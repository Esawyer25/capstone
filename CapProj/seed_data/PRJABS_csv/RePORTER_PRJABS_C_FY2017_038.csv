"9330510","Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource: Project Summary/Abstract The Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource (MPSR) provides investigators with a platform for the design, execution, and interpretation of highly specialized procedures for conducting experiments in vivo. The MPSR facilitates research for investigators in species spanning from mouse to humans. Many of the basic tenets of experimental design are species-independent permitting resources and expertise to be pooled under the common MPSR umbrella. This philosophy alleviates experimental constraints by providing access to a variety of model systems and provides for seamless translation of basic experimental findings to humans. The MPSR uses a defined mechanism for the design and optimization of experimental protocols using an established Studio format. The Studio (i) brings together Vanderbilt scientists with specific expertise to review a proposal; (ii) identifies potential limitations on the front-end; and (iii) leads to the most efficient use of resources including animals and human volunteers. The MPSR makes complex in vivo experiments feasible by providing specialized animal surgical (e.g. catheter placement, bariatric surgery) and experimental (e.g. clamps, energy balance) services. Advancements in the present cycle have led to the development of bariatric surgery procedures and expansion of resources for energy balance measurements in animals that parallel procedures used in human studies conducted by the MPSR. The MPSR has also added a human clamp component. The addition of these vital services fills out the scope of services leading to comprehensive analyses of insulin action and energy balance from rodents to large animals to human subjects. MPSR services will channel into analytical, statistical, and bioinformatics services, thereby enhancing the utility of this resource."
"9301555","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the retinal degenerative diseases that affect 9 million Americans, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most devastating. In RP and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), progressive atrophy of rod photoreceptors leads to secondary death of cone photoreceptors. Gene therapy is a potential means to strengthen or restore rod viability, thereby preventing secondary cone loss. However, the first human gene-therapy trial for RP found improved visual function but did not slow degeneration of photoreceptors. The goal of this gene therapy- oriented proposal is to determine whether therapy is achievable in the context of an already diseased retina. RP resulting from cGMP phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) deficiency is an ideal model for studying progressive cell- autonomous degeneration of rods and subsequent, non-cell-autonomous cone loss. During the previous funding period, we succeeded in restoring PDE6 activity and retinal function for more than 11 months in PDE6- deficient mice by using viral gene transfer methods before the onset of degeneration. We now propose, in Aim 1, to determine whether mouse rods and cones can be rescued within a clinically relevant time window - that is, after the onset of degeneration when patients are usually diagnosed. To do this, we generate a novel inducible genetic rescue system that allows us to conditionally reverse PDE6-deficiency and to control numerical, temporal and spatial aspects of phenotypic reversal. We will use this nonsurgical and robust gene therapy approach to determine if vision restoration/preservation is influenced by the timing of rod rescue (Aim 1a), the number of rods rescued (Aim 1a), and non-autonomous effects of mutant rods (Aim 1b). To complement the study of RP and its rescue in animal models, we have developed a non-invasive autofluorescence imaging technique in mice during the previous funding period. Because FDA is yet to accept imaging biomarkers as a primary outcome measure for treatment efficacy for retinal diseases, we will investigate whether non-invasive imaging can be a surrogate to assess disease progression in both mice and humans (Aim 2). Without novel disease predictors to replace conventional tests that are not deemed not sensitive enough, it is challenging to determine the appropriateness of a therapeutic approach, and/or to establish a baseline from which to assess efficacy (disease progression or stabilization). The novel non-invasive imaging biomarkers will enable us to inform RP patients their disease prognosis and treatment options. Furthermore, they will address the urgency to advise newly expectant parents who already have one child diagnosed with RP. Taken together, this proposal is certain to 1) define the factors limiting interventional therapy; 2) validate a new tool kit for pharmacological control of photoreceptor-specific expression of any gene in the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program cohort; 3) identify novel imaging biomarkers of disease progression essential for assessing efficacy in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and 4) aid current and future basic mechanistic studies of photoreceptor degeneration in humans and animal models."
"9291392","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program in speech perception and auditory psychophysics examines the hypothesis that many of the predominant difficulties in speech understanding of elderly listeners are related to underlying problems in auditory temporal processing. One form of degraded speech that is particularly difficult for elderly listeners to perceive is accented English. Alterations of speech stress and timing with accent may be viewed as a form of degradation in temporal aspects of speech prosody, and this type of temporal distortion is the focus of investigation in the next project period. Moreover, psychoacoustic results demonstrate that large age-related difficulties in temporal processing exist for the perception of auditory tempo and rhythmic characteristics of sequential stimulus patterns featuring a stressed tone. Listener processing difficulty could be attributed to periphera and/or central processing mechanisms, as well as various cognitive factors, including the degree of familiarity with prosodic features of different native languages. The project examines the relative contribution of peripheral hearing impairment, type of stimulus temporal complexity and cognitive demand, and the linguistic background experience of listeners on the processing of temporal prosody cues in speech and non-speech stimulus patterns. The project comprises four aims of investigation, each consisting of a series of speech and non-speech discrimination and recognition tasks. Aim 1 investigates the sources of age-related differences in temporal sensitivity for discrimination and identification of accented speech and correlated non-speech segments that vary in stress patterns. Aim 2 measures the influences of listener age and linguistic background on discrimination of temporal cues within speech and non-speech sequences that vary in prosodic temporal structure and presentation rate. Aim 3 examines the efficacy of auditory training paradigms with stimuli that feature temporal contrasts for improving perception of accented English and non-speech sequences by older people. Aim 4 will examine the effects of age on the ability to integrate temporal information across auditory and visual modalities in processing unaccented and accented speech and non-speech stimulus sequences. Participants in the project will include groups of subjects that differ by age, hearing sensitivity, and for some experiments, native language background. The research described in this application seeks to address one goal outlined by the National Institute on Aging: to develop effective interventions to maintain health and function and prevent or reduce the burden of age-related diseases, disorders, and disabilities. The approach in this research program involves (a) an assessment of the problems encountered in daily activities by the elderly population, (b) an analysis of specific task demands in relation to individual capabilities, and (c) basic research on sensory and perceptual changes with age and on the ameliorating effects of emerging technologies (including rehabilitation). This three-dimensional approach is expected to further progress toward improving communication and health-related quality of life for senior citizens."
"9274979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Near-sightedness (Myopia) is an increasingly serious public health problem. Latest estimates place the prevalence of myopia in the United States at approximately 40%. Several studies have established that longer the eye, greater the magnitude of myopia. With an increase in eye length, the retinal tissues undergo stretching and thinning, in extreme cases leading to retinal detachment. However in even non-pathological myopes, the photoreceptor layer of the retina stretches, causing cones to be placed further apart in comparison to the cones in the eye of an emmetrope (Normal-sighted) of hyperope (Far-sighted). Interestingly this stretching does not happen uniformly across the retina. There is evidence that the foveal center is actually more densely packed with cones compared to the para-foveal region indicating that the formation of the fovea could be different from the rest of the retina. However it is not clear whether this increased sampling rate reflects as an increase in visual resolution as would be expected. In addition to the photoreceptor layer, the underlying neural structures could also be affected, thereby affecting the myope's ability to resolve fine objects such as dots and lines. By measuring visual performance on such tasks it would be possible to identify whether the maximum achievable visual performance of the myope is lower compared to an emmetrope. To summarize, this research project proposes to image and measure the photoreceptor layer of the eye, evaluate the visual consequences of myopia, both due to sampling by the photoreceptor layer and by the neural retina. Understanding the effect on eye growth on the visually important photoreceptor layer is important in devising effective treatment and control strategies for myopia."
"9278228","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC?TTC, where the trinucleotide TCC has experienced a mutation from C to T at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC?TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC?TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC?TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations."
"9259545","Project Summary/Abstract  Myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be one of the leading causes of death in the world due to the negative tissue remodeling that takes place post-MI and leads to heart failure (HF). Methods to treat the heart immediately after MI and prevent negative remodeling are needed to improve patient outcomes and increase long-term survival. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel therapeutic delivery system to non-invasively and safely target treatment to the infarct immediately after MI. Such a system is needed to avoid the off-target side effects that occur when therapeutics are delivered systemically and to allow for intravenous administration rather than direct injection into the damaged heart tissue as is necessary for many other delivery systems being developed. Enzyme-responsive nanoparticles are a promising approach. These nanoparticles respond to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that are up regulated in the infarct post-MI and help drive negative remodeling and subsequent HF. Previous work showed that they can be injected intravenously and will accumulate in the infarct. This proposal seeks to build on previous work and develop these nanoparticles for non- invasive and safe drug delivery to the infarct. The first aim of this proposal is to redesign the nanoparticles to provide for elimination from the tissue after accumulation and to assess their safety. A cleavable core will be incorporated into the nanoparticles to facilitate elimination. Core cleavage will be assessed in vitro prior to testing in a rat model of MI. Toxicity studies will be done in vitro with heart muscle cells and in the animals by checking for an inflammatory response, evaluating liver and kidney function, and analyzing blood cell counts. Accumulation followed by elimination and the potential to cause arrhythmia will also be assessed in the rat model. The second aim of the proposal is to study the MMP-responsive nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle for MMP inhibitors. Studies show that MMP inhibitors limit the negative remodeling in animals but they have not been amenable to systemic use in humans because of off-target side effects. Thus, MMP inhibitors will be conjugated to the nanoparticle core by a labile chemical bond so that after accumulation in the infarct the inhibitor is released. Functional MMP inhibitor release will be assessed in vitro. Then the ability to use the nanoparticle to deliver the MMP inhibitor to the infarct and improve tissue recovery will be studied in the rat model of MI. This proposal aims to develop a novel, non-invasive, and safe strategy to target delivery of a therapeutic to the infarct to support tissue repair. If successful, this work has the potential to revolutionize MI treatment and significantly improve the lives of MI patients."
"9398435","SUMMARY The Ikaros (IKZF1) gene encodes a DNA-binding protein that functions as a tumor suppressor and a transcriptional regulator in leukemia. Deletion of one Ikaros allele results in the development of high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that is resistant to chemotherapy and has a poor prognosis. Our recently published data show that CK2 (Casein Kinase II), an oncogenic kinase that is overexpressed in B-ALL, phosphorylates Ikaros, which reduces Ikaros DNA-binding affinity and abolishes its activity as a transcriptional regulator. Based on these findings we designed a novel B-ALL treatment strategy to restore Ikaros function by targeting CK2. The inhibition of CK2 with a specific inhibitor, CX-4945, as a single drug, restored Ikaros ability to regulate transcription in high-risk B-ALL with deletion of one Ikaros allele and showed therapeutic efficacy in a preclinical model of this disease. Our new preliminary data suggest that CK2 impairs the ability of Ikaros to repress transcription of genes essential to the folic acid metabolism pathway: MTHFD1 (methylene- tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase NADP+ dependent 1), MTR (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyl- transferase) and TYMS (Thymidylate Synthase), as well as the anti-apoptotic gene, BCL-XL. In leukemia, high expression of the folic acid pathway genes and BCL-XL are associated with increased resistance to methotrexate and doxorubicin treatment, respectively. Treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restored Ikaros-mediated repression of the MTHFD1, MTR, TYMS and BCL-XL genes in primary high-risk B- ALL cells. In vitro treatment of high-risk B-ALL with CX-4945 in combination with methotrexate, or doxorubicin exhibits a strong synergistic cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that overexpression of CK2 in high-risk B-ALL impairs Ikaros ability to transcriptionally repress the folic acid pathway and Bcl-XL genes and that CK2 inhibition will restore Ikaros tumor suppressor activity as a transcriptional repressor of these genes in high-risk B-ALL cells resulting in increased sensitivity to methotrexate and doxorubicin treatment. We will test this hypothesis in vivo, using patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from pediatric patients with high-risk B- ALL in the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will establish the therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment with the CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) and the folic acid pathway inhibitor (methotrexate) in a preclinical model of high-risk B-ALL and determine the molecular mechanisms that restore Ikaros ability to repress folic acid pathway genes. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of combination therapy with CX-4945 and doxorubicin and analyze the mechanism that restores Ikaros?mediated repression of BCL-XL in high-risk B-ALL. In Aim 3, we will identify the mechanisms through which high expression of CK2 regulates drug resistance and Ikaros tumor suppressor function in B-ALL. Results of the proposed project would establish the therapeutic efficacy of two novel combination treatments for high-risk B-ALL and provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of tumor suppression in pediatric high-risk B-ALL."
"9353195","Project Summary/Abstract  America's increasing HIV epidemic among youth aged 12-24 and our concurrent failure to identify, link to care, and achieve viral suppression among youth living with HIV (YLH) suggests the need to identify novel community-based strategies to leverage gateways and settings where high risk and infected youth can be engaged in HIV prevention and treatment. Scientific successes reducing HIV viral reservoirs among acutely infected infants, stopping HIV transmission from HIV-infected adults with undetectable viral loads, and documenting the efficacy of Treatment as Prevention (TASP) suggest strategies to reduce the trend of increasing adolescent HIV infections. This U19 will evaluate the usefulness of these advances for youth aged 12-24 at the highest risk of acquiring HIV- gay, bisexual, transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) ? as well as youth living with HIV (YLH) in two HIV epicenters (Los Angeles and New Orleans).  All GBTY and HY at five gay-identified community-based organizations (CBO) and homeless shelters will be screened over 18 months. From these screenings, a cohort of 220 YLH and 1,500 highest risk seronegative GBTY and HY will be formed. Over 24 months, this cohort will be repeatedly tested at four month intervals for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and serious drug use, and with 4th Gen HIV tests if seronegative, in order to identify acutely infected youth, engage youth in medical care, and monitor outcomes. Youth are triaged to:  Study 1: Acute infection. Using 60 ARV-naive YLH with established infection as controls, we expect to identify 36 YLH with acute infection. All youth with acute infections will be aggressively treated with at least four highly potent antiretroviral therapies (ARV) and repeatedly assessed to examine if prolonged viral suppression is achieved, with reduced viral reservoirs to potentially allow ARV- free HIV remission.  Study 2: Stepped care for YLH. Adapting strategies to manage chronic illnesses, we will conduct a RCT comparing a Standard Care Arm (repeated assessments every four month and an Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention [AMMI]) to Stepped Care. In the Stepped Care Arm, increasingly more intense interventions are delivered if viral load is detectable: a) the Standard Care Arm; b) an AMMI that is tailored to comorbidities of the specific YLH; or c) a Coach to support during crises, make treatment referrals, and brief interventions. Dried blood spots will monitor viral load and, on a small sample, ARV adherence over time.  Study 3: Engaging seronegative youth in the HIV Prevention Continuum. Youth will be randomized to either: a) an AMMI Arm; b) Peer-Support plus AMMI Arm; c) eNavigator and an AMMI arm; or d) Peer-Support plus eNavigator plus AMMI Arm. Each condition aims to optimize the HIV Prevention Continuum.  An interdisciplinary team of basic, clinical, and applied researchers with expertise in HIV, STI, behavioral interventions, biomedical interventions, CURE research, perinatal HIV, and a history of participating and coordinating multi-site RCT is participating on this U19 from six universities."
"9283240","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall fitness of complex multicellular organisms depends on the successful coordination of multiple tissues. In the course of an organism's life, mitotic events and environmental insults lead to somatic mutations that can produce pools of suboptimal cells that can compromise tissue integrity. In humans, the presence of genetically distinct populations of somatic cells occurs in a number of Mendelian disorders, disorders of chromosomal anomalies like trisomy 21, and cancer. Quality control mechanisms must exist to ensure proper tissue growth and maintenance. Declining efficiency of these mechanisms may explain the increased frequency of tissue mosaicism with age in the human population and the associated disease burden. In flies, a process known as cell competition optimizes tissue health by actively eliminating suboptimal cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that the phenomenon occurs between mouse embryonic stem cells and in the developing mouse embryo, yet the molecular mediators of mammalian cell competition remain unknown. Clarifying the molecular components of this process in mammals would begin to help us grasp its relevance to human health and disease. To that end, this project sets out to characterize a form of postnatal cell competition in the developing mouse retinal and brain vasculature with the hope of developing a basic understanding of the rules governing tissue growth and maintenance. Preliminary data suggests that central nervous system (CNS) endothelial cells (ECs) lacking the transcription factor Zic3 are less fit than ECs that retain a functional copy. Developing CNS vasculature composed of suboptimal Zic3 null ECs and wild-type (WT) ECs might actively detect and eliminate the mutant population. This mechanism may depend on the cells sensing, reporting on, and comparing some intrinsic fitness parameter like proliferative capacity. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify the genes that enable this process in mammalian cells. The proposed research strategy will accomplish this through three specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that in developing mosaic CNS vasculature, ECs lacking Zic3 are eliminated in a fashion consistent with cell competition, 2) Establish an in vitro EC competition model and test the hypothesis that ECs interact through secreted signals or direct cell contact in order to establish loser and winner populations, and 3) Determine molecular components of the mammalian cell competition machinery through transcription profiling of loser and winner cells. A combination of histological analysis, cell culture, and next-generation RNA sequencing will be used to address these aims. Understanding how tissue robustness is achieved is paramount to human health as the knowledge could bring us closer to clinical applications of tissue regeneration, help mitigate developmental errors, curtail the impending rise in age-related disease, and extend lifespan."
"9241993","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Core B - The developmental component of the UCSD CFAR is designed to facilitate and encourage new investigators and new ideas in HIV/AIDS research. The intent is to optimize opportunities for productive research by providing immediate financial support in association with resource support provided by the Core facilities. Three categories of developmental grants will be supported, although the number and type of these categories are flexible: (1) foster junior investigators; (2) support newly-recruited faculty involved with HIV-related research; and (3) respond rapidly to evolving research opportunities.   Requests for submission of developmental grants are advertised through the Administrative Core twice a year for funding in January and July. Faculty at all four CFAR member institutions are eligible to apply. The submissions are evaluated by an expert review committee and additional ad hoc reviewers who are experts in the pertinent fields as needed. Scientific merit is the primary criterion for making the awards; however, fostering the development of junior investigators is an important programmatic goal that is also considered in prioritization of awards. The maximum amount for the awards currently given is $50,000 for unfunded junior investigators and $30,000 for others. Grants to senior investigators must receive prior approval from the NIAID CFAR Program Office. As part of their award, investigators are required to provide documentation of publications and peer-reviewed funding that result from the developmental awards. They are also required to cite CFAR developmental funds in publications resulting from work supported by developmental grants.  The Developmental Core also coordinates the NCI-funded pilot grants in HIV malignancies, in partnership with the UCSD Moores Cancer Center. The CFAR and Cancer Center issue joint requests for applications and conduct joint reviews. The Developmental Core coordinates the CFAR portion of this collaboration.    The Developmental Core has an active and effective mentorship program. With the growth of the CFAR, anticipate a greater number of innovative and timely projects will be funded, attracting new members and affiliates who can advance HIV and AIDS research."
"9293380","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hereditary peripheral neuropathies (also known as hereditary motor sensory neuropathies, HMSN) are among the most common genetic diseases affecting the nervous system. The mildest form of human peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, causes progressive deterioration of both motor and sensory nerves, muscular atrophy, and chronic pain/fatigue in affected individuals. A majority of inherited peripheral myelinopathies are caused by duplication of a critical myelin gene, Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22), which is classified as CMT1A. Since this disorder results from gene dosage effects, achieving a slight (<2-fold) reduction in PMP22 expression would effectively treat this inherited myelinopathy. Recent proof-of-principle studies using candidate compounds to reduce PMP22 expression levels have shown beneficial effects in rodent models of CMT1A. Before such candidate compounds enter clinical trials, it will be critical to achieve a comprehensive understanding of their molecular targets and how they impact PMP22 regulation.  Our recent studies of PMP22 regulation have elucidated novel regulatory elements controlled by two major regulators of Schwann cell development-Egr2/Krox20 and Sox10-and the goal of this proposal is to test the function of these elements by using genome editing to delete them in the endogenous PMP22 locus. In addition, we will use zebrafish analysis to elucidate the developmental control of these enhancers. This proposal will also explore the function of cooperating transcription factors that amplify PMP22 expression to the high levels found in myelinating Schwann cells. Finally, using the mechanistic analysis that we have developed, we propose to identify the molecular targets of proteasome inhibitors, which are a candidate treatment for CMT1A as they have been recently identified in a drug screen to lower the expression level of PMP22."
"9332844","Studies indicate that a satisfactory content of some micronutrients within the cells maintains several immune functions, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, which together may play a pivotal role in reducing the effects of aging. In contrast, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, studies have linked some heavy metal exposure to cognitive decline, which is clearly associated with aging. Despite this, there remains a critical gap in the literature on how trace minerals, both nutritious elements and heavy metals, affect cognitive health. In particular, data directly relating trace mineral levels to cognitive decline are lacking. In addition, leukocyte telomere length (TL) has been consistently shown to have a direct relation with mortality and aging- related diseases in epidemiological studies, and is thus considered to be a biomarker of aging. TL has also been linked to cognitive function in different populations. Although TL is heritable, it can be modified by a host of environmental variables. Thus, identifying modifiable factors that may slow or prevent TL attrition would certainly have a major public health impact, as possible interventions are likely to be most effective during the early stages of preclinical disease. The overall objective of this project is to examine the longitudinal associations between trace mineral levels and cognitive decline and TL. Specifically, we will examine the trace mineral concentrations measured in urine or serum in relation to the trajectory of cognitive decline, as well as TL, and telomere attrition in a sub-cohort (n=2,391) of participants randomly selected from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, an ongoing US national population-based, general population cohort of 30,239 African American and Caucasian adults, aged 45 and older at baseline (2003-2007). The proposed study will help to identify at-risk Americans for cognitive decline and/or the consequences of aging. For nutritious minerals, information generated from this study will be useful for future interventions to maintain a homeostasis of micronutrients in relation to healthy aging; and for the toxic ones at low-to-moderate exposure level, knowledge gained will serve as a scientific foundation for remediation and prevention strategies to improve cognitive health or slow down the consequences of aging."
"9281715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use."
"9330513","Islet Procurement and Analysis Core (IPA): Project Summary/Abstract The Islet Procurement and Analysis (IPA) Core was established in 2007 as a result of growing demand for murine islets from multiple members within the Vanderbilt DRTC. Over the last funding cycle, the IPA Core provided services to 56 different investigators (49 Vanderbilt and 7 External Non-Profit) by assisting with 2981 procedures. Islet biology, development, and function in normal homeostasis and disease including a broad spectrum of islet-related processes raging from intracellular signaling, physiological response and adaptation, the immunology of type 1 diabetes, the function of islet-enriched transcription factors in development and maintenance of normal hormone-secreting status and cell fate, all the way to islet transplantation, are major research areas of the Vanderbilt DRTC. An essential component supporting the experimental pipeline of the majority of studies falling under this paradigm is our ability to isolate high quality, well-characterized rodent pancreatic islets, and then to perform complex assays of islet function. In addition, the core provides VDRTC investigators with high-resolution imaging solutions that allow bulk-tissue-imaging and fine-detail quantitative assessment of pancreatic islet morphology. Utilizing whole-slide imaging technology, the IPA Core recently developed and published standards for automated measurement of beta cell mass, and this technique is now broadly used by VDRTC members. In this cycle of competitive renewal, the throughput of procedures and number of services under the IPA Core are expected to more than double as part of the newly established Quality Control Core Facility (QCCF) for the NIDDK-supported Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP), which distributes human islets nationwide and internationally from six US-based islet isolation centers. This novel and essential QCCF program centered within the IPA Core will utilize the robust infrastructure, services, and expertise of the IPA Core and directly benefit eleven VDRTC members who already use human islets from IIDP in their research. Through its standardized assessment of human islet function, cell composition, and islet health, the QCCF and IPA Core will build, together with the IIDP, a database of well-characterized human islet preparations from normal pancreas donors that will be an exceptionally valuable resource for the field. By having a centralized facility, the IPA Core provides VDRTC investigators with high-quality data of standardized islet assessment by procedures using established SOPs, optimized over the last decade for reproducibility and time effectiveness, balanced against maximal data output and at a lower price than would otherwise be possible."
"9291485","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The techniques of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing and the ability to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a sample of a patient's blood have placed medicine on the brink of a revolution in our ability to treat, and perhaps even cure, a broad range of genome-based diseases. The goal of the UT Southwestern MDCRC is to improve treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by developing a new therapeutic strategy called myoediting based on these technologies. The Center will be built around five integral components. These include: two inter-related research projects (1) one that will work to optimize the tools for application of CRISPR/Cas9- mediated DMD exon skipping to permanently restore dystrophin function, and the other (2) that will identify genetic and biomarker associations with cardiac phenotypes in adult DMD patients and serve as a primary source for a Duchenne Skipper Database. These projects will be complemented and supported by three Cores (A) an Administrative Core, that will also direct patient outreach and education, (B) a Myoediting Core, which will develop DMD-in-a-dish cardiac and skeletal muscle disease models and house the Duchenne Skipper Database for designing guide RNAs, and (C) a Training Core, which will enhance the educational environment in order to recruit, train, and maintain the next generation of transformative investigators focused on addressing the challenges of muscular dystrophy. We firmly believe myoediting to be a unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to discover a functional cure for many thousands of patients and their families devastated by DMD."
"9249284","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a large number of hospital- and community-acquired infections worldwide. The rise in incidence of S. aureus infections is primarily due to a combination of increased antibiotic resistance and increased virulence of strains associated with community infections. In the absence of a protective vaccine, studies aimed at dissecting virulence strategies of S. aureus are desperately needed with the hope of identifying novel targets for the generation of new treatments to combat this pathogen. An important pathogenic strategy of S. aureus is the production of exotoxins that target and kill host cells. Among these toxins, S. aureus strains associated with human infections can produce up to four different pore-forming bi-component leukotoxins. The long-term objective of our laboratory is to understand the molecular details by which bi-component leukotoxins influence the pathophysiology of S. aureus infection through targeting cells of the immune system. The present application focuses on one of these toxins, leukocidin ED (LukED). The importance of the proposed research originates from our recent discoveries that LukED: (i) is a critical virulence factor involved in the lethality of mice during S. aureus bloodstream infection, (ii) is required for promoting bacterial replication in vivo, (iii) contribues to S. aureus pathogenesis by targeting and killing immune cells in vivo, and (iv) targets a wide variety of leukocytes in a receptor specific manner. The goals of this research program are to understand the mechanism by which LukED targets different leukocytes, to elucidate the consequences of LukED-mediated cell injury to S. aureus pathogenesis, and to explore the therapeutic benefits of targeting LukED as a new modality to dampen S. aureus virulence. To this end, we propose to employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines biochemistry, cell biology, and immunology techniques with ex vivo tissue culture infection models and in vivo animal models of infection. Results obtained from these studies will provide insight into the molecular details of how S. aureus bi-component pore-forming toxins selectively target and kill host cells and the importance of these toxins to S. aureus pathogenesis."
"9392755","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A majority of B-cell lymphomas arise from germinal center (GC) B-cells including diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and follicular lymphomas (FL). GCs are transient structures that form in response to T- cell dependent antigen exposure within which B-cells undergo proliferation and somatic hypermutation. We find that the H3K27 histone methyltransferase EZH2 is required for normal B-cells to form GCs. EZH2 plays a dual role in GC B-cells by suppressing proliferation checkpoint genes and genes required for B-cells to exit the GC reaction. EZH2 is widely expressed in DLBCL and FL, but a subset of these tumors acquire EZH2 point mutations which enable this enzyme to more efficiently trimethylate H3K27. Mutant EZH2 induces greater promoter H3K27me3 and more profound silencing of EZH2 targets, resulting in sustained proliferation and differentiation blockade. Therapeutic targeting of EZH2 is now possible thanks to the development of specific small molecule inhibitors. These drugs suppress DLBCL and FL cell lines with both mutant and WT EZH2, suggesting that EZH2 dependence may reflect a GC lineage role of EZH2. However, response to EZH2 inhibitors occurs slowly, likely reflecting the kinetics of reversal of epigenetic silencin. We hypothesize that EZH2 targeted therapy will be effective against DLBCL and FL with specific genetic and epigenetic features. We predict that resistance to these agents may occur due to their slow response kinetics. We hypothesize that EZH2 inhibitors will synergize with standard and experimental anti-lymphoma agents targeting complementary genetically and epigenetically defined pathways, but require rationale studies to achieve optimal combinatorial potency. Hence our proposal will explore the genetic and epigenetic determinants linked to EZH2 dependency in DLBCL and FL patients, will identify mechanisms through which acquired resistance might develop to EZH2 inhibitors, and the optimal manner in which these drugs could be combined with other anti-lymphoma drugs. Finally we will perform state of the art correlative studies in the context of the first in man clinical trial of a potent EZH2 inhibitor for DLBCL patients to validate the pharmacodynamics and tumor background of lymphomas susceptible of EZH2 inhibitors in humans."
"9321445","Project Summary/Abstract Transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling is one of the most powerful synthetic methods and is used extensively in the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients. The goal of this work is to use fundamental mechanistic studies to develop improved Ni and Pd catalysts for new and existing cross-coupling reactions. Recently, our group developed the commercially available precatalyst scaffold (?3-1-tBu-indenyl)Pd(L)(Cl) (IndPdL, L = N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or PR3), which generates highly active catalysts for a range of important cross-coupling reactions. To design even better catalysts, which can facilitate new reactions and operate at milder conditions, we will perform detailed mechanistic studies using IndPdL derived systems, involving both experiment and theory. Our studies will encompass all aspects of the catalytic process including elucidating the pathway for precatalyst activation, understanding the elementary steps in catalytic cycles and determining the catalyst decomposition pathway. Initially, we will study the mechanism of activation of IndPdL to the monoligated Pd0 active species under a variety of conditions used for cross-coupling. This will be the first comprehensive study of the activation of any cross-coupling precatalyst under a range of commonly used reaction conditions. This information will be used in combination with knowledge of the fundamental steps in catalysis, which will be gained through stoichiometric studies and kinetics experiments, to rationally develop systems for fluoride free Hiyama reactions with aryl chlorides, carbamates and sulfamates and Suzuki-Miyaura couplings with 2-aryl and 2-alkylaziridines. The discovery of Ni catalysts with comparable activity to Pd systems is preferred because Ni is cheaper, more abundant and has lower levels of toxicity. Accordingly, we will also use an approach based on rational design to develop Ni based catalysts for cross-coupling. In preliminary results we showed that several highly active Ni precatalysts for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction rapidly form a NiI complex under catalytic conditions. Here, we will establish the role of NiI species in catalysis with systems supported by monodentate and bidentate phosphine ligands, as well as NHC ligands. This information will be used to develop improved systems for the Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig reactions with aryl carbamates and sulfamates. A major additional benefit of our mechanistic approach is that the general trends we elucidate in regard to catalyst design and reaction conditions for Ni and Pd catalyzed cross-coupling will be generalizable to a plethora of other reactions, which are relevant to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, but will not specifically be studied in this proposal."
"9316419","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive function in humans declines in essentially all domains starting around age 50-60, and neurodegeneration and dementia seem to be inevitable in all but a few who survive to very old age. Mice with a fraction of the human lifespan show similar cognitive deterioration indicating that specific biological processes rather than time alone are responsible for brain aging. While age-related cognitive dysfunction and dementia in humans are clearly distinct entities and affect different brain regions, the aging brain shows the telltale molecular and cellular changes that characterize most neurodegenerative diseases including synaptic loss, dysfunctional autophagy, increased inflammation, and protein aggregation. Remarkably, the aging brain remains plastic and exercise or dietary changes can increase cognitive function in humans and animals, with animal brains showing a reversal of some of the aforementioned biological changes associated with aging. Using heterochronic parabiosis we showed recently that blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice. Accordingly, exposing an old mouse to a young systemic environment or to plasma from young mice increased neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and improved contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. Preliminary proteomic studies show several proteins with stem cell activity increase in old rejuvenated mice supporting the notion that young blood may contain increased levels of beneficial factors with regenerative capacity. In this application we intend to test the hypothesis that blood-borne protein factors in young mice are sufficient to increase adult neurogenesis and regenerate the old brain, and that a focused proteomic screen will allow us to identify the most potent such factors. Our studies pursue the innovative concept that brain aging and cognitive dysfunction is at least in part under control of factors from the circulatory environment and that such factors are sufficient to rejuvenate the aging brain."
"9277556","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 180,000 Americans are living with solid organ transplants. Each year over 2000 heart transplants, including over 300 pediatric heart transplants are performed resulting in over 20,000 living heart transplant recipients in the U.S. alone. One year survival following heart transplantation has improved to over 90%; however, 10 year survival remains less than 60%. With improvement in operative and postoperative management, rejection has become the major determinant of outcome. Earlier detection of rejection facilitates earlier treatment, which improves both early and late function and survival.  The gold standard in surveillance of cardiac allograft rejection remains catheter based endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). To detect rejection early, surveillance biopsies must be performed at regular intervals; however, EMB is both expensive (over $4000) and invasive (major complications 1.9%). It is estimated that over 30,000 surveillance biopsies are performed each year identifying 3,000 rejections with over 300 major complications. There is a tremendous need for a highly sensitive, non-invasive method that reliably detects patients with rejection. This proposal will have high impact on the problem of rejection surveillance in cardiac transplantation promoting earlier detection, earlier treatment, and improved long term outcomes.  Donor specific cf-DNA increases in patients with solid organ rejection. We have completed a blinded pilot study in 38 pediatric and adult heart transplant patients utilizing a novel, highly accurate, targeted sequencing approach which precisely quantifies the amount of donor specific cell free DNA (cf-DNA) and total cf-DNA in recipient plasma. This data established a threshold below which no sample had rejection (0/51), and above which all patients with ISHLT grade e2 rejection (6/6) were detected (100% sensitivity). We have assembled a consortium of 6 major pediatric and adult transplant centers for a blinded multi-center study with independent pathology and echo core labs to test this extremely promising, cost effective, and innovative approach. We will first determine a threshold and develop a predictive model and then validate both on a prospective and blinded sample set of 240 new pediatric and adult transplant recipients followed longitudinally for at least one full year. Finally we will explore the relationships between major pathologic and clinical observations and levels of donor specific and total cf-DNA. This method holds promise to enable the accurate and cost effective non- invasive determination of rejection in all solid organ transplantation."
"9298375","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder affecting more than 20 million people in the United States and is defined by compulsion to seek and take drug. Our ability to successfully treat addiction is hindered by our limited knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms. A long-term goal of work in our lab is to better understand the mechanisms and relevance underlying drug-induced adaptations in key neuron populations implicated in addiction. Toward this end, we recently described a transient cocaine-induced suppression of G protein-dependent inhibitory signaling in dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key element in the mesocorticolimbic system. This novel cocaine-induced adaptation required activation of D2/3 DA receptors (D2/3R) and involved the internalization of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K (GIRK/Kir3) + channels, a key contributor to inhibitory feedback pathways that normally temper DA neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic system. The key goals of my project are to better understand the mechanisms and neurophysiological impact underlying the cocaine-induced suppression of GIRK-dependent signaling in VTA DA neurons (AIM 1), and to determine the impact of GIRK channel manipulation in DA neurons to cocaine- induced reward-related behavior (AIM 2). My working hypothesis is that the cocaine-induced increase in extracellular DA levels in the VTA leads to the acute D2R- and GIRK-dependent inhibition of VTA DA neurons, and subsequent internalization of the unique GIRK channel (GIRK2/GIRK3 heteromer) found in this cell type. The cocaine-induced suppression of GIRK-dependent signaling in VTA DA neurons then facilitates enhanced DA transmission with subsequent drug exposure, and the development of long-term adaptations that promote and support addiction-related behaviors. I propose to test key elements of this working hypothesis using an interdisciplinary approach including brain slice electrophysiology, in vitro fast scan cyclic voltammetry, and behavioral analysis, in tandem with pharmacologic and neuron-specific genetic manipulations of GIRK- dependent signaling in mice. Successful completion of this project will expand our understanding of inhibitory cell signaling mechanisms that underlie drug addiction and will provide an initial assessment of the potential utility of GIRK channel manipulation for the treatment or prevention of addiction."
"9269149","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrin signaling is critical for chondrogenesis, and its alteration is a causal factor in the development of skeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. This project takes advantage of exciting new findings on Kindlin-2, a key regulator of integrin signaling, and seeks to define its role in control of chondrogenic cell behavior. Studies by the applicants have shown that ablation of Kindlin-2 in chondrogenic cells results in severe defects in chondrogenesis in mice. Furthermore, loss of Kindlin-2 impairs TGF-?1 signaling and the expression of Sox9, a master regulator of chondrogenesis. Additionally, there is evidence that Kindlin-2 localizes not only to focal adhesions (FAs) but also to the nuclei of chondrocytes. Based on these and other studies, the applicants hypothesize that Kindlin-2 works in concert with its cytoplasmic and nuclear binding partners to regulate TGF-?1 signaling and Sox9 expression and thereby control chondrocyte functions and chondrogenesis. To test this, the applicants propose the following three aims. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanisms by which Kindlin-2 regulates Sox9 expression in chondrocytes. The applicants will employ a combination of molecular, cellular and genetic strategies to test the hypothesis that Kindlin-2 regulates Sox9 expression through not only its interactions at FAs but also its interactions in the nuclei. Aim 2 s to determine the roles and mechanisms of Kindlin-2 in TGF-?1 activation and signaling. The applicants will test the hypothesis that Kindlin-2 regulates TGF-?1 activation and downstream signaling by interacting with key components of the TGF-?1 signaling pathway. Aim 3 is to determine the functions of the Kindlin-2-Sox9 signaling axis in chondrogenesis in vivo. The applicants will employ conditional knockout and transgenic mouse models to define the functional contribution of the Kindlin-2-Sox9 signaling axis to chondrogenesis in vivo. These studies will shed light on the interplay between three key control elements in chondrogenesis (integrin signaling, TGF-?1 signaling and Sox9 expression) and the underlying mechanisms, which will significantly improve our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing chondrocyte behavior and may lead to development of novel strategies for alleviating common skeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis."
"9271937","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cutaneous malignancy with a median overall survival of 6-9 months (9). Immunotherapies have shown dramatic benefits for a subset of melanoma patients. While this is encouraging, the severe toxicity associated with the use of these therapies and the fact that 60% of patients display resistance to them underscores the need for strategies to improve outcomes in resistant patients. One mechanism by which tumors evade the immune response is by up regulating surface expression of CD47. Upon binding signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa) on the cell surface of macrophages, CD47 inhibits tumor cell phagocytosis (1). Reagents that block the interaction between CD47 and SIRPa increase clearance of human blood-derived tumors and improve survival in preclinical models (2, 3). Although highly effective in blood-derived tumors, our preliminary studies show that malignant melanoma displays resistance to this therapy through unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that increasing the display of eat me signals in combination with CD47 blockade will enhance phagocytosis, increase tumor antigen presentation to tumor- specific cytotoxic T cells, and overcome resistance, leading to significant improvements in anti-tumor immune responses. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will determine if increasing the level of eat me signals expressed by melanoma tumor cells increases tumor cell phagocytosis in vitro, in the presence or absence of CD47 blockade. In specific aim 2, we will determine the effects of CD47 blockade on T cell migration in vitro. We will also examine if the up regulation of eat me signals is able to promote anti-tumor T cell activation in vivo in the presence or absence of CD47 blockade. In specific aim 3, we will confirm that T cells which undergo activation in vivo in response to CD47 blockade and chemotherapy are capable of rejecting tumors in adoptive recipients. Completion of these specific aims will enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms by which melanoma cells resist CD47 blockade and will identify mechanisms to mitigate this resistance. The training plan outlined in this grant is designed to help the applicant develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator including knowledge of cancer biology and immunology, laboratory management, budgeting, teaching, and grant writing. The technical skills to be learned include transfection of mammalian cells, flow cytometry, transmigration assays, live animal imaging, and intravascular staining. In addition to technical skills, the applicant will learn critical thinking design of hypothesis-driven experiments with clear positive and negative results, and managing negative data."
"9272276","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian female reproductive tract, including the oviducts, uterus, and vagina, is essential for the generation of progeny and a frequent site of human disease, including infertility and cancer. The female reproductive tract is derived from the M?llerian ducts of the fetus, a pair of epithelial tubes with a surrounding mesenchyme. In mammals, two pairs of genital ducts form within the mesonephroi associated with the fetal gonads regardless of sex genotype. Initially, the Wolffian ducts form that subsequently give rise to the vas deferentia, epididymides, and seminal vesicles in males. The Wolffian ducts then guide the formation of the M?llerian ducts. The cell behaviors that regulate the elongation of the M?llerian duct are poorly understood. We will use fluorescent, time-lapse imaging of the mesonephros to determine the cell behaviors and mechanisms that lead to M?llerian duct elongation. We have shown that deletion of Lhx1, that encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, in the M?llerian duct leads to ductal loss and subsequently uterine aplasia. In the absence of the M?llerian duct the epithelial compartment, the stroma and inner myometrial layer of the uterus does not differentiate. However, the outer myometrium does form. These results highlight the intrinsic and extrinsic roles of the M?llerian duct for female reproductive tract differentiation. Emx2 and Pax2, encode transcription factors that are also expressed in the M?llerian duct and may participate in a genetic pathway of uterine development. We will test their roles in uterine development by performing M?llerian duct-specific knockouts. In males, the fetal testes produce the TGF-beta family member anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) that binds receptors expressed in the M?llerian duct mesenchyme, causing the elimination of the M?llerian ducts. The fetal ovaries do not produce AMH, permitting M?llerian duct differentiation. Thus, mammalian fetuses are initially ambi-sexual with the potential to develop both male and female reproductive tract organs. Defects in the formation of the genital ducts and resolution of the ambi-sexual state to a male or female phenotype lead to disorders of sexual development (DSD). We have preliminary RNA-seq data that has identified candidate genes expressed in male M?llerian duct mesenchyme but not in females that may mediate AMH-induced M?llerian duct regression. The in vivo role of a subset of these candidate genes (Msx-Dlx-Osterix) will be tested by M?llerian duct mesenchyme-specific knockout. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular, cellular, and developmental mechanisms that regulate female reproductive tract organogenesis and M?llerian duct regression during male differentiation."

OVERALL In 2007 the Penn State Clinical and Translational Science Institute was formed (CTSI, termed the ?Institute? in this application) to advance biomedical research to better predict, prevent and treat human disease. Penn State has over $800 million of research expenditures and its College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is a thriving institution serving over 2 million people. The region is racially and ethnically diverse with a mix of urban, suburban, and rural populations with many being disadvantaged and elderly. As a major land-grant university Penn State has developed a large outreach network affording the opportunity to rapidly identify community needs and deploy new healthcare approaches. This is a new CTSA application that builds upon our efforts since 2007 to reshape clinical and translational science (CTS). We are a learning organization that has developed and implemented methods, metrics and processes to continually assess our performance and progress. Going forward we will continue to seek input from our advisory committees, the CTSA Consortium and NCATS to deliver on the promise of improved health through discovery, development and dissemination of new knowledge. A key underpinning for our vision for CTS is that multidisciplinary teamwork is critical for success. We propose the following aims: Aim 1. Catalyze team science by engaging scientists, professionals and communities across and outside traditional biomedical boundaries from within and beyond Penn State. We will increase the reach of our Institute and will promote health and treat disease across the lifespan through enhanced integration and greater interactions with the diverse communities we serve. Aim 2. Promote the highest quality CTS through the provision of investigator-centered research infrastructure that accelerates protocol development and study completion. We will expand and continually assess our resource support including informatics, research methods, pilot project funding and clinical services within a culture that highlights ethics and concern for the heath care needs of an increasingly diverse population. Aim 3. Effectively and bidirectionally share resources and expertise through collaborations with other CTSA HUBs, the CTSA Consortium and more broadly with providers and the population at large. We will dramatically improve clinical trials and the processes of recruitment and trial innovation. This will accelerate the rate at which discovery is disseminated and translated into clinical care and improved health. Aim 4. Educating a new generation of health professionals and CTS investigators. The Institute will be the focal point for the education of a diverse CTS workforce of scholars and professionals. Our workforce will be not only fluent in cutting edge CTS methods but will also be cognizant of the health concerns of diverse populations and the ethical issues that will arise as CTS is conducted.   Project Summary/Abstract Page 224 Contact PD/PI: Sinoway, Lawrence Isaac"
"9380654","SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury frequently leads to a loss of neurons and the disruption of neural circuitry. A fundamental but unresolved challenge is how to restore lost neurons and repair the damaged neural circuits of the adult brain. Neural stem cells persist and generate new neurons in the adult brain; however, their very restricted localization renders them inadequate for regenerative purposes. The efficacy of transplanted stem cells is limited by the survival and integration of induced neurons, as well as, a potential for tumorigenesis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define a new regenerative strategy for brain injury, which is to use a patient's endogenous glial cells without transplantation. This strategy is based on our recent work showing that resident glial cells can be transcriptionally reprogrammed into new neurons in the adult mouse brain. These reprogrammed neurons can become mature and functionally integrate into the local neuronal network. Our preliminary data further revealed that new neurons can also be induced by a pool of small molecules in the adult brain after traumatic injury, suggesting that chemical biology can be applied to neural reprogramming in vivo. Three aims are proposed in this application to further analyze the chemical reprogramming process: 1) to optimize the chemical composition and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, 2) to examine cell origin, maturation, and connectivity of chemically induced new neurons in the adult mouse brain after injury, and 3) to determine the biological effect of chemical reprogramming on behavioral recovery after brain injury. The results of this proof-of-concept research will lay the ground work for devising a potentially paradigm-shifting therapeutic strategy for brain injury."
"9274985","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project provides the enabling infrastructure for the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) program, dedicated to the objective evaluation of protein structure modeling methods. Knowledge of protein structure significantly aids in the investigation of macromolecular function, interactions, and biochemical pathways. It also has a major impact on the understanding of human disease, and on the development of therapeutics. Experimental determination of structure is inherently time-consuming, costly, and often meets with insurmountable obstacles. Computational modeling offers an alternative approach but modeling methods vary in their effectiveness and typically do not directly provide measures of accuracy. CASP aims at answering these concerns by objective evaluation of methods, so driving progress. CASP is a community-wide program, with over 100 research groups world-wide submitting over 60,000 predictions in the last round (2014). The Center is the primary infrastructure resource for CASP, and handles processing of predictions, develops evaluation software, performs model assessment, develops analysis and display tools, and facilitates access to models and evaluation data. The current proposal includes two major new initiatives, extending the impact of CASP to important new areas of structural biology. First, we will collaborate with appropriate experimental groups to develop modeling methods that maximally leverage sparse and low resolution data. Preliminary results with NMR and crosslinking demonstrate the potential in this area. Second, in partnership with the CAPRI initiative (Critical Assessment of Protein Interactions), we will include modeling of biological assemblies. We will also continue the successful CASP strategy of focusing on overcoming specific bottleneck problems, such as model refinement, estimation of model accuracy, and prediction of three dimensional contacts; adding modeling of non-template regions in homology models. In addition, we will place special emphasis on evaluating the usefulness of models in specific life science applications. Finally, we will interact with teachers and researchers, with te goal of disseminating the insights on modeling and the wealth of data gained through CASP."

"9244015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intestine is a complex organ home to one of our body's largest immune system networks, 100 trillion commensal bacteria, and a variety of specialized eukaryotic cells, such as epithelium, Paneth cells and mucus- producing goblet cells. A high antigenic burden in the intestine exists because it is a common entry site for pathogens, the site for absorption of food proteins and the high number of commensal bacteria. Dysregulation of the immune responses can lead to disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colitis-associated cancers. In order to prevent aberrant immune responses communication and regulation between these compartments is essential. The close proximity of the microbial world to the human cells of our intestine suggest that innate receptors, such as Toll-like Receptors (TLR), which recognize conserved microbial motifs, may play an essential role in regulating homeostasis and inflammation. Our previous work has identified TLR1 as a critical mediator of intestinal immunity during pathogenic infection. Further, we have found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in TLR1, which abrogates surface expression and signaling, is associated with pediatric IBD. Further this mutation impacts disease severity and response to immune-therapies. Intriguingly, we have found that naïve mice deficient for TLR1 signaling produce elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory innate cytokines IL-23 and IL-1ß in the colonic lamina propria. IL-23 and IL-1ß are important for the expansion and maintenance of TH17 cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). We have found that homeostatic levels of TH17 cells are normal, however ILC3 are significantly increased in the colons of TLR1-deficient mice. Importantly ILC have been identified in patients with IBD, though their induction, regulation and role are still unknown. The proposed research will examine the regulation of IL-23 and IL-1ß in the absence of endogenous TLR1 signaling in the colon and how this impacts the development of ILC3. Specifically, we will determine whether IL-1ß and IL-23 are necessary and sufficient for the homeostatic increase in ILC3 and determine the cell types necessary for this increase. We will also determine how the absence of TLR1 signaling in the colon leads to up-regulated IL-23 and IL-1ß. Lastly, as ILC can have both protective and pathogenic roles in the colon, we will examine how ILC induced in the absence of TLR1 signaling impacts intestinal inflammatory responses. The results of these studies will contribute to the understanding how specific TLR1 signals regulate of innate immunity in the colon. Further, as we have identified a mutation in TLR1 signaling in pediatric patients with IBD, a greater understanding of the regulation of innate immunity by TLR1 may lead to the development of individualized therapies or treatments to prevent disease or relapses."
"9495105","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently demonstrated that the bitter taste receptor T2R38 is expressed in the upper airway and is activated by acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs): quorum-sensing molecules secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.  Furthermore, we found that T2R38 regulates human upper airway innate defenses through nitric oxide production, which stimulates mucociliary clearance and has direct antibacterial effects.   Moreover, common polymorphisms of the TAS2R38 gene, correlating with taste sensitivity to the molecule PTC, are linked to significant differences in the ability of uppe respiratory cells to clear and kill bacteria in response to AHLs.  Based on these results, our central hypothesis is that the bitter taste receptor T2R38 expressed in the upper respiratory epithelium constitutes a sentinel defense network for the detection and clearance of microbes and that genetic variation in T2R38 contributes to individual differences in airway defensive capabilities.   To test this hypothesis, we will: (1) determine whether TAS2R38 genotype, PTC taste sensitivity, and allele-specific expression correlate with symptom severity, disease burden, and interventional outcomes of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and whether TAS2R38 polymorphisims not activated by AHLs are overrepresented in a cohort of CRS patient, and (2) identify other micorbial products that activate the common genetic variants of TAS2R38.  The goal of these aims is to determine the role the bitter taste receptor T2R38 plays in upper airway defense and how common polymorphisms of this receptor contribute to upper airway disease. Furthermore, we will determine whether bitter taste sensitivity can be used as an indicator for disease severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, and whether pharmacologic manipulation of this pathway has therapeutic potential."
"9300650","Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the United States' leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs, but proven CVD risk reduction strategies are often not fully used. Medications such as HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as ?statins,? can reduce CVD risks. However, up to 34% of patients never fill a newly prescribed statin (primary nonadherence), and consequently fail to reduce their CVD risk. Data about primary nonadherence are sparse. The limited data counterintuitively suggest higher rates of primary statin nonadherence in some populations at greater risk for CVD, such as blacks and Hispanics/ Latinos, but the reasons for these disparities are unknown. There is incomplete information about the interplay of patient, healthcare system and provider factors underlying primary nonadherence, and about the type and content of motivational strategies that might encourage primary statin adherence. It is crucial to accurately identify reasons for primary statin nonadherence order to ultimately help people lower their CVD risk. The long-term goal of this research agenda is to reduce CV risk by developing patient-targeted tailored interventions to promote medication adherence. This study will contribute a comprehensive understanding of the reasons that patients choose not to fill a newly prescribed statin, and patient preferences for solutions to overcome primary nonadherence. This cross-sectional study has two phases. In Phase 1, focus group and semi-structured interviews with middle-aged and older white, black, and English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino patients will yield open-ended data exploring the range of reasons patients decide not to fill initial statin prescriptions (focusing on patient attitudes and beliefs), and solicit ideas for potential solutions to overcome these barriers. In Phase 2, we will develop and pilot-test a structured survey with a separate patient cohort (Aim 2). Cognitive interviews will be used to refine survey content and wording. Eligible study patients will be identified by querying standardized databases from a PCORnet (PCORI's National Clinical Research Network) Patient-Powered Research Network (Health eHeart) (Phase 1) and from a PCORnet Clinical Data Research Network (pScanner) and the University of California healthcare system (UC ReX) for Phases 1 and 2. The study's specific aims are to: 1) determine: a) patient attitudes, beliefs, and other factors associated with primary statin nonadherence and b) patient suggestions to overcome these barriers; and 2) develop and pilot-test English- and Spanish-language surveys to understand patient characteristics (e.g., demographics, health) related to: a) patient-reported reasons for primary statin nonadherence and b) preferred strategies to overcome primary statin nonadherence. We expect this study to provide critical preliminary information for the design and conduct of a future larger-scale survey, which will in turn inform the content of tailored patient-targeted interventions to reduce primary statin nonadherence, and ultimately reduce CVD risks."
"9276021","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research centers on two aspects of polypeptide folding and assembly that are highly significant from both fundamental and biomedical perspectives. One focus involves amyloid, an aggregated protein state that is associated with many human diseases. The other focus is quaternary interactions involving single-pass transmembrane helices, which are important for signal transduction via cell-surface receptors. Atomic-resolution characterization of amyloids is extremely challenging because polypeptides in amyloids are insufficiently ordered for high-resolution diffraction (amyloids are not crystals), but the solid nature of amyloids precludes the use of powerful solution-state NMR and other biophysical methods. Remarkable progress has recently been made via solid-state NMR in terms of atomic-resolution models for specific amyloids, revealing an essentially infinite quaternary structure that differs from the discrete structural motifs within folded proteins. The first high-resolution glimpses of amyloid structure have raised questions that seem not to be fully answerable via the study of amyloids themselves. We are therefore pursuing a new approach based on soluble models for the amyloid state. The connection between natural amyloids and associated diseases is not clear: toxicity could arise from fibrils themselves, from oligomeric precursors, or both (most current literature favors soluble oligomers as the main toxic agents). Whatever the origin(s) of pathological effects, it is vital to acquire a fundamental understanding of the factors that influence structure and stability in the amyloid state. Since amyloids themselves are not amenable to many of the powerful strategies available for physical characterization of soluble proteins, we seek soluble model systems that manifest key features associated with authentic amyloid structures. Associations between single-pass transmembrane ?-helices (SPTM helices) are crucial for the function of many membrane proteins. Bitopic receptors, for example, contain single-pass helices that link the sensory extracellular domain with a functional intracellular domain. Signaling generally requires discrete receptor assemblies (dimers, trimers or larger oligomers). Formation of signaling-competent assemblies depends at least in part on specific interactions among SPTM helices. NMR-based structural models for SPTM helix assemblies have appeared in recent years, but there are no crystallographic data for bitopic receptor-derived SPTM helix assemblies, to our knowledge. The only relevant crystal structures involve the SPTM segment of the influenza M2 proton channel, which forms a tetramer, and very recent structures of the TM helix from DAP12, an immunoreceptor adaptor protein. Our long-term goal is to acquire multiple crystal structures for diverse SPTM helix assemblies and thereby contribute to a communal elucidation of the rules that govern intramembrane helix-helix recognition. Racemate and quasiracemate crystallization are major tools in our effort. Crystal structures of SPTM helix assemblies from bitopic receptors would be extremely significant complements to NMR-based models. The nature of the inter-helical interfaces is the most burning question, and crystal structures would provide valuable insights that may not be available via NMR."
"9503875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to expand, driven chiefly by sexual transmission of the virus and sharing of contaminated needles among intravenous drug users. The Global Fund and PEPFAR, the two international programs providing the lion's share of antiviral drugs in the developing world, are unable to keep pace with the epidemic. For every 10 subjects placed on antiviral therapy, 16 individuals are newly infected. As the number of infections increases and funds for lifelong treatment become more limited, a serious gap in HIV/AIDS care will inevitably emerge. What can be done to close this gap? Strikingly, the pathogenic challenge posed by lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, has been successfully met in 40+ species of monkeys who have coevolved with their lentiviruses. Surprisingly, the solution is not to suppress the virus, but rather to modify the host response to the virus in a manner that prevents disease. These animals essentially ignore their lentivirus, by failing to mount chronic inflammatory and immune activation responses, such as those found in HIV- infected humans. We recently found that the vast majority of CD4 T cells dying in HIV-infected lymphoid tissues are victims of an intensely inflammatory form of programmed cell death termed pyroptosis, which involves caspase-1 activation and inflammasome assembly. Remarkably, this pathway appears to be selectively activated in pathogenic but not non-pathogenic lentiviral infections. We now propose to determine if small-molecule inhibitors of the caspase 1/inflammasome/pyroptosis pathway can block clinical progression to AIDS. Caspase-1 inhibitors are already in clinical trials. If successful, this host-focused strategy could be use as a novel and cost-effective means to prevent disease progression, potentially transforming the care of millions of HIV-infected subjects who are unable to access antiviral therapy. This approach could help realize the dream of an AIDS-free generation.        P"
"9500389","Project Summary Two series of complementary experiments, conducted by our exceptionally qualified team of 11 investigators from eight state-of-the-art laboratories at four institutions, will close critical gaps in the current characterization of the autonomic connectome controlling stomach function. These proposed synergistic anatomical and functional investigations will form the needed foundation for neuromodulation protocols that can correct shortcomings in past, first-generation bioelectronic attempts to ameliorate and monitor gastric disorders. Building on recent advances in mapping of vagal circuits, many reported by our research team, SA 1 will finish inventories of the efferent and afferent terminal phenotypes, analyze their collateral specializations, establish their regional distributions, and identify chemical taxonomies of their target tissues. We will also compare the neural circuitry of the human (and pig, an ideal large animal preclinical proof-of-principle model) stomach with that of the rat model to facilitate future translational extrapolations. The analyses of SA 1 will use a suite of high-definition neural tracing, immunohistochemical and molecular protocols, along with advanced imaging and morphometric techniques, that our team has adapted to autonomic circuits. SA 1 will focus on those elements in gastric neural network that may be most relevant to informing SA 2 and identify additional localized sites in the stomach wall where focal stimulation will have strong therapeutic potential. In functional assessments, SA 2 will identify optimal locations for both highly selective vagal stimulation (VNS) and precise surgical placement between the exit of the vagus from the brainstem and the target sites of the axons within the stomach wall and will determine the best stimulation protocols for augmenting gastric physiology. SA 2 will use state-of-the-art closed-loop stimulator technologies, algorithms, and electrodes (previously designed and robustly proven by investigators on our research team) and assess the reliability, validity, and stability of the VNS by employing a battery (? 6) of acute, short-term, and long-term non-invasive endpoints. The team will use data archiving and resource sharing platforms that are universally accessible to all research and medical communities."
"9351900","  Abstract  A very large proportion of persons living with HIV infection (PLH) in Russia are not presently in HIV medical care, and many do not adhere to ART regimens at levels needed to achieve full viral suppression. Because viral suppression greatly reduces the likelihood of HIV transmission, poor care engagement fuels Russia's HIV disease incidence at a population level. This application proposes to expand a longstanding, bilateral, and interdisciplinary collaboration between investigators at the Center for AIDS Intervention Research (CAIR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, USA and St. Petersburg State University Medical Faculty to develop and test a novel intervention to reach social networks of out-of-care PLH in the community and then harness peer social support to improve network members' HIV care engagement and adherence. In a 6-month qualitative phase, in-depth interviews will be conducted with 30 out-of-care or ART nonadherent HIV+ drug users, men who have sex with men, and heterosexual men and women to examine relationships between substance use and care nonengagement, and to elicit feedback and recommendations about the planned intervention. The study's main trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a social network intervention designed to improve care engagement and ART adherence. Our prior research in Russia has established that PLH in the community are often linked in their friendship groups with other HIV+ persons and that these networks can be recruited into research. The intervention will recruit 48 out-of-care or ART nonadherent HIV+ seeds from community settings in St. Petersburg. Seeds will invite their HIV+ friends, who will in turn invite their own HIV+ friends into the study, creating a sample of 48 PLH networks (expected n=288, 6 members/network x 48 networks). Following baseline assessment of care engagement, ART adherence, treatment attitudes, psychosocial distress, substance use, and CD4+ and viral load, 24 networks (n=144 participants) will be randomized to an intervention condition and 24 networks (n=144) to the comparison condition. All members of each intervention condition network will together attend a 4-session intervention to strengthen attitudes, intentions, and skills for entering, remaining, and adhering to HIV medical care. Because participants will attend sessions with other PLH who are their own friends in day-to-day life, the intervention will build and increase mutual social support within each network for HIV care and adherence. Peer champions identified in each intervention network will attend 3 additional sessions in which they are guided to reinforce and help to sustain friends' medical care engagement. Intervention outcomes will be determined by baseline to 6- and 12- month followup change on primary measures of participant attendance at HIV medical care visits, adherence to ART regimens, and viral load as well as secondary measures of alcohol use, drug use, sexual risk behavior, treatment attitudes, and psychosocial distress. This research will evaluate a new strategy to reach and deliver intervention to improve HIV medical care engagement among out-of-care PLH in the community."
"9403184","Project Abstract Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been an important policy strategy, intended to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. In our parent grant (Does a New Supermarket Improve Dietary Behaviors of Low-income African Americans? R01CA149105), our team capitalized on a natural experiment in which a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI)-supported full-service supermarket (FSS) was opened in an underserved area. In 2011, we enrolled a cohort (N=1,372) of randomly selected households from an intervention neighborhood (that received the new FSS) and a similar comparison neighborhood and followed the cohort from prior to the FSS?s opening through one year post-opening. We found that intervention neighborhood residents had some dietary improvements ? lower added sugars, calories, and saturated fats, alcohols and added sugars (SoFAAS). However, use of the new FSS, the hypothesized mediator, was not associated with dietary changes. The proposed renewal grant seeks to examine whether the socioeconomic impact that the new FSS or anticipation of it and other developments among investors, had on the neighborhood might be responsible for the dietary improvements we observed. It also taps into a new opportunity to examine the effect of much larger ongoing and impending revitalization of the intervention neighborhood on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and diet. Addressing these research questions will help us to better understand and to replicate the dietary improvements of placing an FSS in a food desert. Results will speak to the substantial literature linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, diet, and weight, largely limited to cross-sectional studies. We will also examine the extent to which the dietary improvements we observed in our parent study are maintained, and the pathways by which neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may impact diet. To achieve this, we will obtain and merge secondary retrospective and prospective data concerning neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (NSEC) of the intervention and control neighborhoods with existing survey data and neighborhood audits, and collect two additional waves of survey and audit data capturing the impending major neighborhood revitalization projects that are underway or in development. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments and the hypothesized causal pathway from neighborhood change to dietary improvement. Thus, the proposed renewal will capitalize on our existing data, cohort, and research infrastructure to address critically important follow-on questions and will be the first study, to our knowledge, to test whether SES improvements at the neighborhood and individual level are associated with improved diet and weight status."

"9241986","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Core L - Scientific inquiry and public health are being fundamentally changed by immense volumes of complex data, and modern computational techniques that are able to mine these data for pattern discovery and inference. The field of HIV research is no exception, and many innovative discoveries have been facilitated or validated by sophisticated modeling and data analyses. Traditional biostatistics services are neither designed to handle gigantic volumes of complex data, nor are these new data types (e.g., next generation sequencing data) a natural fit for current computational biology and informatics applications. The purpose of the Bioinformatics and Information Technologies (BIT) is to handle CFAR investigator demand for storing, managing, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating large and complex data sets, especially those containing viral and host molecular sequences. Based on ongoing and anticipated future needs of CFAR members, in the next five years, the BIT Core is structured as three interlinked units that will: (1) provide bioinformatics support for CFAR researchers by leveraging world-class expertise in bioinformatics and computational biology available at UCSD to offer a comprehensive spectrum of services and consultations related to computational analyses of data collected by CFAR investigators; (2) supply content management systems, web services for biomedical data, and computational infrastructure; and (3) provide training in bioinformatics and information technology. The BIT Core is uniquely positioned to provide these innovative services to CFAR members by drawing upon cutting edge in-house methodological research, modern sequencing and biomedical technologies offered by other CFAR Cores (e.g. GS, PEP, Flow Cytometry Cores), and professional software development and support expertise of its programming team. The CFAR External Advisory Committee reviewed our Center in February, 2012 and noted the following about the BIT Core in their final report: The BIT Core is likely to set the standard for how CFARs handle  next generation sequencing analysis, cohort data management and provide web presence."
"9335242","Project Summary Physical activity rates decrease across the lifespan. Relative to other age groups, nationwide estimates of physical activity are among the lowest in midlife. Average weekly usage of fitness facilities in the U.S. is also well below recommended levels of physical activity. Moreover, within the first 6 months of initiating a structured exercise program, dropout rates are approximately 50 percent. ?Booster strategies? have mainly been implemented within exercise interventions to increase compliance to study protocols, and it has yet to be determined whether training at the onset of enrollment in an exercise program can reduce attrition and increase long-term adherence and engagement in physical activity with limited professional guidance. Evidence suggests that general cognitive training and training specific to exercise- related cognitive processing has the potential to increase self-efficacy and self-regulatory strategies, and ultimately, exercise behavior maintenance. In the last decade, active videogame (exergaming) interventions have been used with aging populations to make exercise more enjoyable and prepare the brain for action. Active videogames have been successfully delivered within center- and home-based interventions and have yielded positive effects on mobility, cognitive functioning, psychosocial outcomes, and physical activity behavior. The purpose of this double- blinded, randomized controlled study is to compare CORTEX (Cognitive Regulation Training and Exercise), a multi-faceted, general and exercise-specific cognitive training program? involving 20 hours of active and traditional computerized cognitive training, delivered via a training center and at home?to an attention-control condition involving health and wellness informational videos. More specifically, the cognitive training group will emphasize dual-task abilities, memory, visual-spatial processing, as well as self-as-exerciser priming and self- certainty training. We hypothesize that a month-long cognitive training program will enhance cognitive and related self-regulatory functioning and self-efficacy and in turn, increase exercise adherence and engagement within a 12-month aerobic and resistive exercise program at a local fitness facility. We also expect more positive improvements in cognitive and psychosocial functioning among participants in the CORTEX condition as compared to the Video Control condition immediately following the cognitive booster training, and across time."
"9313948","SUMMARY: Murine Mutagenesis Core In recent years neuroscience research has experienced many transformative technical advances. Mouse genetics is a major contributor to this technological revolution. NINDS-supported investigators at JHU SOM rely heavily on mutant and transgenic mouse lines to study the nervous system, both in health and disease. However, the generation of these transgenic mouse lines, which in many cases are tailor-made, expensive, and time-consuming to produce, requires extensive dedicated effort and equipment. Moreover, to achieve success using these transgenic technologies, users must have considerable technical knowledge. The goal of the Murine Mutagenesis Core (MMC) is to lower barriers for generating mouse mutants by providing a unique suite of mouse mutagenesis services for neuroscience investigators at JHU SOM. The MMC offers NINDS- supported investigators, and other scientists engaged in research consistent with the NINDS mission, access to state-of-the-art techniques, including: homologous recombination-mediated targeting in mouse ES cells, karyotyping of ES cells, cryopreservation of crucial mouse lines, and the use of targeted ES cells from commercial and noncommercial sources. Importantly, the highly experienced MMC personnel provide face-to- face advice on targeting construct design, the use of recombineering technology to make these constructs, project trouble-shooting as work progresses, and technical feedback which is lacking in cores outside of JHU. Owing to recent success by the MMC in employing CRISPR, ZFN, and integrase based mutagenesis and gene targeting, the MMC proposes expanding its services to utilize these non-ES cell based technologies that have significantly shortened the timeline for generating mutant mouse alleles and have reduced the cost for investigators compared with traditional homologous recombination approaches. The proposed new services (many of which are not commercially available) include: 1) CRISPR induced small deletion mutations; 2) CRISPR-introduced floxed conditional and epitope-tagged alleles; 3) generation of large insertions using the CRISPR approach; 4) CRISPR-induced additional mutations in existing transgenic lines; and 5) introduction of useful genes, such as those encoding various forms of GCaMPs and DREADDs, into the Rosa26 locus by integrase-based integration. Since there are many challenges in implementing the evolving CRISPR technologies, and since there is still value in using targeted ES cells from commercial sources, the MMC ES work will be maintained. Given its success and productivity during the past funding period, the MMC proposes continuing to provide Primary Center Investigators and other neuroscientists at JHU with the opportunity to generate innovative mouse lines to study basic mechanisms of nervous system function and the causes of neurologic diseases. In addition, the MMC proposes continuing to encourage collaboration among neuroscientists at JHU and facilitating the utilization of state-of-the-art techniques to accelerate advances in neuroscience research."
"9288712","SPRINT ASK Project Summary Results from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) are likely to change clinical practice. For many people with hypertension, including those over age 75, the benefit on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and total mortality supports treatment to more intensive BP goals. Because hypertension and CV disease burden is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease, the more important long term public health benefit of SBP lowering may be to reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Yet clinicians have reason to be cautious about lower SBP goals for older patients due to the possibility of adverse effects on brain structure and function. Early stopping of the main trial reduced the planned follow-up for incidence of all- cause dementia and renal outcomes, but a separation in SBP persisted between randomized arms at the final main study visits, and over 90% of the cohort agreed to additional follow-up. The main study will not collect any data on these outcomes after June 30 2016. The proposed study, however, would complete the intended protocol, achieving several critical research objectives: testing whether, after 5 years of follow-up, (1) the incidence of adjudicated all-cause dementia (which will be predominantly Alzheimer's Dementia) and (2) adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will be lower in participants randomized to intensive SBP treatment. It will also assess long term effects on kidney outcomes. All participants will undergo one clinic visit approximately 12 months after their final main study visit to assess blood pressure, cognitive and renal function. SPRINT operations were highly effective and contributed to the success of the trial, and there will be some continuity of staff and operating infrastructure to support these visits early in 2017. The transition will be largely seamless, following closely the main study's protocol for leadership, organization, operations and data collection. It is doubtful that another large scale trial in the US will ascertain incident Alzheimer's and other dementia or examine the renal effects of treating SBP to <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg. If new guidelines encourage an SBP treatment target of <120 mm Hg, patients will be exposed to many years of intensive anti- hypertensive therapy. The SPRINT cohort is uniquely place for a low cost opportunity to determine whether longer term effects of exposure to a lower SBP target is beneficial, harmful, or has no clinically important effect for brain and kidney."
"9276547","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During aging, skeletal muscles become atrophic and lose contractile force. This affects a large population of elderly regardless of ethnicity, gender, and wealth and is the most common cause of age-related loss of independence, frailty, and mortality. As the elderly proportion in the population continues to increase, the potential social and economic burden of muscle aging is becoming enormous. The neuromuscular junction is a synapse between motor neuron terminals and skeletal muscle fibers that transmit signals from motor neurons to muscle fibers. The neuromuscular transmission is critical for the control of muscle contraction and is thus essential for our physical mobility and daily life. Extensive research has revealed insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of muscle aging. However, although NMJ structures and functions are disrupted in aged animals, little is known about underlying mechanisms. In contrast to NMJ formation, which has been studied extensively, much less is understood about mechanisms of NMJ maintenance, in particular in aged animals. This proposal will test an innovative hypothesis that NMJ function in aged animals depends on agrin signaling, a pathway that is required for NMJ formation. In particular, we will address the following critical questions by using a combination of cutting edge technologies. First, does LRP4 deficiency mimicking LRP4 reduction in aged mice cause NMJ decline? Does restoring agrin signaling improve NMJ function in aged mice? What is the mechanism that controls LRP4 stability? How does agrin signaling maintain NMJ function in aged mice? Results will provide unequivocal evidence to either support or refute that agrin signaling is involved in NMJ decline during aging, reveal whether enhancing agrin signaling may prevent or delay NMJ decline and muscle aging, and identify novel mechanisms controlling LRP4 stability and mediating agrin signaling to promote NMJ maintenance. Such knowledge may contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of NMJ decline and muscle aging, which is prerequisite to the development of effective therapeutic interventions for NMJ decline and muscle aging."

"9363653","Abstract  APOBEC family cytidine deaminases are prominent mutators of cancer genomes, often causing thousands of C to T base substitutions in affected tumors. These enzymes normally function within the immune system and lipid metabolism. How APOBECs become dysregulated and the role subsequent of APOBEC-induced genetic instability has in promoting cancer progression are unclear. Also unknown is whether APOBECs induce other types of genetic instability in tumors in addition to base substitutions caused by deamination. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify mechanisms that enable APOBEC mutagenesis, determine how this activity alters cancer genomes, and assess the contribution of this genetic instability to carcinogenesis. Aim 1 will determine if increased levels of single strand DNA caused by chemical and oncogene-induced replication stress facilitates APOBEC mutagenesis. We will measure the effects of replication stress on APOBEC-induced mutation frequencies in human cells, determine if cancer cells displaying endogenous APOBEC activity also display markers of replication stress, and determine whether replication stress induced by Her2 activation synergizes with APOBEC mutagenesis to alter cell proliferation and accelerate tumorigenesis in a mouse model. Aim 2 will address how deficiencies in chromatin modifiers influence APOBEC mutagenesis. We have determined that loss of chromatin modifying enzymes, which are also frequently inactivated during cancer development, increase the frequency of APOBEC-induced mutations in yeast. The mechanisms underlying this effect will be determined and re-capitulated in human cells. Additionally, associations between chromatin modifier loss and elevated numbers of APOBEC-induced mutations in sequenced cancers will be bioinformatically evaluated. Aim 3 will investigate whether APOBECs are capable of inducing chromosomal rearrangements during cancer development. We will measure APOBEC-induced frequencies of non-allelic recombination and copy number variation in yeast and human cells as well as evaluate whether APOBECs mutagenize the single strand DNA intermediates formed during these recombination events to cause kataegis. The results from the experiments proposed in these Aims will likely demonstrate that mutation-driven, cancer-associated changes in DNA metabolism increase APOBEC- induced mutagenesis, investigate an expanded role for APOBECs in promotion of additional types of genetic alterations, and directly characterize the ability of APOBEC-generated mutagenesis to promote tumorigenesis. Successful completion of these aims will describe a critical aspect in the development and progression of a significant number of human tumors."
"9334332","Triplet nucleotide repeat expansion mutations cause progressive and lethal neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's Disease (HD) and Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Although many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathological effects of triplet repeat expansion mutations, the molecular basis for these diseases remains elusive. Most research has focused on the toxic effects of expanded polyglutamine proteins encoded by CAG repeats. However, triplet repeat RNA has recently been shown to be toxic to neurons and to contribute to disease. This research will use a new X-ray footprinting technique to visualize the abnormal structure of the expanded huntingtin mRNA in living neuronal cells. The first aim is to determine the structures of normal and expanded RNA in unstressed and stressed cells that mimic the neurotoxic effects of HD. Comparisons of different triplet repeat mRNAs will identify sequences that readily form neurotoxic RNA structures. The second aim is to investigate how interactions between triplet repeat RNA and cellular proteins contribute to neurotoxicity. In addition, a tool compound that binds CAG RNA repeats will be tested for its ability to block abnormal mRNA structures. The third aim is to determine whether the structures of triplet repeat complexes and their effect on the mRNA interactome account for the varied sensitivity of neurons to triplet repeat mutations. This first application of X-ray footprinting to mRNAs in cells will link the three-dimensional structures of mRNAs with the pathology of triplet repeat diseases, and determine how small molecule tool compounds disrupt these structures in live cells. The long-term goal is to identify a structural signature of RNA-protein interactions that predict neurotoxicity and that can be targeted by new therapies."
"9392671","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S, and it is a necessity to develop better drugs for those with advanced disease. Specific markers of CRC tumor stem cells (TSCs) have been elusive for many years, but recently strong data has emerged to support the TSC-role originally proposed by our lab for doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) in APC mutant CRC. Specifically, Dclk1+ tuft cells initiate tumorigenesis in response to Apc mutation as demonstrated by lineage tracing in the ApcMin/+ model of intestinal neoplasia as well as in a model of inflammation-induced colon cancer. Strikingly, in the ApcMin/+ model, diphtheria toxin-inducible deletion of Dclk1+ cells results in a complete collapse of tumors with no apparent negative effects. While, APC is considered a gatekeeper in colorectal tumorigenesis and inactivating mutations exist in 34-70% of CRC tumors, KRAS mutations are also exceptionally common (30-60%) and associated with significantly decreased overall survival, particularly in metastatic disease. In addition to limiting therapeutic options for CRC patients, KRAS mutations accompanied by APC loss strongly increase tumorigenesis, metastasis, and TSC properties. The DCLK1+ cell is now strongly implicated as a cell-of-origin for KRAS- driven pancreatic cancer, and recent proteomic studies demonstrate that knock-in of KRASG12/G13 mutations into CRC cells results in specific DCLK1 upregulation20. Moreover, DCLK1 is highly expressed in CRC metastases and predicts significantly decreased survival in patients. We propose to unravel DCLK1's role in KRAS-mutant CRC progression and assess DCLK1-targeted therapies with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of DCLK1 and the DCLK1+ tuft cell in the initiation and progression of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Aim 2: Dissect DCLK1's mechanistic role in CRC downstream of KRASG12D and in the background of APC loss. Aim 3: Demonstrate the feasibility of targeting DCLK1 in KRAS-mutant patient-derived CRC models as a primary therapy and to overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted cetuximab and gefitinib. These studies will utilize novel models to provide the first definitive assessment of the DCLK1's functional significance in KRAS-driven CRC and its potential as both a primary therapeutic target and an adjuvant to reverse KRAS-mediated resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We will pursue these studies with a highly multi- disciplinary team of experts including: Courtney Houchen and Dongfeng Qu (DCLK1/gastrointestinal cancers), Timothy Wang (DCLK1 mouse model), Channing Der (KRAS), Robert Langer (bioengineering), Hans Clevers (CRC organoids), Min Li (mouse surgery models), and Magdalena Bieniasz (patient-derived xenografts). These studies may lead to novel and effective therapies for patients with advanced CRC."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolic homeostasis plays a central role in all aspects of life, allowing animals to balance their dietary intake with the energy needs required for day-to-day survival. Conversely, mis-regulation of metabolism can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are critical risk factors for human disease, including cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Our research exploits the speed and power of Drosophila genetics to identify and characterize key aspects of metabolic control with the goal of identifying new levels of regulation that are conserved through evolution, from flies to humans. The molecular context for our studies are nuclear receptors (NRs), which are ligand-regulated transcription factors that play a central role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Drosophila has 18 NR genes, significantly fewer than the 48 genes found in humans, spanning all vertebrate NR subfamilies and encoding homologs of key human receptors, including HNF4 (dHNF4), LXR (DHR96), NR4A receptors (DHR38), TR2/TR4 receptors (DHR78), and ERR (dERR). This provides a simplified context for functional studies of NR signaling pathways, allowing us to use Drosophila to define the ancestral roles of evolutionarily-conserved NR subclasses in the absence of genetic redundancy. Over the past four years of NIDDK support our studies of dHNF4, DHR96, DHR78, and dERR, have demonstrated that their fundamental activities have been conserved through evolution, and have revealed new insights into the regulation and function of their mammalian counterparts. In this renewal application, we propose two specific aims that continue our studies of Drosophila NRs with a focus on lipid metabolic pathways. These aims build off recent studies in our lab that identified new activities for the Drosophila members of the ERR and TR2/TR4 NR subfamilies. In aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that dERR supports lipid uptake, transport, and/or storage in adults, analogous to the role of ERR? in the intestine and adipose tissue. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that DHR78 plays a central role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial activity that supports female fertility and suppresses neurodegeneration. By combining metabolite measurements, metabolomic profiling, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, tissue-specific rescue experiments, RNAi studies, functional characterization of select target genes, and ligand regulation of the receptor, we will define the mechanisms of NR signaling at a level of resolution that is difficult to achieve in more complex organisms. These advances, in turn, will improve our design of mouse models for future functional studies, harness the power of model organism genetics to understand the factors that contribute to diabetes and obesity, and facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches to treat metabolic dysfunction."
"9303356","Rapid advances in technology are leading to field-deployable mobile sensing devices that can be used to  quantify complex dynamics of key physical, biological, behavioral, social, and environmental factors that  contribute to health and disease risk across time and help us thus break through to the next level of  biomedical understanding of causation in complex disorders. While ongoing efforts have focused on and  made significant strides in the analysis of big data in the areas of genomics, imaging, and EHR, significant  new investment is needed to provide training in data analytics tools specific to the unique features of mobile  sensor data to enable scientists to convert this wealth of data into information, knowledge, and action.  Investment in a strong, open, scientific, and computational infrastructure for mobile big data at this early  stage promises outsize returns to advance science, but only if accompanied by easily-accessible training  and education.  The Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (MD2K) will generate generalizable  theory, methods, tools, and software, to address major barriers to processing complex mobile sensor data  and using it for biomedical discovery. The Training Core of the MD2K Center will enable the broader  biomedical research community beyond the Center to use the MD2K data analysis tools for biomedical  discovery in a range of biomedical applications by providing online tutorials, training videos, virtual seminars  and a comprehensive web-based resource library. It will engage the data science research community in  advancing the science of MD2K itself by equipping them with data sets, open-source software,  documentation, and online forums so they can contribute new theories, software, and data sets, and  integrate new sensors and other data types into the MD2K platform. It will develop curricular materials for  use in classrooms, in both data science and biomedical disciplines, to provide MD2K training to students,  and begin the process of building the next generation of scientific workforce that is capable of using MD2K in  increasingly sophisticated biomedical applications."
"9396789","PROJECT SUMMARY Deficits in goal-directed behavior are the hallmark of many neuropsychiatric diseases. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) has emerged as a key mediator of goal-directed actions, serving as a critical node for integration of sensorimotor, motivational, and cognitive information. Low-threshold spiking interneurons (LTSIs) exert strong inhibitory control over striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and are positioned to regulate plasticity at cortico-SPN synapses through dendritic inhibition. While LTSIs are poised to play a key role in regulating goal-directed behavior, no evidence of DMS LTSI involvement in learning behavior has presently been reported. The overarching aim of this proposal is therefore to explore the role of DMS LTSIs in goal- directed behavior and examine how learning alters LTSI physiology and plasticity. The first proposed experiment investigates whether LTSIs are important for the acquisition of goal-directed behavior. To provide initial evidence for LTSI involvement in learning and behavioral flexibility, excitability of LTSIs has been reduced using cell-type specific viral expression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and mice subsequently trained in a goal-directed operant task. Preliminary data demonstrates that this reduction in LTSI excitability significantly enhances task acquisition. Efficient goal-directed behavior is comprised of learning action-outcome associations, selecting an appropriate action, evaluating the resultant outcome, and adjusting behavior if necessary. To temporally delineate the role of LTSIs in action selection and outcome valuation during the acquisition of an action-outcome contingency, an optogenetic approach will be implemented. Using halorhodopsin, DMS LTSIs will be selectively inhibited during the interval preceding lever choice (action selection period) or as mice retrieve and consume their reward (outcome valuation period). Prior work has shown a key role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in action selection, while the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been strongly linked to outcome valuation. Interestingly, preliminary cell type-specific monosynaptic tracing data shows DMS LTSIs receive the densest innervation from the ACC and OFC. While results from the optogenetics experiment may implicate the ACC and/or OFC in LTSI function during goal-directed behavior, it will be important to more directly pursue the functional role of these circuits. As LTSIs are highly excitable and tonically active, learning may involve silencing their inhibitory effects within the striatum. This can be achieved through reductions in LTSI excitability, enhanced depression of excitatory ACC-LTSI or OFC-LTSI synapses, or reduced efficacy at LTSI-SPN synapses. The second set of ex vivo electrophysiology experiments will directly test these possibilities using projection-specific optogenetic recruitment of ACC and OFC synapses onto LTSI neurons in mice that have learned the goal-directed behavior task."
"9278154","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute mucosal infections remain a foremost global health problem. ROR?t and IL23/STAT3 signaling in ROR?t+ group-3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are critical for IL-22 production required for protection against Citrobacter rodentium colitis. We recently showed that lymphotoxin (LT) from ILC3s could also control IL-22 production. IL-7R signaling is required for maintaining ILC3s. The transcription factor Id2 is required for ILC progenitor development, since Id2-/- mice lack all ILC lineages; however, Id2 is still highly expressed after ILC3 development, and it remains unclear whether or not Id2 regulates the function of differentiated ROR?t+ ILC3s and, if so, how this is executed. To address the role of Id2 in the homeostasis and/or function of ILC3s, we generated mice deficient in Id2 only in their ROR?t+ ILC3s (ROR?t-Id2-/- mice) and observed that they have reduced ILC3s with diminished IL-7R, IL-23R, LT and IL-22 expression and became highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection. Surprisingly, cohousing ROR?t-Id2-/- mice with WT mice reduced mortality and morbidity of ROR?t-Id2-/- mice. We hypothesize that Id2 expression in differentiated ROR?t+ ILC3s is required for the homeostasis and function of ILC3s, which can control commensal flora against pathogen colonization in the gut. In Aim 1, we will determine how Id2 regulates the development of various ILC3 subsets. We will test whether or not Id2 is required to control the IL-7R pathway and how this is regulated. We will also study whether or not Id2 controls the survival or proliferative capacity of ILC3s through IL-7R signaling. Finally, we will determine how interaction of Id2 and E protein controls the IL-7R/STAT5 pathway. In Aim 2, we will define how Id2 controls host defense against C. rodentium infection. We will test whether or not Id2 expression in ILC3s promotes IL-22 production, which is required for protection against C. rodentium infection. We will test whether Id2 intrinsically regulates IL-22 production through the IL-23R pathway to protect the host against an infection. We will also determine how Id2 controls LT expression on ILC3s for extrinsic regulation of IL-22 production against C. rodentium infection. In Aim 3, we will determine whether Id2 controls C. rodentium infection through regulating and maintaining a gut flora capable of competing with C. rodentium. If so, we will test how an Id2- dependent response regulates the protective gut flora against C. rodentium. We will further determine whether the selection is mediated by ILC3-derived IL-22. Finally, we will determine how an Id2- dependent gut flora controls C. rodentium infection. Studying Id2 in ROR?t+ ILC3s will provide new insights into ILC3 development and function, which contribute to the homeostasis of gut flora that protects against a mucosal infection in the gut."
"9223034","ABSTRACT  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a clinical-pathologic diagnosis characterized by steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS), focal scarring of the glomerular capillary tuft and rapid progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). The incidence of FSGS has increased more than 10-fold over the past three decades and the disease is highly prevalent in the African Americans (AA) population. Indeed, AAs account for 40% of all cases of ESKD due to FSGS despite comprising only 13% of the general population.  FSGS is now the most common primary glomerular disorder causing ESKD. A characteristic feature of the disease is a reduced number of glomerular podocytes. As a result, podocytes are thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of FSGS.  The study of familial forms of FSGS has provided key insights into the disease process. These studies have identified mutations in over 30 genes that are enriched in glomerular podocytes. Mutations in these genes are rare in AAs despite the high risk for progression to ESKD in the AA population. Our laboratory has collected over 30 AA kindreds with autosomal dominant FSGS. Using this unique resource, I have identified a rare heterozygous missense variant in the interleukin-15 receptor-? (IL-15R?K47R) as the only variant that segregates with the disease in an AA kindred with autosomal dominant FSGS. The variant occurs within the high-affinity ?sushi? ligand binding domain of the receptor and is predicted to be damaging by SIFT and polyphen analyses. In support of a damaging effect of the mutation, we found that the IL-15R?K47R point mutation impairs IL-15-induced prosuvival signaling. Based on these preliminary data, I hypothesize that the IL-15R?K47R is a hypomorphic, loss-of-function variant that promotes impaired prosurvival signaling, resulting in podocyte apoptosis. To investigate this hypothesis, 3 specific aims are proposed:  1. Determine the effect of the IL-15R? K47R variant on podocyte pro-survival signaling  2. Characterize the renal phenotype of the IL-15R?-deficient mouse, and  3. Determine the prevalence of rare variants in IL-15R? in our cohort of AA patients with FSGS. The proposed experiments will generate insights into the molecular pathogenesis of FSGS and may uncover novel therapeutic targets.  Over the term of this award, I hope to develop new skills in human glomerular disease modeling in mice and to generate the data necessary for submission of an independent investigator award focused on defining the molecular pathogenesis of FSGS. My mentor for this proposal, Dr. Robert Spurney, is a leader in the field of cell biology and whole animal modeling and has extensive experience as a research mentor. Moreover, my mentor team, my experience in biochemistry and Nephrology, and the unique training environment of Duke University uniquely positions me to achieve the scientific objectives outlined in this proposal."
"9227325","The older adult population is increasing with estimates of over 80 million or greater than 20% of the US population by 2050. As aging is associated with functional decline, preventing functional limitations and maintaining independence throughout later life has emerged as an important public health goal. Research indicates that sedentary behavior (prolonged sitting) is associated with functional loss and diminished ability to carry out activities of daily living. Despite many efforts to increase physical activity, which can be effective in countering functional loss, only an estimated 8% of older adults meet national physical activity guidelines. Thus, shifting the focus to reducing sitting time is emerging as a potential new intervention strategy but little research has been conducted in this area. With community support and funding, we developed and pilot tested a four week ?Stand Up & Move More? intervention and found significant decreases in sedentary behavior, increases in physical activity, and improvements in mobility and vitality in a small sample of older adults. The purpose of this project is to expand upon these promising results and examine the effectiveness and feasibility of translating a ?Stand Up and Move More? intervention by State Aging Units to older adults from underserved communities. Eighty older adults from four counties made up predominantly of rural older adults and older African American adults will be randomly assigned to intervention (n=40) or wait-list control (n=40) groups. The intervention consists of four weekly sessions plus a refresher session at 8 weeks, and will be delivered by community partners in each county. Based on self-regulation theory, the sessions will elicit ideas from older adults regarding how they can reduce their sitting time, help them set practical goals, develop action plans to reach their goals, and refine their plans across sessions to promote behavior change. Sedentary behavior, physical activity levels, functional performance, and health-related quality of life will be assessed before and after the intervention to examine the effectiveness of the program. Feasibility of implementing the program by our community partners will be assessed via semi-structured interviews. Strengths of the proposed project include strong community collaborations and a high need since the older adult population is projected to increase substantially in the next 15 years."
"9285839","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite glaring health and HIV/AIDS-disparities among American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIAN), Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Island Islanders (NHPI), there is a paucity of culturally grounded research addressing their HIV-related biomedical and behavioral health concerns. A strong network of highly trained and productive Indigenous scholars dedicated to research that is culturally grounded would contribute to ameliorating HIV-related disparities among Indigenous populations. This competitive renewal application, in response to PAR-12-273, NIMH Research Education Mentoring Programs for HIV/AIDS Researchers is designed to develop the Indigenous HIV/AIDS Research Training Program-Lauhoe (IHART2) to develop a cadre of culturally grounded Native scholars capable of serving as PIs on extramurally funded HIV/AIDS- related prevention and disparities studies with Indigenous populations. The program is based on the success of the first 5 years of the Indigenous HIV/AIDS Research Training (IHART) R25 program (under PAR-06-494), the only Native-specific HIV/AIDS research training and mentorship program in the US. IHART2 extends the reach of the original IHART program from a primary focus on indigenous North Americans (e.g., AIAN and Native Latinos), to including NHPI (e.g., Native Hawaiian, Samoans). Additionally, where IHART focused on mid-career scientists, IHART2 now targets postdoctoral and early-career scholars. Building upon IHART success, IHART2 deepens the 360 degree co-mentorship approach with flexibility for program Fellows and Mentors to co-identify HIV training, career development, and cultural needs of the Fellow. IHART2 will be housed at the university-wide interdisciplinary funded Indigenous Wellness Research Institute (IWRI; iwri.org) National Center of Excellence (NIMHD; P60 MD006909-02) at the University of Washington. IWRI is directed and staffed almost entirely by AIAN, with three of the leading federally funded AIAN HIV researchers at the helm. IWRI has the infrastructure and environment necessary to promote culturally grounded Indigenous HIV prevention and disparities science training in a manner that is not currently covered by any existing R25s. To achieve the overall objectives of IHART2, we will select 15 Fellows who will undergo a structured 24-month intensive year-round mentorship program that includes: (a) annual research institutes and writing retreats (writing retreat; Spring Research Roundtable; Summer Research Institute; grant writing workshop,); (b) other training (webinars; 4 quarterly seminars; on-site mentor shadowing; and support for attendance to HIV/AIDS training institutes; (c) technical assistance (peer review for grant submission; statistical, editorial, and technical assistance for grant applications and manuscripts for publication); (d) seed funding ($20,000 to conduct pilot studies, travel to conferences, or to buy out time); and (e) network development (via mentor networks and website). By the end of the 24 month program, Fellows will have implemented a pilot study, published HIV/AIDS articles; presented at HIV-related conferences; and developed a NIH HIV-related grant proposal."
"9277581","ABSTRACT BACE1 was discovered as the Alzheimer's ?-secretase for initiating the production of ?-amyloid peptide (A?) from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Abnormal accumulation of A? in various forms (dimers, trimers, multimers, oligomers) has been linked to impaired synaptic and cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Reducing A? generation by BACE1 inhibition is therefore an actively investigated area for ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. However, BACE1, as a membrane-bound aspartyl protease, can cleave membrane-bound proteins other than APP. Among its identified substrates, the signaling molecule neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) and Notch ligands such as Jagged-1 (Jag1) are important for their roles in neural development and synaptic functions. In this study, we will focus on the roles of BACE1 in processing signaling molecules such as Nrg1 and Jag1. The abolished cleavage of Nrg1 in BACE1-null mice reduces Nrg1 signaling through ErbB receptors and thus impairs myelination during development and remyelination in the adult, and it also induces schizophrenia-like behaviors, including impaired cognitive functions. On the other hand, abolished cleavage of Jag1 in BACE1-null mice likely increases Jag1 signaling on the neuronal surface and activation of its receptor Notch in a paracrine fashion; this increased Jag1-Notch signaling induces astrogenesis and reduces neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ). Neurogenesis in the SGZ produces dentate granule cells, which are neurons important for long-term potentiation. Hence, BACE1 is required for normal neural development and synaptic functions. We aim to test our central hypothesis that BACE1 cleavage of signaling molecules such as Nrg1 and Jag1 regulates neurogenesis and synaptic functions. Specifically, we will 1) determine the role of BACE1-dependent Nrg1 signaling in the control of synaptic function, and 2) investigate BACE1-dependent Jag1 signaling in astrogenesis and neurogenesis. Our main objectives for accomplishing the proposed studies are to fully understand the in vivo neuronal functions that BACE1 exerts during early development and in the adult brain and to develop strategies for enhancing synaptic functions or neurogenesis to couple with therapeutic strategies of reducing A? through BACE1 inhibition in AD patients."
"9273354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disturbances of metabolism, often linked to mitochondrial function, have a major impact on disease risk and healthspan among human populations. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases are all linked to major changes in metabolic and mitochondrial function. A complex set of genetic and environmental factors-including diet-underlie individual differences in the risk and severity of metabolic syndrome. This project is focused on the complex gene-by- environmental interactions (GXE) that contribute to mitochondrial and metabolic syndrome, and that reduce healthy lifespan. We use a new integrative systems genetics approach to study effects of a high fat Western diet. This work relies on a large family of isogenic and genetically diverse murine lines-including F1 hybrids- that serve as a translational and mechanistic bridge between reductionist and integrative approaches. Identical cohorts will be studied as a function of age on markedly different diets. In Aim 1, we study lifespan using BXD strains and non-inbred but isogenic F1 cohorts of females under high and low fat diets. We map and quantify novel GXE-type modifier loci, candidate genes, and molecular networks that modulate healthspan and longevity. In Aim 2 we generate deep molecular, mitochondrial, and metabolic biomarker data as a function of age and diet. We expect that gene variants and diet will be causally linked to mitochondrial function and to metabolism in key organs and tissues. In Aim 3 we model complex and integrative molecular and cellular networks that define differences in vitality and healthspan. We use sophisticated bioinformatic and statistical frameworks (eQTL analysis, ANOVA, and structural equation modeling). Finally, in Aim 4 we validate and translate networks involved in metabolism, mitochondria, and healthspan. We test candidate genes using gain- and loss-of-function strategies in C. elegans. We evaluate translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by testing for associations in a remarkably well studied cohort of 161,000 postmenopausal women (Women's Health Initiative data sets). The WHI is an ideal translation companion to test effects of diet. This project will (1) identify high impact variants and molecular/metabolic networks involved in metabolic diseases and healthspan, and (2) provide an experimental and predictive systems biology framework that links genotype and environmental factors to disease risk in human populations."
"9265130","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 renewal project aims to explain the neural origins of breathing behavior at the cellular and synaptic level. It advances understanding of the brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), which is acknowledged to be the principal site driving respiration in humans and all terrestrial mammals so far studied. Also, this project examines interneurons of the intermediate reticular formation, adjacent to the preBötC, which may give rise to respiratory premotor neurons. The intellectual driving force for this project is te discovery by the PI's team - and French colleagues - that the key rhythmogenic preBötC interneurons in perinatal mice are derived from embryonic precursors that express transcription factor Dbx1 (i.e., Dbx1 preBötC neurons). This project exploits this new knowledge and by coupling Dbx1 Cre-driver mice with six different flox-STOP reporter strains to perform a spectrum of experiments in vivo and in vitro such as patch-clamp recordings, cell-specific laser ablations with physiological monitoring, and optogenetic manipulations that interrogate network properties. Aim 1 uses juvenile and adult mice (in vivo and in vitro) to examine whether Dbx1 preBötC neurons are rhythmogenic beyond embryonic and neonatal stages of development. Aim 2 uses embryonic and neonatal mice in vitro in conjunction with cell-specific laser ablation methods to test whether preBötC neurons with bursting-pacemaker properties are obligatory for respiratory rhythm generation, offering a fresh approach to a 24-year-old unsolved problem regarding `pacemaker' driven preBötC rhythms. Aim 3 uses perinatal mice in vitro to characterize synaptic interconnections among Dbx1 neurons and quantify the input-output relationship. These experiments elucidate recurrent synaptic excitation in Dbx1 preBötC neurons, which is also putatively rhythmogenic. Aim 4 uses perinatal through adult mice (in vivo and in vitro) to examine whether Dbx1 neurons in the adjacent intermediate reticular formation serve as the first layer of premotor neurons for respiratory movements of the tongue (genioglossus) and pharynx. Dysfunctions in respiratory control circuits cause significant health problems including obstructive and central apneas, as well as respiratory failure and death. These conditions afflict premature infants, children, adults, and patients with neurodegenerative disorders. This project is significant because it characterizes the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that animate the key genetic class of neurons (i.e., Dbx1) at the core of the respiratory oscillator, which represents a transformative advance in our understanding that would inform new prevention and treatment strategies to combat respiratory pathologies. The PI is the ideal scientist for this job because of his track record as a leader in respiratory neurobiology, who - with French colleagues - first characterized the role of Dbx1 neurons in the preBötC and now is poised to further discover their detailed properties and downstream premotor counterparts. If this project succeeds, neuroscience would finally know the cellular and synaptic origins of a significant central pattern- generating circuit in a mammal and the point of origin for an important behavior, breathing."
"9285816","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study tests a comprehensive approach to the promotion of school readiness in low-income families, beginning shortly after the birth of the child, through enhancement of positive parenting practices (and when present, reduction of psychosocial stressors) within the pediatric primary care platform. We do so by integrating two evidence-based interventions: 1) a universal primary prevention strategy (Video Interaction Project [VIP]); 1, 2 and 2) a targeted secondary/tertiary prevention strategy (Family Check-up [FCU]) 3 for families with infants/toddlers identified as having additional risks. VIP provides parents with a developmental specialist who videotapes the parent and child and coaches the parent on effective parenting practices at each pediatric primary care visit. FCU is a home-based, family-centered intervention that utilizes an initial ecologically- focused assessment to promote motivation for parents to change child-rearing behaviors, with follow-up sessions on parenting and factors that compromise parenting quality. Two primary care settings serving low-income communities in New York City, NY and Pittsburgh, PA will be utilized to test our integrated intervention in hospital-based clinics, providing information about translation across venues where one of the two interventions has been previously used alone. Also, we will leverage the practice network developed by an initiative known as Reach Out and Read (ROR), 4 providing an infrastructure for later dissemination. We plan to test the VIP/FCU model in a randomized trial of 500 families (200 to VIP/FCU, 200 to routine care, 100 to VIP alone) utilizing parent surveys, observational data on parent-child interactions, and direct assessments of children's development, at key points during intervention follow-up. Analyses will address questions of program impact for the integrated program across all families and by key subgroups, and the added value of FCU to VIP. The largest single contribution made by this study is to test whether an integrated primary and secondary/tertiary prevention strategy implemented in pediatric primary care can produce impacts on early school readiness outcomes, including social-emotional, pre-academic, and self-regulation. As such, this study has the potential to provide the scientific and practice communities with information about an innovative approach to promoting school readiness skills among low-income children."
"9281663","PROJECT 1 SUMMARY  The willingness of a woman to use a microbicide product has been linked to reduction of dosing frequency and  product convenience and appeal. Vaginal films have been identified to possess a number of attributes which  women find desireable. Combining the discreet and compact nature of this platform with other advantages  such as preceived ease of use, reduced leakage, enhanced drug release, and decreased disturbance of innate  immune barriers, films offer a dosage form which may lead to enhanced patient acceptability and product  efficacy. The feasability of on-demand delivery of pharmacetucial agents to the vagina in a safe and  acceptable manner using a film has been illustrated in two separate clinical trials evaluating a dapivirine film  and a tenofovir film. Human studies of the dapivirine film showed that the vaginal delivery profile was  consistent with gel and ring dosage forms. Further, drug tissue levels for film matched those achieved with  intravaginal ring use which were shown to be associated with protection in an ex vivo challenge assay.  Although the feasiblity of utility of this platform for on-demand applications has been demonstrated, its ability to  be modified for use as an extended release product has yet to be explored. The Project 1 goal is to design a  non-coitally dependent vaginal film for the integrase inhibitor MK-2048 that achieves cervicovaginal  tissue drug levels that are effective against the sexual acquisition of HIV for one week following a  single application. In preliminary studies in the nonhuman primate model, a prototype MK-2048 film was  shown to have the ability to retain significant levels of MK-2048 in the target tissue up to 96 hours post film  administration following two separate acts of coitus. Within Project 1, three strategies will be explored to  develop a weekly administered MK-2048 film. The primary strategy involves modification of film geometry and  excipient composition to extend the release of MK-2048. Within this strategy iterative evaluation of product  retention and release in the NHP model (Core B) will be used to optimize the delivery profile and achievment of  protective levels of MK-2048 in the vagina (Project 2, Core C). The ability to maintain protective levels even in  the context of sex will also be confirmed in this model. The developed film will be scaled up (Project 4) and  evaluated in human clincial trials (Project 3). Additionally within Project 1 alternative nanotechnology based  strategies for extending the window of protection with the film will be explored. Our group has previously used  nanoparticles combined with the film platform to overcome vaginal drug delivery challenges. Nanoparticles  containing MK-2048 will be developed and incorporated into the film platform to provide enhanced tissue  retention and targeting. Finally, a highly novel and innovative approach to increase film retention will be  developed.This strategy is based on the combination of micro/nanopatterns with the film platform to achieve  enhanced vaginal product retention. Successful design of an MK-2048 film which provides an extended  window of protection would offer a convenient option for protection against HIV infection in women."

Two community-based research teams in Los Angeles and New Orleans will screen all intakes at five homeless shelters and gay- identified community based-organizations for 18 months, testing 4500 gay, bisexual and transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and serious drug use, and obtaining self-reports of mental health, health care utilization, and comorbid conditions. From this initial screening, the 1500 youth at highest risk of acquiring HIV and 220 youth living with HIV will be identified and repeatedly assessed at four month intervals over 24 months. Over this time, 36-90 acutely HIV infected youth will be identified and triaged into potent ARV treatment and a multi-component text, social media, and coaching intervention (Study 1). Interventions with seronegative GBTY and HY and youth living with HIV will also be conducted, with each intervention including both Automated Messaging and Monitoring Interventions and either an eNavigator or Coach. The Management Core will ensure quality assurance and monitor automated indices of performance so that the quality of all activities is to the highest scientific standards and consistent with the values and best interests of the communities and youth participating in the U19 studies.  The Management Core will be led by an experienced group of researchers with long histories of productive and cutting-edge findings in adolescent HIV interventions for both seronegative and seropositive youth; experience in the management of large centers, similar to program projects; expertise in acute infections among infants, adolescent medicine, community-based participatory research, STI, and rapid diagnostic tests; and, experience conducting laboratory research across broad distances and executing complex integrated studies on collaborative teams."
"9310143","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many types of decisions that are important in everyday life are driven by the gradual accumulation of evidence favoring one possible outcome over another. The long-term goal of this line of research is to understand how individual brain areas and their interactions process information related to evidence accumulation to reach decisions. Previous work from this laboratory has determined how regions in the brain's cortex encode such information and has determined their temporally precise causal role in a rat model of perceptual decisions. The proposed experiments will study the specific contributions of two subcortical brain areas, the striatum and the superior colliculus, to decision-making. The overall objective of this application is to understand how decision- related information is encoded in each of these areas, whether each representation is required for decision-making, and exactly when during a task trial this information is needed. In addition, we will distinguish the causal roles of neural connections from frontal cortex to each area individually. We will achieve this objective by recording neural activity to examine the moment-by-moment electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation in these subcortical areas and compare them directly to decision variables from behavioral data. Then we will inactivate each of these areas or the projections to them to define whether, and when, such neural activity is required for accumulation of evidence. The contribution is significant because it will resolve several important questions about the flow of information across time and space in this circuit. The approach is innovative because this laboratory has developed tools that allow continuous, single-trial estimates of decision behavior variables along with precisely timed interference with task-relevant signals within and between brain regions. The work proposed in this application will therefore advance knowledge of how the encoding of information and interactions among brain regions lead to decisions. In the long run, we expect this research to produce a detailed understanding of how information flows through this brain circuit to produce decisions."
"9292299","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global epidemic of chronic kidney disease is progressing at an alarming rate. In the United States alone, glomerular kidney diseases affect some 20 million people, and this number has roughly doubled in the last two decades. Indeed, kidney-related diseases are rapidly eluding present treatment options and resources. Thus, it is a high priority to uncover novel therapeutics to treat chronic kidney diseases. Podocytes are specialized cells within the glomerulus that are essential for kidney ultrafiltration. They form fot processes (FPs), highly dynamic actin-based cellular extensions that are connected by slit diaphragms. Most forms of proteinuria and nephrotic syndromes are characterized by the transformation of podocyte FPs into bands of cytoplasm due to dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton (referred to as FP effacement). The work in this proposal is based on our recent identification of the GTPase dynamin as a major regulator of actin dynamics in podocytes. Studies from this laboratory suggest that preservation of dynamin function is sufficient to reverse FP effacement, restore functional podocytes, and ameliorate proteinuria. We have shown that dynamin directly regulates the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. In addition, we have identified small molecule that promotes dynamin oligomerization into rings, which in turn protects the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. We have recently shown that administration of dynamin-specific small molecule reversed FP effacement and ameliorated proteinuria in diverse animal models of chronic kidney diseases. Originally, we focused on the role of dynamin in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. In this grant application we expand our original observation by focusing on the role that dynamin-actin interaction, dynamin oligomerization, and dynamin-specific molecules play in regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endocytosis is a key process in all eukaryotes by which portions of the plasma membrane, along with extracellular material, are internalized. It plays an essential role in regulating signaling pathwas that originate at the plasma membrane. In Specific Aim 1 we investigate the role that dynamin plays in regulating actin-dependent endocytosis in podocytes. In Specific Aim 2 we investigate whether endocytosis plays a role during crosstalk between podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells. In Specific Aim 3 we investigate whether actin-dependent endocytosis plays a role in reversing early signs of glomerular injury such as mesangial matrix expansion and deposition of collagen IV by examining the effects of dynamin-specific small molecules in rodent models of progressive kidney injury."
"9284369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goal of this translational research project is to improve predictions of older driver safety through comprehensive measurements of naturalistic driving over extended time frames in the real world. To date this research project and team have developed extensive tools, including neuropsychological tests, driving simulation, and instrumented vehicles, with distinct advantages for predictions of driver safety. However drivers may behave differently in controlled tests than they do over extended time frames amid the contingencies and risks of the real world. Drivers who are aware of their functional impairments may strategically reduce their exposure to driving risk, while those who lack awareness will not. A greater understanding of real-world driver exposure and awareness is indispensible to predictions of driver safety and development of evidence-based criteria to improve driver awareness, safety, mobility, and quality of life. To tackle these linchpin issues, a multidisciplinary team of experts (in neurology, cognitive science, driver assessment, human factors, measurement, biostatistics, and public policy) will apply advances in sensor and cellular communications technology to meet 4 Specific Aims: (1) Quantify real-world driving behavior through comprehensive naturalistic driving assessments over extended time frames in 120 older drivers who are at increased risk for driving safety errors because of a range of functional impairment associated with aging;(2) Quantify exposure to real-world driving risks; (3) Quantify self-awareness of impairment; and (4) Develop models that incorporate functional and naturalistic driving data to predict subsequent crashes and traffic citations. Real-life driving wil be studied longitudinally using modern instrumentation and telemetry packages providing direct, detailed information on behavior from each driver's own vehicle over two 3-month periods starting one year apart. The grand total of 60 years of real-life driving data provides comprehensive observations of driver strategy, tactics and exposure to road risks not available from any other source. Safety-critical behaviors and errors will be identified through analyses of electronic sensor and video data from each driver's vehicle. The approach, methodologies, and instrumentation are novel to the field of older driver research and in a broad sense. By tackling cognitive and behavioral research in real-world settings, this study will provide unique data on driver exposure and safety errors and advance the NIH priority of performing translational research in neuroscience. Innovative tools and techniques used in this study cycle will provide critical information needed to identify individuals who are at greater risk for impaired driving du to functional impairments, lack of awareness, and lack of compensatory behaviors associated with aging. The information could be used to develop strategies for advising patients and families on fitness to drive, and extend safe mobility through individualized interventions (including situation awareness and hazard avoidance training), in line with the promise of personalized medicine."
"9345159","Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor, and one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Standard surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation fail to eliminate the infiltrative, invasive cancer cells. Median survival remains only ~15 months. Drugs that seek out the disseminated GBM cells behind the blood-brain barrier will prevent the inevitable recurrence in patients. Based on their unique tumor-tropic migration and long- term drug delivery, engineered neural stem cells (NSCs) have shown enormous promise as a new approach to GBM therapy. However, procurement of appropriate cells for NSC- based therapy has been a significant challenge. The ideal NSC would be easily isolated and autologous to avoid immune rejection. To overcome the challenges with isolating autologous NSC from the brain, we discovered that transdifferentiation (TD) creates tumor-homing drug carriers capable of regressing GBM. Using a defined set of transcription factors, we switched the fate of mouse and human skin fibroblasts in induced NSCs (iNSCs) that homed to GBM with the same directionality as brain-derived NSCs. iNSCs genetically engineered to release the cytotoxic gene products dramatically reduced human GBM xenografts in mice and markedly extended median survival. Falcon Therapeutics now proposes to take the critical translational step. The objective of this proposal is to investigate this novel approach to cancer therapy using iNSC-based carriers from GBM cancer patient fibroblasts (iNSCPD). We will explore the following specific aims: 1) Determine if engineered iNSCPD are safe drug carriers that migrate to recurrent human GBM foci; 2) Determine if intracavity iNSCPD therapy is an effective treatment for post-surgical patient-derived GBM. This will be accomplished using a new TD approach we discovered that generates iNSCPD fast enough for clinical GBM therapy. We will use iNSCPD variants we developed that express optical reporters and/or prodrug/enzyme therapies that mimic clinical NSC therapy for GBM. We will employ our unique models of GBM resection/recurrence in mice and transplant iNSCPD on our newly identified clinically- compatible matrices to maximize the clinical relevancy of our findings. Once complete, our studies promise to identify a new approach to autologous NSC therapy that is easily translatable to human patient testing. This will address a critical gap in current NSC-based treatments for GBM, serve as a springboard for the field of iNSC-based carriers to improve cancer treatment, and begin to move this promising therapy towards clinical trials as well as commercialization."
"9378281","With few exceptions, viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) begin in peripheral tissues and then reach the CNS either by hematogenous routes or transport in nerves. This proposal focuses on the first step in the nerve route pathway ? invasion of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The primary emphasis is on alpha herpesviruses that have evolved to enter the PNS efficiently. The overarching questions are why PNS invasion by alpha herpesviruses is so efficient and how do peripheral axons defend themselves against viral invaders. Our recent studies revealed that axonal entry by alpha herpesvirus particles rapidly stimulated new, local protein synthesis to increase efficiency of virus particle retrograde transport to cell bodies. We suggested that axonal infection induces an immediate damage response that increases efficiency of axonal transport. Axons also sense both type I and II interferons (IFN) produced in infected peripheral tissues, resulting in a novel antiviral response (local axonal production of phosphorylated STAT1 after IFNß exposure resulting in reduction of virus particle transport toward the cell bodies). A hallmark of the axonal response to viral infection and IFN exposure is rapid translation of new axonal proteins from repressed axonal mRNAs. Remarkably, infection by herpesviruses, as well as IFN exposure rapidly changes the total axonal proteome and does so before new viral proteins are produced. Our data suggests that the PNS axons not only sense peripheral virus infection. We are interested in the mechanisms of these axonal responses and their virus specificity. We will explore the interplay and specificity between axonal detection and local defensive action. The unique focus of this proposal is on axon biology immediately after virion entry and subsequent transport of distinctive viral/cellular cargos in PNS axons with or without cytokine exposure before viral gene products are made. Our hypotheses are (1) that axons are front-line sensors and responders to diverse viral PNS invasion; (2) they locally sense and respond to entry of different virus particles; and (3) they respond to IFN produced by infected non-neuronal tissues and mount distinct, local antiviral responses. We have developed three technologies to explore these ideas: tri-compartment Campenot chambers to physically isolate axons from their cell bodies; optical imaging technology to follow entry events and subsequent axonal transport of individual virus particles in the presence or absence of IFN; and bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) or Click chemistry and SILAC mass spectrometry approaches to label and quantitate new proteins synthesized immediately in axons after infection or IFN treatment. Understanding the fundamentals of the immediate and local response of PNS axons to incoming virus particles and inflammatory cytokines before any new viral gene products are expressed will lead to a deeper understanding of how the PNS and ultimately the CNS, is protected from infection."
"9389974","Project Abstract  Oral and Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world. The primary management of OSCC relies on complete surgical resection of the tumor. However, the establishment of margin-free resection is often difficult given the devastating side effects of aggressive surgery and the anatomic proximity to vital structures such as the carotid artery and the spinal cord. Positive margin status is associated with significantly decreased survival. Currently, it is the surgeon's fingers that determine where the tumor cuts are made, by palpating the edges of the tumor. Accuracy varies widely based on the experience of the surgeon and the location and type of tumor. Efficacy is further confounded by the risk of damage to adjacent vital structures, which limit resection margins. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate a novel, non-invasive, imaging system based on Dynamic Optical Contrast Imaging (DOCI) that has been developed to differentiate between cancerous and normal tissue intraoperatively using OSCC as the model. The imaging system is based on a novel realization of temporally dependent measurements of tissue autofluorescence that allow the acquisition of specific tissue properties over a large field of view. This system is optimized such that it can be used by surgeons at the time of cancer resection surgery to gather quantitative information on margins of malignancies and has been extensively validated in ex vivo OSCC samples. Companion histology has verified the sensitivity and specificity of the technique. In the proposed work we will reconfigure the imaging system for a large field of view (FOV), then pursue an intraoperative trial where tumors will be imaged prior to resection and wounds beds will be mapped to detect potential residual dysplastic tissue. Companion visible imagery and histology will be analyzed at all stages of the work ensuring statistical diagnostic power of the technique. We hypothesize that the accuracy and efficiency of tumor resection, margin determination and frozen sections will improve significantly when aided by our optical imaging technology. This intraoperative instrument would be the first of its kind, giving us the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity and accuracy of determining true OSCC margins thus enabling the surgeon to save healthy tissue and improve patient outcomes."

"9402004","PROJECT SUMMARY  The majority of heterosexually transmitted HIV-1 infections are initiated by a single genetically distinct virus selected from a diverse population of viruses, or quasispecies, in the transmitting partner. This genetic bottleneck is an active area of research, as elucidation of shared properties among viruses initiating infection, or transmitted/founder viruses (TFVs), could indicate viral transmission requirements to target in vaccine development. However, the longitudinal impact of TFVs in HIV-1 infection and disease has been largely neglected as a subject of study. Our lab demonstrated that the TFV replicative capacity (RC), as determined by the transmitted gag gene, is significantly associated with HIV-1 proviral burden in central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) early in infection. High TFV RC is associated with increased proviral burden in TCM cells, a cell subset implicated as a major component of the viral reservoir, or the population of latently infected cells in which integrated HIV-1 DNA can persist for years even during antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment. Additionally, viral RC correlates with set point viral load, and is predictive of CD4+ T cell decline to 300 cells or fewer for five years following infection, indicating a potential lasting role for the TFV in disease progression and infection. We hypothesize, therefore, that TFV fitness determines HIV-1 DNA burden in CD4+ central memory T cells during ART-naïve infection and impacts the reservoir via persistence of the TFV or similar variants in latently infected cells. We will test this hypothesis in three ways: first we will determine the relationship of TFV replication and HIV-1 DNA load in CD4+ T cells during early and chronic infection of ART-naïve individuals, sampling cells from approximately 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years following infection, as well as shortly prior to ART initiation. Second, we will amplify proviral genes from CD4+ T cells analyzed for HIV-1 DNA burden and viral genes from plasma collected during ART-naïve chronic infection, then determine if the TFV or closely related variants are present. Last, we will amplify and sequence proviruses from cells collected during ART treatment to determine if the TFV or closely related variants persist, then measure the replication of the viruses to determine the relationship of TFV replication and reservoir variant replication. Our unique collaboration with the Zambia- Emory HIV Research Program (ZEHRP), in which partners of HIV-1 serodiscordant couples (one HIV+, one HIV- partner) are counseled to prevent transmission, the negative partner is monitored for seroconversion, and followed longitudinally in the event of infection, will facilitate these studies. Technical challenges of sequencing and cloning TFVs can be met with molecular cloning and next-generation sequencing technologies developed in our lab. This project will contribute to an understanding of the effect of the TFV and its fitness on HIV-1 infection, including the potential for a TFV influence on the replication of proviruses in the reservoir. Identifying such an impact of TFV fitness would signify that the early stages of HIV-1 infection are a target for therapeutic strategies to modulate viral fitness for constraining the reservoir, a major barrier to HIV-1 cure."

"9304282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD13 is a large, multifunctional cell surface peptidase that is constitutively expressed on all lineages of myeloid cells (among others) and upregulated on endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis and inflammation. Collectively, our recent studies demonstrate that CD13 regulates endocytosis of receptors of disparate classes in different cell types to control downstream signal transduction pathways, implicating a role for CD13 in fundamental cellular processes. More recently, we showed that in dendritic cells (DCs) CD13 regulates endocytosis of the toll-like receptor TLR4 which is a critical sentinel of the innate immune response to pathogens via PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and DAMPs (danger associated molecular patterns). Binding of DAMPs to macrophage and DC TLR4 in the absence of CD13 leads to an unbalanced cytokine response and aberrantly high levels of type I interferons (IFNs) due to skewed endocytic-signaling pathways. Although beneficial in anti-viral responses, strong IFN responses clearly exacerbate the patho- genesis of TLR4-binding PAMPs and DAMPs. Furthermore, we have additional evidence implicating CD13 in receptor recycling to the cell surface. To model this in vivo we subjected wild type and CD13null animals to permanent femoral artery dissection, which releases endogenous ligands that TLR4 recognizes as DAMPs. Functionally, CD13null mice have strikingly impaired ambulation and perfusion recovery and more necrosis consistent with impaired healing. Furthermore, cytokine profiles in the ischemic muscle showed markedly increased levels of IFN-ß and IL-10 consistent with our in vitro data and with studies where TLR4 engagement by PAMPs or DAMPs leads to exaggerated pathology suggesting that CD13 regulates the balance between pro-inflammatory and IFN-generating signal transduction in myeloid cells. Furthermore, marrow transplant studies demonstrating that CD13null donor hematopoietic cells are unable to rescue perfusion and function in wild type ischemic muscles validate this notion and highlights the importance of fully understanding the mechanistic basis of this novel regulator. Finally, while it is clear that the individual subsets of myeloid cells of the innate immune response orchestrate subsequent steps in the healing process, their relative contributions and specific roles are largely unknown. Pertinent to this proposal, macrophage and DC TLR4 signaling occurs via both cell surface and endocytic mechanisms supporting discrete regulatory processes and cell-specific roles for these largely uncharacterized pathways in distinct cell types. Therefore, through its regulation of endocytosis, we propose that myeloid CD13 is a functional regulator of innate immunity and dissection of the relative contributions of CD13 expressed on pan-myeloid (lysM-cre) and DCs (CD11c-cre) to these regulatory processes will clearly increase our understanding of myeloid cells in response to ischemia, information essential to the design of strategies to regulate healing by manipulating this novel target."
"9384037","Project Summary  Despite the impressive catalog of mutations amassed from sequencing human breast cancer genomes, most genomes decoded so far derive from early-stage disease, which likely leaves many genetic events driving disease progression undiscovered. Ongoing efforts to decode the more complex genomes from more advanced and drug-resistant breast cancers hold great promise, but the higher mutation burden in these cancers complicates the difficult task of distinguishing causative driver events from innocuous passengers events. Animal models that offer a genome-wide view of the mutations acquired during breast cancer progression can provide cross-species validation crucial for validating candidate driver genes.  Drawing on the breast cancer genomics landscape and our own mouse modeling work, we formulated the hypothesis that breast cancer progression depends on driver mutations acquired in a disease stage- specific manner, obscured by continuously accruing passenger mutations. Based on this hypothesis, we developed the following long-term goal: discover novel drivers of breast cancer progression by performing genetic screens in mouse breast cancer models using timed mobilization of transposons (so-called ?jumping genes?) at discrete disease stages.  In unpublished preliminary studies, we engineered new mouse models for discovering and validating candidate mammary oncogenes. To enable oncogene discovery, we generated an inducible version of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition system, which enables timed transposon mobilization in the mouse breast. We confirmed that this system provides an efficient cancer gene discovery platform by identifying known and novel oncogenes that cooperate with Wnt pathway activation to drive mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. To complement this high-throughput cancer gene discovery platform, we designed a novel strategy for efficiently validating candidate oncogenes and probing their mechanisms of action by monitoring the growth of mammary tissue fragments (organoids) grown in 3D culture. This strategy employs live-cell imaging for quantitative scoring of the oncogene-driven events that culminate in mammary cell overgrowth.  We will address our hypothesis by completing three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, transposon-based gene discovery will be employed in the context of mouse models engineered to express known breast cancer- relevant oncogenes. Our goal is to identify novel candidate genes that drive the transition from mammary hyperplasia to focal mammary cancer. In Aim 2, delayed transposon mobilization will be initiated within established mammary cancers arising in the classic MMTV-Neu breast cancer model. Our goal is to identify candidate genes that drive resistance to Lapatinib, a clinically important drug that blocks Her2/Neu signaling. In Aim 3, we will optimize our live-cell imaging platform and apply it to test whether and how candidate cancer genes confer malignant capabilities to mammary cells grown in 3D culture."
"9274971","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the Chairman's grant proposal for the Convergence insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a randomized, placebo controlled, clinical trial designed to test the effects of convergence insufficiency (CI) treatment on measures of reading performance and attention. In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic CI will be randomly assigned to: 1) office- based vergence/accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy with home reinforcement. After 16 weeks of treatment, examiners masked to treatment group assignment will administer the primary outcome measures for: 1) reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest and 2) attention (Strengths & Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]). The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Other secondary outcome measures include: a test of reading fluency (WIATT III), the SNAP test of attention, the CI Symptom Survey, clinical measures of CI (i.e., near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near), and assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension (pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension). Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention will be assessed 1-year post treatment. This Chairman's grant proposal provides the significance, innovation, and approach for the clinical trial including the results of preliminary studies, and the budget for th Study Chairman's office and functions. Accompanying documents include the CITT-ART Manuals of Procedures, and grant proposals from the CITT-ART Data Coordinating Center and 9 participating Clinical Centers. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Symptomatic CI is a common childhood vision disorder frequently associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of CI treatment on reading and attention is unknown. Results from the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, eye professionals, and other health care providers who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9330514","Pilot & Feasibility Program (P&F): Project Summary/Abstract The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) program has funded 121 projects (including 2016) since its inception in 1978. This program has been extremely valuable and effective by providing monies for the support of diabetes- related projects. The goal of the program is to support small research projects by new investigators (who have little or no independent research support) or established investigators who are turning to diabetes research for the first time. The vast majority of the proposals are in the former category. Three new projects are normally initiated each year. After a university-wide solicitation of proposals, four individuals (two internal and two external to the institution) review each grant. The critiques of the proposal are evaluated by the P&F Review Committee (equivalent to an NIH study section), and each proposal is assigned a priority score. The proposals and priority scores are then presented to the DRTC Executive Committee (equivalent to the NIH Council) for a funding decision. Support for a second year of research is awarded when satisfactory work is completed in year one and if support for the projects has not been obtained in the interim. The success rate of this program, measured either by the number of investigators who remain involved in diabetes research, or who convert their P&F into a nationally awarded, peer-reviewed grant, is high (33% of grants funded from 2012-2016 (5 of 15). In addition, this program funds applications from a wide variety of departments within the institution. For example, faculty members from Departments of Medicine, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Pharmacology, Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Anesthesiology, Pediatrics, and Chemistry were funded over the past five years. The P&F program also provides visibility for the VDRTC within the Vanderbilt scientific community and thus makes the scientific community more aware of the VDRTC, its research efforts, and its core facilities. The importance and effectiveness of the VDRTC P&F program is underscored by the decision of the VUMC leadership to provide additional P&F funds ($100K/year) for this program in the next funding cycle."
"9402868","Project Summary/Abstract Our mission in this program is to bring highly quantitative and high-content experimental and computational approaches to study the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system, focusing on cartilage, bone and synovium. The musculoskeletal disease focus is post-traumatic osteoarthritis, an all too common condition initiated in otherwise healthy (young to middle-aged) individuals who suffer a joint injury. The interactions between cartilage, bone and synovium in human joints are critically important for joint function and human motion on earth and in long-term space flight. Upon traumatic joint injury, there is an immediate upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in the synovial fluid that are secreted primarily by cells in the synovial membrane. When combined with mechanical trauma to cartilage accompanying joint injury, degradation of cartilage as well as subchondral bone often progresses to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. To study these interactions and how they may be ameliorated both on earth and in space, we propose to co-culture primary human explants of intact (native) cartilage, bone and synovial joint capsule tissue (obtained from a long-standing collaborating human donor bank). We will then test the effects of selected pharmacological agents (e.g., the anti-catabolic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, and an anti-bone resorptive anti-sclerostin antibody, to prevent bone loss) to ameliorate tissue degradative processes. To perform these studies, our Aims are to validate an MPS model using osteochondral plugs co-cultured with joint capsule synovium, to challenge this model with inflammatory cytokines and an initial impact injury (associated with the early phases of post-traumatic OA), treat these challenged co-cultures with selected pharmacological agents on earth and in the international space station, and to address issues of patient stratification for treatment strategies, human donor variability, and response to therapeutics via biomarker discovery. Endpoint analyses include intracellular and extracellular biomarkers assessed using quantitative metabolomics and multiplexed protein release analyses. In addition, we will test the possibility that an optimized mechanical loading protocol on earth, post-flight, could have specific pro- anabolic and anti-catabolic effects on osteochondral tissues and a suppression of inflammatory cytokines from the synovium.  "

The first component, designated the Core Pilot Program will distribute $150k/yr in seed monies for high-merit pilot studies. This program (open to all Center and Institute investigators) will enhance mentorship, aid junior investigators, and stimulate collaborative, innovative science and enhance the value of our existing COBRE core facilities. The selection of funded projects will be based on scientific merit and prioritized using the following criteria: a] Projects should be collaborative, with a co-investigator structure that enhances scientific interactions, b] When feasible, one co applicant should be a junior investigator, c] To enhance multi-disciplinary research projects, applicants may partner with colleagues at MMCRI and/or external collaborators with expertise from other IDeA institutions, d] Aims must be sharply focused, relate to Center goals, and lead to new technologies or methodological advances as related to core facilities, e] Projects should have a budget of -$50,000, well-defined milestones, and be accomplished within 1-year, f] For projects that utilize human subjects and/or vertebrate animals, prior investigator training and institutional IRB or lACUC approval is required. The second, or Translational Pilot Program component will focus sharply on enhancing the capabilities of our Center and Institute to conduct translational TI research. In part, this is driven by an exciting opportunity to advance the activities of a senior translational scientist soon to be recruited to our Center and MMC/RI. Here, COBRE funds will be used initially (up to $100K/yr, years 11-13) to bolster major institutional support for the development of a Translational Therapeutic Laboratory that will provide patient-based assay services, assist in patient selection for clinical trials, and providing tools for therapeutic monitoring. Funds specifically will be used to support services, supplies, and research technician costs. Subsequently, in years 14 & 15, funds (up to 100 K/yr) will be competitively awarded specifically for translational pilot projects whereby Center investigators partner with their clinical counterparts again in a highly collaborative manner."

To introduce new educational programs to maximize Scholars' ability to benefit from emerging new  technology and resources, including ones focused on providing competencies in: a) Engaging  communities to insure that patients' and communities' priorities are in incorporated into all phases of  protocol development and research conduct b) Developing ontology-driven human phenotyping, c)  Querying Big Data Electronic Health Record warehouses to test hypotheses across the translational  spectrum, and d) Rapidly and efficiently moving ?From Discovery to Health-Enhancing Products.? To accomplish these specific aims we developed a 3 year Master's degree KL2 Clinical Scholars Program in which Scholars design, conduct, analyze, and disseminate the results of a human subjects protocol under the guidance of a distinguished senior scientific mentor. This experiential core component is complemented: by a didactic curriculum including tutorials in Clinical and Translational Science, Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Epidemiology; a weekly Clinical Research Seminar by outstanding translational investigators; a private weekly meeting with the seminar speaker; team science training; a graduate level scientific course; Humanities and Translational Science special events; and training in the Responsible Conduct of Research. To maintain the optimal size of ~15 trainees we complement the Scholars supported by the KL2 program with Scholars supported by University resources. In the upcoming award period we will build on this program by adding new components to strengthen the ability of the Scholars to: engage communities as full partners throughout the entire protocol cycle, from development to dissemination and implementation; develop phenotyping instruments that are backed by ontologies to enhance genotype-phenotype analyses; query large databases of Electronic Health Records to test scientific hypotheses; and develop their laboratory discoveries into products that improve human health. We will collect detailed metrics on each component of the program to drive improvements and we will track the future progress of the graduates of the program with the on-line Graduate Tracking Survey System we developed, which has been adopted by more than 20 other CTSA hubs."
"9349422","Project Summary/Abstract: While research efforts to develop highly-active antiretroviral therapy have greatly extended healthy lifespan for HIV-1 infected individuals receiving treatment, the virus poses unique challenges for the development of a long-sought after cure. Part of the viral lifecycle involves the permanent insertion of the HIV genome into a host cell's genetic material, establishing a long term population of HIV infected cells. New strategies to prevent spread from these cells must be developed. Unlike currently available antiviral drugs, anti-HIV gene therapy holds the potential for the treatment and even cure of HIV-1 infection. The gene therapy-mediated knockout of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 in HIV susceptible cells has shown potential in greatly reducing HIV viral loads in both mouse models of HIV disease and early phase human clinical trials. Surprisingly, in rare trial participants, this drop in viral load is sustained even when antiretroviral drug therapy is halted. However, all current anti-HIV gene therapy strategies rely on the separation and ex vivo manipulation of HIV susceptible cells, followed by re-infusion of these newly HIV-resistant cells back into patients. This approach requires access to advanced cell culture and bone marrow transplant facilities and is currently prohibitively expensive for the majority of HIV infected individuals living where the HIV epidemic continues to worsen. To address these technical, economic, and biological challenges, new approaches to inexpensive gene therapy must be developed. CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are an attractive target for gene therapy, given their status as predecessors to all cells susceptible to HIV. However, these cells have shown resistance to genetic modification by currently available lentiviral vectors. In new data introduced in this application, I demonstrate previously unforeseen levels of gene delivery to CD34+ HSPCs in vitro, achieved by pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the measles virus hemagglutinin and fusion glycoproteins. Mechanistic insights from this work has guided mutagenesis of vesicular-stomatitis virus glycoproteins which will be used to identify restriction factors in CD34+ HSPCs. In this application, I propose using these novel lentiviral vectors to evaluate the potential of in vivo transduction as a potential anti-HIV strategy, using a humanized mouse model of HIV infection. By direct intrafemoral injection of lentiviral vectors carrying the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting CCR5, I will evaluate if this approach can achieve sufficiently high levels of gene knockout to protect from HIV challenge. If successful, this approach holds the potential to radically reduce the cost and technical difficulty of anti-HIV gene therapy."
"9372505","Project Summary/Abstract Influenza A virus (IAV) is an acute, cytopathic virus that infects a range of different cell types, but principally lung epithelial cells. Viral infection causes extensive damage to both the proximal and alveolar airways. Because virus growth is highly cytolytic in cell culture, and the virus is completely eliminated from the host by the adaptive immune system, it has long been believed that no infected cells are able to survive direct IAV infection. A derivative of this assumption is that the virus is incapable of influencing the host after the resolution of viral infection. I recently developed a Cre recombinase-expressing IAV, which allowed me to permanently label every infected cell and follow their fates. With this virus and transgenic reporter mouse lines, I identified a population of epithelial club cells that survived direct and productive viral infection. Not only can these cells eliminate all traces of the virus and survive, but further characterization of these cells revealed that the cells acquire an altered, and generally inflammatory, transcriptional profile after surviving. Specific depletion of these cells enhanced epithelial regeneration, indicating that survivor cells delay lung repair after the resolution of viral infection. The implication of my preliminary data is that IAV infection leads to the generation of a population of transcriptionally reprogrammed survivor cells that have important inhibitory roles in lung repair. To the best of my knowledge, the contribution of survivor cell populations to lung repair has never been studied. In this proposal, I will assay how the strain specificity of IAV influences the numbers of surviving club cells in vivo. I will then define how survivor cells influence uninfected basal/progenitor cell behavior as well as track the fates of survivor club cells during lung repair. I will specifically evaluate the effects of surviving club cells on the repair of both the larger and alveolar epithelium. The proposed work will explore a completely unstudied regulator of lung repair, and may identify novel mechanisms to therapeutically enhance epithelial regeneration after viral infections.  "
"9285782","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic islet transplantation (Tx) has a lifesaving potential for Type 1 diabetes patients. However, even with introduction of the immunosuppressive regimen known as Edmonton Protocol, insulin independence was only transient in most recipients due to significant islet loss that starts early after the procedure. Allogeneic immune rejection, one of the major reasons for islet death, requires permanent use of immunosuppressive drugs, which are toxic to islets and cause serious side effects including cancer and infection. Moreover, in addition to its significant short and long-term side effects, there is direct evidence that immunosuppression leads to reemergence of autoreactivity, the condition that Tx is supposed to treat. New strategies to reduce the dose of immunosuppression by providing alternative defense approaches to transplanted islets are urgently needed. RNA interference is a technique that offers great potential for therapeutic gene silencing and could be employed for improving islet graft resistance to damaging factors after transplantation. We have previously demonstrated the utility of siRNA-conjugated iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticle (MN) probes for siRNA delivery to pancreatic islets prior to transplantation in immunodeficient rodents. siRNA directed towards genes responsible for islet damage silenced these genes and provided islet protection prior to transplantation. By the use of a magnetic reporter, labeled pancreatic islets could be monitored after transplantation by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These preliminary studies in rodents showed significant improvement in graft outcome after the silencing of genes responsible for apoptosis and immune rejection. In this application we propose to extend these studies to the next level and investigate the effectiveness of MN-siRNA in a pre- clinical immunocompetent non-human primate model of islet transplantation. The experimental design will include synthesis of the MN-siRNA probes targeting caspase-3, caspase-8, Fas and beta2-microglobulin genes, which will then be incubated with pancreatic islets. This will lead to mRNA silencing and simultaneous magnetic labeling of islet cells. Allogeneic islets pre-incubated with these MN-siRNA probe(s) will be transplanted into diabetic baboons that will be monitored long-term using magnetic resonance imaging while tapering immunosupression. In vivo MRI will allow us to follow graft outcome and compare it with non- manipulated control grafts. We anticipate that siRNA treatment of the islets will allow for significant improvement in long-term graft outcome and reduction of the effective dose of immunosupressants. Due to the module design of the nanoparticles siRNA molecules to additional targets can be introduced if necessary."
"9298533","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related neurodegenerative disorder defined by the deposition of ?-amyloid (A?) peptides which are generated from processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations or gene duplication of APP are causal for a subset of early onset AD, establishing its central role in AD pathogenesis. However, the vast majority of AD cases are late onset in which advanced age and the ?4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene are established risk factors. Age is associated with many changes, one of them is adult neurogenesis, a process that generates functional neurons throughout life but its ability declines with age. Impaired adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been implicated in learning and memory decline associated with aging and in AD. Interestingly, ApoE has been shown to play multiple roles in adult hippocampal neurogenesis through both cell-autonomous and non cell-autonomous mechanisms the latter requires GABAergic interneurons and is differentially influenced by the ApoE3 and ApoE4 isoforms. Using various APP genetic mutants we created during the current funding cycle and as part of our long-standing research in understanding the APP pathophysiology, we uncovered a potent role of APP in mediating adult hippocampal neurogenesis and, remarkably, many of the phenotypes observed in APP mutant mice resemble those of ApoE mutants. The overarching goals of the renewal application are to decipher the cellular mechanisms of APP in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, to investigate the genetic and functional interactions of APP and ApoE, and to evaluate the effects of APP gene dosage and A? on APP/ApoE-mediated adult neurogenesis using the APP YAC genomic transgenic mice. These mice will allow us to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms since both APP gene duplication and mutation are causal for AD. This proposal is highly innovative and significant in that it brings APP and ApoE, molecules that play critical roles in familial early-onset and sporadic late-onset of AD, togethe and addresses a question that's directly relevant to aging and Alzheimer's disease."
"9346378","ABSTRACT  Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most widely recognized occupational health conditions. Domestically, the condition affects 3-6% of adults. According to a 2008 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, CTS is associated with the second longest average time away from work (28 days) of all major disabling diseases and illnesses in all private industries. The cumulative economic cost is in excess of $2 billion annually, making this the most expensive peripheral neuropathy in the United States.  Currently, carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery is indicated in almost all patients with moderate to severe CTS. CTR surgery involves division of the transverse carpal ligament (TCL). This surgery reduces pressure on the median nerve by increasing the volume of the carpal tunnel. Unfortunately, surgery is invasive and has a large incidence of symptom recurrence and morbidity. Up to 30% of CTR surgery patients report poor to fair strength and long-term discomfort, and 57% have recurrence of some pre-operative symptoms beginning an average of two years after surgery. In recent years, brace-like ligament tensioning devices that attempt to emulate the effects of surgery have emerged, but these devices have had limited success due to the uncomfortable high forces required to manipulate ligament tissues and the lack of compliance due to their obtrusive design.  A novel approach to providing long-duration tensioning to carpal tunnel ligaments without reliance on excessive force and/or cumbersome design would be highly desirable as an alternative to CTR surgery. This Phase II SBIR project will continue development of a Carpal Tunnel Tissue Manipulation Device (CTMD) that uses negative pressure to relieve compression on the median nerve without excessive force or cumbersome designs. Unlike the majority of traditional and dynamic splints, the proposed device allows for free movement of the wrist with minimal impediment during daily activities. Our self-funded Phase I efforts involved multiple design iterations until a working prototype was ready for a clinical trial. We then evaluated 4 weeks of CTMD treatment in 11 patients with mild to severe CTS. The study showed that the CTMD reduced CTS symptoms at the end of treatment (4 weeks) and improvement continued or was maintained 2 months after treatment, as determined by the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) Symptom Severity Scale (SSS).  In this project, the CTMD prototype will be refined to fit more people and will be validated in a larger, longer clinical trial. In Aim 1, PPS will finely tune the design specifications of the CTMD to fit more patients with input from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pressure profile measurements in humans and cadavers. In Aim 2, the new design will be investigated in a 140-subject, multi-site, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial that compares the CTMD to a placebo control. Ultimately, this device could provide a noninvasive, simple and easy-to-use, low-cost alternative to surgery for the millions that suffer from CTS."
"9275959","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The obesity pandemic brings with it multiple attendant metabolic comorbidities, including Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Both T2D and NAFLD are inadequately treated with currently available therapy; although multiple medications are approved for T2D, few address the underlying problem-insulin resistance. In addition, no medications are approved for NAFLD, the leading cause of chronic liver disease and fastest-growing reason for liver transplantation. Clearly, a wider net for potential therapeutics must be cast in order to stem the tide of obesity-related illness. Notch is a highly conserved family of proteins critical for cell fate decision-making, but less is known about Notch action in mature tissue. We showed that Notch signaling is present at low levels in normal physiologic conditions, but increases markedly in livers from diet-induced or genetic mouse models of obesity, and similarly in obese patients with T2D or NAFLD. As Notch has been shown to interact with FoxO1, the key transcriptional regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and mTORC1, which regulates insulin-mediated lipogenesis, we hypothesized that Notch plays an active role in physiologic and pathologic glucose and lipid metabolism. We generated mice lacking hepatocyte Notch signaling- these mice, when challenged with high- fat diet feeding, showed improved glucose tolerance and a parallel decrease in hepatic steatosis. In proof-of- principle studies, we found that Notch inhibitor treatment of obese mice recapitulated our genetic loss-of- function model, suggesting Notch may be both a mechanistic node in obesity-related pathology as well as a bona fide therapeutic target. In this application, we will examine the mechanisms underlying activation of hepatic Notch signaling and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for obesity-induced metabolic complications. In Aim 1, we will determine how hepatocyte Notch signaling integrates with the insulin/FoxO1 and nutrient/mTORC1 pathways to modulate hepatic insulin sensitivity and triglyceride levels. In Aim 2, we study the mechanism by which Notch stabilizes and activates mTORC1. In Aim 3, we will study how the Notch signal is transduced - i.e., by what ligand, expressed by which cell type in the liver - and determine whether we can exploit this knowledge to design safe and specific Notch inhibitors for treatment of metabolic disease. Successful completion of this application will identify the underlying mechanism of inappropriate Notch signaling in obesity, as well as potentially repurpose existing Notch inhibitors for treatment of insulin resistance/T2D and NAFLD."
"9256598","Project Summary/Abstract Mature astrocytes are arguably the most morphologically complex cells in the central nervous system. This complexity is associated with several of the most well characterized functions of this cell type, including neurotransmitter reuptake, K+ homeostasis, and blood-brain barrier maintenance. While we know the developmental time window when astrocyte morphological maturation and refinement occurs, we know little else about this process. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical growth factor secreted largely by neurons and involved in the development and maturation of neurons, including neuronal growth and synapse refinement. Preliminary data we have generated for this grant demonstrates that astrocytes express high levels of the BDNF receptor TrkB when compared to neurons. In particular, the truncated version of TrkB, TrkB.T1 is the predominate receptor expressed. TrkB.T1 expression is highest in astrocytes during the critical period of astrocyte morphological refinement and maturation, a developmental time window which also happens to coincide with highest neuronal BDNF expression levels. Loss of BDNF expression is a hallmark of neurodevelopment disorder Rett Syndrome, and recent publications indicate that astrocytes have a significantly reduced morphological complexity and are dysfunctional in this disease. These findings have led us to the hypothesis that BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling is an important mediator of astrocyte morphological maturation and that reduced neuronal BDNF expression contributes to astrocyte dysfunction by modulating astrocyte morphology in Rett Syndrome. We propose to examine BDNF?s influence on astrocyte morphology utilizing a combination of in vitro and in vivo molecular, genetic, and imaging techniques. Additionally, we will examine if reduced BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling contribute to aberrant astrocyte morphology in Rett syndrome which may shed light on how astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of this devastating disease."
"9326999","Abstract  Ion transfer across biological membranes is central to nerve excitation, muscle cell contraction, signal transduction, and hormone secretion. Ion channels play a vital role by providing a passageway ? the ion conduction pore ? within membranes to allow specific ions to traverse down their electrochemical gradient. The immense physiological importance of ion channels is reflected in the fact that their dysfunction underlies a variety of disabling human diseases including seizures, deafness, ataxia, long QT syndrome, and cardiac arrhythmias.  There is a long history of physiological work and a large body of functional and structural data on tetrameric cation channels that are localized to the plasma membrane, including the K+, Ca2+, Na+, TRP and cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. However, relatively little is known about organellar cation channels, partly because of the difficulty in directly measuring their activities in organellar membranes. Currently, there is an emerging research interest in the recently defined two-pore channels (TPCs) due to their importance in endo/lysosome physiology. In human and animals, TPC channels regulate the ionic homeostasis and pH within lysosomes, set the lysosomal membrane potential and excitability, and may also regulate the lysosomal Ca2+ release. Therefore, TPC channel functions directly or indirectly affect lysosome-mediated processes such as cellular degradation as well as catabolite export and trafficking, and defects of these processes can result in lysosomal storage diseases. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of TPC channel functions will provide basic, fundamental knowledge about many TPC-related lysosomal activities and diseases.  My laboratory has a longstanding interest in studying the structural basis of ion selectivity and gating, the two fundamental properties of tetrameric cation channels. Our studies over the last funding period have been focused specifically on deciphering the ion selectivity properties in K+ and CNG channels using the prokaryotic non-selective NaK channel from Bacillus cereus as a model system. In this proposal, we plan to expand our research to eukaryotic organellar TPC channels. More specifically, our proposed research will center on a plant vacuolar TPC1 channel from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtTPC1, which is a non-selective cation channel regulated by both membrane potential and Ca2+, whose structure was determined recently in my lab. A combined approach of protein crystallography and electrophysiology will be employed in the proposed studies."
"9404174","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a training program currently in its ninth year, and proposes to continue the support of four predoctoral and four postdoctoral fellows per year, with each fellow receiving two years of training. This training program is directed by Dr. Edward P. Riley of San Diego State University (SDSU) and co-directed by Dr. Sandra A. Brown from the University of California San Diego (UCSD). The training faculty consists primarily of individuals affiliated with the SDSU/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program (JDP) in Clinical Psychology. The JDP provides a unique opportunity for the training of doctoral students in the Science/Practitioner (Boulder) model and recently has been ranked the #1 Clinical Psychology program in the U.S. by the Chronicle of Higher Education. The program is guided by the conviction that a solid foundation in the science of psychology is essential for the modern clinical psychologist. Further, a rigorous scientific core, including the commitment to empirically based knowledge and the development of research skills, is regarded to be fundamental in educating clinical psychologists. Finally, given that trainees acquire both scientific and clinical skills, this model is consistent with the NIH goal of translating research o the clinic. The environment for this training at both SDSU and UCSD is rich with resources, skilled mentors, ample research funding, and a collegial atmosphere that encourages collaborative studies. The training program is designed to prepare fellows for careers in academic settings with specialization in the alcohol research field. The specific training encompasses a broad range of alcohol-related research, including areas such as adolescent alcohol use, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and genetic influences on alcohol sensitivity. Predoctoral students receive didactic training in the behavioral sciences and in alcohol and substance abuse. In the first year, students receive a varied research experience and then focus on a particular aspect of alcohol research where collaboration is encouraged. The postdoctoral fellows receive similar types of varied training with a more individualized approach, tailored to their needs and expectations within the broad field of alcohol research. Since our training program began in 2002, we have undergone constant refinement and will continue to do so in order meet the needs of our trainees and of the field. However, our trainees are making their way in the academic world with considerable success and we are pleased at the progress we have made during the past nine years. Their experience as a fellow on this T32 has provided the trainees with the scientific discipline necessary to be successful academic researchers and the clinical skills to ask applicable and relevant questions regarding alcohol abuse and alcoholism."
"9293180","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of older Americans experience cognitive declines as they age. Millions of older adults have sensory deficits that affect more than one sense. The focus to date on sensory decline, however, has been almost exclusively placed on simple clinical measures of threshold sensitivity in each sense. Based on our recently completed work, there is reason to believe that measures of temporal processing may be more sensitive to the effects of aging than measures of threshold sensitivity. In addition, our emerging model demonstrates that temporal processing in multiple senses is strongly associated with cognitive function (regardless of age). Our laboratory has developed an unprecedented cross-sectional data set on various aspects of temporal processing, from temporal acuity to temporal-order identification in three senses: hearing, vision, and touch. For the main baseline data set, data are available from 195 middle-aged and older adults tested on 34 sensory-processing measures using reliable, rigorous psychophysical methods. These data have permitted analysis and modeling of individual differences in performance within and across age groups; analyses that have heretofore not been possible. Age-group differences between young and older adults were also examined and were nearly universal among the set of 34 temporal-processing dependent measures included in our study. Although supportive of likely age-related changes in temporal processing, these changes require confirmation with longitudinal data on temporal processing. The gathering of such data from 195 middle-aged and older adults at 7 and 10 years following completion of the initial set of baseline measures represents the specific aim of the proposed project. In addition, there may be cognitive-health consequences for those middle-aged and older adults who exhibit poor temporal acuity and temporal-order identification in multiple senses. Individuals who exhibited this pattern of performance in the baseline cohort of 195 middle-aged and older adults, for example, had worse cognitive function. The greater the number of sensory processes impaired, the greater the cognitive decline. The longitudinal data to be gathered here will provide fundamental new knowledge about age-related sensory decline and also determine whether declines in sensory processing precede cognitive declines in older adults as hypothesized. If this hypothesis is confirmed, these findings could prove critical to the early diagnosis of cognitive decline in older adults and, ultimately, may lead to new approaches to intervention as well."
"9263854","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project summary: Substance abuse and sleep disorders are both common problems in the United States and around the world. In the US alone, over 20 million people suffer from substance abuse and/or sleep disorders. Similar to the general US population, sleep disorders and substance use are common in veterans (Newsletter of the National Office of Drug Control Policy, 2010), with populations such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibiting especially high rates. Furthermore, sleep disorders/difficulties are often co-morbid with substance abuse (Shibley et al., 2008; Gromov and Gromov, 2009). Sleep disturbances have been demonstrated during active drug use, during withdrawal, and during abstinence periods (Morgan et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2008). There is abundant evidence that sleep disruption in humans is a robust predictor of relapse (Brower et al., 2001) and difficulty sleeping is often cited as a reason for substance use (Brower et al., 2001). However, there have been few attempts to directly assess whether sleep loss has a causal role in future drug use. One basic, and as of yet unanswered, question is whether sleep loss augments the appetitive value a drug. In the current proposal, the hypothesis that sleep deprivation enhances the rewarding properties of cocaine will be tested using the conditioned place preference (CPP) task. The CPP task assesses cue-induced drug seeking following conditioning trials to a presumed appetitive (cocaine) and a presumed neutral (saline) stimulus. Mice will undergo short periods of sleep deprivation either prior to cocaine conditioning trials or prior to the probe trial to test whether sleep deprivation alters cocaine conditioned place preference acquisition or expression, respectively. Preliminary evidence suggests that sleep deprivation does increase preference for the cocaine-paired context. Finally, two neuromodulator systems, adenosine and orexin, will be probed as possible mechanisms by which sleep, or loss thereof, could impact reward behavior. These two systems have previously been implicated in both sleep/waking activity and addiction. Behavioral, genetic, and pharmacological techniques will be used to carry out the proposed experiments. The project mentors provide expertise in all the fields relevant to the research project, including sleep/waking behavior (Greene, Yanagisawa), addiction research (Self), and the adenosine (Greene) and orexin (Yanagisawa) systems."
"9392247","Project Summary: Cancer cell metabolism comprises of a number of aberrantly regulated metabolic pathways including lipid synthesis (lipogenesis), glycolysis (the Warburg Effect). While prostate cancer PCa) cells do not exhibit elevated glucose uptake, a characteristic of the Warburg effect, they do feature elevated glycolysis and lipogenesis enzyme expression. Also whereas normal cells obtain lipids primarily from exogenous sources PCa cells depend on de novo lipid synthesis. Importantly, elevated glycolysis and lipogenesis enzyme expression drive metabolite production for nucleotide, protein and lipid production, which facilitate cell proliferation, energy production, intracellular signaling and immune evasion. Importantly lipogenesis and aberrant glycolysis enzyme expression have been identified, as bona-fide mediators of PCa etiology and invasiveness, therefore targeted disruption of these pathways are a potential treatment approach for PCa. A number of inhibitors have been developed to target cancer metabolism. Unfortunately these inhibitors have poor efficacy and have associated toxic side effects including severe weight-loss and anorexia in rodent cancer models. As a result there are currently no treatments for PCa that target oncogenic metabolism currently used in the clinic. PCa treatments that focus on blocking androgen receptor activity and cell division have not been able to extend patient lifespan substantially. This is due to PCa cells adapting and continuing to grow and invade other tissues by ?rewiring? androgen receptor signaling and bypassing targeted cellular pathways. Metastatic, castration resistant PCa is responsible for all PCa deaths. Therefore our objective is to develop a cancer metabolism inhibitor that is effective, safe and will be able to replace, supplement or enhance current treatments. We hypothesized that suppression of the transcriptional activity of the liver-X-receptor (LXR); a master regulator of expression of multiple glycolysis and lipogenesis genes could be a potent means of inhibiting cancer metabolism. Therefore we designed a LXR inverse agonist: SR9243 that suppresses LXR transcriptional activity. SR9243 significantly blocks the Warburg effect and lipogenesis and is able to disrupt PCa cell growth without producing weight loss or other undesired side effects. To investigate whether LXR inverse agonism, using SR9243, is a useful treatment approach for PCa we will address 2 specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will test the efficacy of SR9243 against PCa tumors in a PCa orthotopic primary tumor model and a metastatic model. Specific Aim 2 will investigate whether SR9243 is able to enhance the efficacy of currently used PCa treatments when used in combination using a patient derived xenograft model of PCa. This study should generate a novel treatment approach for PCa and will lay the foundation for future projects aimed at exploring the mechanistic role of LXR transcriptional activity in PCa metabolism."

"9285780","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to establish quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) as an objective, accurate, precise, and widely available method for diagnosis and grading of hepatic steatosis in the over 100 million persons in the United States and over one billion persons worldwide with or at risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The immediate goal of our research is to refine and prospectively validate QUS technology to diagnose and grade hepatic steatosis in NAFLD. As part of this validation and as supported by our preliminary studies, we will show that QUS is superior to conventional ultrasonography (CUS), the current most commonly used modality, for diagnosis and grading. To achieve this goal, we propose a prospective, cross-sectional clinical study in adult patients undergoing contemporaneous clinical-care liver biopsy for evaluation of suspected NAFLD or re-assessment of previously diagnosed NAFLD. Patients will undergo same-day QUS and CUS research examinations within 60 days of percutaneous liver biopsy; liver biopsies will be scored histologically for presence and grade of hepatic steatosis. Subsets of patients will undergo repeated QUS and CUS examinations on the same day or on different days, sometimes varying either sonographer or scanner. In parallel with the clinical study, the QUS technology will be tailored for adult liver to refine and thus improve accuracy and precision of QUS parameters. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that QUS is superior to CUS for diagnosis and grading of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD. The study has the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Accuracy for diagnosing hepatic steatosis. Hypothesis: QUS is more accurate than CUS for diagnosing the presence of hepatic steatosis in adult patients with suspected or known NAFLD, using contemporaneous liver biopsy and centrally scored histology as reference. Patient acquisition and data analysis factors that affect diagnostic accuracy of QUS and CUS will be examined. Specific Aim 2. Accuracy for grading hepatic steatosis. Hypothesis: QUS is more accurate than CUS for grading the degree of hepatic steatosis in adult patients with suspected or known NAFLD, using contemporaneous liver biopsy and centrally scored histology as reference. Patient acquisition and data analysis factors that affect grading accuracy of QUS and CUS will be examined. Specific Aim 3. Repeatability-reproducibility. Hypothesis: QUS provides higher (a) same-day repeatability, (b) between-day repeatability, (c) inter-sonographer reproducibility, and (d) inter-scanner-manufacturer reproducibility than CUS in adult patients with suspected or known NAFLD. Patient acquisition and data analysis factors that affect repeatability-reproducibility of QUS and CUS will be examined."
"9293298","Dys-regulation of the body's internal circadian time-keeping mechanism is an established risk factor for metabolic disease. Chronotype, or sleep-timing preference during the 24 hour day, is a behavioral manifestation of underlying circadian rhythms that can be assessed by questionnaires in large populations. Chronotype is heritable and from large-scale GWAS, robust underlying genetic variants implicating circadian and other pathways have been found, providing opportunities to understand the biological causes and consequences of circadian rhythm disturbances on human physiology. We hypothesize that identification of causal variants underlying genetic associations, characterization of the molecular, cellular and physiologic function of culprit mutations and genes, and dissection of causal genetic relationships between chronotype variants and metabolic disease using computational and experimental approaches will help illuminate the role of chronotype in health, obesity and risk of type 2 diabetes. In order to test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To identify causal variants underlying known genome-wide significant and newly discovered chronotype loci using large publicly available genotype and self-reported chronotype (n~500k) and objective sleep timing information (n~100k); 2) To determine the molecular, cellular and physiologic effects of causal variants and genes in human models using analyses of existing resources, experimental assays and unique controlled in-laboratory sample collections; and 3) To systematically evaluate the polygenic overlap of chronotype genes and pathways with type 2 diabetes susceptibility. This work will build the knowledge necessary to understand the mechanistic link of timing of the internal circadian rhythm to type 2 diabetes, opening potential new avenues of treatment for circadian rhythm disorders and type 2 diabetes."
"9295138","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer research has recently experienced a paradigm shift from the seemingly obvious target of tumor cells towards key support systems of cancer, such as the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tissue oxygenation (pO2) and acidosis (pH) are among the most established hallmarks in solid tumor. Recently, extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) has been identified as a new signaling molecule of importance in tumorigenesis. This project aims to develop new biocompatible paramagnetic probes suitable for systemic delivery allowing for in vivo concurrent measurement of tissue acidosis (pH), oxygenation (pO2) and Pi concentration in the extracellular compartment (HOPE probes) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based technologies. These developments will provide a new unique tool in cancer research allowing for in vivo direct non-invasive measurements and correlation of these important TME parameters. Under SA1, a robust click chemistry approach has been designed to efficiently produce a library of PEGylated HOPE probes. Under SA2, tumor targeting will be achieved upon conjugation of the PEGylated probe to RGD and/or folic acid ligands. The synthesized probes will be evaluated in vitro for their functional sensitivity, spectral properties, toxicity and ability to bind to the targeted biological receptors. Finally, under SA3, we will use a mouse model of human breast cancer to perform toxicokinetic studies, to optimize the probe dose and experimental time window, and to determine the functional sensitivity and tumor targeting efficiency of the probes using low frequency EPR spectroscopy and Overhauser-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We anticipate to achieve in vivo functional sensitivity of 1-2 mmHg of pO2, 0.05 units of pH, and 0.1 mM of Pi. We expect the dual targeted approach of the two receptors upregulated in numerous cancer types to improve the contrast between healthy and tumor tissues, and to significantly enhance signal intensity and decrease probe dosage. The completion of this K99/R00 award by the PI will allow him to obtain the necessary tools and skills in EPR-based in vivo spectroscopy and imaging to successfully apply this knowledge to the field of cancer functional imaging; therefore, bridging the interface between synthetic organic chemistry, cancer research and imaging technologies. The successful completion of this project is designed to make a signficant impact on the future of bioimaging applications to medicine."
"9266775","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital malformations occur in up to 10% of babies born to diabetic women. Optimal glycemic control is difficult to achieve and maintain, and even transient exposure to hyperglycemia can cause malformations. This current proposal is formulated on the basis of our findings relative to the PKC pathway, which is critically involved i the induction of diabetic embryopathy. Because the molecular intermediates downstream PKC activation have not been determined, we have advanced a novel hypothesis that maternal hyperglycemia-induced PKCa/d activation reduces the expression of SIRT2 through DNA hypermethylation. SIRT2 downregulation prevents sustainable antioxidant enzyme expression and induces MARCKS hyperacetylation, which contributes to MARCKS phosphorylation. PKC-dependent SIRT2 downregulation and MARCKS phosphorylation in the developing neural tube are responsible for cellular stresses that cause neuroepithelial cell apoptosis and NTD formation. Aim 1 will determine whether PKCa and PKCd suppress SIRT2 expression through DNA hypermethylation in diabetic embryopathy. We hypothesize that that PKCa and PKCd increases the expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3A/B), which induce hypermethylation in the SIRT2 promoter and inhibit its expression. Aim 2 will determine the role of SIRT2 in PKC-induced cellular stress, MARCKS phosphorylation and NTD formation in diabetic embryopathy. Our working hypothesis is that downregulation of SIRT2 decreases antioxidant enzyme expression, which results in oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and leads to an increase in MARCKS acetylation and phosphorylation, which contributes to cellular stress. Aim 3 will determine the causal role of MARCKS phosphorylation in diabetes-induced cellular stress, apoptosis and NTD formation. We will test the hypothesis that PKCa/d-dependent MARCKS phosphorylation induces cellular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in apoptosis and NTD formation. The success of this project will significantly fill the gaps in the current knowledge base regarding events that cause diabetic embryopathy."
"9256742","Project Summary Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a serious and growing problem, and the development of new antibiotics is critical in the fight against antibiotic resistance. One important class of antibiotics are polyketide compounds, which are produced by modular polyketide synthase enzymes. I will identify novel polyketide antibiotics by generating a polyketide biosensor and by applying large-scale mutagenesis, thereby working towards a general strategy to identify novel biosynthetic products. An E. coli biosensor will be constructed by first fusing a ligand-binding domain that binds to diverse polyketide compounds to required bacterial transcriptional component. The hybrid protein will then be engineered for ligand-dependent stability, such that it is stabilized in the presence of ligand and destabilized in the absence of ligand. In this design, increased biosensor stability is linked to increased reporter gene transcription, enabling the rapid measurement of ligand levels. In parallel, gene synthesis methods will be used to construct a synthetic polyketide pathway, incorporating restriction sites in key locations within the relevant genes. This synthetic pathway will be used to construct chimeric pathways in which acyltransferase domains from other polyketide synthase pathways are substituted for the native domain. Acyltransferase domains control which new substrates are incorporated into the growing polyketide backbone, and substitution of acyltransferase domains with unique substrate tolerance will enable the biosynthesis of diverse polyketide compounds. These chimeric pathways will be evaluated for production of their polyketide product. Finally, large-scale mutagenesis and biosensor-based selection will be used to rescue the biosynthesis activity of poorly performing chimeric pathways to produce novel polyketide antibiotics. This strategy of biosensor-based selection coupled with large-scale mutagenesis can be broadly applied to other biosynthetic pathways to produce novel compounds."
"9225224","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing a genetic network diagram of the primate brain linked to social disorders is one of the major challenges of modern neurobiology and medicine. Nowhere is this need clearer than in social-emotional systems, where dysregulation of circuitry is implicated in mental illnesses: autism, depression and anxiety. We will generate multiple-gene-specific 3D reconstructions from serial sections of long range axon projections of social circuitry in primate, including hypothalamus, bed nucleus and stria terminalis, basal forebrain nuclei, amygdala and basal ganglia, and integrate with MRI. This will address two barriers to understanding primate brain and human social behavior; lack of knowledge of endogenous circuitry, and lack of computational systems for large scale multicolor axon projections in serial registration and for handling the terabyte datasets. We have generated a novel pipeline of multicolor confocal image acquisition integrated with a computational suite of algorithms for reconstructing and visualizing TB image sets. We have applied these to generate a 3D reconstruction of 45,295,200 images (1,620mm) at the axon level for social circuitry involving oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) and the Williams syndrome gene, GTF2IRD1, all implicated in social behavior. We have identified novel OT and AVP structures and sparse tracts that may fill critical gaps as substrates and biomarkers for human behavior. Moreover, we have developed approaches for hierarchical 3D integration of axon-level images to MRI images. The proposal emerges from a unique multidimensional team and advisors*; experts in segmentation, large scale image reconstruction and 3D visualization (Tasdizen, Joshi, Pascucci, Roysam*), in primate brain circuitry and neuroanatomy (Angelucci, Hof*, Dong*, Korenberg), in animal and human MRI (Hsu, Joshi), and in genetics and multicolor fluorescence imaging of axon projections (Korenberg, Angelucci). We will: 1) Establish a genetic wiring diagram of axonal projections for OT, AVP and GTF2IRD1 in macaque. We will generate, validate and image more than 667 serial coronal sections (21,100mm) of macaque brains multicolor fluorescence immunohistochemistry of ligands and their receptors, using confocal microscopy and tract tracing. Pre-/post-mortem MRI(150-200mm resolution) and block-faces images will be acquired. Novel circuitry will be validated in cognate regions of human brain. 2) Build a Neural Information System that integrates and visualizes a multiscale volumetric TB dataset of primate genetic connectivity for social neuropeptides, aligned using automated slice-to-slice image registration at the resolution of axonal projections to MRI, and annotated neuroanatomy. The results will identify novel OT/AVP related social circuitry and establish a pipeline of integrated technologies for bridging (macro)connectome with (micro)axome and both with genetics of mental illness. These will provide novel biomarkers for disease features and receptor targets, and accelerate translating the dissonant orchestration of social behavior by neuropeptides to therapeutic harmony in humans."
"9353216","Advances in technology are driving both an evolution of our approach to the prevention of HIV and the care of those living with HIV, and of the means we use to disseminate prevention and treatment approaches. New technologies, including mobile apps and web-based prevention services, have been proposed as one solution to help bring HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) screening, PrEP adherence, and antiretroviral adherence to scale. To support a program of research in these areas, core services, resources, and technical capacities are needed. Co-directed by Sullivan and Hightow-Weidman, the Technology Core will provide services for technology- related fields, including mobile technologies, web-based platforms, laboratory platforms, online recruitment and technology-related ethics issues to support the overall iTech strategy. The Core is conceptualized as a service center, to which individual investigators from within the iTech or the broader ATN community of funded U19s can request specialized assistance or request to use shared resources (e.g., video counseling platform, image libraries for advertising). Quality control of core services will be assessed by review of the tangible results of service requests (e.g., requirements documents, summaries of app testing, technical documents, laboratory protocols) by the Core co-directors. Centralization of resources will allow development of deep expertise, minimize redundant costs of common tools, and facilitate connections across research projects and sites. The specific aims of the Technology Core are to: 1) Provide technology-support to all six research projects in the iTech and promote the development of sustainable technologies for addressing the HIV care continuum among youth; 2) To be a resource to other funded U19s by providing technical assistance and support on all technology-related aspects of recruitment, retention, implementation and evaluation; 3) Develop and disseminate best practices for the execution and evaluation of technology-based interventions within the Adolescent Trials Network and stay up to date with technological advances, including those related to platform/system changes, new technologies (e.g. wearables, sensors, point of care testing) and improved methodologies (e.g. EMA, virtual reality); and 4) Develop and maintain standards for the ethical conduct of online/technology-based interventions for youth through ongoing consultation with community advisors. In addition to supporting the iTech research and pilots studies, the Technology Core will work collaboratively with the Management Core to ensure project and subject recruitment venue (SRV) milestones are met, data standards are upheld and dissemination is timely. Collaboration with the Analytic Core will serve to ensure the development, execution, analysis, and dissemination phases of each research project succeed. The Technology Core will also serve as a resource to other funded U19s providing technical assistance on mobile technologies, web-based platforms, home specimen collection, and online recruitment, retention and participant management."
"9312847","Each DE-CTR institution has resources for mentoring faculty and fostering career advancement in basic science and clinical disciplines, but the focus and depth of these resources vary across sites. A goal of this Key Component Activity (KCA) is to integrate resources and programs for mentoring and educating investigators across the DE-CTR. Efforts in this KCA will bring tremendous power to the DE-CTR's capabilities to transform the research and learning environments in our institutions to foster development of strong clinical and translational research programs and encourage team-based approaches to research. An effective and efficient core focused on faculty Mentoring, Education and Development (MED-Core) leverages existing programs and structures. Notably, the CTSA-supported South Carolina Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has greatly advanced mentoring and education programs at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Our KCA will leverage the SCTR experience and the SC-CTSA's goal to export their successes to other institutions to develop programs in Delaware, with MUSC playing a central role by providing guidance and expertise.    A successful MED-Core will entice doctoral-qualified clinicians to sustain research efforts, will provide basic scientists support to build translational programs, will coordinate outreach to engage research communities, and will significantly strength clinical and translational research effectiveness. Synergistic interactions among the institutions will foster development of infrastructure for translational research overall and support research teams addressing health care disparities affecting both states. The ability of participating investigators to establish innovative collaborations will be greatly enhanced by coordinated access to the broad and deep expertise within the combined institutions ofthe DE-CTR - expertise that spans clinical practice, health economics and policy, population sciences, public health, biomedical sciences and engineering within a unique combination of institutions that have an established record of effective partnership.    The MED-Core will use an innovative approach to build mentoring, education and career development programs guided by the concept that research should be driven by clinical need while being cognizant that the needs of different patient populations vary depending on current understanding of disease state, available treatments/therapies, and the ability to implement effective strategies in the clinic and community. Impactful clinical and translational research depends on a continuous flow of knowledge from bedside to bench to clinic to community, and effective MED-Core programs must establish the skills to manage these dynamics and prepare investigators to work within multidisciplinary teams focused on improving health and healthcare."
"9312846","Small grants to conduct pilot projects are a well-proven and pivotal mechanism for the establishment and capacity building of a successful, sustainable research program. They allow investigators to establish and test new collaborations and ideas, collecting preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of important clinical and translational research projects. Without a mechanism to evaluate the soundness of new ideas, it will be impossible to develop a high-quality research program and to successfully secure future NIH research grants. This opportunity to test new ideas and collaborations is critical because the DE-CTR depends on the establishment of cross-institutional partnerships. To be funded, pilot projects will be required to involve a partnership of faculty from at least two institutions. These partnerships will include not just local Delaware institutions (the University of Delaware, Nemours, Christiana Care, etc.), but also institutions in other IDeA states, specifically, our partners at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC).  Projects funded under the Clinical and Translational Pilot Grants Program will have to be translational in nature. Collaborative research between basic, clinical, and translational researchers from different disciplines, departments, and/or programs within or across institutions will be encouraged, and at least one ofthe Pilot Projects funded at any time will have to be fundamentally clinical in nature.          The pilot project grants will provide an opportunity to create a community of medical research that has a strong mentorship component. To grow the base of NIH-funded investigators, PIs of pilot projects will generally be junior faculty without prior NIH funding. Each junior faculty member will be required to have a mentor who has undergone mentorship training through an established faculty mentorship program. Both junior faculty and mentors are expected to participate in DE-CTR events, retreats and planning meetings so they become a part of the DE-CTR community. We intend to fund seven pilot projects at any given time after the initial year (Year 1 will only have four pilot projects, allowing us time to establish the program). Each pilot grant proposal may request up to $88,500 in direct costs per year. Funding will be provided for a single year with an option for a second year based on meritorious review. Most ofthe funding awarded is expected to be used for research assistant stipends and laboratory equipment and supplies. PI salary will be discouraged, as institutions are required to provide faculty release time. All pilot project PIs that are junior faculty (the majority) will be required to have a scientific mentor. Projects will be selected based on a two-stage review process. Priority scores will be given by members ofthe DE-CTR Research Committee, and funding decisions will be made by the DE-CTR External Advisory Committee."
"9276803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand how the forebrain neuromodulatory region, nucleus basalis (NB) supports cognitive functions. NB is thought to play significant roles in learning and attention, and its degeneration parallels the decline of cognitive functions in patients in a range of dementias. However, identified projection cell-types have never been recorded. Our objective is to determine what information is represented in and signaled by distinct NB long- range cortical projections and establish their causal behavioral function.  To study this issue, we have developed a quantitative psychophysical auditory detection task for mice, adapted from human and primate work, enabling us to assess a number of behavioral correlates of NB neurons. In addition, we will use our recently developed optogenetic toolkit to record from all the three known NB projection cell-types: cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons during behavior for the first time. Our central hypothesis is that NB broadcasts distinct cognitive signals in a cell-type-specific manner. First, we operationalized different cognitive variables so that the activity of every neuron encoding a particular cognitive variable can be statistically evaluated. Specifically we will assess the moment-to-moment, trial-to-trial correlations between firing rates and different behavioral measures (e.g. accuracy or reaction time, RT). Second, in each of the three aims we will consider one of the major projection systems and evaluate when they are recruited during behavior and what cognitive variables they encode. Finally, using the temporal information gleaned from these recordings we will test the causal role of different NB projection cell- types using optogenetic gain and loss of function manipulations.  Upon completion of these aims, we expect to establish the cell-type specific broadcast signals from NB and their role in defined aspects of cognition."
"9315198","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training program is an extension of a program currently funded by NHLBI K12 HL089990 (Translational Genetics and Genomics of Airways Diseases). This K12 program, which has operated successfully for the past 5 years, is closely linked with our T32 HL007427 program (Clinical Epidemiology of Lung Diseases), which has been in continuous operation for 37 years. Both of these training programs focus on systems genetics and genomics of chronic respiratory diseases, particularly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are major public health problems. Asthma and COPD are linked via common environmental and genetic susceptibility; these factors influence disease expression throughout life. Based on our current knowledge of complex diseases, there is a critical need for individuals trained in the application of systems and integrative genomic methods to perform quantitative research in respiratory biology. Therefore, we propose to revise and extend our current K12 training program with an increased emphasis on systems biology, network science, and multiple -omics approaches. The proposed K12 program will be instrumental in meeting the need for increased computational biology expertise in respiratory disease research by successfully training independent research investigators who will go on to lead their own research programs across the U.S.. The proposed K12 program provides research training in six major areas: (1) Systems Genetics (GWAS, Fine Mapping, and Pharmacogenetics); (2) Functional Genetics; (3) Emerging -Omics (Proteomics/Metabolomics/Microbiomics); (4) Transcriptomics, including integrative genomics; (5) Epigenomics; and (6) Systems Biology/Network Modeling. Two Scholar slots are requested in this proposal. The Scholars interact with a pool of 31 core faculty mentors in the six interrelated research areas. Each Scholar will have the opportunity to become involved in the design, execution, and analysis of ongoing federally and non-federally funded research projects, as well as develop an independent career path. Scholars' research is conducted in the Channing Division of Network Medicine, a research division of the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). After completing our program, K12 Scholars will be eligible to assume faculty positions in systems genetics and genomics. Scholars benefit from a close relationship with the Departments of Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health, the Program in Bioinformatics at Children's Hospital Boston and the Partners Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine. In the past 5 years, we have had 100% retention of K12 trainees in faculty positions and 62 % who have moved on to completely independent funding."

"9271179","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid hormone has major effects on the development, regeneration and function of skeletal muscle. Thyroid hormone receptor ?1 is the predominant mediator of muscle T3 action, and transcriptionally regulates a number of important genes including SERCA A1 and A2, UCP 3 and GLUT 4, as well as the muscle differentiation factors myogenin and MyoD1. Circulating T3 enters myocytes via specific transporters such as MCT8 and 10, but we have shown in the last cycle of this grant that a significant fraction of cellular T3 is generated by the intracellular monodeiodination of T4 catalyzed by the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2). While mature myocytes are stable, skeletal muscle has a robust regenerative mechanism that is markedly accelerated following injury. This involves the concerted actions of satellite cells, the muscle stem cell equivalent, an a number of different cell types localized to the muscle stem cell niche including resident stromal fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), T-regulatory cells, and macrophages. These cells produce a number of pro-myogenic cytokines and growth factors that that are necessary to coordinate the regeneration process including Notch, Wnt/?-catenin, sonic hedgehog, IL-4 and IL-6, and a number of TGF-??family members among others. During the last grant period, we showed that changes in thyroid hormone mediated by local thyroid hormone metabolism play an important role in these signaling cascades. We found that after muscle injury acute inactivation of thyroid hormone by the type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) is necessary to facilitate satellite cell proliferation and block premature differentiation that otherwise would lead to apoptosis. This is followed by increased type 2 deiodinase (D2)-mediated T4 activation that is essential for the satellite cell to differentiate into mature myoblasts and then myofibers to complete the normal muscle regeneration program. In studies employing gene knockout mouse models, we have found that a loss of either D3 of D2 dramatically impedes muscle repair after injury. Using a murine model of satellite cell transplantation therapy, we further showed that local thyroid hormone activation by D2 plays a crucial role in the engraftment of transplanted muscle stem cells. In this renewal, we propose to combine studies using our unique mouse knockout models and established FACS-sorting isolation of specific cell types. We will investigate why D2 is required for engrafted satellite cell survival and successful myotube formation, how D3 and D2 change after injury in satellite cells and other components of the muscle stem cell niche, whether deiodinases are required for the coordinated responses of other cell types in the muscle stem cell niche, and how dysregulation of this process may lead to fibrosis. This will expand our knowledge of the contributions of thyroid hormone to muscle regeneration and form the basis for potential therapeutic strategies for patients with skeletal muscle injuries."
"9275542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ventral, medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex, the major white matter pathways that connect them (and their links to the basal ganglia) are central parts of the reward/motivation circuit. Dysfunction in these areas is associated with several psychiatric diseases including depression. Fibers from these cortical areas are captured at two surgical targets for treatment resistant depression (anterior cingulotomy and deep brain stimulation of the subgenual cingulate). The goal of this application is to gain insight into the anatomical substrates that underlie human functional connectivity profiles and changes in disease derived from imaging studies. Cortex and basal ganglia are generally organized in parallel functional circuits, yet emerging data indicate that specific subregions also serve as connectional nodes that integrate information processing across functional systems. Our work has focused on how prefrontal cortical regions are anatomically linked through the basal ganglia, to integrate across reward/motivation and cognitive domains. We have recently expanded these studies to examine cortico-cortical connections, particularly, the white matter pathways that connect them. By combining anatomical tracing and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging we are exploring the ability of imaging to replicate fiber pathways. The aim here is to build on our previous findings combining non-human primate anatomical tracing, non-human primate diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and human dMRI to identify cortical and basal ganglia areas that anatomically link areas of prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex. Data will be used to determine the pathways/structures involved at the cingulotomy and subgenual DBS targets. Aim 1 uses conventional tracing experiments to determine how cingulate and prefrontal cortical terminals and pathways interface. Aim 2 will determine their pathways through the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and corpus callosum, and the ability for diffusion imaging tractography to replicate these connections. Aim 3 will use the results from Aim 2 to evaluate and segment the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus, and the corpus callosum in healthy human subjects and delineate which connections are likely to pass through the surgical targets, the dorsal anterior cingulate (cingulotomy) and subgenual anterior cingulate (deep brain stimulation)."
"9305506","Project Abstract  Understanding neurotransmitter activity is fundamental to elucidating normal and diseased neuronal function, with glutamate (Glu) and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) being the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Such understanding is particularly critical in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a set of neurodevelopment disorders characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Although varying in presentation and severity, ASD occurs in all ethnic and socioeconomic groups, has a lifelong duration, and affects an estimated 1 out of 68 children in the United States. Unfortunately, the etiologies of these disorders are not fully understood, and this technical development proposal to develop novel non-invasive imaging tools for studying ASD brain neurochemical biomarkers is in response to NIH PA 10-158 ?Research on Autism Spectrum Disorders?. The innovations to be evaluated under this project will help not only investigating ASD, but also other neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders where advanced imaging techniques are needed.  Despite the heterogeneity of ASD, patients may share final common biochemical pathways and potentially be responsive to similar treatments, and ASD is now hypothesized to result from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Known as the ?E/I balance? theory, findings from both animal models and humans suggest ASD is characterized by hyper-excitability in critical brain regions due to increased Glu and/or decreased GABA. While in vivo evidence of such neurochemical imbalances is beginning to emerge through the use of J-edited 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS being the current method of choice) robust in vivo measurements are time-consuming and problematic. Glu measurement is straightforward, but separation from closely related glutamine (Gln) is difficult. Furthermore, co-edited macromolecules (MMs) overlap the targeted GABA signal and account for 40-60% of the detected signal, leading investigators to refer to the resulting data as GABA+MMs or simply GABA+. MRS-detected MMs are also reported to exhibit regional variations, variability across normal subjects, and dependence on both age and pathology. Even for single-voxel studies, prior proposed MM-suppression techniques are not widely used, being either time-consuming or highly sensitive to B0 magnetic field variations.  This proposal seeks to overcome these limitations via the systematic design, implementation, and testing of robust MM-suppressed J-edited single-voxel (Aims 1 and 2) and multi-voxel (Aim 3) sequences to measure these targeted neurochemicals, yielding time-efficient measurements from multiple brain regions. These new tools will be used to assess neurochemical imbalances in adolescent patients diagnosed with ASD (Aim 4)."

Investigators at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and The University of Minnesota (UMN) will join forces to accomplish the goals outlined by this RFA. The team at UNC has over 10 years of experience in recruiting and imaging typically developing and at-risk children, scanning over 1000 children from birth to five years1-40. Well established infrastructure at the Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC) at UNC and Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at UMN are in place to recruit and retain pediatric subjects and facilitate the coordination of pediatric imaging studies. Our past and ongoing studies for imaging children (birth ? five years of age) without sedation have achieved an overall success rate of 81% and attrition rate of 29.3%. Our track record demonstrates that we possess the critical and essential components to successfully conduct longitudinal pediatric imaging studies focusing on early brain development, a critically-important aspect of this RFA. Our ability to recruit, retain, and image non-sedated, typically developing children is further strengthened by our image analysis team, which has developed novel image analysis tools specifically for early brain development. The expertise at UNC is complementary to and strengthened by the expertise of the team at UMN. The CMRR at UMN has been one of the leading groups in the HCP project and has developed novel MR imaging approaches to dramatically shorten data acquisition time. Furthermore, the team at UMN has extensive experience in behavioral and cognitive studies of early child development. Together, our combined team is well positioned to accomplish the goals of this RFA. To this end, a total of 500 typically developing children between birth and five years of age will be recruited across two data collection sites in a sequential cohort, accelerated longitudinal study design. The participants are divided into two main groups, longitudinal (n=285) and cross-sectional (n=215) groups, respectively. This hybrid longitudinal and cross-sectional design enables detailed characterization of early brain development from both brain structural/functional using MRI and behavioral aspects using behavioral assessments. All of the acquired images and behavioral assessments will undergo extensive quality assurance and control processes to ensure that high quality data is obtained and transferred to the Central Connectome Facility at Washington University. In addition, we will integrate novel image analysis tools, developed by our team onto the existing HCP pipelines."
"9277243","PROJECT I - NEUROHUMORAL AND RENAL MECHANISMS OF HYPERTENSION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although impaired renal-pressure natriuresis occurs in all forms of chronic hypertension studied thus far, neurohumoral mechanisms often mediate abnormal kidney function and increased blood pressure (BP). Therefore, our research is directed toward understanding neurohumoral mechanisms that alter kidney function in hypertension caused by excess weight gain which accounts for 65-75% of human essential hypertension. We previously demonstrated that increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity plays a major role in the pathophysiology of obesity-hypertension mainly by stimulation of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). We also found that leptin, an adipocyte derived hormone, contributes to SNS activation and increased BP in obesity by stimulating CNS pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and ultimately by activation of melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4R). Our studies also indicate that the CNS POMC-MC4R pathway is a key means by which leptin regulates glucose homeostasis. Moreover, POMC activation can regulate BP and glucose independent of its effects to reduce appetite. The complex CNS circuits that mediate this differential control of cardiovascular and metabolic functions are still poorly understood. In addition, we found that the POMC-MC4R pathway may be important for BP regulation independent of leptin. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that POMC-MC4R activation in distinct areas of the hypothalamus, brainstem and spinal cord can differentially and independently regulate BP, RSNA, and metabolic functions, including appetite and energy expenditure. The proposed studies will determine which specific brain regions are most important in mediating the chronic effects of POMC-MC4R activation on RSNA, baroreflexes and BP regulation, food intake and energy expenditure, as well as the cardiometabolic responses to leptin. We will also determine the role of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), in modulating leptin's actions on POMC and other neurons of the forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord in regulating cardiometabolic functions. These studies will employ unique, genetically engineered mouse models that permit us to delete or rescue MC4R, SOCS3, or PTP1B in specific neuronal populations of the hypothalamus, brainstem and spinal cord. Sophisticated physiological techniques that provide computerized chronic monitoring of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic functions, coupled with novel animal models, will permit us to unravel the specific CNS circuits by which the POMC-MC4R pathway differentially controls metabolic and cardiovascular functions, and the role of SOCS3 and PTP1B in modulating this system in obesity."

We will optimize access to our resources to reach scholars and the larger workforce. The products of our efforts will be shared across CTSA HUBs. We will recruit a diverse group of KL2 scholars with demonstrated potential to become catalysts for innovation in biomedical research translation. Four postdoctoral scholars will be supported by this application and support for another 3-4 scholars has been pledged by our University. These outstanding candidates will engage in an intensive 2-3 year ICDC designed to create the next generation of leaders in translational science. Our specific aims are: 1. Recruit and engage talented scholars from diverse backgrounds in clinical and translational  sciences career development; 2. Establish a structured yet individualized framework to accelerate scholars' development of  knowledge, skills, attitudes and practices that are essential for innovative, multidisciplinary,  clinical and translational research; 3. Strengthen existing and build new partnerships within the University and across CTSA HUBs to  share and disseminate tools and best practices for translational research career development; 4. Refine processes for scholar and mentor evaluation and continuous enhancement of the career  development program. In pursuing these aims we recognize the factors that facilitate scholars' transition to independence including individual persistence, resilience, initiative, and autonomy, personal-professional life balance, engagement in collaborative networks, strong and effective mentorship, protected research time, and an institution's translational research infrastructure. Programmatic offerings for ICDC are coordinated with Workforce Development and the TL1 and include MS degrees in Public Health Sciences or Public Health, a Certificate in Clinical and Translational Sciences, core programmatic seminars, experiential opportunities and individualized courses, learning modules and consultations. Our intended outcomes are productive, connected, competent translational researchers trained to accelerate discovery by bridging gaps along the translational research continuum."

"9292216","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging is accompanied by a gradual loss of skeletal muscle size and function known as sarcopenia. A contributor to falls, frailty and loss in functional mobility in the elderly, disability associated with sarcopenia is considered to be a burgeoning cost to the US healthcare system. The reasons for age-related skeletal muscle decline and hence therapeutic strategies remain elusive. Features of sarcopenic skeletal muscle include ongoing cycles of denervation and reinnervation, loss of functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and depletion of resident stem cells (satellite cells). However, any interrelationship between age-related satellite cell and NMJ decline remains ambiguous. Hence, this proposal is designed to elucidate the fates and roles of satellite cells and derived progenitors at degenerating NMJs with age. In addition, we propose a strategy to attenuate age-related NMJ decline by specific manipulation of satellite cells. To accomplish these objectives satellite cell-specific mouse genetic models and confocal immunofluorescence imaging of NMJs will be used. We have generated preliminary data that show loss of post-synaptic myonuclei at NMJs together with myofiber type transitions consistent with neuromuscular disruption in aged skeletal muscle. In parallel studies, we find satellite cells are required for the maintenance of post-synaptic myonuclei, myofiber type properties and the reinnervation of adult NMJs by motor nerve terminals in response to experimental neuromuscular disruption. Finally, we demonstrate that satellite cell specific forced expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase feedback regulator sprouty1 (Spry1) is sufficient to attenuate decline of post-synaptic myonuclei at aging NMJs. We will solidify our preliminary findings through the assessment of NMJ integrity, satellite cell proximity, post-synaptic myonuclei and myofiber type properties in skeletal muscles of various ages. We will also assess the consequences of satellite cell depletion and satellite cell specific Spry1 forced expression on the maintenance of NMJs and myofiber type properties with age. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To identify whether loss of post-synaptic myonuclei is a feature of aged degenerated NMJs, define regulators of age-related myofiber phenotypic transitions connected to NMJ decline and examine satellite cell derived contributions at aging NMJs, 2) To examine if satellite cell depletion accelerates age-related declines in NMJ integrity and NMJ regulated myofiber properties and 3) To determine if satellite cell-specific forced Spry1 expression attenuates loss of; post-synaptic myonuclei, NMJ integrity and maintains NMJ regulated myofiber properties with age."
"9273894","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative 'superbugs' are rapidly spreading around the world, and polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E) are often the only effective antibiotics. Since polymyxin B was released in the 1950s, its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicodynamics (PK/PD/TD) have never been defined. Recent pharmacological research on polymyxins has predominantly focused on colistin methanesulfonate (CMS, an inactive prodrug of colistin) and demonstrates that CMS has significant limitations. Thus, polymyxin B is increasingly being viewed as the preferred polymyxin. Unfortunately, recently developed scientifically-based dosing recommendations for CMS cannot and should not be applied to polymyxin B, as the latter is administered as its active entity. Therefore, it is essential to determine the PK/PD/TD of polymyxin B in critically-ill patients, refine optimal dosage regimens, and develop the user-friendly adaptive feedback control (AFC) clinical tool. The Specific Aims are: 1) To develop a population PK model for polymyxin B; 2) To investigate relationships between the PK of polymyxin B, duration of therapy and patient characteristics, with the development and timing of nephrotoxicity; and to use next-generation proteomics to identify the most predictive biomarker(s) of polymyxin B associated nephrotoxicity; and to develop the population PK/TD model; 3) To establish the relationships between polymyxin B PK, bacterial susceptibility and patient characteristics, with the probability of attaining and time to achieving clinical and bacteriological outcomes; and 4) To employ the models from Aims 1-3 and Monte Carlo simulation to develop scientifically-based dosage regimens of polymyxin B and to develop an AFC algorithm for future individual patients. Research Design: Patients being treated with intravenous polymyxin B will be identified at three clinical sites in the USA and one in Singapore. Patients (n = 250) will have blood collected at various times surrounding a dose of polymyxin B between days 1 and 5 of therapy. Development of nephrotoxicity, clinical response, and bacteriological response will be examined. Total and free plasma concentrations of polymyxin B will be determined. Bacterial isolates will be examined for the emergence of polymyxin resistance. The relationships between polymyxin B PK, PD and TD end-points (e.g. clinical and bacteriological responses, development of toxicity and resistance) will be assessed using pharmacometric analyses. Finally, the obtained information will be used to apply Monte Carlo simulation to examine the impact of various patient characteristics and other factors on polymyxin B PK, PD and TD, in order to establish optimal dosage regimens and AFC algorithms for individual critically-ill patients. Significance: No new antibiotics will be available for Gram-negative 'superbugs' for many years. This landmark multicenter study will provide essential information for optimizing polymyxin B use in critically-ill patients, while minimizing resistance and toxicity. This proposal aligns perfectly with the NIAID priority To teach old drugs new tricks and the recent Executive Order of the White House to combat antibiotic resistance."
"9276057","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks funding to expand the Integrated Public Use Micro-data Series (IPUMS) by adding demographic and geographic data describing the entire enumerated population of the U.S. from 1790 to 1930.

"9309129","Contact PD/PI: Sherwin, Robert S. 1. Overall Project Summary- The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) was created in 2005 to strengthen Yale's infrastructure for clinical and translational research, based on the recommendation of a Medical School strategic planning committee. Soon afterwards, when NIH launched its new program of Clinical & Translational Science Awards, YCCI applied and became the home of the Yale CTSA. Since then, one of its major priorities has been to support the education and career development of the next generation of clinical and translational investigators. As described in the present application, this initiative has met with great success, underscored by the fact that graduates of YCCI's K-Scholar program have received 47 individual NIH K Awards, 43 NIH RO1 awards, and 65 Foundation grants, published >1,800 papers, and obtained >$240 million in independent research funding. Remarkably, 98% of the program's graduates have stayed in academic medicine or pursued research careers in the biotech or pharmaceutical industries. YCCI has also made substantial progress in its push to accelerate the translation of disease-related discoveries into the clinic. As will be described, it provides Yale investigators with key assistance in areas including biostatistics and bioinformatics, study design, protocol development, regulatory approval, patient recruitment, access to inpatient and outpatient research facilities, and budgeting support, and gives them ready access to pilot grants and state-of-the-art research cores. The result has been a significant upsurge in the number and scope of clinical research projects throughout the Medical Center. In the next grant cycle, YCCI will build upon these achievements with an emphasis on team-based T1 to T4 research, including studies across the lifespan. YCCI will also pursue new partnerships with the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science to develop an innovative technology transfer program called the Center for Biological and Innovative Technology (CBIT) and with the School of Organization & Management to offer a novel program of leadership training for clinicians and physician-scientists. In addition, YCCI will take active advantage of the recent expansion of clinical services by Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), which now has 1,540 beds and more than 1 million outpatients visits per year, and the growth of the Yale Medical Group (YMG), which has a network of >1,200 practicing physicians in >100 clinical specialties. The resulting clinical volume (~4 million patient records) gives Yale researchers access to a large, diverse patient base for outcomes studies and clinical trials. Overall, YCCI will leverage Yale's outstanding scientific and clinical environment and work with other CTSA hubs to foster the growth of multidisciplinary team science, to develop innovative strategies for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and to implement results for the benefit of the health care system and the population as a whole.

"9275049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxygen and iron are critical metabolic substrates for rapidly developing brain structures in childhood. Anemia, which causes a deficit of both, is a common pediatric problem that is associated with long- term neurodevelopmental impairment. Estimates indicate that half of the world's children are anemic, much of it due to blood loss. This includes over 300,000 preterm neonates per year in the US who become profoundly anemic due to repeated blood sampling in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are at high risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. Blood loss risks shortchanging the young brain of oxygen and iron, and the brain structures that are most rapidly developing during the period of anemia are likely to be affected. Few if any clinical studies have directly assessed the short and long-term neurodevelopmental effects of blood-loss anemia in preterm infants. However, extensive studies in humans and preclinical rodent models have shown the long-term effects of early life dietary iron deficiency anemia, supporting the hypothesis that early life anemia is detrimental to the brain. One intervention which may help to alleviate the anemia and lessen these changes is administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (RhEpo) which stimulates red blood cell production, thereby increasing oxygen delivery. Erythropoietin may also act as a neuroprotectant.  Using a mouse model of blood loss anemia that is both developmentally and physiologically relevant to anemic preterm infants, this proposal will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine the effect of anemia during early-life on the metabolism of four brain regions critical to normal cognitive development: cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The objective is to ask whether there are differential alterations to metabolism in the blood loss anemia group as compared to non-bled controls within regions that are rapidly growing during the period of anemia (hippocampus and striatum). Specifically, the study aims are to 1) determine whether the neurochemical profiles of important four brain regions are altered differentially by anemia; 2) determine whether the neurochemical profiles of four important brain regions remain altered in adulthood after recovery from anemia and whether there are functional behavioral deficits; and 3) determine whether alleviation of anemia through RhEpo administration normalizes the neurochemical profiles. To accomplish these aims, in vivo MRS will measure the regional steady-state concentrations of critical metabolites. Ex vivo extracellular flux analysis will allow assessment of neuronal bioenergetics. Quantitative real-time PCR will assess synaptic plasticity gene expression changes. Long-term functional outcomes will be assessed via anatomically driven behavioral tests that index the functionality of each brain region.  Training of the applicant by Dr. Michael Georgieff, an expert in iron deficiency and neonatal brain development, and Dr. Gülin Öz, an expert in MRS techniques and analysis, will prepare her well for a future career researching early neurodevelopment using MRS and other neuroimaging techniques."
"9325694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Migraine is the world's most common neurological disorder. This condition is characterized by a number of phases including a prodrome, the headache phase and a post-drome. In the headache phase, disabling cephalic pain occurs that is typically unilateral and persists for 4-72 hours. The migraine attack is also often associated with nausea, vomiting and hypersensitivity to a variety of external stimuli including light and sound. The International Headache Society distinguishes migraine without aura (MO) and migraine with aura (MA). The pathophysiology of migraine is not well understood but ultimately, migraine is believed to arise from a state of altered cortical excitability (dysexcitability) capabe of activating the trigeminovascular system in genetically susceptible individuals. One of the most commonly noted clinical triggers of migraine is stress. How stress may trigger migraine is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that stress activates the dynorphin/KOR system to produce multiple CNS effects. Our preliminary data suggest that stress can induce features that are consistent with clinical observations of migraine in a novel animal model of medication overuse headache (MOH) induced by a period of exposure to triptan drugs. In this proposal, we plan to discover a brain penetrant kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist that can be developed for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. We will synthesize and optimize compounds from a preliminary scaffold, characterize them in vitro for their receptor selectivity, and evaluate them for harmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetic (PK), metabolic, side-effect and safety profiles in vivo. The first specific aim will synthesize and perform in vitro assays of novel 4-amine-N-(quinolyn-2- yl)piperidines. The second specific aim will assess the DMPK characteristics of these novel compounds. Aim 3 will characterize CYM51317, a prototype KOR antagonist, in migraine prevention in our rat MOH model and screen novel KOR antagonists for migraine prophylaxis to identify new molecules that have drug-like profiles that will enable IND-filing. These studies will allow identification of a candidate molecule that can be pursued for human evaluation."
"9282323","San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7*^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including Increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs, in addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health care for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire 11 to T4 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs."
"9278157","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several clinical trials have demonstrated that both lifestyle change and metformin significantly reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Prior efforts to disseminate treatment with lifestyle have resulted in very limited population reach, and there has been minimal uptake of metformin for the treatment of prediabetes. Within the UCLA Health System, we have developed a successful program called Managing your Medications for Education and Daily Support (MyMEDS) that fully integrates pharmacists in primary care settings to co-manage patients with poorly controlled diabetes. We propose a pragmatic diabetes prevention program that extends the existing MyMEDS infrastructure to also treat patients with prediabetes. Within 14 of 28 randomly selected clinics, MyMEDS pharmacists will use a decision aid developed by HealthWise(c) to educate patients about the DPP and engage them in shared decision-making about diabetes prevention. The pharmacist and patient will jointly develop a care plan that includes intensive lifestyle change (preferred strategy) and/or metformin, or take no immediate action and the pharmacist will communicate the plan to the primary care physician. For those who select lifestyle change, we will partner with the YMCA of Los Angeles, which offers the DPP at multiple locations. Our primary endpoint will measure improvements in use of any treatment for prediabetes, a critical first step for stemming the impending diabetes epidemic. Our Specific Aims are: 1) In a clinic level, cluster-randomized, intention-to-treat trial, to test the effectiveness of using pharmacists to implement diabetes prevention among patients with prediabetes, as compared to those receiving usual care, on uptake of intensive lifestyle change and/or metformin at 4 months (primary outcome). Secondary hypothesis generating outcomes include impact of the intervention on weight, A1c, and blood pressure control. 2) To evaluate characteristics that will influence sustainability of ths intervention, we will measure: a) Acceptability to patients, physicians, pharmacists, and community partners; b) Psychosocial impact of pre-diabetes, stratified by the treatment selected; c) Uptake of intensive lifestyle change and/or metformin at 4 months, by age (< 60 vs. 60+); d) The cost of program implementation per participant who successfully initiates any treatment. Our analyses will use GLM adjusted models to compare the rate of uptake of treatment for prediabetes in the randomly selected 14 MyMEDS clinics to the rates observed in the 14 control clinics. We will measure the health system costs of implementing this program and if it improves the proportion of prediabetics engaged in care, will partner with the University of California Office of the President to disseminate this program to the other 4 UC medical centers. In summary, there is a critical need to educate and engage patients with prediabetes in treatment to prevent diabetes, and this trial will test the effectiveness of clinical pharmacists i primary care practices, using a shared decision making tool to help patients with prediabetes select a treatment that is best suited for them."

"9353219","Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the U.S. have a disproportionally higher incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with other MSM. These men also have low uptake of HIV/STI testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a highly efficacious HIV prevention strategy when taken daily. Known barriers include low perceived HIV risk, difficulty accessing providers, lack of engagement in regular healthcare, stigma, and concerns about confidentiality. The high uptake of mobile devices among youth provides an opportunity to leverage mobile health applications on hand- held devices (mHealth) to increase HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM. The major goals of this pilot project are to refine and pilot test a combination mobile app based intervention designed to overcome barriers to HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM. Using qualitative methods and informed by the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills theoretical model, we will build upon an existing mobile app platform to develop and tailor the mobile app, LYNX, to increase both HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM through an iterative development design method (aim 1). We will then pilot test this mobile app for usability in a 2-month open technical pilot (aim 2). After revising this app, we will subsequently conduct a 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of LYNX among a diverse sample of YMSM in Chicago, IL and Tampa, FL. Upon completion of this 2-year project, we will have optimized the LYNX mobile app for increasing HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM, which will be poised for further evaluation in a full-scale efficacy trial in years 3-5 of the iTech."
"9286505","Project Summary/Abstract The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 10% of adults in the United States, over 20 million Americans have chronic kidney disease. Diabetes Mellitus is the leading risk factor for chronic kidney disease in the United States. Despite improved glycemic control, individuals with Diabetes Mellitus continue to develop and progress to diabetic kidney disease (DKD). In DKD, along with endothelial injury and mesangial expansion, podocyte loss directly contributes to the functional capacity to maintain the renal filtration barrier. Mitochondrial injury is also uniformly observed in DKD and is accompanied by mitochondrial DNA damage as well as altered expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, function, and fragmentation. We recently reported the essential role for the zinc-finger transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), in podocyte injury. Specifically, we demonstrated that KLF6 is an early inducible injury response gene that enhances mitochondrial respiratory complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase, COX) expression, thereby abrogating the release of cytochrome c and activation of apoptosis in the setting of cell stress. KLF6 maintains COX assembly by regulating the expression of key transcripts involved in mitochondrial replication, transcription, and function under cell stress. To date, this is the first study demonstrating a direct regulatory effect of a zinc-finger transcription factor on mitochondrial function in the podocyte. Our preliminary data also suggests that podocyte-specific loss of Klf6 (Klf6-/-) accelerated DKD in mice. In addition, we observed a significant increase in mitochondrial injury with podocyte loss in the diabetic Klf6-/- mice as compared to diabetic wildtype mice. Furthermore, we observed that modulating the level of KLF6 expression in the podocyte directly regulated mitochondrial structure, function, genes involved in COX assembly, and apoptosis. Finally, KLF6 expression was reduced in DKD as compared to healthy control subjects in three independent gene expression arrays from human kidney biopsies. The objective of this research proposal is to demonstrate that KLF6 is required to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and podocyte injury in DKD. The long-term goal of our project is to identify ?druggable? targets in restoring mitochondrial function in podocytes of diabetic kidney. This proposal will address a current gap in the field by demonstrating that COX assembly is critical to preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in podocytes of diabetic kidney. The potential impact of this proposed research is that it will shed new light on the critical role of respiratory complex assembly in improving mitochondrial function in the podocyte and slowing the rate of DKD progression in the kidney. Finally, deciphering the mechanism by which KLF6 regulates COX assembly will provide us with a novel pathway to target in DKD."
"9291491","The techniques of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing and the ability to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a sample of a patient?s blood have placed medicine on the brink of a revolution in our ability to treat, and perhaps even cure, a broad range of genome-based diseases. The proposed Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW Wellstone MDCRC) is uniquely poised to begin translation of this technology to benefit patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and ultimately, other forms of muscular dystrophy. For this to become a reality, it is essential to train a new generation of clinicians, physician-scientists, and basic scientists who will be able to apply these evolving technologies in the service of muscular dystrophy patients and their community. The objective of the Training Core is to enhance the educational environment in order to recruit, train, and maintain the next generation of transformative investigators focused on addressing the challenges of muscular dystrophy. Our approach will be three fold: (1) To provide mentoring and financial support for two competitive, pilot and feasibility projects each year focused on advancing our understanding or treatment of any of the diverse forms of muscular dystrophy; (2) To develop and coordinate educational opportunities that will benefit all investigators and trainees associated with the Wellstone Center by both complementing and leveraging the strengths of existing training programs here at UTSW; (3) To foster avenues of interaction that will facilitate communication, collaboration, and synergy between the investigators at the UTSW Wellstone Center and those at other Wellston MDCRC network sites."
"9322597","Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated misfolded tau proteins is one of the main hallmarks in many neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, knowledge and understanding of disease mechanisms that impact tau production and accumulation, altering overall tau proteostasis is critical. Recently, abnormalities in microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to neurodegeneration. However, the extent to which dysregulation of miRNAs directly alters tau proteostasis by modifying tau expression, phosphorylation or both is currently unknown. Each miRNA is capable of binding to and silencing many target transcripts, providing an additional level of regulation that complements canonical transcriptional pathways. We have recently found in autopsy brain tissue that miR-219 is downregulated in Alzheimer disease (AD) compared to controls. Using mammalian cell cultures and a novel transgenic Drosophila model, we have also found that miR-219 directly binds to the tau mRNA 3' untranslated region (UTR) and silences its expression at the post-transcriptional level. Strikingly, our bioinformatics analysis indicates miR-219 is also predicted to target Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 gamma subunit (CAMK2?), Tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1) and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3?), which are all implicated in the generation of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau. The interaction between microRNAs and tau/tau kinases 3' UTR and its implication in the regulation of tau expression, phosphorylation and overall tau proteostasis in vivo and the influence of this interaction on the disease will be assessed in three specific aims in this application. In Aim 1, we will determine in primary hippocampal cultures the extent to which miR-219 modulates (i) the synthesis of potential miR-219 targeted kinases (i.e. CAMK2?, TTBK1, GSK3?) and (ii) tau phosphorylation and cell toxicity. In Aim 2 we will investigate the role miR-219 plays in the post-transcriptional regulation of tau and tau kinases in both wild type and in the htau transgenic mice. In Aim 3 we will determine the extent to which tau/ tau kinases 3' UTR-microRNA interactions influence tau toxicity and neurodegeneration in the transgenic hTau model of AD tau pathology. This proposal is innovative because looking at miRNA regulation has forced a re-assessment of gene expression that will provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of AD and related tauopathies as well as will provide a new framework and new models to investigate mechanisms of tau proteostasis regulation and toxicity. Together, these studies will help us address the critical need of understanding the earliest events in AD and help pave the way towards future strategies to address AD with miRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutics."
"9313946","SUMMARY: Administrative Core The Administrative Core of this proposed continuation of the ?JHU Center for Neuroscience Research? NINDS P30 Center is critical for implementation of the primary goal of this Center: to provide the Primary Center Investigators, and other JHU neuroscientists that are engaged in research consistent with the mission of NINDS, with cutting-edge Core services, enhancing their research capabilities to enable fundamental scientific advances in our understanding of the nervous system that have the potential to address critical issues in the treatment of neurological disease. This Core, therefore, includes an administrative structure that allows for fair and equitable use of the two Center Scientific Cores: the Multiphoton Imaging (MPI) Core and the Murine Mutagenesis Core (MMC). It also addresses Scientific Core project prioritization to ensure fair access to the Cores by JHU neuroscience investigators, including: the NINDS-funded Primary Center Investigators, other NINDS-funded JHU investigators, and other neuroscientists at JHU who would benefit from access to the Center. Further, the Administrative Core is proposed to have in place mechanisms that provide a facile means to request Core access, and also strict reporting procedures that provide a record of Core use by all investigators. This includes an assessment of the success of projects performed by the Cores, quantification of services provided by the Cores, and feedback on the quality of Core service. The Administrative Core will oversee all financial issues relating to day-to-day activities of the Cores, and it will provide long-term oversight in order to assure adequate resources are available for all Core services.

"9270043","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Webster University is a student-focused, tuition-driven institution that values teaching and academic excellence. The transformation from a traditionally teaching-heavy culture to a balanced teaching and research culture requires institutional level changes. Historically, Webster has emphasized teaching excellence but not research productivity, though that is changing with a new administration. The growing emphasis on faculty research, a new endowed professorship in biological sciences, and the imminent construction of an interdisciplinary science building make this an ideal time to formalize research administration and expand research productivity at Webster. Our objective is to build a sustained Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP) that serves and supports the faculty in competing for external funding. This will require development of an ORSP and faculty initiatives to meet these goals, with the following Aims. Aim 1: Develop the new Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP), currently the Corporate Foundation and Government Relations (CFGR), to encourage and support externally funded research. This includes enhancing administration through ongoing training in research administration for grants officers and in accounting from NIH and NCURA. Aim 2: Review and reorganize institutional policies to remove barriers and incentivize the pursuit of external research funding by faculty. This will include setting research as a new priority and reviewing hiring, tenure, and promotion policies to encourage and give credit for a balance of teaching and research. We will explore new incentive structures and review and clarify policies for support of faculty time devoted to developing and managing research grants. Aim 3: Develop faculty research productivity for successful pursuit of external research funding and increase research grant activity. We will promote and provide increased training in grant writing and research methodology. We will designate a Faculty Research Director who will be Faculty Advisor to the new ORSP with responsibilities to provide faculty mentoring around research, publishing, and grant writing. The student body has 38% under-represented minorities and 55% females in STEM and biomedical areas, demonstrating that Webster University has also been successful in recruiting and retaining underrepresented students. Increasing the research productivity of Webster faculty will provide increased opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in behavioral and biomedical research with a greater likelihood that they choose careers in those areas. We propose to provide training to faculty in grant writing, cultivate undergraduate researchers, and balance expectations for teaching, research, and service that will support incentives for promoting and attaining external grant funding. With this BRAD application, we strongly believe that Webster University is ideally positioned to make the transition to increased research and external funding, while promoting opportunities for under-represented minority students to be a critical part of STEM, biomedical, and behavioral research."
"9264922","Project Summary This Fast Track SBIR project long term objective is to develop and test of a minimum viable product (MVP) of The Oaks, a perioperative, digital, education, assessment and guided exercise software application for adults with osteoarthritis of the knee (KOA) awaiting total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. This product is relevant to the mission of the NIA because it addresses the call for ?Development of technologies to assist in the improvement of physical function and mobility in older persons prior to (prehabilitaiton) or following (rehabilitation) elective/ planed surgery?. The envisioned MVP is an elegantly simple mobile application that is designed to specifically measure the Centers for Medicare/Medicaid's (CMS) Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) required assessments and physical performance assessments prior to and following TKR, provide educational content typically contained in pre-operative TKR classes and track recovery of function for 30 days following TKR surgery. This product was conceived in response to four main drivers: 1) the growing number of adults aging with KOA needing TKR, 2) the need for developing improved patient care perioperatively for TKR surgeries, 3) the finding that attending educational classes and performing strengthening exercises prior to TKR improves outcomes and lowers post surgical medical utilization potentially saving billions of dollars and 4) the CMS CJR rule requiring healthcare systems to reduce the cost of care delivery for TKR surgeries, within a diminishing bundled payment. This application is very timely and has great potential for widespread adoption, as it will be designed based on end user feedback, from all stakeholder groups including people with KOA and the medical care team. Broad Objective: We intend to translate existing evidence-based educational material, assessments and exercises to a mobile device for widespread dissemination and adoption to prevent functional decline pre and post operatively, promote health and wellbeing and improve patient care and outcomes through coordinated higher quality of care. Approach: In Phase I we will 1) employ user-centered design methodologies to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) Alpha version of The Oaks for adults over age 60 with TKR surgery and 2) identify and evaluate feature and content expansions/adaptations for The Oaks Beta MVP. In Phase II we will 1) employ user-centered, iterative design approaches to develop The Oaks Beta MVP and we will 2) complete feasibility, usability, and a pilot effectiveness study. Research Design: We will use a between subjects 1-way ANOVA, (App/No-App) repeated measures (pre/post-surgery) design to determine feasibility, usability and effectiveness (pilot data) of The Oaks. Participants will self-select class/no-class and then be randomized to App (Group 1) or No-app (Group 2) stratified by class/no class. Expected Outcomes: We believe that The Oaks will be a feasible and usable adjunct to TKR for KOA perioperatively and for 30 days post surgery. The app will provide healthcare professionals with important data regarding function while reducing the cost of care delivery.  "
"9206086","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           HIV/AIDS is a significant health risk to both male and female veterans, and is transmitted predominantly by heterosexual intercourse. A roadblock to the discovery of efficacious prevention modalities, including vaccines and microbicides, is the incomplete understanding of basic virus-host interactions that underlie the acquisition of mucosal HIV-1 infection in the female genital tract. Two recent NIH workshops on Mucosal Immunity and HIV Prevention highlighted under-explored fundamental questions that need to be addressed, including anatomical sites of early virus infection in the female reproductive tract (FRT), and the influence  of endogenous sex hormones on the mucosal environment and susceptibility to HIV-1. We submit that the endometrial mucosa of the uterus constitutes a site of early HIV-1 infection. (i) The upper FRT (uFRT) is accessible to pathogens. The uterus is readily accessible to sperm, experimental microspheres, viral and bacterial pathogens, and possibly HIV-1 virions attached to sperm. (ii) The cervical mucus is an imperfect barrier and upward myometrium contractions likely promote delivery of semen content into the uFRT. (iii) The uFRT comprises an abundance of HIV-1 target cells beneath the epithelium lining. (iv) Cellular and innate immune functions in the uFRT are suppressed during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. (v) Previous studies on HIV-1 infection of UEC are. (vi) Innovative and transformative virologic strategies are available in our laboratory that will facilitate physiologically relevant studies using primary mucosal transmission models, including transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 infectious molecular clones (IMC), and HIV- 1 reporter genomes that augment both sensitivity and specificity for dissecting early virus-host mucosal interactions. (vii) We present preliminary results that to our knowledge demonstrate for the first time UEC are susceptible to infection by T/F. Therefore, there exists essential virologic underpinnings and compelling rationale to further examine the uFRT as a potential site for the acquisition of mucosal HIV-1 infection and transmission. Our central hypothesis is that the uFRT mucosa is vulnerable to productive T/F HIV-1 infection. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To determine the susceptibility of primary UEC to productive infection by T/F, chronic control and laboratory strains of HIV-1. Viruses expressing T/F envs from isogenic reporter proviral genomes will be studied, enabling sensitive and specific analyses of productive HIV-1 infection in a primary UEC model of virus infection. Importantly, chronic control viruses will be analyzed in parallel experiments to rigorously address the question of whether T/F viruses possess unique fitness properties for infecting potential target cells that exist in the uFRT mucosa. (2) To elucidate cis and trans infection pathways by which T/F HIV-1 spreads from primary UEC to endometrial CD4+ T lymphocytes. Mucosal CD4+ T cells isolated from endometrium will first be analyzed for their susceptibility to infection by T/F and control viruses to establish important underpinnings for subsequent experiments with UEC. The following experiments will elucidate susceptibilities of autologous CD4+ T cells to HIV-1 infection mediated by de novo produced virus from infected UEC or transcytosis of intact/infectious virus particles. The results will be analyzed to elucidate  virus subtype- and strain-specific susceptibilities of UEC and CD4+ T lymphocytes to HIV-1 infection, and identify mechanisms/pathways of virus entry and correlations of these factors with menstrual cycle stage. Such findings promise to provide critical underpinnings for translational prevention research initiatives."
"9397352","PROJECT SUMMARY Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of sexually transmitted diseases, non-congenital infertility, and the blinding eye disease called trachoma. This obligate intracellular bacterium replicates within a membrane bound compartment, the inclusion, where it utilizes a specialized protein export system called the type III secretion system to translocate effector proteins into the cytoplasm of the host cell. A unique subfamily of type III effector proteins the Inclusion membrane proteins (Incs), is inserted into the inclusion membrane, with its N- and C- termini ideally poised at the host-pathogen interface to interact with host proteins and organelles. However, our understanding of the function of Incs has been limited, as they share little homology to each other or to other known proteins, and genetic manipulation of Chlamydia only recently become possible. To define the C. trachomatis Inc-human protein interactome, the Engel lab performed a high-throughput affinity-purification mass spectroscopy screen of 58 predicted Incs. Remarkably, a subset of Incs was identified to target components of the host ubiquitin (Ub) machinery, which prompts the hypothesis that a subset of Chlamydia Incs may modulate host ubiqutylation during infection and that these changes may be critical to the pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infection. Ubiquitylation, which involves the covalent attachment of Ub to a target protein by an E1 Ub-activating enzyme, an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 Ub ligase, alters the function, stability, or location of the Ub-modified protein within the cell. Modulating protein ubiquitylation during infection is an emerging theme for intracellular pathogens. Indeed, previous studies have established that C. trachomatis infection globally alters the host protein stability; however, how Inc-Ub machinery interactions reshape the host proteome is unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how interactions between specific Incs and the host Ub machinery alters the host Ub landscape and promotes Chlamydia pathogenesis. In aim 1, a newly developed MS-based ubiquitin remnant profiling (URP) approach and bioinformatics will be used to globally define C. trachomatis-induced changes in the host ubiquinome. These changes will be compared to data sets for other intracellular pathogens obtained by a similar pipeline to identify changes in protein ubiquitylation that are specific to Chlamydia infections as well as protein ubiquitylation events that are common targets of intracellular pathogens. In aim 2, a combination of URP, host and bacterial genetics, and cell and molecular biology will be used to identify changes in the host ubiquinome that are dependent on the Inc (CT383) and its interactions with components of host Ub machinery. Together, these studies will provide critical new insights on the mechanisms by which C. trachomatis reprograms the host cell through ubiquitylation to promote pathogenesis. !"
"9282431","Abstract (Pilot and Feasibility Program) The goal of the Indiana Diabetes Research Center (IDRC) Pilot and Feasibility Program is to provide pilot funding for projects that have outstanding potential to open an area of diabetes-related research to both new and established investigators in diverse scientific disciplines at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) and Purdue University (Purdue). The Pilot and Feasibility Program will foster the development of a community of productive, well-connected investigators whose work leads to advances in the treatment of diabetes and its complications. The IDRC Pilot and Feasibility program has identified areas of scientific strength at the affiliated institutions that might be leveraged to open new and promising investigations. Specifically, the aims of the Pilot and Feasibility Program are: (1): To solicit, review, and fund Pilot and Feasibility grants. These grants will be provided to outstanding beginning and established investigators at IUSM and Purdue whose expertise is complimentary to areas of strength within the IDRC membership, whose research has a high probability of benefiting from use of the IDRC core facilities, and for whom such funding may result in acquisition of major peer-reviewed grants. (2): To provide mentorship/support for recipients of Pilot and Feasibility grants. The goal of these relationships will be to provide a source of intellectual support and critique during the project period to facilitate the application of the grantee's scientific expertise to an area of investigation that is new to them. These relationships will also encourage future collaboration between investigators receiving Pilot and Feasibility grants and the other members of the IDRC. Successful execution of this plan will result in new independent investigators focused on solving problems related to diabetes and complications of diabetes, a stronger diabetes research community in Indiana, and scientific discoveries that may lead to new treatment strategies for people with diabetes."
"9481399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year more than one million Americans require interventions to treat atherosclerotic vascular disease. Unfortunately these interventions trigger the development of recurrent disease or restenosis of the treated vessel. Although preventative therapies have been developed, restenosis still develops in 10-15% of coronary and up to 80% of lower extremity interventions (depending upon the vascular bed). Further insights into the mechanisms that underlie restenosis will aid in the development of improved therapeutics. Two major processes contribute to restenosis: 1) thickening of the neointima, termed intimal hyperplasia, and 2) changes in the vessel wall diameter resulting in either constrictive or adaptive remodeling. Our previous discoveries verify that TGFß is a dominant factor involved in both of these processes. The role of the cytokine TGFß in vascular disease has been a conundrum because of the paradox that in vitro, TGFß produces a highly differentiated smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype, however in vivo, TGFß stimulates SMC de-differentiation and intimal hyperplasia. We have discovered over the past grant period, a unique explanation for this conundrum: elevated levels of Smad3 that develop following vascular intervention, transform TGß into a stimulant of SMC de-differentiation, proliferation, migration and inflammation (MCP-1 production), and an inhibitor of apoptosis, all signature behaviors that promote intimal hyperplasia. Surprisingly, elevated levels of TGFß and Smad3 following arterial intervention also produce the favorable by-product of adaptive remodeling or vessel wall expansion. Inspired by these provocative findings, we are eager to continue our investigations of TGFß/Smad3 with the goal of 1) gaining further insights into TGFß's role in the pathophysiology of restenosis, 2) developing new strategies to inhibit restenosis by manipulating SMC de-differentiation and 3) developing therapeutic strategies to inhibit restenosis by blocking both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGFß signaling. In Specific Aim-1, we will dissect and differentiate the pathways through which TGFß/Smad3 stimulates intimal hyperplasia (pro-restenosis) versus adaptive remodeling (anti-restenosis), taking advantage of a series of mutants that produce differential expression of Smad3-responsive genes. In Specific Aim-2, we aim to better understand the factors through which TGFß/Smad3 produces SMC de- differentiation with the theory that blocking de-differentiation and/or enhancing differentiation will prevent intimal hyperplasia. In Specific Aim-3, we will determine the role of Smad-independent pathways in TGFß- induced restenosis, and then design combination therapies to simultaneously block Smad3 signaling with a Smad3-inhibiting peptide, and non-Smad pathway(s) with their specific inhibitors. Our ultimate goal is to identify agents that effectively prevent the development of recurrent vascular disease, a process affecting hundreds of thousands of patients each year."
"9462470","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. The overall goal of this proposed study is to use genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), including expression QTLs (eQTLs), protein QTLs (pQTLs), and DNase I sensitivity QTLs (dsQTLs), to map non-coding regulatory elements in human brain, then to use the QTL SNPs to uncover regulatory mechanisms underlying GWAS findings and to discover novel risk genes.  Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We hypothesize that other QTLs will similarly represent other levels of regulation. So, using QTL mapping, we will identify SNPs affecting chromatin accessibility in brain (dsQTLs), and downstream gene and protein level variations (eQTLs and pQTLs). We will use RNA-seq, micro-western arrays (MWAs), reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs), and DNase-seq to profile prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of 432 postmortem brains, along with sorted NeuN+ and NeuN- nuclei. Using the optimal deconvolution method, all brain measures will be partitioned into neuronal and non-neuronal measures for QTL mapping. We will thereafter re-analyze existing GWAS data for seven psychiatric diseases, plus three non- psychiatric diseases/traits as controls, to understand the contributions of neuronal- and non- neuronal QTL SNPs to disease risks. We will also look for differential expressions of transcripts and proteins, as well as for differential DNA sensitivities, in patient brains, and use these molecular measures to construct novel regulatory networks. This integrative study represents a timely, novel and powerful approach that will transform our understanding of brain genomics and the genetic risks of psychiatric diseases. It is positioned to create a new paradigm for integrating brain genomics and psychiatric genetics that are truly distinct from current approaches."
"9375603","PROJECT SUMMARY: Peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs) are a promising therapeutic target in stroke and other brain injury states because they frequently occur after brain injuries and negatively impact tissue vitality by inducing pronounced change in hemodynamics. Although PIDs that occurred over chronic time scales were confirmed to lead to neuronal deterioration in patients, most animal studies are limited at the acute phase for up to a few hours post occlusions, largely due to a lack of methods capable of simultaneously quantifying neurophysiological and hemodynamic parameters with sufficient spatial resolution over periods of weeks to months. As a result, the hemodynamic and neural consequences of chronically occurred PIDs remains poorly understood, limiting the ability to clearly target them to optimize and tailor intervention strategies. The objective of this project is to provide systematic characterization of PIDs in a mouse stroke model by spatially resolving and mapping of hemodynamics and neural activity from acute to chronic time scales and at controlled infarction size. The hypothesis is that such systematic characterization of PIDs will be enabled by developing a chronically viable, multimodal platform that integrates high-resolution functional optical imaging of hemodynamics and targeted photothrombosis with spatially resolved electrical recording of neural activity. We will use two types of ultra- flexible nanoelectronic neural probes for different detection ranges and resolutions, both of which are compatible with chronic optical methods. We will employ a novel optical system combining multi-exposure speckle imaging and phosphorescence lifetime quenching to simultaneously image and quantify cerebral blood flow and oxygen tension chronically, which also enables targeted photothrombosis with fine control over the lesion location and size. We will pursue the following aims: 1: Characterize and optimize the multi-modal platform for acute and chronic studies at awake. 2: Determine the chronic consequences of PIDs on hemodynamics and neural activity, including to quantify and spatially map the hemodynamic consequence of chronic occurring PIDs, and to determine the cortical-depth and lesion-size dependence of PID characteristics. The application is highly innovative, in the applicant?s opinion, because it integrated technical advancements at multiple fronts to provide a highly novel and powerful combination that permits studies of PIDs in previously unattainable temporal and spatial regimes. The application is significant, because it is expected to vertical advance the fundamental understanding the induction and consequences of PIDs, and to have broad translational importance in the intervention of a number of neurological conditions where PIDs are known to occur. The long-term goal of this project is to quantify the risk of PIDs with extreme variability in the size, location, severity, and mechanism similar to those occurred in human strokes in order to develop and optimize intervention strategy and improve tissue outcome after stroke."
"9362814","ABSTRACT In the United States, nearly 70,000 new cases of primary brain tumors are diagnosed every year. Although significant advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of brain cancers, the mortality rate has remained steady for more than 30 years. Patients have a five-year overall survival rate from 5% to 40% depending on the histological subtype; survival is dismal for glioblastomas (5% survival rate at five years). A promising new approach to treat brain cancer is immunotherapy. Several immune-based drugs are currently in development for brain tumors, including anti-CD47 antibodies. However, some types of brain tumors are relatively resistant to anti-CD47 antibodies, due at least in part to the difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), even the abnormal BBB observed in brain tumors. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has emerged as an effective, non-invasive treatment for brain lesions through the intact skull.1 MRgFUS causes intravenously injected microbubbles to oscillate, which mechanically disrupts the BBB in a targeted, transient, and non-toxic manner, increasing its permeability to large molecules into the brain. In preclinical studies, BBB opening has been used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents, antibodies, stem cells, and targeted genes. Although studies have probed the effect of MRgFUS on normal brain tissue, including changes in BBB opening and sterile inflammation in the normal brain microenvironment, the effect of MRgFUS has not been studied in brain tumors. In this study, we will investigate the use of MRgFUS on brain tumor tissue, with the goal of enhancing the effect of immunotherapies on brain tumors. Using mice with orthotopic brain tumor grafts (mouse tumors and human glioblastomas), we will assess (1) how MRgFUS affects the microenvironment of brain tumor tissue, (2) whether MRgFUS enhances the delivery of anti-CD47 antibodies in brain tumor tissue, and (3) whether MRgFUS increases the efficacy of immunotherapy on brain tumors without increasing the risk of toxicity to the normal brain tissue. Our results could be applied to other anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies, and standard chemotherapeutic agents for a range of brain tumors. By better understanding the effect of MRgFUS and MRgFUS+microbubbles on the brain tumor microenvironment, this research will open a path to safely enhancing the effect of treatments for malignant primary brain tumors."
"9269473","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunity to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) following infection is complex, and not fully protective against reactivation and reinfection with new strains. Although generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent adults, infection or reinfection in pregnant women can be devastating to the developing fetus if transplacental transmission occurs. Because of the lifelong disabilities caused by congenital CMV infection, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), understanding the host defense determinants that protect the developing fetus is critical, toward the goal of developing an effective preconception vaccine. Clinical trials of an adjuvanted glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine showed protection in young women of childbearing age, but waning immunity and modest efficacy (~50%) necessitate consideration of other subunit strategies. Recent evidence suggests that the pentameric complex (PC) of CMV proteins (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131) may be a more compelling vaccine target for induction of protective antibody responses than gB. This stems from the observations that antibodies to the PC potently block virus entry into epithelial and endothelial cells and leukocytes. Moreover, acquisition of these antibodies correlates with a reduced risk of fetal transmission in women with primary CMV infection. To address whether a PC-based vaccine provides superior protection against congenital CMV transmission to that conferred by a gB-based vaccine, we will compare MVA- vectored gB and PC vaccines in the guinea pig model of congenital CMV infection, using the guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) homologs of these proteins. In addition to comparing the endpoints of maternal and pup mortality, congenital GPCMV infection, and magnitude of viral load following high-dose GPCMV challenge during pregnancy (aim 1), we will compare these vaccines for their ability to confer protection against SNHL (aim 2) following low-dose challenge during pregnancy. This study will represent the first animal model evaluation of a prenatal vaccine to prevent congenital CMV-induced labyrinthitis and SNHL. We will also address a second area of significant complexity in CMV vaccines, namely, addressing the phenomena of re-infection during pregnancy. It has become increasingly clear that, in spite of preconception immunity, women can become re-infected with new strains of HCMV, and these strains can be transmitted to the fetus, leading to injury. Therefore, in aim 3, we will utilze a newly discovered strain of GPCMV, the CIDMTR strain, to model re- infection studies in the guinea pig. We will test whether MVA-PC vaccination can provide superior protection compared to gB vaccine against re-infection and subsequent fetal transmission in dams with preconception immunity to a heterotypic strain, the ATCC (22122) strain. Since most congenital CMV infections occur in the context of non-primary maternal infections, these studies will substantially advance the field, and clarify what is required of a CMV vaccine in women of childbearing age."
"9398677","PROJECT SUMMARY Diet is a modifiable exposure that can positively or negatively impact health. More than half of adults and one-third of children use dietary supplements that contain nutrients critical to human health. Currently no metric exists to measure overall total nutrient exposures from all sources. Without measuring the contribution of dietary supplements, exposure classification is incomplete both for nutrient inadequacy and nutrient excess. Using a data-driven strategy with the nationally- representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the assembled, highly qualified team proposes to develop the first comprehensive total nutrient index. Indexes and scores are the preferred metric for use in nutrition because the standardized framework they create allows comparison across studies. In fact, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee, building on systematic reviews from the USDA Nutrition Evidence Library, concluded that only diets classified by indexes and scores were useful for informing nutrition policy. The synthesis of the data in the report yielded strong and consistent evidence for dietary patterns classified by indexes and scores, and cardiovascular disease and weight status, and moderate evidence for dietary patterns and Type 2 diabetes. However, no index or score is available that accounts for nutrients derived from dietary supplements and medications. In Aim 1, the team will develop a usual intake model that captures habitual intakes from food, beverages, dietary supplements, and medication, mitigiating the measurement error to the extent possible with self-reported dietary intakes. In Aim 2, the team will characterize the patterns of nutrient intake, using data reduction techniques to create the most salient items to include in the index. The patterns will be carefully examined with regard to biomarkers, health behaviors, and measures of bone and body composition, to create a scoring algorithm for the total nutrient index. In Aim 3, the team will test the reliability and the validity of the total nutrient index. The purpose of the total nutrient index is to provide a tool that can be used for research, monitoring, and policy purposes, and the use of the NHANES data to develop the total nutrient index greatly enhances its external validity. Improving measures of dietary exposure will facilitate researchers' abilities to show causal links to health, ultimately enabling successful intervention strategies."
"9246519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is known about the neurocircuit and neurobiological bases for regulation of feeding and metabolism, and this has greatly limited progress in understanding and treating obesity and feeding disorders. Lack of knowledge in this area is due, in large part, to complexity within brain regions controlling these processes - namely those that lie within and are connected to the hypothalamus. Each anatomic subregion contains many different types of neurons, each controlling unrelated, opposite or unknown functions. While general information exists regarding connectivity between subregions, this provides little mechanistic insight because the functions of the different neurons within each subregion are complex and/or unknown, and the labeled lines connecting specific upstream neurons to specific downstream neurons are also not known. In essence, we lack a wiring diagram for hypothalamic control of behavior and physiology. With recent technological advances, enabled by neuron-specific Cre-expressing mice, it is now possible in a cell-specific fashion to establish connectivity and function. The present proposal utilizes such approaches to delineate the neurocircuitry underlying leptin regulation of energy balance. These studies build upon our recent discovery that the majority of leptin's anti-obesity effects are mediated by leptin receptors on GABAergic neurons. In Aim 1, we set out to identify the source of leptin-responsive GABAergic input to POMC and AgRP neurons. In preliminary studies, using Cre-dependent monosynaptic rabies mapping and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping, we have determined that, for POMC neurons, leptin-responsive GABAergic input is entirely from local neurons (all within the arcuate), while for AgRP neurons, very strong leptin-responsive GABAergic input comes from the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). Given the key functional importance of these DMH afferents to AgRP neurons in controlling hunger (as shown in Aim 2), we are using Single-Neuron RNA-Seq to determine their identity, to detect genes likely to suggest function (such as those involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and transport, neuropeptides and receptors), and to begin a search for possible drug targets. In Aim 2, we are using optogenetic techniques in awake, behaving mice to determine the role of DMH leptin receptor-expressing GABAergic inputs to AgRP neurons in regulating hunger. In preliminary studies we have discovered that optogenetic activation of these afferents completely blocks hunger, even that caused by fasting. Thus, these neurons are previously unknown potent regulators of hunger. Finally, in Aim 3, we are performing optetrode recordings in awake, behaving mice to determine, in real time, the firing rate of AgRP neurons and their DMH leptin-responsive GABAergic afferents. By using light/ChR2- evoked spiking to identify neurons, these studies address previously inaccessible questions regarding effects of behavioral and physiologic perturbations on in vivo firing rates. In total, these studies should significantly advance our understanding of how leptin, and the circuits it regulates, control eating and energy balance."
"9292325","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal circuits for local synaptic processing In this application, three widely-known laboratories with complementary expertise that specialize in studying function of retinal circuitry propose to investigate mechanisms of signal processing within On- and Off-bipolar cell types in the mammalian retina. Bipolar cells are essential for the retina because they transmit signals from photoreceptors in the outer retina to amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner retina. They are thought to be non-spiking neurons that relay signals via graded depolarization.  However, recently bipolar cells in several species have been reported to generate spike-like calcium transients that may generate bursts of neurotransmitter release similar to those found at most central synapses.  In preliminary studies, we showed that mouse bipolar cells also display such spike-like transient events and that independent calcium events can be generated in different axon terminal branches. Using a combination of physiological and computational methods, this project will determine whether the calcium transients in bipolar cell axon terminals represent full- blown spikes, and what computational functions they can perform. Using a live ex vivo mouse retina, we will record responses of bipolar cells and ganglion cells to light stimuli, and construct computational models of the responses to determine the biophysical mechanisms present. The project comprises three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether individual bipolar cell axon terminal branches can respond to light independently. This aim will use two-photon calcium imaging in whole-mounted retina to test several hypotheses about the signals that are generated and relayed by graded potentials and spikes in the bipolar cell axon terminal to postsynaptic ganglion cells.  Aim 2 will determine the influence of inhibitory feedback to bipolar cells on their spike-like events, using whole-cell patch clamp in retinal slices and whole-mounts.  Integrating the results from Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop realistic computational models that will enable us to test novel hypotheses about local processing functions performed by spikes and graded potentials in bipolar cell terminals. We will develop computer models of identified types of bipolar cell with different axon terminal morphologies. This will allow us to determine the critical parameters for independence of signals in bipolar cell axon terminals. In particular, we will explore the role of inhibitory feedback from amacrine cells in modulating spikes and graded signals in bipolar cell axon terminals, to support signal independence between terminals and control their vesicle release with precise timing. Overall, the project will reveal how mammalian bipolar cells transform the graded potentials they receive from photoreceptors with high fidelity into spike-like transient events in their axon terminals, and how these signals interact with inhibitory feedback to modulate bipolar synaptic output. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the signal processing of the adult retina. As bipolar cells are critical targets for stimulation by visual prostheses and genetic approaches to restoring vision loss from a range of eye diseases, the knowledge gained here will guide the further development of such devices and treatments."
"9367815","PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the most lethal of any of the common cancers. Targeted therapy has a demonstrated benefit in the treatment of lung cancer so identifying novel druggable pathways is a priority. Glutathione S- transferase P1 (GSTP1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational modification, protein S- glutathionylation. Our preliminary data indicate that 1) GSTP1 over-expression and increased protein S- glutathionylation occurs in approximately 40% of human resected lung adenocarcinomas and is associated with a worse prognosis for early lung cancers; 2) GSTP1-induced S-glutathionylation is important for glycolysis and tumorigenesis in our models of lung adenocarcinoma, and pharmacological GSTP1 inhibition results in decreased tumor formation; and 3) GSTP1-induced S-glutathionylation controls pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) conformation. GSTP1 expression is strongly associated with a worse prognosis with a potential ability to identify high-risk individuals who may benefit from targeted treatment strategies. TLK199 is an orally available agent and has an excellent safety profile in Phase II trials (for hematologic cancers). This proposal will focus on addressing the mechanisms of GSTP1-induced S-glutathionylation and its role in tumorigenesis and evaluating the potential for GSTP1 targeted therapies. The hypothesis: S- glutathionylation (notably of PKM2) driven by GSTP1 is important in increasing glycolysis during lung tumorigenesis. Ways to attenuate or reverse S-glutathionylation are thus anticipated to decrease glycolysis and to disrupt tumor cell growth and will be tested in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the impact of inhibition of S-glutathionylation or its reversal on KRASG12D-induced tumorigenesis in an inducible lung cancer mouse model and evaluate the effect of TLK199 on tumor development and growth. This system will also allow us to identify further downstream metabolic effects and targets of GSTP1-induced protein S- glutathionylation. Aim 2 will address the importance of pyruvate kinase M2 in KRASG12D-induced tumorigenesis and investigate the impact of GSTP-linked PKM2 glutathionylation. The goal of Aim 3 is to evaluate GSTP1, overall S-glutathionylation and PKM2 in adenocarcinoma and in primary adenocarcinoma-generated patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mice. We will establish PDX mice from lung cancer biopsies from our actively enrolling lung cancer study at the University of Vermont and the effects of pharmacological inhibition of GSTP on primary tumor cell and PDX mice will be evaluated. Completion of the Aims of this proposed work may prove foundational for clinical investigation of the GSTP1 inhibitor TLK199 for treatment of lung cancer."
"9282377","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal leverages and extends the MOBILIZE Boston Study (MBS), which previously demonstrated significant relationships between abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation, slow gait speed, and the development of falls in a representative population of elderly people living in the Boston metropolitan area. Our findings have led to the hypothesis that alterations in CBF regulation are associated with microvascular damage to periventricular and subcortical white matter in the brain, which ultimately results in slowing of gait, executive dysfunction, and falls. We also hypothesize that those individuals who can redistribute blood flow to healthy cortical networks during cognitive or motor tasks can prevent slowing of gait and falls, despite the presence of white matter damage. The current proposal will add rigorous transcranial Doppler and neuroimaging (structural, diffusion tensor, and functional MRI) measures to the third assessment of 250 MBS participants to determine whether: 1) reduced CBF in response to a cognitive or motor task (neurovascular coupling), is longitudinally associated with the slowing of gait speed, executive dysfunction, functional decline, and recurrent falls over 2 years of followup; 2) abnormalities in CBF regulation, including CO2 vasoreactivity and neurovascular coupling, are associated with loss of white and gray matter microstructural integrity on MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); 3) these structural changes in the brain are associated with slowing of gait, executive dysfunction, functional decline, and recurrent falls over 2 years; and 4) the brain's ability to increase blood flow to healthy regions during cognitive or motor tasks can attenuate the adverse effects of white or gray matter microstructural damage on functional decline and falls. The study is unique in focusing on alterations in CBF as a pathological mechanism of falls, developing cutting-edge MR imaging techniques to detect early microstructural markers of brain damage that can predict falls, and identifying a compensatory mechanism that protects some people from the effects of this damage on falls - all in a large representative elderly cohort. Our successful 7-year retentio and followup of the MBS cohort and collaboration with the Boston VA Neuroimaging Center will help assure we achieve our goals. Relevance: This study will provide novel information necessary for the early detection and ultimate prevention of cerebrovascular causes of falls and mobility impairments in elderly people. If abnormal brain blood flow is discovered to be a cause of falls, currently available interventions to increase brain blood flow, prevent cerebrovascular damage, grow new blood vessels, or build new neural pathways may prevent future falls."
"9384493","Abstract Human liposarcoma (LPS) is a deadly and the most common soft tissue cancer whose cellular origin and molecular regulation are unclear. Using a novel transgenic mouse model, we made a seminal discovery in our unpublished preliminary results that aberrant activation Notch signaling in mature adipocytes drives their dedifferentiation and formation of LPS. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction cascade that plays an important role in development, cell-cell communication and stem cell differentiation. Aberrant Notch activity has been implicated in several types of cancers including leukemia, breast cancer and osteosarcoma but its role in LPS has not been reported. While our series of preliminary studies have established the adipocyte origin and pathogenic process of LPS in the mouse model, several imperative questions stood out to be addressed in the proposed work. First, we will distinguish the relative role of Notch activity and metabolic dysfunction ? an accompanying feature of the LPS transgenic mouse model ? in the development and pathogenesis of LPS. Second, we will investigate the role of Notch signaling in human liposarcomas. Third, we will dissect and molecular mechanisms underlying Notch-driven LPS based on our preliminary genomics and lipidomics results, and futher explore therapeutic interventions to treat the murine and human LPS in xenograft mouse models. Results from the proposed work will for the first time uncover the oncogenic function of Notch signaling in adipocytes and adipose tissue, one of the most important metabolic organs in the body. In addition, our transgenic mouse model will represent a unique tool to study the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of human LPS."
"9280858","PROJECT SUMMARY Pediatric obesity is a multifaceted public health concern. Nearly one-third of children with obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) ? 95th percentile for age and gender, exhibit cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF), which are associated with accelerated cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and morbidity. Small changes in diet, weight loss, or physical activity can significantly reduce risk for CRF. Although evidence-based interventions delivered by healthcare providers (physicians, nurses, dieticians) exist for the prevention of pediatric obesity for high-risk youth, low participation rates and program availability, as well as nonadherence to recommendations, are significant barriers to positive outcomes. Although they are not widely used, family-centered behavioral interventions are an evidence-based approach that has been found to significantly prevent obesity in children and adolescents. The proposed study uses an adaptation of the Family Check-Up (FCU) to target health behavior (HB) change, termed the FCU-HB program, in youth with elevated BMI. Extensive data support the original FCU's efficacy in improving child outcomes across domains of health and functioning, including the prevention of obesity, through family-level mechanisms of action. The FCU-HB is an assessment-driven approach to tailoring services and increasing motivation to address the behavioral health needs of overweight and obese children and their families. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial to test the effects of the FCU-HB program in pediatric primary care with a multiethnic sample of 350 families with children ages 6 to 12 years who are identified as obese (BMI?95th percentile) or overweight (BMI?85th percentile) with risk identified through the electronic health records (EHR). The FCU-HB will be coordinated with care in three primary care clinics: the general pediatrics clinic at Phoenix Children's Hospital and two federally qualified health centers. All three clinics serve predominantly Medicaid patients and a large ethnic minority population of Mexican Americans and American Indians, who face disparities in pediatric obesity, CRF, and access to care when compared with Non-Latino Whites. Consistent with the literature, providers have reported barriers to pediatric obesity treatment with respect to family functioning, motivation, and adherence to recommendations. The FCU- HB was designed to reduce BMI by improving family engagement and behavioral health practices. This trial aims to facilitate sustainability and scale up. Community and scientific boards will provide guidance on study and program design to ensure the program achieves this aim and is found to improve children's weight. We will use a multi-method and multi-informant assessment strategy including EHR data, behavioral observation, questionnaires, and interviews to assess the impact of the FCU-HB on BMI as a primary outcome, child health behaviors, parenting, and service utilization. We will also assess implementation outcomes, including acceptability, adoption, feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and cost, which will provide actionable information for sustainable delivery in other healthcare systems.  "
"9297304","DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): In the armamentarium of techniques available for contemporary biomedical research carried out with humans at the basic, translational, and clinical level, magnetic resonance (MR) methods have become critical and indispensible, often providing non-invasive measurement capabilities that are simply unavailable from alternative approaches. The central aim of this Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC) grant is to significantly advance such MR based measurement capabilities and their biomedical applications in humans by: 1) developing novel image acquisition and reconstruction technologies and engineering solutions through five TRD (Technology Research and Development) projects, and 2) enabling a large number of Collaborative     and Service projects to acquire advanced structural, functional, and physiological information to investigate human organ function in health and disease, targeting both human brain and the abdominal organs. This central aim will be pursued with a focus on high (3 and 4 Tesla) and particularly ultrahigh (7 Tesla and higher) magnetic fields, which provide numerous advantages but also pose several significant technological challenges that must be overcome. This is a unique feature and a particular strength of this BTRC; ultrahigh field MR and numerous accompanying methods for human studies were pioneered in this BTRC, yielding previously unavailable detection sensitivity and precision. This BTRC is also home to some of the most advanced, unique and rare high field MR instrumentation in the world. Collectively, these unique instruments and the proposed methodological developments are expected to be transformative for MR technology and its applications."
"9277595","Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in ?Brain Machine Interfaces? (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs."
"9302395","Project Summary /Abstract Activation of RAGE (receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs)), via binding of AGEs and other ligands, modulates the development and progression of diabetic complications through persistent and cyclic activation of nuclear factor-?B. Targeting RAGE directly as a therapeutic strategy has largely been unsuccessful. However, RAGE signaling can be interrupted, in vivo, by ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) directed proteolytic cleavage of the RAGE ectodomain, and thus creating a soluble isoform of RAGE (sRAGE) that is released from the cell and appears into the circulation. Maintaining high levels of circulating sRAGE is advantageous as sRAGE will sequester RAGE ligands and prevent RAGE cell signaling. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications. Using aerobic exercise, we have elucidated a mechanism for ADAM10 upregulation to increase RAGE shedding. Aerobic exercise presents a unique model for mechanistic study of RAGE shedding as muscle contraction provides stimuli for tissue remodeling and resolution of the metabolic milieu that drives inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that skeletal muscle is a quantitatively important source of sRAGE appearance in the circulation and maintenance of healthy levels of total sRAGE promotes cardiometabolic health. The rationale is that once the mechanisms of ADAM10 activation and sRAGE generation are elucidated, progress towards the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications may be possible. Compelled by noteworthy preliminary data, we propose three specific aims to pursue our central hypothesis: (1) we will test the effects of acute and chronic exercise in generating sRAGE isoforms (2) we will determine the effects of acitretin therapy on RAGE mediated inflammation and (3) we will explore new protective effects of sRAGE in the microvasculature. The work is innovative because the study of RAGE ectodomain shedding in human skeletal muscle challenges the current understanding of AGE/RAGE biology and the known behavior of ADAM10 activity. At the completion of these studies, it is our expectation that we will have identified a novel mechanism of ADAM10 activation and an important tissue source of sRAGE production. Ultimately, such an insight has the potential to improve the prevention and therapeutic management of diabetes and its complications, thus reducing the financial and social burden that affects the ~347 million people worldwide with diabetes."
"9285785","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical islet transplantation (CIT), the infusion of allogeneic islets into the liver, has shown significant promise in the long-term treatment of Type  diabetes by providing a cell-based means to mimic the normal physiological response to glucose. While promising, it is dampened by the impaired function and loss of islets following implantation. This loss is attributed to strong inflammatory and immunological responses to the transplant, primarily instigated by cell surface proteins and antigens. In this application, we see to minimize detrimental host responses that lead to islet engraftment failure by encapsulating the islets in novel ultrathin polymeric layers. Ultrathin coatings are generated through the covalent layer-by-layer assembly of biomaterials functionalized with bioorthogonal chemical handles. Through the controlled, covalent linking of polymers layers on the islet cell cluster surface, resulting stable capsules are on the order of 500-fold smaller than standard practices; thus, void volumes are dramatically reduced and nutritional transport and glucose sensing are unaffected. Further, the composition, structure, thickness, and function of these layers can be intricately controlled on the nanometer scale. Once fabricated, these ultrathin layers serve as ideal platforms for cell surface engineering, whereby bioactive motifs capable of dynamically interacting with implant-host interface can be tethered. As such, the inert biomaterial layer can be converted to a bioactive surface capable of actively altering the localized implant environment. We hypothesize that covalently stabilized, ultrathin coatings, generated via covalent layer-by-layer assembly, will enhance islet engraftment and functional duration by masking host recognition of surface antigens and proteins, without imparting limitations on nutrient or insulin diffusion. In addition, the tethering of bioactive agents capable of instructin immune responses will further enhance long-term survival of the transplanted islets. To test this hypothesis, biostable, covalently-linked, ultrathin coatings will be generated on the islet surface using biocompatible polymers capable of masking surface antigens and inflammatory proteins (Aim 1). Additionally, the surface of ultrathin coatings will be functionalized with immunomodulatory agents capable of directing host innate and adaptive immune responses at the transplant interface (Aim 2). Aims will be evaluated both in vitro and in diabetic murine models. The design of effective strategies to build tailored nano-thin layers on the islet surface capable of expressing active immunomodulatory agents could significantly improve the efficacy and long-term stability of islet transplants in the absence of chronic, systemic immunosuppression."
"9353217","The number of HIV infections among men who have sex with men aged 15-24 (YMSM) has grown significantly  in the past decade. The HIV epidemic among YMSM is marked by staggering disparities by race and ethnicity.  Despite this burgeoning epidemic, there is a dearth of interventions that have proven efficacious for reducing  HIV risk among this population. For YMS to successfully engage in HIV prevention and care services requires  that they navigate a series of multilevel barriers operating at the individual (e.g., risk awareness, self-efficacy to  get tested), systems (e.g., costs, medical mistrust, lack of culturally competent care), and structural (e.g.,  homelessness, costs, stigma) levels. We developed Get Connected (GC) as an online brief intervention that  employs individual and systems-level tailoring technology to reduce barriers to linkage to competent prevention  care (e.g., HIV/STI testing, PrEP) for YMSM (ages 15-24). GC is responsive to the ATN RFA as its multilevel  approach recognizes and addresses individual and structural factors that may impede HIV/STI testing and  PrEP uptake among YMSM. As part of the proposed iTech U19, we will test the efficacy of GC for increasing  YMSM's successful engagement in locally appropriate HIV prevention and care. With a large (n=400) and  diverse sample of YMSM, drawn from three sites characterized by high HIV incidence among youth (Houston,  Philadelphia and New Orleans) we propose of two-arm randomized control trial with 12 months of follow-up.  Primary outcomes include (1) HIV/STI risk behaviors, (2) repeat HIV/STI testing among HIV-negative high risk  YMSM, and (3) awareness and uptake of PrEP services. Secondary outcomes include treatment of incident  STIs and linkage and retention in care among incident HIV+ cases. We will also examine changes in GC's  theorized mechanisms of change, including YMSM's (1) self-efficacy to get tested, (2) perceived benefits and  barriers to get tested. To address structural influences on successful engagement in care, HIV/STI testing sites  listed in GC will receive quarterly performance assessments based on ratings that YMSM provide after visiting  their locations. We will examine sites' satisfaction with the quarterly performance assessments and their  improvements in service delivery when working with YMSM across the three study sites selected to test GC.  These activities will be paralleled by a cost input analysis to inform discussions of sustainability and roll out of  the GC intervention. If proven efficacious, Get Connected has the potential to significantly inform mechanisms  for linking YMSM to locally available HIV prevention services."
"9330512","Transgenic Mouse/Embryonic Stem Cell Shared Resource: Project Summary/Abstract For the past 22 years, the Transgenic Mouse/Embryonic Stem Cell Shared Resource (TMESCSR) has provided a cornerstone for many scientific advances within the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (VDRTC), and elsewhere. Not only have the TMESCSR-derived mice enabled hundreds of highly impactful studies to be performed by VDRTC investigators, they have also been utilized by numerous other non-VDRTC investigators who obtain these animals from public repositories. With the discovery of CRISPR/Cas, which enables the derivation of mice with precisely targeted mutations in a rapid and efficient manner, the TMESCSR made the strategic decision to discontinue its long-standing mouse ES cell (mESC)- based gene targeting service. This action enabled the personnel supporting this resource to optimize and deliver a new CRISPR/Cas-based service, while continuing to provide many other frequently utilized mouse- based services. Together, the services provided by the TMESCSR enable VDRTC members to efficiently derive mice with new genetic alterations, to maintain and cryopreserve existing mouse lines, and to derive new lines from the vast number of mutant mESCs and frozen embryos or sperm that are now available from several large-scale mutagenesis projects, including the Knock-out Mouse Project (KOMP). VDRTC support enables the TMESCSR to import and optimize new technology, such as CRISPR/Cas, thereby assuring that VDRTC investigators have continuing access to up-to-date strategies for deriving state-of-the-art mouse models. These mouse models, in turn, enable VDRTC members to perform high quality studies to understand the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity and other endocrine diseases, and to perform preclinical testing of new therapies for these diseases, utilizing the expertise in other VDRTC-supported cores (e.g. Cell Imaging Shared Resource, Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource, Hormone Assay and Analytical Services Core)."
"9298674","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Loss of endothelial cell (EC) barrier function is important in the development of indirect acute lung injury (ALI). We have shown, in a novel murine model of hemorrhage (shock) with a subsequent septic challenge caused by cecal ligation and performation (CLP), that neutrophil (PMN) interactions with resident pulmonary cells are central to this pathology. In ALI, unresolved inflammation elicits a pathological process with loss of EC barrier integrity and impaired lung function. EC growth factors, Angiopoietin (Ang)-i and 2, under physiological conditions, maintain vascular homeostasis through competitive interactions wdth the t3T:osine kinase receptor, Tie2, expressed on ECs. Ang-1/Tie2 binding has been shown to stabilize vessels and stimulate down stream pro-survival/anti-inflammatory signaling, in contrast, Ang-2, released from storage granules of activated ECs, destabilizes vessels. Recent findings report that plasma Ang-2 levels are significantly elevated in patients that develop ALI. We find similar elevation in the lungs and plasma in our shock/CLP model, and we have found that depletion of PMNs prior to shock abrogates Ang-2 elevation. We propose the following central hypothesis: Ang-2 causes loss of pulmonary EC barrier function in ALI due to shock/CLP, initiated by EC interaction with shock-primed PMNs. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the kinetics of change in Ang-1:Ang-2 and Ang-2 expression and re-synthesis as well as its relationship to changes in indices of inflammation. We will use Ang-2 (si)RNA to suppress lung tissue expression, Ang-2 protein specific inhibition, and Ang-1 competitive inhibition of Ang-2/Tie2 binding to assess the contribution of Ang-2 release in shock priming for the development of ALI. Aim 2 will determine mechanisms by which Ang-2 changes pulmonary EC phenotype/activation in response to plasma from mice with ALI/ARDS. Aim 3 will determine mechanisms by which Ang-2 mediates changes in EC phenotype /activation in cultured mouse ECs following co-culture with shock-primed PMNs. The studies in this proposal will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of PMN associated, Ang-2 mediated ALI and will elucidate pathways that hold potential for therapeutic intervention."

"9282488","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this study is the development of a framework to identify causal regulatory mutations in patients with serious neuropsychiatric presentations through the paired analyses of whole genome sequence and high resolution RNA sequence data from both accessible primary cells (PBMC and buccal cells) and reprogrammed neuronal cells from the same patients. The latter constitutes a particularly exciting opportunity as it will allow us to assay gene expression during different developmental stages of previously inaccessible cell types of much greater relevance to patient phenotype than the circulating cells DNA studies are customarily performed on. Specifically, we will interpret the effects of the regulatory variants in different developmental stages of the reprogrammed neuronal and other cells of interest with a comparison to the PBMC and buccal cells helping to interpret the specificity or generality of the relevant effects in different tissues. These analyses will focus nt only on mapping cis- and trans-acting eQTLs, but will also deploy new variant prioritization schemes that integrate knowledge of regulatory regions of the genome through ENCODE and related efforts as well as population genetic data. While an explicit aim of the work is to identif regulatory variants influencing risk of schizophrenia and autism, we emphasize that this work has primarily the broader goal of the development of appropriate frameworks for the eventual identification of such mutations, which inevitably will require substantially larger sample sizes that currently feasible to facilitate systematic discovery."
"9291488","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited X-linked disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin (Dmd), a protein required for muscle fiber integrity. DMD affects approximately 1 in 3,500 boys and is characterized by progressive severe muscle weakness and a shortened lifespan. Despite intense efforts to find cures for DMD through a variety of approaches, including myoblast transfer, viral delivery of dystrophin, and oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping, there remains no cure for this disease. We have recently used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated genome editing to correct the dystrophin gene (Dmd) mutation in the germ line of mdx mice, a model for DMD. Genome editing produced mosaic animals containing a wide range of correction (2 to 100%) of the Dmd gene. Interestingly, the degree of muscle phenotypic rescue in mosaic mice exceeded the efficiency of gene correction, likely reflecting an advantage of the corrected cells and their contribution to regenerating muscle. The major advantage of this genome editing approach is that it removes the genetic mutation responsible for the disease, allowing for permanent correction of muscle structure and function. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize and adapt CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to postnatal muscle and ultimately to leverage this approach to correct DMD mutations in humans. This project represents a close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists sharing the common goal of advancing an entirely new therapeutic strategy to permanently cure DMD. We refer to this new strategy as ?Myoediting?. To achieve our goals we plan to optimize CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent Dmd exon skipping (Myoediting) on genomic ?hot spots? in human muscle cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in culture. Based on the knowledge gained from these studies, we will establish a publicly available resource for selecting the optimal sequences for editing individual human DMD mutations. In addition, we will generate a ?humanized? mouse model of DMD as a means of assessing the consequences of specific exon skipping strategies in adult mice. We will also generate dystrophin reporter mice to allow assessment of the phenotypic consequences of Myoediting in living animals. Finally and most importantly, we will optimize the conditions for delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing components to skeletal muscle and the heart of mice. These studies will involve detailed phenotypic analysis of gene-edited mice and determination of safety of this gene editing approach. Ultimately, the optimized Myoediting method will be tested in pre-clinical studies of a canine model of Dmd as a prelude to eventual therapeutic translation of this approach."
"9332392","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 4D fluorescence microscopy is considered the workhorse for biomedical research. It provides a window into the spatially complex, temporally evolving physiology of living specimens with high specificity. The knowledge gained from the 4D space-time data has also facilitated the discovery of informative biomarkers that can be used for the early detection of diseases and for the development of drugs directed at new therapeutic targets. However, many cellular structures and events are below the spatial resolution limit of traditional fluorescence microscope and happen on sub-second time scale, putting them beyond our ability to investigate in greater detail. In addition, observing the fast evolving dynamic process over the entire 3D volume involves inevitable tradeoffs on spatial resolution, temporal resolution, sample-induced aberrations, and phototoxicity. This last point is especially important for 4D live-cell imaging, where phototoxicity caused by the high level of free radicals would alter the physiological state of living specimens. In this project, we propose to develop a super-resolution imaging method, termed fluorescence ptychographic microscopy, for 4D live cell imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and reduced phototoxicity. The proposed approach will be built upon the structured illumination microscopy (SIM) technique that combines multiple acquisitions under sinusoidal illumination patterns for super-resolution imaging. We aim to significantly shorten the acquisition time of the SIM approach by using a modified ptychographic recovery procedure developed in the PI?s lab. More importantly, we will also develop a ptychographic procedure that is able to correct for the unknown distortions of the sinusoidal patterns and compensate for the sample-induce wavefront aberrations. If successful, the proposed imaging procedure would provide a turnkey solution for 4D fluorescence microscopy with sub-diffraction spatial resolution and sub-second temporal resolution, with minimum invasiveness for the living specimen, and is able to compensate for sample-induced aberrations. Our long term goal is to translate advanced imaging technologies for the broad biomedical and clinical communities."
"9353200","Project Summary/Abstract  Adolescent HIV interventions call for more advanced analytic approaches than traditional HIV studies have used. HIV prevention and treatment research trials have traditionally been conducted in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) framework where study participants, often recruited from social service agencies, are randomized into an intervention or standard of care condition and followed over time. Outcome measures consist of self-reported mental health and HIV transmission behaviors. Three large changes are necessary for adolescent studies in the modern era of HIV research. First, youth are often difficult to identify and engage in HIV care. Innovative recruitment strategies that make use of traditional and technology-based methods are necessary to maximize efforts. Second, NIH research priorities target biomedical HIV endpoints. Combination strategies that target HIV end points and comorbid conditions are needed. Lastly, researchers need to plan for intervention delivery in real-world settings. Youth deal with many complex issues, such as homelessness, that can impede access to and delivery of care, directly impacting biological outcome markers. Studies in the proposed U19 proposal will address current challenges in HIV research by using comprehensive youth engagement strategies and combination prevention strategies to address HIV end points and comorbidities. Statistical methods will be used to evaluate interventions in the RCT framework through complex multilevel models (MLM) to evaluate multiple end points over time. In addition, implementation science methods will be used to examine barriers to HIV care and engagement in clinic settings.  The Analytic Core provides a range of technological, biomedical, and behavioral research expertise that will support research in the current U19 proposal. The Analytic Core is comprised of statisticians with expertise in fitting complex MLM in HIV studies that contain both biomarker and behavioral outcomes. Technologists are also a part of the Core and have used social media recruitment tools, mobile phone-based assessment, and cloud-based data storage in their own HIV research. The Analytic Core also fields expertise in implementation science and cost effectiveness analysis that will be used to address study aims. The Analytic Core will support research across U19 projects through the following specific aims. First, we will provide consultation on web- based tools that will enhance standard recruitment methods and finalize the recruitment sample of seronegative youth based on risk factors from a larger pool of seronegative youth. Second, data collection will be centralized to maximize data quality and security, minimize costs, and facilitate analysis. Dimagi CommCare software that we have used in prior HIV research will be used and provides an integrated package to provide HIPAA-compliant cloud-based data storage and mobile phone or web-based data entry. Third, Core scientists will conduct innovative analyses that include biological, engagement, and behavioral outcomes. Lastly, the Analytic Core will coordinate with the Management Core for timely dissemination of study findings."
"9488876","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, are bioactive molecules with clinical applications for suppressing chronic inflammation. A major obstacle in the translation of n-3 PUFAs into the clinic is a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs regulate inflammation and moreover, the consequences of n-3 PUFAs on other aspects of the immune system. We have discovered n-3 PUFAs boost murine immune responses from B cells, which we propose is a result of n-3 PUFAs exerting immunosuppressive effects on antigen presenting cells and CD4+ T cells. The data raise the exciting possibility that n-3 PUFAs can be used to simultaneously suppress cell-mediated inflammation and enhance humoral immunity in select diseases. The long-term goal of our research program is to establish the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs on immunity for the general public and for specific clinical populations. The current objectives are to determine the individual and combined efficacy of EPA and DHA in regulating inflammatory cytokines and humoral immunity in lean and obese mice. The rationale for focusing on obesity is that obese individuals display, in addition to chronic inflammation, poor humoral immunity. The central hypothesis is that n-3 PUFAs generate CD4+ Th2 cytokines that boost B cell activation and antibody production. We will also test the additional hypothesis that n-3 PUFAs enhance Th2 cytokines and B cell activity by targeting the G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 120, an n-3 PUFA sensor. Aim 1 will establish n-3 PUFAs suppress Th1/Th17 cytokines and enhance Th2 cytokines and Tregs in lean mice. Aim 1 will then determine if n-3 PUFAs boost Th2 cytokines by targeting the immunological synapse and GPR120 of select cell types. Aim 2 will determine how n-3 PUFAs boost humoral immunity of lean mice. Aim 2 will first elucidate how elevated Th2 cytokines, in response to n-3 PUFAs, enhance B cell activity. Aim 2 will then dissect the contribution of additional mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs could directly enhance B cell activity. These include n-3 PUFAs stimulating B cell GPR120 signaling and generating pro-resolving lipid mediators. Aim 3 will establish the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in rescuing the decrement in antibody production of obese mice in response to several antigens including influenza. Aim 3 will also establish the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs on suppressing inflammation by enhancing select adipose specific B cells in a GPR120 dependent manner. The approach will rely on immunological assays, genetic mouse models, lipidomics, and biophysical imaging methods. The proposal is significant because it will define the efficacy of EPA+DHA (modeling over-the-counter and prescription supplements) and the individual activities of EPA and DHA on inflammation and humoral immunity in lean and obese mice. The research is innovative because it tests novel mechanisms using complementary approaches to challenge the general paradigm that n-3 PUFAs only have utility for suppressing or resolving inflammation. Completion of the project will provide a foundation for studies with select n-3 PUFAs on immunity in humans."
"9327345","PROJECT SUMMARY  Over  the  last  few  decades,  the  medical  community  has  witnessed  a  remarkable  shift  in  the  composition  of  pharmaceutical  therapies  from  traditional  small  molecules  to  biomacromolecules.  Despite  their  tremendous  success,  macromolecular  therapies  have  been  limited  almost  exclusively  to  extracellular  targets  due  to  the  significant  challenge  of  their  controllable  delivery  into  the  cytoplasm.  To  overcome  this  critical  barrier  in  expanding the scope of macromolecuar therapy, naturally occurring self-­deliverable protein systems such as the  Botulinum  neurotoxins  (BoNTs)  offer  an  attractive  solution.  These  protein  complexes  recognize  cholinergic  neurons, and promote the translocation of the active toxin component, the BoNT LC protease, into the cytosol  where it deactivates the cellular machinery responsible for membrane fusion events through proteolysis. While  potent, BoNT LC proteases are highly specific catalysts, and generally only recognize a single substrate. Efforts  to reprogram the activity of BoNT LC proteases have met with limited success, and the inaccessibility of new  intracellular targets for BoNT LC proteases remains the primary barrier in extending BoNT-­derived therapeutic  strategies. Recently, phage assisted continuous evolution (PACE) has emerged as a powerful tool for the rapid  evolution of novel activity, and has been applied to the exploration of the mechanisms by which viral proteases  develop resistance to inhibitors, and to evolving new substrate activities in viral proteases. This work will extend  the PACE strategy to reprogram the BoNT F LC protease to cleave novel target sequences, and will be applied  to  the  intracellular  proteolytic  deactivation  of  the  therapeutically  relevant  SNARE  protein  VAMP7.  With  this  in  mind,  the  goals  of  this  proposal  are:  (1)  adapt  the  current  protease  PACE  platform  for  use  with  BoNT  LC  proteases and evolve a BoNT LC protease to selectively cleave the SNARE protein VAMP7;? (2) develop a PACE  negative selection and apply this selection to evolve BoNT LC proteases that cleave VAMP7 with high specificity;?  (3) characterize in depth the activity, specificity, and potential therapeutic relevance of the evolved proteases.  This  work  will  provide  a  strong  foundation  upon  which  future  catalytic  intracellular  protease  therapies  can  be  based. "
"9352517","Project Summary The overall goals of this proposal are to plan a trial to address the significant gaps with respect to our understanding of best approaches to treatment of children ages 1-4 with intestinal schistosomiasis. Over 200 million individuals worldwide are infected with one of three predominant species of schistosomes, with over half of infections occurring in children. Recent studies have highlighted the fact that many children experience first infections before the age of two, with the prevalence of infection among children under four mirroring the prevalence of older children from the same community. Importantly, praziquantel (PZQ), the drug used worldwide for the treatment of schistosomiasis, is only FDA approved among adults and children over the age of four. Only one small study led by co-PI Bustinduy has evaluated the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of PZQ in children. That study, conducted among children ages 3-8, strongly suggests that the current dose of 40 mg/kg is insufficient, with lower cure rates than found at 60 mg/kg. In endemic settings, PZQ is most often administered as part of school based, or community wide preventive chemotherapy campaigns. Currently, none of the 28 schistosomiasis endemic African nations or The Philippines include children under the age of four in control programs. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include a) lack of sufficient PK/PD data in this age group, with none in children under three, b) lack of safety data at a dose of 60 mg/kg, c) lack of data addressing the impact of treatment on key growth and nutritional outcomes in this vulnerable age group hampering prioritization of treatment, d) no PK/PD studies conducted in the context of pediatric S. japonicum and e) FDA labeling that does not include young children. The goals of this proposal are to plan a randomized, controlled Phase II trial to be conducted in an S. mansoni endemic region of Uganda and an S. japonicum endemic region of The Philippines with N=600 children ages 1-4, that will address many of the current gaps that are hindering treatment of young children. Specifically in SA1 we will 1) assess PK/PD of PZQ dosing among children under the age of 4 at doses of 40 versus 60 mg/kg, 2) expand PD endpoints to include state of the art antigen tests and morbidity outcomes, 3) assess the PK/PD of both PZQ enantiomers, and 4) address the innovative hypothesis that environmental enteropathy (EE) contributes to the significant inter-individual variability observed in PZQ PK/PD. In SA2, we will 1) assess the safety of PZQ administered at 60 mg/kg in two large cohorts of very young children, 2) assess the impact of two different treatment intervals (6 vs 12 months) on nutritional status, growth, and anemia risk, and 3) address innovative hypotheses regarding mechanisms through which schistosomiasis contributes to morbidity in this age group including EE and gut microbial translocation with consequent systemic immune activation."
"9306702","PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating condition currently affecting approximately 300,000 people in the United States. The prevalence of severe chronic pain in SCI is 16%-63%. Following SCI, rapid activation of microglia at the injury site likely contributes to establishment of chronic pain through the release of pro- inflammatory signaling mediators. VGF (nonacronymic) is a neuropeptide precursor that is upregulated upon neuronal injury, and VGF expression is rapidly increased after contusion SCI. Dr. Vulchanova's laboratory was the first to show that VGF-derived peptides signal to microglia, and established that the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-21 contributes to both the development and maintenance of hypersensitivity after peripheral nerve injury and inflammation. TLQP-21 activates the Complement 3a (C3aR1) receptor. Because C3aR1 is upregulated in microglia following CNS injury, I hypothesize that C3aR1-expressing microglia are the cellular target of TLQP-21. This idea is supported by my preliminary results in microglial cultures indicating that TLQP-21 evokes Ca2+ transients in microglia. Signaling via C3aR1 is known to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, including ERK. Activated ERK is increased in microglia after SCI and is associated with hypersensitivity by mediating release of PGE2. My overall hypothesis is that TLQP-21 and C3aR1 increase spinal microglial ERK and PGE2 signaling, ultimately leading to SCI neuropathic pain. Specific aim 1: Characterize behavioral and spinal microglial correlates of neuropathic pain after SCI and evaluate the involvement of TLQP-21 and C3aR1 in SCI pain behavior. I will evaluate behavioral signs of hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain and will quantify Iba1, pERK, TLQP-21 and C3aR1 using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Additionally I will examine the contribution of TLQP-21 and C3aR1 to the maintenance of pain behavior following SCI. My working hypothesis is that disruption of TLQP-21 and C3aR1 signaling will attenuate the maintenance of pain-related behaviors after SCI. I will use TLQP-21 sequestration as well as a C3aR1 antagonist to examine the function of TLQP-21 and C3aR1 in the establishment of pain behaviors following SCI. Specific aim 2: Establish the function of TLQP-21 and C3aR1 on spinal microglia in our SCI model. I will use Ca2+ imaging in the adult spinal cord slice to test the working hypothesis that TLQP-21-evoked C3aR1-dependent calcium transients are potentiated in microglia after SCI. Additionally, utilizing an ELISA, I will examine PGE2 release from injured spinal cord slices to test the working hypothesis that TLQP-21 evoked PGE2 release is potentiated following SCI. These studies will have a significant impact because they represent the first examination of the function of the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-21 on spinal microglial signaling and on chronic pain following SCI. The outcomes of the proposed project have the potential to impact the identification of TLQP-21 and C3aR1 as novel therapeutic targets for SCI-induced neuropathic pain."
"9333951","PROJECT SUMMARY Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant threat to public health, transmitting via mosquitos and infecting hundreds of millions around the world each year, of which roughly one hundred million become symptomatic and one half-million develop severe complications such as hemorrhagic fever, shock syndrome, or death. Despite many efforts to interpret antibody and serum cytokine measurements, only once has a diagnostic test been able to differentiate patients that are susceptible to heterotypic infections that associate with greater risk for severe complications. The uncertainty of the dynamics of the immune response to DENV has repeatedly thwarted efforts to create a vaccine protecting against all prevalent serotypes for over 80 years.  A perhaps even more urgent problem is the blossoming spread of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), another mosquito-borne virus characterized by higher transmissibility and infection rates much higher than those of DENV, with roughly three quarters of infected persons developing symptoms that can include chronic polyarthritis and fatigue. Sharing the same urban mosquito vectors as DENV, the transmission of CHIKV within the Western hemisphere was reported for the first time two years ago. Like DENV, there are no approved specific treatments or vaccines. So far, very little is known about the molecular interactions necessary for CHIKV to enter human cells and effectively counter the innate immune system.  Next generation sequencing and immune profiling technologies such as RNA-seq, Luminex, proteomics, and CyTOF have the ability to generate a wealth of data that can be used to help illuminate global biomolecular changes driving viral infections in humans, but only if signal can be separated from noise to identify useful signatures and key pathways. The pathogenesis of an infection within a host is a complex process, involving interactions among networks of biomolecules, cell types, tissues, and host individuals. Such complexity necessitates a multiscale, integrative approach, since characterizing one network or phenomenon in isolation is unlikely to sufficiently explain changes occurring across the entire system.  This study proposes analyses that will identify robust biomarkers derived from immune profiling of a longitudinal cohort of pediatric DENV and CHIKV infections in Nicaragua, as part of a multi-institutional consortium (DHIPC). Furthermore, we will integrate these data into causal network models of the host- pathogen interaction, which will reveal key driver genes for pathways that associate with changes in the host immune response and facilitate antiviral and vaccine discovery. Given the anticipated data, this proposal maximizes the impact of the modeling approach for DENV and CHIKV on future biological discovery and advances the state of the art in holistic, data-driven modeling of infectious disease."
"9381481","Abstract: This longstanding competing renewal application CA74305 concerns our plans to apply chemical and biochemical approaches in cell signaling to enhance our understanding of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the pathways involved. In the next cycle, we plan to investigate the regulation of three key enzymes, PTEN, WWP2, and AKT1 that are connected to the cancer promoting phospholipid, PIP3 (phosphatidyl 3,4,5-triphosphate). PTEN is one of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes and catalyzes the conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 and in this way antagonizes the action of the PI3-kinase oncogenic signaling pathway. WWP2 is a HECT domain E3 ligase (ubiquitin transferase) that targets PTEN for destruction and is considered to be an oncogene. AKT1, also an oncogene, is a protein Ser/Thr kinase that is activated by PIP3 and drives tumor formation and is an intensively studied cancer therapeutic target. PTEN, WWP2, and AKT1 are each subjected to multiple phosphorylations that are proposed to have important regulatory implications. Our research program will continue to adapt and employ protein semisynthetic methods including the newly described enzyme-catalyzed expressed protein ligation (EPL) to generate these signaling enzymes containing the requisite PTMs and appropriate mimics to interrogate how these phosphorylations influence the structure and function of these key cancer-related enzymes. Our three specific aims are: 1. Optimize enzyme-catalyzed expressed protein ligation (EPL) for protein semisynthesis and apply to the study of PTEN regulation; 2. Elucidate the molecular basis of WWP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulation; 3. Determine the role of C-terminal phosphorylation of AKT1 on its structure, activity, mechanism of regulation, substrate specificity, and inhibitor sensitivity. With site-specifically modified signaling enzymes in hand, we will integrate kinetic analysis, X-ray crystallography, protein microarrays, and cell-based studies to clarify key regulatory and signaling features. Upon completion of this research effort, we should have a much clearer understanding of the PIP3 signaling network. Moreover, these studies should pave the way for new therapeutic strategies to combat PTEN-AKT1 pathway dysregulation in cancer."
"9276157","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in correctly addressing causality in observational studies due to missing data, and lack of randomization, and complications due to temporality. Measures of association are inapposite for making relevant policy recommendations because these involve suggestions for interventions, which are causal statements. The long-term goal is to address important environmental health causal questions (e.g., discovering biological mechanisms linking air pollution to low birth weight or autism, and relating extreme weather conditions to heat stroke or worldwide nutritional deficiency) that have policy-relevant consequences, and develop statistical methodology that correctly addresses causality in environmental health studies. The overall objective of this grant application is to correctly formulate and estimate causal environmental health effects, especially in the presence of intermediate variables, by transporting successful statistical tools developed in the fields of missing data (Rubin 1978) and classical and modern multi-factorial randomized experiments over the past 80 years (essentially since Fisher, 1935). Guided by preliminary development and significant applications, this proposed research will consist of four specific aims: 1) Expand successful multiple- imputation methods for high-dimensional missing data to enable valid statistical inference when confronted with missing data using standard complete-data methods. Two different settings will be considered, the first one dealing with multivariate time series and the second with gold standard prediction from less accurate but available measurements. 2) Develop statistical theory to estimate casual estimands from data collected by observational studies, which would be reconstructed to approximate data from a randomized experiment; one particularly interesting setting will consider intermediate variables on the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome (also called mediators). 3) Expand standard methods developed for causal mediation analysis; analysis of mediation has become a popular developing tool to examine causal biological pathways and their relative contribution to adverse health effects. 4) Implement these methods developed in the three previous aims with new software that is compatible with software currently used by biomedical researchers. The proposed research targeting correct formulation and estimation of causal environmental health effects is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by transporting successful methods and concepts developed in classical and modern statistics in two areas: 1) multiple imputation techniques for handling missing data, 2) analysis of complex multi-factorial randomized experiments, especially in the presence of intermediate variables and complex data (e.g., longitudinal, survival, and high-dimensional). The proposed statistical methodology will be significant to biomedical research because it will yield valid causal environmental health effect estimates under precisely stated assumptions, which are expected to provide positive impacts on policy decisions and suggest appropriate interventions."
"9313322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulty in emotional perception is a key trans-diagnostic impairment. Emotion perception deficits contribute to mental health treatment costs and incur significant social and economic costs, more broadly. Inability to perceive emotion can have a profound impact on professional and personal realms, due to losses in worker productivity and disruptions on social functioning. Yet scientists lack of mechanistic understanding of emotion perception and deficits therein. This represents a critical barrier to treatment and prevention within this major facet in social functioning. I propose that surmounting this critical barrier can be achieved by examining emotion perception through a cross-cultural lens, using a process-based theoretical approach. Cultural comparisons can provide a lens on normative variation that is typically obscured within a single cultural context. The proposed research aims to reveal the ways in which the underlying mechanisms that contribute to emotion perception are contextually bound and culturally variable. I will examine two processes: mentalizing (i.e., how much people make inferences about the inner feelings) and action perception (i.e., how much people identify situated behaviors). It has long been assumed that health is universally defined by the engagement of mentalizing during emotion perception. Yet my prior research identified a culture (the Himba of Namibia) where this is not the case. I plan to continue study individuals from the Himba cultural context, and expand to a Chinese cultural context, to further probe cultural variation in the mechanisms of normal emotion perception. With aim 1, I will better characterize cultural variation in mentalizing and action identification through analysis of natural language use during emotion perception and mentalizing tasks. With aim 2, I will investigate the neural underpinnings of cultural variation in mentalizing using ambulatory neuroimaging by examining the functioning of one region that anchors the network underpinning mental state inference the dorsomedial cortex (dmPFC). I predict that people in cultural contexts in which mental state language use occurs more frequently (Aim 1), the dmPFC will be more robustly activated, during both domain specific (emotion) and domain general (mentalizing) tasks (Aim 2). By examining emotion perception as a complex act of social cognition within a cultural framework, I aim to reveal the underlying mechanisms of emotion perception that are consistent across cultural contexts and those that differ. This will allow me t build a more mechanistic model of emotion perception that can inform our understanding of how these processes can go awry to produce disordered emotion perception. Based on this research, future interventions could be tailored based on a mechanistic account. In the United States, treatment for individuals high in action identification (e.g., individuals with Autism) coud be informed by understanding transactions that primarily rely on action identification in other cultures."
"9282430","Abstract (Swine Core) The central function of the Indiana Diabetes Research Center (IDRC) Swine Core (a Regional/Shared Resource Core) is to reduce barriers to the use of Ossabaw swine, a unique animal model that closely approximates human metabolic syndrome (MetS) and progression to type 2 diabetes. Providing this animal resource enables testing of numerous hypotheses about the integrated, in vivo pathogenesis and long-term complications of MetS and type 2 diabetes and provides tissues for studies of cellular and molecular mechanisms. The Comparative Medicine Center, a collaboration between Purdue University and Indiana University School of Medicine (lUSM), has the only research and large-scale breeding colony of Ossabaw miniature swine in the world. Induced by an excess calorie atherogenic diet, Ossabaw swine develop MetS and atherosclerosis among other complications, and are an ideal model for testing human therapies. The Ossabaw swine resource has been used for numerous studies, including metabolism in skeletal muscle and liver, percutaneous catheter interventions and stents, lithotripsy of kidney stones, and bariatric surgery among others. The current and projected demand for Ossabaw miniature swine for NIDDK and several NIH Institutes, universities and biomedical and biotechnology companies clearly states the need for this animal model and justifies this Core as a Regional/National Shared Resource. The Swine Core is a critical interface in the translation of research from simpler animal models (Rodent Core) to humans (Translation Core). Islet and Microscopy Cores will be complementary with the Swine Core for basic cellular characterization. The primary aims of the Swine Core are to (1) provide quality control and care of the breeding colony of Ossabaw swine, (2) provide quality control of diet-induced MetS and diabetes (MetS/D), (3) phenotype the endocrine, metabolic, and dyslipidemia indices of MetS/D, (4) phenotype cardiovascular disease, and (5) provide a tissue and data bank for distribution for research studies. These aims of the Swine Core will reduce barriers to study of this highly relevant animal model, and will facilitate the progressive translation of research from simpler, less complex models to humans."

"9278313","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postural instability and gait disturbances, including freezing of gait are common, disabling and poorly understood symptoms that afflict approximately half of all patients with Parkinson's disease. With disease progression these symptoms become resistant to treatment and are major causes of falls, immobility and increased morbidity. Currently there are no effective treatments. Degeneration of the pedunculopontine nucleus, a region in the brainstem that controls locomotor pattern generation and postural tone, has been hypothesized to mediate the pathogenesis of postural instability and gait dysfunction. The pedunculopontine nucleus also plays a role in suppressing muscle activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus, the loss of the pedunculopontine nucleus should manifest as disturbances in both sleep and gait. This project will conduct a series of experiments to establish that neurodegenerative processes that disrupt the control muscle activity during REM sleep are closely linked to the development and progression of treatment-resistant postural instability and gait dysfunction. Quantitative assessments of sleep and motor function (gait, gait initiation, postural stability), in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging measures of structural (from diffusion- weighted imaging) and functional connectivity (from resting-state functional imaging) of the region of the pedunculopontine nucleus, will be obtained in a cohort of patients with early stage Parkinson's disease. These patients will be followed for three years to map the progression of changes in sleep, motor function and organization of brainstem locomotor pathways. We hypothesize that the loss of suppression of muscle activity during REM sleep will be predictive of the rate of progression of treatment-resistant motor features of disease and changes in structural and functional connectivity of the PPN region. Establishment of a link between REM sleep disorder and the development of treatment-resistant motor features of disease will help to identify individuals at risk of developing these symptoms. Since REM sleep disturbances can often be recognized years or decades before the emergence of parkinsonian motor symptoms, this may provide a critical period for early intervention to slow or prevent disease progression. Overall the study section was very enthusiastic about the focus of this application which addresses an area of high significance, but specific concerns reduced the overall level of enthusiasm."
"9298540","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent decades have witnessed landmark advances in mapping neurocognitive decline in the elderly, as well as discerning its determinants. Central to this success is the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- based approaches to mapping human brain function and structure. These efforts have identified several protective factors. In particular, cardiovascular fitness (CF), has emerged as one of the strongest predictors of longevity, neurobiological integrity and cognitive performance in the elderly -a finding supported by cross- sectional, longitudinal and interventional studies alike. However, the origins of neurocognitive decline in mid life have received less attention in brain imaging, and likely represent missed opportunities for early intervention. The present application calls for the generation of an open science resource to comprehensively map neurobiological change throughout mid and older adulthood in a community-ascertained sample. This resource will help to discern the midlife relevance of putative determinants of neurocognitive decline previously established in the elderly (e.g., CF). Specifically, we propose to generate a community-ascertained structured multi-cohort, longitudinal sample (Ne233 after data loss) from ages 40.0-74.9 yrs that can be used to delineate aging trajectories of the brain's functional and structural architectures, and capture brain-behavior relationships. 19 age-cohorts (n=23/cohort) will be spaced two years apart, each with 4 assessments spaced 12 months apart. Per cohort, we expect to have at least 18 participants with 2 or more consecutive, usable datasets, 16 with 3 or more usable datasets, and at least 13 participants with all 4 datasets. Proposed imaging methods include resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI), 137-direction diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling and morphometry. We will also collect a task-based fMRI assessment of executive function (flanker), allowing for direct comparisons between measures of functional connectomics with task-based cortical recruitment and psychophysiological interactions. State-of-the-art multband imaging will be used for functional and diffusion-weighted data to maximize sampling rate, as well as spatial and angular resolution, while minimizing participant burden. Comprehensive phenotyping will include dimensional cognitive, behavioral, medical, sociodemographic, and psychiatric assessments. Gold-standard CF assessments, neuroimmunologic markers and genetics will also be obtained. The impact of phenotypic variables on multimodal structure- function relationships will be examined using an innovative multi-kernel varying coefficient framework. The proposed work builds on the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample, a large cross-sectional sample of brain development, maturation and aging in ages 6.0-85.0 yrs, currently funded to recruit and assess 1000 community-ascertained participants using multiband imaging-based R-fMRI and DTI and deep phenoytyping. De-identified data will be shared quarterly on a pre-publication basis via The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. Building upon the NKI-RS effort minimizes startup, infrastructure, recruitment and design needs."

"9281912","Aspects of microglial activation in neuroinflammation associated with CNS neurodegeneration have alternately been reported to be further damaging or to be protective against disease progression. Thus, the translational potential of targeting microglia in new drug development for CNS neurodegenerative diseases remains uncertain. A major challenge in this context has been that relevant microglial phenotypes and activation states have been exceedingly difficult to recapitulate in cell line models or even in primary cultures of microglia. Conversely, microglial studies in vivo are time- and cost-intensive, and consequently have limited scalability.  To address this need, we propose to develop and provide validation for a novel, brain tissue- based drug discovery model for the identification and mechanistic evaluation of new drug and drug target candidates for modulating microglial activation in CNS neurodegenerative disorders. Brain tissue models capture important aspects of intercellular interactions within the intact, local 3-dimensional structure of native neural tissues, and thereby have increased physiological relevance and can be more predictive of clinical benefit compared to cell-based models. Moreover, we have shown previously that brain slice assays can be scaled to useful throughputs for drug discovery in Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke.  The goal of the present proposal is thus to establish the experimental framework for a brain slice-based screening and mechanistic assay for microglial-neuronal interactions, and to provide initial validation that perturbation of microglial activation and/or numbers leads to clear and reproducible effects on rates and/or extents of neurodegeneration. In addition, we will extend the assay to interrogate potential effects of peripheral monocytes, whose infiltration is associated with later stages of CNS disease. We will initially focus on an HD brain slice model that we have used extensively in both screening as well as mechanistic studies, and then ask if our findings are generalizable to different models of CNS neurodegeneration driven by amyloid precursor protein and tau isoforms relevant to AD and frontotemporal dementias (FTD), respectively.  If successful, the proposed studies should provide a new 3-D brain tissue-based model for capturing clinically relevant microglial-neuronal interactions scalable to screening throughputs for the discovery of new candidate drugs and drug targets for CNS neurodegeneration, and for their mechanistic evaluation and validation."
"9332440","Project Summary/Abstract Malaria remains one of the most devastating parasitic diseases in the world with the vast majority of deaths caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The pathology of the disease results exclusively from the blood-stage of the infection during which parasites invade and multiply within host erythrocytes. To establish this intracellular niche, P. falciparum imposes striking modifications to the erythrocyte through export of effector proteins but the export mechanism is poorly understood and the effector functions essential to parasite survival remain largely unknown. Export into the red blood cell requires crossing a vacuole membrane surrounding the parasite, a translocation event that depends upon the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX). In a recent paper, the candidate showed that inactivation of heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), a AAA+ ATPase component of PTEX, results in a complete block in protein export and parasite death. Related AAA+ proteins can unfold and directionally thread substrates through a central channel, suggesting HSP101 may drive recognition of effector proteins and power the translocation process. The proposed career development plan aims to dissect the role of HSP101/PTEX in export and to identify key exported effectors that enable the parasite to survive within the erythrocyte. Specific Aim 1 seeks to understand the substrate recognition and catalytic properties of recombinant HSP101 and to dissect the role of HSP101 in protein export within intact parasites. Specific Aim 2 will use genetic and proteomic approaches to define the function of additional PTEX components and a cross-linking mass spectrometry approach to map the architecture of the complex. Specific Aim 3 will analyze the function of exported effectors implicated in parasite survival within the erythrocyte using forward and reverse genetics as well as proteomic approaches. PTEX is an exciting new drug target and the proposed experiments will reveal key mechanistic information about the role of this export machinery as a necessary basis for rational drug design. Furthermore, identification of key exported proteins with roles in parasite survival may provide needed additional therapeutic targets. Collectively, this work will further our understanding of how the malaria parasite subverts its erythrocyte host cell and support development of new tools for control of malaria disease. The experience and research tools acquired in the process will propel the candidate into an established career as an independent investigator."
"9385801","Axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) spontaneously regenerate, allowing functional recovery after injury, which is largely absent in adult mammalian central nervous system. Intra- axonal protein synthesis is a key component of spontaneous regenerative responses in the PNS and this can be drastically enhanced in nerves that have been pre-conditioned by a prior injury. Our work has shown selective localization and differential translation of many axonal mRNAs in adult sensory neurons and axons of peripheral nerves. However, it is still not clear how translation of axonal mRNAs is regulated. Our long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that provide spatial and temporal regulation for intra-axonal protein synthesis. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have emerged as key controllers of gene expression in the nervous system. Among these, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are primarily known for their roles in silencing transposable elements in germline cells. Recently, piRNAs are suggested to contribute to neuronal development and function. However, the possibility that the piRNAs are acting locally within neuronal processes to regulate axonal mRNA translation has not been tested. We anticipate that axonal piRNAs could confer a unique advantage for coordinately altering the population of proteins generated in growth cones by targeting mRNA cohorts. Our preliminary work shows that piRNA-like small RNAs (piLRNAs) are present in axons of sciatic nerve and that depletion of MIWI protein, a murine homolog of PIWI, increases axon growth and decreases axon retraction after injury. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the MIWI protein and specific piLRNAs are selectively enriched in axons of neurons and are functionally important for neuronal morphology including axon growth and regeneration following injury. In Aim 1, we will determine whether piLRNAs are selectively enriched in axons of neuronal cells by directly contrasting levels of piLRNAs in axon vs. cell body compartment. In Aim 2, we will focus on piLRNAs-5567, 1199, 5901, 5598, and 5595 to examine whether these axonally enriched piLRNAs control axon growth and/or regeneration. Once completed, we will, for the first time, demonstrate the localization of neuronal piLRNAs in the axon compartment, and identify novel roles of the axonally enriched piLRNAs in sensory neurons in axon growth and/or regeneration."
"9263770","To fulfill the new NCATS vision for the CTSA Consortium and accelerate scientific discoveries into improved outcomes for patients, academic health and science systems must invest, transform, and innovate to optimize their unique strengths. Our vision, aligned with that of NCATS, is to create a research environment at Duke that stimulates the translation of scientific discovery from bench to bedside by 1) linking discovery science to a creative engine that efficiently accelerates development of new technologies; and 2) integrating clinical trials, registries, and electronic health records in a learning health system where research and practice form a continuum. Our research environment will be driven by scientific merit and societal need, agnostic to disease or specialty discipline, aligned with our updated institutional framework for research oversight and quality, and continually evaluated for academic productivity, efficiency, and cost. To achieve these goals, we will create an Integrated Home for clinical and translational research by providing infrastructure and resources to serve investigators and trainees across the research spectrum. We will offer resources based upon common needs among our researchers, including education, biostatistics, biobanking, regulatory expertise, ethics, pilot funding and recruitment assistance. We will also tailor our offerings to specialized needs across research communities that include early translation, proof of concept, site-based research and population' based research, which includes multi-site trials, outcomes, health services, implementation science and community engaged research. Integrating these resources will require a new tool, a portal for all trainees and investigators, MyResearchHome(gDuke, and its human counterpart, MyResearchTeam(gDuke. These tools will provide a single point of entry for all clinical and translational research at Duke, regardless of their department or school. Thus, we will enhance our Integrated Home for clinical and translational research with a combination of sophisticated information technology and mentoring and navigation; provide access to common and specialized resources for all of our translational research communities and train the next generation of researchers in our educational and training programs.

"9493696","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makadzange, Azure Tariro In 2014 UNAIDS set ambitious goals to achieve 90% virologic suppression rates among individuals on ART. In Zimbabwe this is an ambitious target particularly among adolescents; <5% of HIV infected individuals received HIV viral load (VL) testing in 2015 and treatment failure rates among adolescents range between 35-42%. Adolescents failing ART also have high rates of drug resistance. Scalable strategies to facilitate improved VL monitoring, adherence support and genotyping for those with persistent viremia are urgently needed. We have shown that dried blood spot (DBS) samples can be used for routine VL monitoring on existing technologies. We have also adapted an evidence based, widely used, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) adherence intervention (Life-Steps) for use in Zimbabwe and have identified a low-cost genotyping strategy that can facilitate detection of drug resistance mutations using already existing RT-PCR technology. We hypothesize that our proposed package of care will result in a decrease in virologic failure rates among adolescents. Our primary study objective is to determine if implementation of a package of care that includes DBS based viral load monitoring, coupled with an evidence-based intervention to improve ART adherence using cognitive- behavioral principles and genotyping for those with persistent viremia decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among HIV-infected adolescents compared with standard of care. We will also adapt and integrate Nzira Itsva for Adolescents (NI), a cultural adaptation of Life-Steps into routine care as an adherence support intervention for HIV infected adolescents, and implement a novel low-cost genotyping assay using Pan Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) of viral RNA as a point mutation assay for the detection of drug resistance. Process and cost data will be collected for subsequent cost-analysis. The proposed intervention will be a two-arm cluster-randomized trial in Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North provinces of Zimbabwe. The units of randomization will be public and largely rural clinics within the provinces, with sites randomized to the intervention or to the standard of care. The study is anticipated to show that the use of DBS in routine monitoring of adolescents is feasible, to show that CBT if incorporated into routine counseling activities can complement viral load monitoring and genotyping to reduce treatment failure rates and preserve therapeutic options for infected adolescents. The results of this study will have important implications in Zimbabwe and other low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a large proportion of HIV infected adolescents. The study will include young adolescents 10-14 years, as well as older adolescents 14-19 years and therefore provide data that will guide implementation of strategies for virologic success in the growing number of children who are surviving on ART into adolescents, as well as for behaviorally infected adolescents.

"9309130","Contact PD/PI: GINSBERG, HENRY N OVERALL ABSTRACT Our CTSA Hub is situated in the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (Irving Institute) of Columbia University (CU), and based at the CU Medical Center (CUMC) in Northern Manhattan (NM). The CU College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S), Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH), College of Dental Medicine (CDM), and School of Nursing (SON) are all at CUMC together with major components of New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). The vision of the Irving Institute is: 1) to transform the culture of biomedical research enabling CUMC investigators to develop new treatments faster and deliver those treatments to patients more efficiently, effectively, and safely than ever before; 2) to utilize medical research advances to benefit patients and the community, converting knowledge into practice; and 3) to recruit, train, support and nurture the next generation of clinical and translational investigators in multi- and interdisciplinary team science environments. Since first receiving CTSA funding in 2006, we embraced a vision that would impact maximally on a) individuals, particularly junior faculty and trainees, b) groups of faculty and trainees working in common areas of interest but often in relative isolation, and 3) the institutional culture. We believed that this bottom-up approach was necessary if we were to move CUMC from a system that rewarded individual effort more than the achievements of groups. After nine years, we are certain that we have changed the environment significantly, and that CUMC and NYP both understand that multidisciplinary team efforts are essential for success in this era of greater complexity both in science and in clinical care. Additionally, we all have come to understand that only by engaging our patients early in the research process, particularly those individuals in the communities of Northern Manhattan (NM), will we gain their trust and enthusiasm, two keys to their participation in the revolution generated by Precision Medicine. Our aim is to expand, enhance, and improve the Irving Institute's CTSA Hub, to ensure that we create an outstanding environment where junior and senior faculty, trainees, clinical research coordinators, nurses, support staff, and patients, particularly members of the underserved and underrepresent communities of NM are all engaged in, and benefit from, our efforts to meet the exciting and unique opportunities afforded by the CU/NYP Precision Medicine Initiative and the extraordinary advancements in information technologies, `omics', and therapeutic possibilities. Innovations and achievements at our Hub will be disseminated for the benefit of our local neighboring Hubs and the CTSA Hub Network.

"9267951","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It remains poorly understood how serotonin circuits in the brain dysfunction in depression, drug addiction and other disorders. Understanding the role of serotonin neurotransmission in psychopathology is complicated by one of the most salient features of the serotonin system: its neuroanatomy. In this project we examine how serotonin neuron function changes in animal models of depression and nicotine abstinence, and after antidepressant treatment. Our work seeks to reconcile behavioral pharmacology with neuroanatomy to resolve some of the contradictory findings in the field. The over-riding hypothesis is that there are topographically organized changes in the activation of serotonin neurons in depression and these are resolved by antidepressant treatment. In addition, we examine how feedback inhibition mediated by 5-HT1A receptors changes in coordination with altered patterns of serotonin-neuron activity. Finally we examine the functional impact of topographically selective changes in activation state on behavior. The specific aims integrate cellular, systems and behavioral approaches to understand function and dysfunction of serotonin neurotransmission. The broad long-term goal of this research program is to provide a better understanding of the role of serotonin in affective and addictive disorders."
"9280915","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from SRI International is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (10/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 550 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2 the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. Our project focuses on the sleep and chronobiology data collected across the consortium, both with questionnaires and periodic assessment with wearable wrist trackers. Our aims are to assess sleep behavior and chronotype as predictors of subsequent substance use, and to investigate the effects of current substance use on sleep characteristics in adolescents. We will also conduct exploratory analyses to determine the effect of marijuana usage on sleep, to evaluate relationships between sleep and chronobiology variables, substance use and development of depression; and to investigate genetic and environmental contributions to associations between sleep characteristics, chronotype and substance use in twins. The combination of careful assessment of subjective and objective sleep and chronotype, detailed evaluation of substance use patterns and sensitive clinical measures will provide a unique resource for the scientific community, and help guide age-appropriate behavioral interventions."

"9272380","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear receptors (NRs) comprise a family of 48 transcription factors, which are regulatory proteins that turn genes on or off. In contrast to othe transcription factors, the activity of NRs is physiologically regulated by small molecules (ligands), including sex hormones, glucocorticoids, vitamins, lipids, and others, which makes these proteins amenable to pharmacological intervention for the treatment of many diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and diabetes. NRs therefore represent one of the most successful classes of therapeutic drug discovery targets. Orphan NRs are receptors for which no physiological ligands were known when they were first identified. This set of NRs remains of enormous medical interest as their physiological roles and possible regulation by small molecules and drugs are still emerging. The objective of this study is to determine high resolution crystal structures of the remaining orphan NR ligand-binding domains (LBDs), to correlate the structures with biological functions of these receptors, and to explore the structura information for drug discovery that targets these receptors. All nuclear receptors contain at least one of two conserved domains: the centrally-located DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the C-terminal LBD. The LBD is the key functional domain that mediates the ligand binding, receptor dimerization, ligand-regulated transcriptional function of nuclear receptors. As such the LBD has been the focus of intense structural studies and pharmaceutical discovery. Crystal structures of most of the human nuclear hormone receptor LBDs have been determined and these structures have provided key mechanisms of ligand regulation and ligand discovery for nuclear receptors. Work from the first renewal of this application identified novel regulatory mechanisms for two repressive orphan NR, SHP and TLX, and suggested that similar mechanisms may be shared by other repressive orphan NRs. In the specific aims of this application, we will test this hypothesis by functionally analyzing the newly discovered regulatory interfaces and by determining the crystal structure of SHP in different states to identify the structural mechanisms by which SHP is regulated by small molecules and by which SHP represses other NRs. Following the structural determination, we will validate the functional significance of key structural elements through close collaborations with Drs Steve Kliewer, David Mangelsdorf, Chun-Li Zhang, and Pat Griffin, who are key experts on these receptors. Significance: The structural information generated in this application will significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of how these orphan nuclear receptors have evolved for their respective ligand-dependent or -independent signaling pathways, and can serve as rational templates for drug discovery that targets these receptors."
"9336931","Project Summary: Kinesin motors carry out bidirectional transport in neurons, organize the mitotic spindle during cell division, and are involved in a number of other vital cellular processes. Significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanochemical transitions that underlie kinesin stepping; however, identifying the key structural features and the rates of structural and biochemical transitions that underlie the functional diversity observed across the kinesin superfamily remains elusive. Our ongoing work suggests that: i) differences in unloaded processivity between kinesin families result from differences in the length of their neck linker domains, a 14-18 residue sequence connecting the catalytic core to the coiled-coil domain, and ii) differences in motors' response to load result from properties resident in the core motor domain. We hypothesize that the processivity of dimeric kinesins results from a race between attachment of the tethered head to the next tubulin binding site and dissociation of the bound motor from the microtubule. Until now, there has been no reliable way to the detachment/reattachment dynamics of one head in a processive kinesin dimer. We will attach gold nanoparticles to individual heads in a kinesin dimer and track the particles with nm and sub-msec resolution using Interferometric Scattering (iSCAT) and Total Internal Reflection Dark-Field (TIRDF) Microscopy. We recently showed that iSCAT can detect substeps at saturating ATP levels that have not been measured by optical tweezers, the benchmark in the field. Aim 1 is to identify transitions in the mechanochemical cycles of kinesin-1, the intraflagellar transport motor kinesin-2, and the `superprocessive' kinesin-3 that govern their differing behaviors. To understand how kinesins transport cargo along the crowded microtubules found in cells, Aim 2 will identify features of the hydrolysis cycle that enable motors to step around roadblocks. In Aim 3 these investigations will expand to the mitotic motor kinesin-5, which we recently found to be a microtubule polymerase. Experiments in Aim 3 will identify the specific features of the kinesin-5 chemomechanical cycle that lead to its plus-end-binding and microtubule polymerase activity. We will test the hypothesis that the contrasting influence of load on these motors results from what proportion of the hydrolysis cycle the motor resides in a vulnerable one-head-bound state. By applying new techniques to measure rapid mechanical transitions during kinesin stepping, this work will help to define a general model for kinesin mechanochemistry that can be applied to diverse motors in the superfamily. This understanding is necessary to extrapolate observations at the single-molecule level to the complex dynamics of multi-motor transport in cells in both normal and diseased states."
"9338337","Project Summary/Abstract Local degeneration of neuronal processes is an important mechanism in neural circuit remodeling and neuronal injury. The neuronal debris resulting from degeneration must be promptly cleared by phagocytes to prevent inflammation and to facilitate the subsequent neuronal regrowth. Although aberrant recognition and clearance of neuronal debris are implicated in neuroinflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative diseases, it is unknown how phagocytes distinguish degenerative neurites from surrounding healthy ones. In particular, three important questions remain unanswered: what is the signal on degenerating neurites that allows the recognition by phagocytes? What is the receptor for the recognition signal of degenerating neurites? How is the recognition signal specifically exposed on degenerating neurites? Our new in vivo data provided important clues that will help us to solve these puzzles. Using our new in vivo probes, we discovered that the ?eat-me? signal phosphatidylserine (PS) is absent on the surface of healthy dendrites but is exposed on degenerating dendrites in both developmental remodeling and physical injury. Building on these observations, this project aims to elucidate the in vivo mechanisms of PS exposure and recognition in dendrite degeneration using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model system. Our long term objective is to uncover autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms of dendrite degeneration and repair. For this project, we propose the following three aims: 1) Determine the role of PS exposure in the recognition and engulfment of degenerating dendrites. The necessity of PS exposure in engulfment of dendrites after injury will be determined by (i) masking PS on the dendrite surface with PS-binding proteins, and (ii) blocking the biosynthesis of PS in specific neurons. The sufficiency of PS in triggering dendrite engulfment and degeneration will be tested by ectopically inducing PS exposure in neurons. 2) Investigate how the CED-1 family member Draper recognizes degenerating dendrites. Our results suggest that Draper recognizes degenerating dendrites. Two complementary in vivo competition assays will be performed to determine if Draper directly interacts with PS. 3) Determine how PS exposure is regulated in neurons and degenerating dendrites. By conducting loss-of-function studies of candidate genes, the identities of PS flippases and scramblases that regulate PS exposure during dendrite degeneration will be determined. The role of caspases in PS exposure will be investigated by examining caspase activity after dendrite injury and by disrupting the caspase pathway in neurons. Together, these aims will reveal in vivo mechanisms of neuronal debris sensing. As the clearance of neuronal debris in both mammals and insects requires the same CED-1 family of engulfment receptor, this study will reveal conserved mechanisms that may be relevant to neurodegenerative disorders."
"9389996","The long-term objective of this application is to discover and characterize the adductomics-based exposure indicators for the assessment of cancer risks and for cancer prevention. Endogenous metabolism and environmental exposure can both give rise to DNA damage. If left unrepaired, the resulting DNA adducts may compromise the flow of genetic information by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription and inducing mutations in these processes. In addition, the ultimate levels of DNA adducts accumulated in mammalian cells and tissues are the result of a dynamic interplay between DNA adduct formation and repair. Thus, it is important to establish a robust analytical method for the quantitative measurement of a broad range of DNA adducts that are implicated in the etiology for the development of cancer and other human diseases. Such a method will also enable the characterizations of the repair of DNA adducts, which may lead to the discovery of risk factors for cancer initiation and development, and guide the development of approaches for effective cancer chemoprevention. In this application, we propose to establish a DNA adductomic approach by employing and expanding our recently established LC-MS/MS methods for the quantification of DNA adducts induced by reactive oxygen species, DNA photoproducts arising from UV irradiation, and DNA epigenetic marks, which represent a substantial subset of the DNA adductome. We will then employ this adductomic approach for investigating the modulations of the levels of oxidatively induced DNA lesions and DNA epigenetic marks by DNA repair enzymes, for assessing the implications of DNA adducts in the etiology of melanoma development, and for evaluating the effects of sunscreen components on altering UV-induced DNA adduct formation. The proposed research will have a long- lasting impact on the fields of DNA damage repair and cancer biology by offering a facile adductomic platform for characterizing the risk factors and therapeutic/preventive approaches that modulate the formation and removal of DNA adducts."
"9276754","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often in need of psychiatric care due to poor emotion regulation and emotional distress. Only two psychotropic medications have been approved for use in ASD, both to treat irritability expressed as tantrums, outbursts, and aggression. However, the underlying deficits in emotion regulation that lead to these problem behaviors are poorly understood and rarely measured or targeted in treatment. Evidence-based treatment approaches for the full range of emotion dysregulation (e.g. depression, outbursts, meltdowns, etc.) present in ASD do not exist. A major barrier to progress in this area is a lack of validated, treatment sensitive measures of emotional distress for individuals with ASD. This project proposes to refine and validate a new measure of emotional distress and emotion regulation for ASD, called the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI). Guidelines from the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Project and gold-standard statistical approaches will be utilized to complete calibration and psychometric analysis of the EDI. The primary sample will include caregivers of 1000 children and young adults with ASD from community, outpatient, and psychiatric inpatient settings. Data collection will occur through an online system. Analyses will focus on establishing the EDI's factor structure/dimensionality, developing a less than 10-item short form, establishing convergent and divergent validity, comparing EDI scores among groups whose scores would be expected to differ (e.g. inpatients versus community sample; ASD versus healthy controls), and comparing EDI scores to observational counts of emotion dysregulation episodes displayed by children who are inpatients on two specialized psychiatric units. A subset of the sample will complete the EDI twice to establish test-retest reliability. The EDI's ability to detect treatment change will be determined by comparing both caregiver- and provider-rated EDI scores at admission and discharge across two psychiatric inpatient units that specialize in ASD and 4-week change scores in a stable community sample. The primary outcome of this study will be a user-friendly (e.g. available online, brief), validated, treatment sensitive outcome measure for clinical trials in ASD that is independent of verbal ability. In addition, this study will produce he largest existing dataset on emotion dysregulation in ASD, which will be used to identify emotional profiles and treatment needs in this population. Additional time-course questions in the EDI that tap the individual's history of emotion dysregulation will be useful for clinical conceptualization and helping to understand the boundaries between emotion dysregulation that is inherent in ASD and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Finally, having a sensitive measure of emotion dysregulation in ASD will aid in understanding heterogeneity in genetic and neuroimaging research and will enable cross-population studies"
"9283260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Findings from observational studies by our group and others suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (a common condition) is associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations in school-aged children. We hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations in high-risk (so defined due to an exacerbation in the previous year) children aged 6 to 14 years who have vitamin D insufficiency (a serum 25(OH) D <30 ng/ml) and who are being treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for mild to moderate persistent asthma. We further hypothesize that this protective effect results from a reduced incidence of viral infections that lead to severe asthma exacerbations and/or enhanced response to ICS in these children. We will test this hypothesis in a randomized double-masked placebo-controlled clinical trial with the following primary and secondary Specific Aims: Primary Specific Aim 1) To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation (4,000 IU/day) is superior to placebo in preventing severe asthma exacerbations in high-risk school-aged children who have vitamin D insufficiency and who are on ICS for mild to moderate persistent asthma. Secondary Specific Aims In high-risk school-aged children with vitamin D insufficiency who are on ICS for asthma, to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation is superior to placebo in:  1) Preventing severe asthma exacerbations resulting from viral infections  2) Reducing the daily dose of ICS as well as the average cumulative dose of ICS, at the end of the trial."
"9397501","Project Summary Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disease that leads to motor dysfunction and death. Affecting one in 6,000 to 10,000 babies born, it is the leading genetic killer of children under two years of age. The molecular basis of the disease is a deficiency in the production of a specific protein ? Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. Motor neuron function is sensitive to reduced SMN protein levels, and this cellular defect leads to the loss of muscle function in the limbs, neck, and chest. Currently there is no treatment for SMA. However, researchers have suggested that it is one of the neurological diseases closest to treatment, due to the unique presence of a back-up gene called SMN2. In fact, this past September Biogen submitted the first ever NDA for SMA to the FDA for a drug targeting the SMN2 back-up gene. Cure SMA has sponsored the SMA Researcher Meeting for 21 years. In 2017, the conference will be held June 29 to July 2 in Orlando, Florida at the Contemporary Hotel. It is now the largest SMA research conference worldwide with more than 330 attendees each year. Basic researchers, clinicians, and industrial researchers all attend the conference, allowing for cross-disciplinary dialogue crucial to therapy development. The meeting is held simultaneously with the Annual SMA Conference, with 1,200 people affected by SMA attending. The major meeting goal is to provide a venue for SMA experts to share unpublished data and develop scientific collaborations to hasten the development of a cure for SMA. Conference presentations are organized into 3 major areas: clinical research, basic research, and translational research. This allows researchers from different scientific disciplines to communicate about SMA. Another important meeting goal is to introduce new scientists to SMA research. This includes researchers in training to build the future of our research community and industrial researchers to integrate them quickly into our research community. Finally, a major focus of the 2017 meeting will be a special session on ?The Role of Fatigue and Muscle Weakness in SMA with Therapeutic Implications?. As mentioned above, the SMA field has made major advances with SMN enhancing approaches, but to achieve the greatest impact from this therapeutic approach, early treatment will likely be required. Therefore, the goal of this session is to discuss novel mechanisms that could result in greater motor and muscle function at advanced stages of SMA. Many older SMA patients cite fatigue and endurance as a significant concern, yet the biological origin, as well as the treatment options are poorly understood. The session will discuss these concerns from a clinical and biological perspective, breaking down the potential role of the different components of the motor unit and possible ways to intervene therapeutically."
"9306881","Community Engagement and Training Core (Aim #3) One of the aims of the MS-INBRE is to develop a pipeline of students that is trained in various aspects of biomedical research including community outreach. We have identified the three scientific themes that address the three major epidemics in Mississippi: cancer, STDs, and obesity. These health problems are particularly alarming in two communities in Mississippi; the rural community and the urban African-American community. These health disparities are caused by lack of education about prevention and by lack of access to health care. We propose to establish a Community Engagement and Training Core (CETC) whose mission is to improve the health of the rural community and the inner city (mostly African-American). The core will reach out directly into these communities with education to improve the health status of these vulnerable communities. To achieve this goal, the MSINBRE developed a partnership with My Brother's Keeper (MBK), an organization that has extensive experience and infrastructure in this type of efforts. This partnership will provide a training opportunity for 16 PUI students every year in community outreach. These MS-INBRE Service Scholars will be selected based on their interest in working directly with the target community. They will be trained by the professional staff at My Brother's Keeper under the supervision of its CEO, Dr. June Gipson, who will also serve as the director of CETC."
"9282654","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of Michigan and University of Florida is in response to RFA-DA-15-015, as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (9/13) to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 975 9-10 year olds will be recruited as part of this application, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 total sites across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. These comprehensive assessments will occur at 2-year follow-up intervals, with intermediate assessments of functioning and substance use at 6- month intervals. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. Elements Unique to this Site: This hub's Research Project application leverages site-specific expertise to address two aims focused on the identification of risk and resilience factors for adolescent substance use. Using baseline data categorized into distinct domains (Demographic, Cognitive, Mental Health, Personality, Life Stressors, Family History/Genetics, Environmental, and Brain), we will use cutting-edge, multi-stage analytic methods involving data reduction within each domain (e.g., latent variable analyses), identification of etiologically-distinct subgroups (e.g., community detection), and the construction of integrated multi-modal predictive models (e.g., regularized regression). This approach will delineate subgroups characterized by distinct profiles of risk and resilience. This approach is essential for informing outcomes of substance use during adolescence, which will ultimately inform the development of more efficacious interventions and clarify the toxic effects of exposure on adolescent brain, health, and cognition."
"9263679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The link between aggregated amyloid (A?) to downstream events, including hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic loss and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain to be elucidated. Growing lines of evidence suggests that astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to the development and progression of AD. Specifically, astrocytic glutamate transporter (GLT-1) decrease has been shown in AD. I want to elucidate the role of GLT-1 dysfunction in the progression or initiation of AD pathology. First, I will generate two suitable in vivo transgenic mouse models: one overexpressing human wildtype tau (hTau) with a conditional knockout out of GLT-1 in the forebrain region (NST-GLT1-KO) and the other expressing A? (J20) with NST-GLT1-KO. Second, I will conduct temporal assessment on cortical-dependent and hippocampal-dependent cognition by novel object recognition and novel object in place tests respectively. Third, I will compare temporal changes of A? pathology in J20-NST-GLT1-KO and tau pathology in hTau-NST-GLT1- KO mice. I will also compare the pathologies between the single and double transgenic mice. Finally, I will assess synaptic and dendritic changes by Golgi staining and immunofluorescence staining. These steps will determine whether the loss of the glutamate transporter activity is sufficient to 1) trigger a buildup of tau, synaptic loss and cognitive decline in human tau overexpressing mice and 2) exacerbate A? pathology. Hypothesis: Functional loss of GLT-1 triggers and exacerbates A? buildup and tau pathology, resulting in synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Aim 1: Determine whether the functional loss of GLT-1 triggers tau pathology, synaptic loss and cognitive decline in a mouse model of AD. Aim 2: Determine whether the functional loss of GLT-1 triggers aberrant neuronal excitatory activity and exacerbates A? pathology in a mouse model of AD. The contribution of this research includes a better understanding on the role of astrocyte dysfunction in the early stages of AD and its consequences on the progression of the disease. The data from this research proposal will elucidate potential therapeutic targets in the early stages of AD and tau-related neurodegenerative disease (tauopathies)."
"9281665","PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of the FAME program is to develop a film formulation of the integrase inhibitor MK-2048  that achieves cervical and vaginal tissue drug levels for one week following a single application. The broad  goal of this clinical project is to establish the feasibility of this approach by demonstrating that a single film  inserted intravaginally will provide adequate drug levels to the vaginal and cervical tissues to reduce infection  when challenged with HIV ex vivo up to 7 days after film application. The rationale for the development of an  on demand, coital-independent vaginal microbicide film is based on the increased recognition that daily use  products containing ARVs have had insufficient adherence in the young populations of women at the highest  risk of HIV to be effective. Our team has demonstrated that vaginal films can deliver the antiretroviral drug  dapivirine at levels similar to those achieved by rings or gel formulations. Project 1 and the IND Enabling  Project 4 of the FAME program will develop a vaginal film which can be tested in pharmacokinetic and pre-  Phase 1 studies of safety and efficacy. Therefore, we propose to: 1) conduct a sequence randomized  crossover study of two placebo films containing different polymers in order to test the hypothesis that film  excipients differentially impact the vaginal mucin proteins, glycome and microbiome; 2) perform a dose  selection pharmacokinetic study of a 15 and 30 mg MK-2048 film and then use this dose to 3) conduct a pre-  Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled study of an MK-2048 film which will assess the safety,  pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the MK-2048 film at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after a single application  using the ex vivo challenge model. Throughout the film evaluation process, we will incorporate a behavioral  decision science approach to produce an in-depth understanding of how women perceive and understand  vaginal microbicide films. To do this, we will assess user perceptions, acceptability, understanding and correct  use of microbicide films through mental models research, and to use those findings to create an intervention  tool aimed at addressing misconceptions and promoting acceptability and adherence."
"9273517","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The islets of Langerhans are multi-cellular micro-organs central to regulating blood glucose through the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Diabetes, a world-wide epidemic affecting ~400M people, ultimately arises due to a dysfunction of insulin-secreting ß-cells in the islet. Most genetic mutations that cause diabetes or elevate te risk of diabetes are associated with disrupting insulin secretion. While signaling within the ß-cel that regulates insulin is fairly well understood - consisting of a series of metabolic, electrical nd other cell signaling events - ß-cells do not act autonomously. Rather complex, dynamic cellular interactions are required to tightly regulate both the dynamic range and the pulsatile dynamics of insulin release, and these can be disrupted in diabetes. We have discovered how electrical coupling mediated by gap junction channels plays a key role to coordinate the dynamic electrical response underlying insulin release. However a key question is how properties of the individual ß-cells impact the islet-wide response upon coupling. This is important for several reasons: individual ß-cells are highly heterogeneous in terms of their signaling dynamics and response to glucose; mutations that cause diabetes shift the population-level response non-uniformly, and sub-populations of cells that show differing function are present in development and through many pathogenic conditions associated with diabetes. Therefore, towards our goal of understanding how properties of the ß-cell population impact the islet-level response when coupled, our overall hypothesis is: small changes in the regulation of electrical activity within te heterogeneous cellular population tightly control overall islet function upon electrical coupling. We will test this through 3 specific aims that combine quantitative experimental measurements and predictive mathematical models of multicellular islet signaling: 1) how coupling suppresses global activity under inhibitory conditions (such as upon diabetes-causing mutations), and the importance for the distribution in excitability of the ß-cell population; 2) how coupling coordinaes global dynamics under excitatory conditions, and how sub-populations of ß-cells exert control of the overall dynamics; and 3) how interactions between [Ca2+] and cAMP signaling can promote their coordination between ß-cells. Through understanding the population-level regulation and interactions within the islet, we will discover novel ways the global response of the islet can be controlled and how it may be disrupted in diabetes. This can be applied to overcome genetic mutations or other conditions of islet dysfunction that cause diabetes. Further, we anticipate many principles governing islet function will be broadly relevant to further our understanding of the emergent multicellular properties of physiological systems."
"9370044","ABSTRACT The objective of this proposed R21 work is to develop and demonstrate a novel high-speed (10Hz) multi-slice dynamic MRI acquisition and model-based analysis technique to quantify the biomechanical properties of cerebral blood vessels. This novel approach measures T1-weighted inflow fluctuations (related to blood flow/velocity) in large arterial and venous blood vessels. Fluid mechanics model-based analysis is then applied to examine the frequency-dependent dampening and phase between velocity waveforms measured from proximal and distal ends of blood vessel segments allows the characterization of the biophysical properties of these segments including vascular resistance, inductance, and compliance. These high temporal signals are combined with structural MRI angiography to provide a spatial map of the blood vessel properties and topology. We believe that these quantifiable biomechanical and mathematical parameters can be linked to cerebral vascular diseases, since these directly reflect properties such as the rigidity and flow resistance of the vessels. The development of these methods has significant clinical implications toward quantitative assessment of cerebral vascular physiology in the context of vascular disorders such as hypertension, stenosis, and risk of stroke. As a proof-of-concept of this approach, and to initially investigate the sensitivity of this method, this technique will be applied to characterize the cerebral vascular properties of two groups of patients with chronic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension in comparison to age-matched normotensive controls. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1. Optimize methods for high-speed MR arterial compliance mapping. Aim 2. Demonstrate proof-of-concept for high-speed MR arterial compliance mapping in chronic hypertensive (HT) and isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) patients and compared to age-matched normotensive (NT) healthy controls. We hypothesize that: Hypothesis 1. Measurements of vascular resistance and compliance is sensitive to hypertrophic changes in HT and ISH patients and can be reliably measured using our proposed high-speed MR arterial compliance mapping approach. Hypothesis 2. HT and ISH patients will show increased resistance (stiffness) and decreased capacitance (compliance) compared to NT controls. These changes will be larger in the ISH group. The dynamic cerebral auto-regulation index (dCAI) will be impaired in both HT and ISH."
"9275370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The newly described collagen fragment proline-glycine-proline (PGP) drives chronic neutrophilic inflammatory responses and appears to play a role in COPD pathogenesis. Prolyl endopeptidase (PE) is a particularly important serine protease because it has been shown to catalyze the final step in a proteolytic cascade required to generate PGP from collagen. Consequently, PE would seem to represent a very attractive new target for future therapeutics related to COPD. However because recognition of the role of PE in chronic inflammation is so new, certain fundamental aspects of the regulation of this protease in the context of lung disease remains poorly understood. This revised proposal will fill in this void of knowledge by highlighting new evidence from the PI's laboratory demonstrating that PE is released from airway epithelial cells via exosomes. This application focuses on a unique feed-forward pathway of PE expression and PGP generation in cigarette smoke (CS) exposure and COPD with particular emphasis on endogenous CXCR ligand signaling. The aims in this proposal are thematically linked to each other (through high quality in vitro, in vivo models and ex vivo clinicl specimens) and are carefully crafted to improve our understanding of this pathway and its relevance to COPD lung disease. Specific aim 1a will examine the regulation and release of PE from primary airway epithelial cells by CXC ligands, highlighting the potential of PE release via exosomes, identifying the intracellular pathways involved in the release, and determining the impact of this release on ex vivo PGP generation from collagen. Specific aim 1b will determine the impact of cigarette smoke (CS) on the regulation of PE and PGP production, with specific targeting of CXC receptors and PE with novel therapeutic compounds. The second aim of this grant will focus on PE inhibition as a therapeutic approach in a chronic CS model of COPD. This will be examined utilizing a genetic deletion of PE (the PREP-/- mouse) to examine if there is amelioration of the observed inflammatory response and phenotype with chronic CS exposure. This model will also be examined in testing a new PE inhibitor S- 17092, currently in clinical trials for neurodegenerative disease, as a lead anti-inflammatory therapeutic in this model of COPD lung disease. The final aim will involve the collection of clinical biospecimens via bronchoscopy from patients with COPD to determine the presence of PE-rich exosomes and PGP peptides compared to individuals without lung disease. The successful completion of these aims will lead to an increased understanding of the regulation and release of PE in the extracellular environment and the downstream effects of its unfettered protease activity. In doing so, these studies may result in the development of a new biomarker and therapeutic target for COPD."
"9384078","Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin (?-ctn) signaling plays a crucial role in embryonic development and homeostasis of many adult tissues. Conditional inactivation of ?-ctn, the sole downstream mediator of pathway activity, demonstrates its necessity in multiple diverse processes in vivo. Inactivation of ?-ctn in endothelial cells (ECs), for example, yields embryonic vascular defects limited to the central nervous system, while systemic vascular development appears normal. Interestingly, our recent studies show that inactivation of ?-ctn in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in mice causes death by embryonic day (E) 12.5, with systemic arteries that are dilated and incompetent due to impaired SMC proliferation, survival, and investment of the developing vascular wall. Thus during development, SMCs of the systemic circulation require ?-ctn expression, while corresponding ECs do not. Our mechanistic analysis indicates that the former effect depends in part on critical signals from the ?-ctn C-terminal domain that suppress acetylation and activity of the tumor suppressor p53. ?-ctn functions in the adult vasculature and its potential roles in vascular homeostasis or remodeling are not well understood. Our preliminary studies indicate that SMC ?-ctn can be inactivated in the adult mouse without immediate vascular consequences, but that neointimal formation after vascular injury is significantly reduced by its absence. How ?-ctn inhibition affects adult vascular integrity, response to injury, and atherosclerosis has not been reported. These gaps in our understanding are significant, because aberrant ?-ctn signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers, and thus inhibition of ?-ctn serves as a potentially important target in several emerging anti-neoplastic strategies. This proposal encompasses three aims: first, to determine how ?-ctn suppresses SMC p53 activity, second, to assess ?-ctn structural and N- vs C-terminal signaling functions in vascular homeostasis, injury response, and atherosclerosis, and third, to test Wnt/?-ctn inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for control of accelerated vascular remodeling and/or atherosclerosis. Analysis of ?-ctn in vascular function is relevant to understanding how new therapies based on Wnt/?-ctn inhibition may affect vascular homeostasis, and should allow us to evaluate the safety of such approaches and their potential utility in treatment of vascular disease."
"9276660","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Pathobiology and Reversibility of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (PROP-ABC) study proposes to study an extant cohort, comprising ~400 normoglycemic African American and Caucasian offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes for an additional 5-year. The subjects were enrolled between 2006 and 2009 and have been followed up to 2012, during which 11 have developed diabetes and 100 developed prediabetes, without evidence of racial disparities. The objective of the present proposal is to gain a fuller understanding of the natural history and metabolic predictors of early glucose abnormalities, by assessing the role of race during the second wave of glycemic progression, and the time dependency of reversibility of prediabetes. The study tests 4 hypotheses: 1) Among offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes, early progression from normal to impaired glucose regulation (within 5 yr.) occurs in the highest-risk subjects independently of race, whereas late progression (5-10 yr.) displays racial disparities, and is predicted by physiological, biochemical and behavioral markers; 2) Early microvascular complications, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and endothelial dysfunction manifest during transition from normal to impaired glucose regulation, display racial disparities, and are predicted by glycemic and nonglycemic factors; 3) The metabolically healthy insulin-sensitive obese (ISO) phenotype displays racial disparities in its association with cardiometabolic risk factors and incident dysglycemia among African-Americans and Caucasians offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes; and 4) Duration of the prediabetic state is a major determinant of, and is inversely related to, the efficacy of lifestyle intervention to induce regression of the prediabetic phenotype and restoration of normal glucose regulation. The 100 participants with prediabetes will receive Intensive Lifestyle intervention (ILI), to reverse prediabetes and restore normoglycemia. The ~260 participants who have maintained normal glucose status will continue follow-up for 5 years; persons who develop prediabetes will immediately receive ILI. Understanding the predictors of the escape from normoglycemia, the role of race, and the reversibility of new-onset prediabetes is of utmost importance, because the discovery of interventions for reversal of prediabetes will also help eliminate ethnic disparities in downstream diabetes events. The additional 5 years of follow-up will provide data on 10-yr rates and predictors of incident prediabetes, racial patterns during the second wave of progression, and, time-dependent reversibility of prediabetes. Focusing on prediabetes is of immense public health significance, as its successful reversal prevents diabetes and associated complications."
"9389899","Project Summary Central neurons are highly specialized and long-lived cells that form precise circuitry to support normal brain function. The cerebral cortex does not add new neurons to maintain or increase function nor replace neurons lost to injury or disease. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the human brain shows that adult neurogenesis is possible. However, for human cerebral cortex, there are two possible strategies for neuronal addition, 1) replace with exogenous neurons generated by cell culture or 2) recruit local endogenous cells by converting them to neurons. The ultimate goal of this project is to investigate the second approach and to establish the capacity for neuronal reprogramming of human glial progenitor cells and to assess their potential for functional integration. For neuronal reprogramming to have therapeutic potential, it will be necessary to precisely engineer neurons with a predictable and sustainable rate of survival. Aim 1 will address issues of survival efficiency and subtype precision, developing an innovative vector toolbox to conduct these studies. But there also remains the question of how authentic these induced neurons become. The forced transcription factor expression may cause expression of certain neuronal phenotypes, including the capacity to fire an action potential, without necessarily resulting in functional maturation. While our preliminary data demonstrate the most advanced neuronal morphology reported to date, true circuit integration still remains to be shown. Aim 2 is designed to utilize current advances in connectivity tracing to investigate the state of integration of newly engineered neurons into local and distant circuits. In particular Aim 2b will ask if newly engineered neurons are capable of actively rewiring in the brain. We see application for this approach in rebuilding any damaged circuit, including ultimately those experiencing dysregulation such as in epilepsy or neuropathic pain. There is no information about the capacity to reprogram non-neuronal cells in the human brain into new neurons, despite the compelling need for such data to advance therapeutic application of this approach. As we cannot conduct these experiments in human brain, Aim 3 will develop a chimeric model, engrafting human cells into rodent brain to allow targeting of human glial progenitor cells for neuronal reprogramming and evaluating the extent of circuit integration with rat neurons. By using human iPSC-derived glial progenitor cells as our starting population, it will be possible to expand these studies to address the impact of disease-specific factors as well as providing a basis for eventual patient-specific therapies."
"9324366","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite years of intense efforts, there has been no effective therapeutic approach for Huntington's disease (HD) or other neurodegenerative diseases. The cause of toxicity in HD is poorly understood, and there is no well-defined drug target. Thus, at-risk and affected individuals inexorably progress toward clinical disease, providing an underlying urgency not only to find therapies for the disease, but also to develop biomarkers to predict the progress of therapeutic outcome. During the last funding period, we have discovered a toxic oxidation cycle in which there is cooperation between the mutant HD protein and the expansion mutation in causing toxicity. Toxicity occurs at four steps, and we have developed promising inhibitors to each one. The most promising compound, XJB-5-131, has a mitochondrial targeted antioxidant properties. Although it is poorly soluble, administration alone alleviates all of the obvious pathological features of disease in an hHdH150Q mouse model for HD. In the renewal, we propose to improve the drug-like properties of XJB-5-131 and use an optimized analog in a multi-hit therapy in which multiple steps of the toxic oxidation cycles are targeted simultaneously: (1) a tricyclic pyrone for inhibiting the protein aggregates, (2) inhibitors for 8-oxo-G glycosylase, an enzyme that prevents single strand breaks and stops CAG trinucleotide expansion in DNA, and (3) HDAC inhibitors that target MSH2-MSH3, a protein that stabilizes the DNA loops to create expansions. In Aim 1, we propose to co-administer our most successful compound, XJB-5-131, with at least one of the other inhibitors to determine the pharmacology, the optimal route of analog administration, the maximum tolerated dose of each inhibitor combination, and to prioritize in vivo testing according to the best drug-like properties. In Aim 2, we will test the efficacy of multi-hit treatment using simple in vivo endpoints of motor function, cognition, histopathology, and mitochondrial activity to follow therapeutic progression. We will identify which combination of compounds is most effective in offsetting toxicity due to expression of the mutants HD protein. In sum, there are no therapies for HD or methods to speed up the search for therapeutics. New tools and approaches are desperately needed. Our novel discovered compounds and the multi-hit strategy for therapy provide a promising therapeutic approach that warrants further testing to fill these medical gaps."
"9301035","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic, pharmacological and imaging studies point to altered dopamine (DA) signaling as a risk determinant of Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ADHD comorbid disorders. The presynaptic DA transporter (DAT, SLC6A3) has drawn particular interest due to its interactions with the most commonly prescribed ADHD medications, methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin) and amphetamine (AMPH) formulations (e.g. Adderall). MPH is a DAT antagonist, whereas AMPH competes with DA for transport by DAT and induces DAT-mediated, non-vesicular DA release. The molecular/cellular basis for the effectiveness of these agents in ADHD treatment, and their relationship to a DA-based etiology of ADHD is unclear, owing in large part to a lack of understanding of the etiology of the disorder. This fact has also contributed to a lack of animal models with construct validity, necessitating the use of models with trait similarities (e.g., hyperactivity) but where origins likly have little or no relationship to disease mechanisms. The genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD, is believed to arise from contributions of both common and rare genetic variation. Whereas common genetic variation is often difficult to model, owing to a lack of penetrance and conservation across species, rare variation, particularly polymorphisms that impact protein coding sequence, offers the prospect of targeting conserved elements of proteins to achieve functional changes in molecules, cells and circuits. Recently, we identified a rare, coding variant (Val559) in the SLC6A4 gene of two male siblings with ADHD, a variant also identified in subjects with bipolar disorder and autism. Our studies of DAT Val559 expressed in transfected cells and neurons revealed that although DAT protein expression and DA uptake are normal, the variant displays a striking, voltage-dependent, DAT-mediated, anomalous DA efflux (ADE) phenotype. Remarkably, AMPH suppresses the ADE of DAT Val559, whereas it induces DA efflux from WT DAT (Ala559). DAT Val559 is also phosphorylated at N-terminal sites that are normally phosphorylated only after AMPH application, and the mutation of these sites in DAT Val559 to preclude phosphorylation eliminates ADE. These studies led us to the novel hypothesis that tonic DA leak, arising from perturbations of a DAT regulatory network that normally sustains concentrative DA uptake, leads to DA-linked traits prominently featured in multiple neurobehavioral disorders. To test this hypothesis, we have generated DAT Val559 knock-in mice and initiated a multi-disciplinary program to profile their biochemical, physiologica and behavioral features. Our Preliminary Studies provide evidence of ADE in vivo that leads to anomalous actions of local and systemically administered AMPH. In the current proposal, we seek to extend these studies to establish molecular, physiological and behavioral perturbations that arise in the model, studies that can redirect the field toward a novel framework for RDoc-responsive diagnoses and treatments underlying multiple psychiatric disorders."

"9323475","Project Summary Abstract The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism by which vascular malformations grow. This will inform us about the fundamental process of vascular morphogenesis and, importantly, identify specific pathways for which targeted therapies can be developed to improve the lives of children affected by vascular malformations and other vascular diseases. Vascular malformations are common, affecting 1/200 children, and cause significant morbidity: disfigurement, obstruction, pain, infection, bleeding, heart failure, and death. Vascular malformations are particularly problematic because they are progressive and enlarge over time. Currently the mechanism for vascular malformations is unknown and there is no cure for these lesions. We propose the novel hypothesis that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be responsible for the progression of vascular malformations. The secretion of FSH mirrors the life cycle of these lesions (i.e., FSH surges during puberty when a vascular malformation is most likely to expand). Our preliminary data has shown that vascular malformations uniquely express the receptor for FSH (FSHR), in contrast to other normal and pathological vascular tissues. The goal of these studies is to test whether FSH (or its antagonists) affects the growth of vascular malformations. Our first aim will isolate specific cell populations from vascular malformations to identify the cell type(s) that contain FSHR. Our second aim will test the effects of FSH on the angiogenic/vasculogenic properties of human-derived vascular malformation cells. Cell based assays will be used to determine whether FSH causes human vascular malformation endothelial cells, pericytes, or stem cells to exhibit a phenotype that promotes neovascularization. Finally, our third aim will test whether systemically administered FSH (or antagonists) affects the growth of vascular malformations in-vivo. Our validated murine models of lymphatic malformation and venous malformation and newly created in-vivo vascular malformation models will be used for these studies. The effects of FSH on the size, blood flow, and microvessel density on these lesions will be tested. These experiments will be high impact when we succeed in identifying the mechanism responsible for vascular malformations. For the first time we would be able to pursue a targeted approach for treating these lesions. For example, pathway specific topical, intralesional, and/or systemic FSH inhibitors could be developed to prevent the formation or growth of vascular malformations. Also, discoveries into the cause of these lesions will help us understand the mechanisms that underlie other pediatric vascular lesions, and will improve our ability to manipulate neovascularization in other systems (e.g., cancer, tissue repair, engineering)."
"9276070","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions): At our COBRE Center and Institute, the large majority of investigations employ and develop transgenic and knockout mouse models for human disease. In keeping with our Center's theme, these typically are designed towards studying stem and/or progenitor cells within select tissues, lineages and pathways of prime interest. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that many cell and molecular regulators can also affect metabolism and bioenergetics in substantial and important ways. This can reveal unexpected off targets, rule-in major circumscribed roles for new metabolic regulators, or rule-out pleiotropic effects. In year-4 of Phase-ll, in response to increasing needs for metabolic phenotyping, we designed and deployed a new Physiology Core Facility in order to provide consolidated and highly informed analyses of mouse model biomarkers and analytes, metabolism; global metabolism and skeletal features; cell and mitochondrial respiration; and hematology parameter analyses. Importantly, this new facility is headed by a highly productive and informed clinician scientist with exceptional experience in bone, adipocyte, endocrine and metabolic biology (Dr. C Rosen, Core Director). Expert research staff also are in-place with 15+ yrs combined experience. Specific goals/aims of this now fully active core are four-fold: 1- Offer a needs-based arrays of enzyme-linked, colorimetric and radioimmunoassays for comprehensive hematologic, metabolic and skeletal phenotyping; 2- Perform complete metabolic phenotyping for genetic models through the use of metabolic cages plus DXA scanning approaches; 3- Assess cellular and mitochondrial bioenergetics via analysis of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis of isolated cells and mitochondria; 4- Provide investigators with full reports and counsel detailing the metabolic profiling of mutant strains, total and fractional tissue mass, energy expenditure, biochemical markers and substrate utilization. As this core now ramps-up, biomarker/analytic demands are increasing; mouse metabolic chambers are reserved 3-monthsout; and needs for cell/mitochondrial respiration and hematology analyses are steadily increasing. Six months- in, exciting findings already are being generated for publications and grants. Extensive prior experience (and success) with clinical laboratory endeavors further underscores strengths in developing plans for core income, and self-sustainability. Institutional support for this exciting new core facility also has been strong (and new institutional faculty hires in metabolics are scheduled in a recently approved new 5- year research strategic plan). Overall, this core will effectively and efficiently provide investigators with comprehensive metabolic phenotyping."
"9312551","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase II project will develop a novel mobile framework to measure left ventricular ejection fraction as a marker for systolic dysfunction using automated non-invasive analysis of cardiac signals. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women accounting for more than one-third (33.6%) of all U.S. deaths. In 2011, total costs associated with cardiovascular disease in the U.S. were estimated to be $320 billion, making it the costliest health problem facing the nation. In addition, it occurs disproportionately among minority and health disparity populations. For example, heart failure related deaths are 37% higher among African- Americans than among whites. Decreased ejection fraction is a marker of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the most common type of heart failure. Overall cardiac health can be significantly improved by proper triage at the primary care level by determination of the ejection fraction without requiring a 2-D echo-cardiogram. It will provide health care professionals with point-of-care technology to guide diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic efforts. Portable device capability makes it even more accessible and readily available without high costs. As the technology being developed does not require skilled operators or specially trained physicians, it will allow healthcare providers to measure ejection fraction within their normal medical training. Through the course of the two-year Phase I work we have developed a revolutionary medical device that enables measurement of ejection fraction using the cardiac sound signals measured at the chest wall. The scope of the science proposed in this Phase II project is to complete development of the diagnostic framework using our specially engineered sensor system combined with the novel algorithm technology to be accessed via a smartphone or tablet for a portable and cost-effective solution. Resource-poor communities across the globe lack access to quality healthcare arising from shortages in medical expertise and poor availability of expensive medical diagnostic devices. In recent years, mobile phones have become increasingly advanced and ubiquitous. The mobile framework developed through this project is a tremendous opportunity to provide low-cost diagnostics to under-served populations. The benefit of this pioneering work is the development of a low-cost and portable solution that can be used to diagnose systolic dysfunction, and thus enable improved screening during routine annual checkups, doctor visits, at community medical screenings, classes, and health fairs leading to healthier communities. It will make measuring ejection fraction as routine as measuring blood pressure. In Phase II, we will continue validation of the device through user-trials and seek FDA 510(k) clearance for commercialization. Followed by commercialization in the Florida and Mississippi region, based on the partnerships and joint collaborations established to help create a commercially successful product."

"9277481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the great hallmarks of evolution is the enclosure of genetic information in the nucleus. This spatial separation creates the necessity for efficient communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which is achieved through the selective transport of folded proteins and of protein/nucleic acid complexes across the double membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE). The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole gateway that allows passage of macromolecules through the NE, making this transport organelle an essential machine for eukaryotic life. NPCs are embedded in circular pores permeating the NE and can accomplish the bidirectional transport of particles of up to ~40 nm in diameter and at a rate of several hundred events per second. Electron microscopic studies have revealed that the NPC consists of a central core with an 8-fold rotational symmetry across a nucleo-cytoplasmic axis and a two-fold rotational symmetry across the plane of the NE. This symmetric core links to cytoplasmic filaments and a nuclear basket structure. The NPC is built from approximately 30 distinct proteins, termed nucleoporins (nups) that are organized into six distinct subcomplexes. Each nup is present in the NPC in multiple copies such that the entire assembly reaches the extraordinary molecular mass of ~60 MDa in yeast and even more in vertebrates. The NPC functions not just as a transport channel, but has a comprehensive role in other modes of gene regulation, for example through direct interaction with the transcription and mRNA export machineries. As such, it is less surprising that NPC dysfunction has been observed in a diverse set of human illnesses, such as neoplastic or retroviral disease. These associations as well as the NPC's existential role in eukaryotic cell biology have motivated investigations into its detailed architecture. The NPC's size and flexibility along with the unavailability of sufficient quantities of suitable material presently preclude the crystallographi determination of the structure of the entire intact NPC in one piece. An alternative approach proposed herein seeks to elucidate the atomic architecture of the NPC through recombinant reconstitution and crystallographic characterization of NPC subcomplexes, which constitute the physiological building blocks of the intact NPC in vivo. Combined with electron microscopic reconstruction, biochemical protein-protein interaction maps and cellular assays, this strategy is designed to lead to a composite pseudo-atomic model for the entire NPC and provide a roadmap for comprehensive structure-function analyses. As such, the outcome of the proposed research is expected to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the involvement of the NPC in nucleocytoplasmic transport and other cellular processes, while at the same time creating a mechanistic basis for currently untreatable nucleoporin diseases. Furthermore, the methodologies developed herein will challenge the current boundaries of structural cell biology and serve as a paradigm for other large macromolecular assemblies with essential cellular roles whose functional mechanism has remained elusive due to lack of structural insight."
"9264522","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes has climbed enormously over the last decades. Nearly 26 million Americans (8.3% of the U.S. population) have diabetes (90% of whom are type 2) and additional estimated 79 million US adults (about 35%) have pre-diabetes according to new estimates from the CDC. Insulin resistance is the main culprit in the development of these disorders. Although our understanding of the molecular basis of insulin signaling and insulin resistance has significantly increased, the therapeutic interventions for insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes remain inadequate. Recent reports have shown the importance of central neural signaling in the control of hepatic glucose production and glucose homeostasis. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated manipulation of expression of the orexigenic peptide neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) to study the function of DMH NPY in the control of energy balance, we have noted a potential role for DMH NPY in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Our pilot studies have revealed that knockdown of NPY in the DMH enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity and promoted insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production independently of the changes in body weight. Given that the brainstem/vagal nerve circuits participate in the control of hepatic glucose production, we hypothesize that DMH NPY signaling affects hepatic glucose production to regulate glucose homeostasis via a descending pathway to the brainstem and through the actions of the vagus nerve. The present research project is aimed at assessing this hypothesis via the following three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to characterize DMH NPY signaling in the regulation of hepatic glucose production by determining the importance of hepatic vagal signaling in DMH NPY regulation of hepatic glucose production and examining the contribution of neural signaling in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus to the glycemic effect of DMH NPY. Aim 2 focuses on identifying the role of DMH NPY modulation of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) oxytocin (OXT) signaling to regulate hepatic glucose production. We will specifically assess whether alterations in OXT signaling in the brainstem affect the glycemic effect of DMH NPY. In Aim 3, experiments are proposed to ascertain the actions of the neuromodulators such as cholecystokinin and agouti-related protein in modulating DMH NPY signaling in the regulation of hepatic glucose production and glucose homeostasis. Overall, the results from this project will elucidate the potential neural mechanism underlying the control of glucose homeostasis, and provide the neural basis for designing potential intervention strategies for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes."
"9274090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sperm acquire motility and the ability to fertilize and egg during their transit in the epididymis; post testicular sperm maturation and storage involve mechanisms mediated by the epididymal mucosa. One of the most intriguing and understudied aspects of male reproductive physiology is the ability of the excurrent duct to prevent the development of autoimmune responses against millions of autoantigenic spermatogenic cells and mature spermatozoa, meanwhile initiating very efficient immune responses against pathogenic microorganisms. The present application is focused on the role of macrophages (M?) and dendritic cells (DCs) in establishing the protective environment in which spermatozoa mature and are stored. M? and DCs are two closely related and extremely versatile families of cells that play critical roles in the initiation and regulation of immune responses. We have previously shown that the epididymis is populated by a dense and heterogeneous network of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) expressing M? and DC markers; in the proximal epididymis, they establish intimate interactions with epididymal epithelial cells and are part of the blood- epididymis barrier. Therefore, they are strategically positioned to play a major role in the contro of male reproductive function. We hypothesize that M? and DCs cooperate to survey both sides of the blood- epididymis barrier to regulate the balance between immune tolerance and inflammation in the post-testicular environment. In Specific Aim 1, we characterize luminal antigen uptake and elucidate the mechanisms underlying tolerance to sperm antigens via the induction of a specific subset of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how M? and DCs prevent circulating pathogens from affecting spermatozoa by surveying local capillaries. Both aims will rely on the use of state-of-the-art microscopy imaging procedures (3D laser scanning confocal microscopy and two-photo intravital microscopy), transgenic mouse models, and immunological techniques (e.g. flow cytometry analysis, cross-talk assays to characterize MPs and T cell interactions) rarely used in reproductive physiology. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide new frameworks for the treatment of male immunological infertility (a major public health issue) and, conversely, for the control of male fertility via immunocontraception."
"9438043","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HL-131: To function as an intact barrier, epithelia must maintain constant cell numbers despite sometimes high rates of turnover. If the rate of cell death exceeds proliferation, epithelial barrier function could become compromised; if it lags behind proliferation, cells could amass into tumors. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that keep airway epithelial stem cells largely quiescent during homeostasis or in check after a regenerative response to prevent the tissue overcrowding and dysplasia associated with airway remodeling in chronic lung diseases like COPD and asthma. After airway epithelial injury, surviving epithelial cells spread out to maintain barrier function and secrete Wnt7b to induce fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) expression and proliferation in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Fgf10 secreted by the ASMCs then acts on surviving club cells to initiate epithelial repair by breaking quiescence and inducing proliferation. The objective of this project is to identify the key signals that keep this Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling cascade silent during normal homeostasis or once regeneration is complete, but activate the Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling cascade when airway epithelial injury is sensed. Recent work in the lung has identified a role for the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in regulating airway epithelial stem/progenitor cell quiescence during normal homeostasis. In addition, it was shown that the Hippo pathway becomes inactivated in surviving airway epithelial cells when they spread out to maintain barrier function shortly after injury, likely to initiate repair. We therefore hypothesize, that the Hippo pathway keeps airway epithelial/stem progenitor cells quiescent during normal homeostasis by inhibiting activation of the Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling cascade. We have identified substantial aberrant signaling of the above-described pathways in clinical samples of COPD. We further hypothesize that when surviving airway epithelial cells spread out, signals are transduced by integrins to induce Yap/Taz-mediated Wnt7b expression. Interestingly, the scaffolding protein integrin linked kinase (Ilk) has been proposed to be essential for the proper termination of liver regeneration by positively regulating the Hippo pathway. Based on these findings the overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that: Ilk in the airway epithelium maintains stem cell quiescence by positively regulating the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway to block activation of the Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling axis and prevent airway remodeling as observed in chronic lung diseases. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the Hippo pathway blocks activation of the Wnt7b- Fgf10 signaling axis between airway epithelial progenitors and their niche during normal homeostasis. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that during normal homeostasis Ilk positively regulates the Hippo pathway in airway epithelial cells, to inhibit activation of the Wnt7b-Fgf10 repair pathway. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether human airway remodeling in COPD patients is associated with deregulated Ilk-Hippo- Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling."
"9331709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to commercialize the Hemanext Storage System to deliver red blood cells (RBC) of significantly improved quality by establishing and maintaining an anaerobic environment for refrigerated RBC storage. The higher quality red blood cell product will exhibit bioequivalence vs. conventionally prepared RBC with lower doses by virtue of higher RBC recovery, superior microvascular perfusion and oxygen delivery and a reduction in agents implicated in adverse events. The design of the Hemanext Storage System has been informed by detailed study of existing blood bank operating practices to maximize compatibility with existing procedures, equipment use, and cost. The Phase IIB work described below will build on the outcomes achieved in an ongoing Phase II contract. Supported by the Phase II contract, a first generation disposable oxygen reduction and anaerobic storage system was designed and fabricated with the objective of performing the required pivotal clinical studies to achieve FDA clearance. The four aims of this Phase II Bridge proposal are: First, to conduct a pre-pivotal, dual-arm clinical study with 6 subjects under 2 processing conditions. A first generation, IDE-ready commercial device will be tested at Hoxworth Blood Center to both verify the fit of the Hemanext Storage System into pre-storage component processing operations at a blood center and to measure the impact deoxygenation and anaerobic storage have on in vivo recovery and in vitro blood quality parameters. Second, to conduct the pivotal clinical study to support the FDA regulatory submission of the Hemanext Storage System. Hoxworth Blood Center and the American Red Cross Mid-Atlantic Region Research Center in Norfolk are the planned pivotal clinical study sites. Third, to conduct an in vivo recovery study at Columbia University to demonstrate how establishing and maintaining an anaerobic environment mitigates the damage done to red blood cells by irradiation. Fourth, to apply systems biology analytics of red blood cell metabolomics, lipidomics, biomechanics, and vascular bioactivity to identify novel biomarkers that are predictive of in vivo recovery. All studies will be performed, where required, under the authorization of an FDA-compliant IRB."
"9308043","Contact PD/PI: Buchanan, Thomas A Inst-Career-Dev-001 (047) MCD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We propose a two-year Mentored Career Development (MCD) Program for clinician scholars that will lead to general competency in clinical and translational research and establish a lifelong methodological foundation overlaid with the additional competencies in communications, grant-writing, leadership and team science that are requisite for success as an independent career investigator. Consistent with the theme of the Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute (SC CTSI), the MCD Scholars will also develop the specific competencies and insights needed to carry out research in and translate findings to diverse populations. The MCD Program builds on a formal methodological core and complementary career development activities that have been established during the first four years of funding. We plan every-other- year cohorts of seven trainees, three supported by this award and four with institutional support. Trainees will enroll either in the existing Master of Science or Certificate in Clinical, Translational and Biomedical Investigations, completing a three-course methodological core, courses in biostatistics, and new courses on research in diverse populations and informatics. A major outcome for the core courses is completion of a K or R type proposal. The program for each MCD Scholar is tailored around the Individual Development Plan (IDP) and discussion with the mentoring team. Complementary activities include a career development seminar series, NIH-style mock review of planned applications, and mentor training. Scholars will have community- based experiences related to clinical and translational research and work with mentors from a community setting. They will have an array of internal and external opportunities to gain experience in regulatory science, in innovation and technology transfer, in health services and health outcomes, and in industry settings. A robust distance education platform is in place, which will be used for flexibility, archiving, and dissemination of materials, and training is offered in ?digital scholarship.? We intend to collaborate with the other California hubs to develop and disseminate a model curriculum in research on diverse populations, along with other products. Evaluation covers short-, intermediate- and long-term metrics, and the resulting data are used for continuing refinement of our program. The Multiple Principal Investigators, Drs. Samet and Patino-Sutton, have collaborated in developing the program over the first funding cycle; they are joined by faculty and mentors who bring expertise and experience with all phases of clinical and translational research and have rich records of research in diverse populations. Looking back over accomplishments since the SC CTSI was funded by the National Institutes of Health, we can identify transformative and widespread institutional change consequent to the current KL2 and TL1 programs. We have established a novel model for training at an institution that had only begun to formalize training in clinical and translational research before the SC CTSI programs were initiated. In this next phase, we will refine our training approach and aim to train researchers who carry out meaningful research to improve the health of diverse populations.

"9309550","We propose to continue our research group?s work to identify and validate hormonal markers that predict risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although the estrogen pathway plays a critical role in breast carcinogenesis, accruing evidence suggests measurement of the classic estrogens only, as done in prior epidemiologic studies (including our own) may miss a sizeable component of estrogenic activity that is etiologically relevant to risk. Further, the insulin pathway is another critical, but relatively understudied, hormonal pathway that may impact breast cancer risk. Using a prospective nested case-control design, we plan to analyze blood samples collected from the 32,826 participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) who provided a blood sample in 1989-90 and, for 18,743 of these women, a second sample in 1999-2000. Specifically, we propose to evaluate the independent associations of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC; a recently identified endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator) as well as an estrogen bioassay (that assesses estrogen pathway activation) in relation to breast cancer risk. We also will evaluate several new aspects of the relationship between plasma c-peptide (reflecting insulin secretion) and breast cancer risk. With 26 years of follow-up and two blood samples in a subset of women, we will evaluate the importance of timing of c-peptide exposure in breast carcinogenesis. Further, we will assess whether the c-peptide/breast cancer relationship varies by breast tumor expression of insulin receptor or several markers of PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. Previous work, by not accounting for these tumor molecular characteristics, may have underestimated the etiologic importance of insulin in breast cancer risk and hence opportunities for prevention. We also will evaluate if c-peptide (and secondarily the novel estrogen related markers) improve the Gail and Rosner-Colditz risk prediction models, and validate the addition of multiple biomarkers (i.e., the plasma hormones, a genetic risk score and mammographic density) to these models in the prospective Mayo Mammography Health Study (MMHS) and Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS). The MMHS and MCCS have risk factor and biomarker information that is comparable to that in the NHS. In addition to providing one or two blood samples, NHS cohort members have provided detailed exposure and disease information biennially (including data on most known or probable breast cancer risk factors) since 1976, and, for about 70% of breast cancer cases, we have collected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue, thus allowing molecular analyses of the tumor. The recently funded NHS UM1 grant will provide cohort follow-up, breast cancer documentation, and important covariate data, increasing the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project. This project, by working across the translational research spectrum from discovery of novel hormonal biomarkers to practical application of well confirmed biomarkers in risk prediction models, should add considerable insight into breast cancer etiology and ways to better identify high risk women who may benefit from risk reduction efforts (e.g., chemoprevention)."
"9273593","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy has been shown to result in substantial improvement and even cure for a number of diseases such as hemoglobinopathies and adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition, HSC transplantation has recently been shown to result in the cure of HIV when HIV-resistant donor cells from a donor with a rare mutation in the HIV co-receptor CCR5 were used in an allogeneic transplantation. While this study showed that transplantation of CCR5-negative cells could result in an HIV cure, finding an HLA-matched CCR5-negative donor is exceedingly rare. Thus as a surrogate approach many investigators are exploring the use of genetically modified HIV-resistant autologous cells. However, relatively high levels of genetically modified/HIV resistant cells are necessary and this can often not be achieved even after a myeloablative conditioning regimen. We have shown in a nonhuman primate model using HSCs gene-modified with a MGMTP140K mutant transgene that we can achieve efficient increases of gene-modified cells in vivo. Thus, we would like to test this strategy in a patient population that has been shown to benefit from an autologous transplantation and that may also benefit from both the anti-tumor effect of low-dose chemotherapy used for in vivo selection and from the resulting increased levels of genetically modified and HIV-resistant HSCs. We have previously shown that we can achieve low-level engraftment of gene-modified HIV-resistant cells in patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. However, engraftment of gene-modified cells was too low to result in any significant therapeutic benefit. In the current application, we propose to use a potent HIV entry inhibitor (C46) and the potent P140K selection cassette to increase the level of gene-modified HIV resistant cells in patients. The use of in vivo selection would have wide applications not only for the treatment of HIV but also genetic diseases and in particular hemoglobinopathies where high levels of gene-modified cells are necessary to alleviate all clinical manifestations of the disease. A major strength of this proposal is the collaboration between investigators from two institutions with unique expertise in the fields of gene therapy, transplantation and clinical HIV. Our overall hypothesis is that an autologous HSC transplantation with cells gene-modified with a potent anti-HIV transgene will lead to control of HIV and associated complications. Furthermore, inclusion of a potent in vivo selection transgene, P140K, will allow us to significantly increase the levels of HIV-resistant CD4 cells following transplantation. Based on extensive preclinical data from our nonhuman primate studies, we hypothesize that the levels of gene-modified, HIV-resistant HSCs and HSC-derived T cells obtained with our proposed approach will allow for an improved immune response and control or elimination of HIV and thus cure."
"9326981","Project Summary The digestion and absorption of nutrients from maternal milk during the postnatal period of suckling is fundamentally different from the ?mature? digestion and absorption of ingested food that develops around weaning and takes place henceforth. In adults, proteins from ingested foods are digested by proteases in the lumen of the digestive track, largely in the stomach, and then the resulting amino acids are absorbed by intestinal enterocytes. During suckling, however, the stomach is not yet acidic and proteins pass through it intact. Then, in the intestinal lumen, enterocytes endocytose the whole proteins and degrade them in their lysosomes. For this form of intracellular digestion, enterocytes during the suckling period develop a prominent system of endosomes and lysosomes. We found that two endolysosomal ion channels, mucolipins 3 and 1 (also known as TRPML3 and 1), are highly co-expressed in neonatal enterocytes from birth to weaning. We also found that, in the absence of both mucolipins, neonatal enterocytes suffer pathological endolysosomal vacuolation together with reduced endocytosis, and that the mutant mice suffer diarrhea and reduced growth. All these symptoms disappear by weaning, when pathological enterocytes are replaced by normal-looking, adult-like enterocytes (which do not use endosomes and lysosomes for nutrient absorption). Hence, we have an animal model demonstrating the pathological effects of endolysosomal dysfunction to the neonatal intestine. We will use these and related mice to determine which type of nutrient uptake is compromised upon endolysosomal system failure in neonatal enterocytes. We will also determine with time-inducible and chimeric mutant generation, as well as with viral transfection of cultured enteroids, how many enterocytes, and at what postnatal stages, require endolysosomal functioning to sustain a healthy intestinal function. In order to translate these findings to humans, where the onset of weaning is not clearly defined as it is in rodents and even the existence of suckling-style enterocytes is largely ignored, we will also establish the postnatal period when human enterocytes display a specialized endolysosomal system. We will finally obtain, examine and culture human intestinal biopsies to test the novel hypothesis that endolysosomal abnormalities underlie neonatal intestinal pathologies such as pediatric malabsorption syndromes and necrotizing enterocolitis. These studies may lead to a fundamental change in the understanding of neonatal intestinal pathologies, leading causes of infant mortality worldwide.  "
"9277233","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The single most effective predictor of preterm birth is the state of cervix during pregnancy upon presentation with symptoms of preterm labor. The mechanisms underlying physiological cervical ripening at term are largely unknown, and the causes of preterm cervical dilation are even more elusive. It is well-established, however, that (i exogenous topically-applied prostaglandins induce cervical ripening at any stage of pregnancy, and (ii) inhibitors of PGH2S (cyclooxygenase 2, COX-2) are successful in blocking preterm cervical ripening. PGE2 is the major COX2-derived prostanoid in the cervix. It is surprising, therefore, that the downstream targets of PGE2 signaling in the cervix are not known. By way of preliminary studies, we found that PGE2 and prostaglandin analogs commonly used for cervical ripening in women (i.e., Dinoprostone (PGE2) and Misoprostol (PGE1)) suppress 15-PGDH gene expression through complex stromal cell-specific mechanisms. Importantly, PGE2-induced down regulation of 15- PGDH was mediated through EP2 receptors, highly expressed in human cervical stromal cells. These findings led us to propose the hypothesis that PGE2-EP2 interactions play important roles in regulating the transcriptional program of cervical stromal cells during cervical ripening. The aims of this proposal, therefore, are to (i) explore the global effects of PGE2-mediated gene expression in human cervical stromal cells, (ii) define the cellular signal transduction mechanisms by which activation of EP2 receptors leads to loss of MiTF-CX and 15-PGDH gene expression in cervical stromal cells, and (iv) determine if EP receptor antagonists regulate preterm cervical ripening in vivo."
"9323093","Project Summary The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine the relationship between remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) and a novel exercise modality called ?occlusive exercise?. Findings from this investigation will have direct relevance to the exercise component of stroke rehabilitation. Stroke is one of the leading causes of potentially preventable death and disability worldwide and extensive research has been focused on developing therapies for its treatment and prevention. One such therapy is a technique known as remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). This technique is characterized by restricting blood flow to an arm or leg for a short period of time (e.g., 5 min) then rapidly releasing the occlusive stimulus. RIPC has demonstrated its efficacy in numerous clinical settings, and the protection it confers is now known to be mediated by the release of various factors into the circulation. These factors include catecholamines, nitrate, cytokines, endogenous opioids, and others. Our central hypothesis is that a novel exercise modality called ?occlusive exercise? will elicit similar cerebro-protective effects as RIPC via the release of the same circulating mediators. This form of training, which is characterized by restricting blood flow to the active muscles, is already undergoing trials in some clinical populations. Specific aim 1 will compare the release of the protective factors known to be associated with RIPC between an acute bout of traditional exercise, occlusive exercise, and RIPC. We hypothesize that combining exercise with RIPC in the form of occlusive exercise will result in an even greater release of these factors than either exercise or RIPC alone. One concern that has been raised about the utilization of occlusive exercise in a rehabilitative setting is the potential for an augmentation of the exercise pressor reflex, which could cause an unsafe rise in arterial pressures. To address this concern, Specific aim 2 will comprehensively compare the hemodynamic and cerebrovascular responses between traditional exercise, occlusive exercise, and RIPC. We hypothesize that the exercise-induced elevation in arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and cerebral blood flow will be attenuated with occlusive exercise, due to the use of lower workloads. The rationale for the proposed research is to extend the application of RIPC beyond the pre-operative setting to which it is currently limited. While we cannot anticipate when a stroke will occur, we can target our therapies to high-risk populations. One such population is stroke survivors, as a significant portion of these individuals will suffer from a recurrent stroke. Many of these patients are already participating in exercise as part of their rehabilitation; thus, if the same factors known to be released with RIPC are also released with occlusive exercise, then this rehabilitation would be the ideal environment to incorporate this novel training modality. This project is innovative in that it expands the reach of RIPC beyond the operating room, into a population pool that could likely benefit from its application. This investigation will fill the gap in our knowledge regarding the possibility that the cerebro-protective effects of RIPC can be emulated by occlusive exercise."
"9449605","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drawing data from a variety of cell lines, the ENCODE project found that more than 60% of the human genome is transcribed, and that the majority of these messages are not translated into proteins and are likely to have regulatory functions. Over two thirds of protein non-coding RNAs are novel and specific to a particular cell type and developmental stage. In this project we will (1) provide a genome-wide catalogue of all known and novel transcripts and their regulatory elements in progenitors and early neurons from the embryonic human frontal cerebral cortex~ (2) understand whether their expression is recapitulated in vitro during neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)~ (3) establish the brain specificity of novel and known transcripts nd their regulatory elements by comparing our dataset with those of the ENCODE project, and (4) identify and catalogue those transcripts and their regulatory elements that are in loci previously  implicated in schizophrenia and autism. Gene expression of the embryonic brain is different from that of the postnatal brain. The systematic discovery and analysis of all active genomic elements that we propose here for the mid-gestational embryonic cerebral cortex has not yet been performed, neither is planned under the ENCODE tier 3 projects. The selected histone marks and transcription factors will identify a large fraction of enhancers/promoters active in any  specific cell type. Only some were previously ascertained in the developing brain. Abnormalities in very early aspects of brain development, and specifically the developing cortex, are likely to underlie the pathogenesis of common neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Human genomic variants that have been linked to these disorders often lay in poorly annotated regions of the genome. These variants could play a direct role in disease pathogenesis by modifying the coding regions of novel, non- annotated transcripts and/or modifying transcription factor binding to their promoters/enhancers. Hence, our first priority is to discover, as well as provide a catalogue of such elements. Their functinal role in development must then be established. The iPSC model system offers an opportunity to begin answering the question of whether these novel transcripts may have an important biological effect. However, the validity of iPSCs as a true representational model of neurodevelopment needs to be established by performing a direct comparison of their transcripts and epigenetic regulators with those that are active in neural cells in vio at comparable stages of neuronal development, ideally in the same genetic background. Hence, in this project we will provide the first rigorous validation of the iPSC model by comparing all transcripts and chromatin marks of progenitors and neurons that are derived from iPSC with those that are present in the brain at comparable stages of development. This will allow the future use of iPSCs to elucidate the function of non-coding elements of the genome and their potential relevance to psychiatric disorders."

"9260090","Project Summary Array- and sequencing-based association studies have identified many loci harboring genetic variants associated with complex traits and common diseases. Altogether, these associated variants only explain a small proportion of heritability, suggesting that most traits and diseases have a polygenic background and are influenced by many variants with small effects. Early attempts to model polygenic complex traits, notably via the linear mixed models (LMMs) and the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP), have shown promising outcomes for estimating chip heritability, identifying causal variants, and predicting disease risks. However, statistical methods for modeling polygenic architecture remain in their infancy. In particular, existing methods rely on simple effect size assumptions, are not flexible nor adaptive to the underlying genetic architecture of a given trait or disease, and hence cannot take full advantage of the polygenic natural of most traits and diseases.  To increase the power of association test and enable more precise phenotype and risk prediction, I propose to develop a suite of novel statistical methods to accurately and flexibly model the polygenic architecture. These new methods will facilitate evaluation and integration of variant functional annotations, multiple phenotype association mapping, and phenotype and risk prediction in association studies. In particular, we will (1) develop methods to evaluate and integrate variant genomic functional annotations to better understand the polygenic architecture of traits and diseases, and enable powerful association mapping; (2) develop strategies for association mapping with multiple correlated phenotypes to identify pleiotropic associations by taking advantage of the shared polygenic background among phenotypes; and (3) develop methods to flexibly model polygenic architecture and use all variants jointly to achieve accurate phenotype and risk prediction. We will develop efficient algorithms to accompany these methods and implement them in free open-source software. We will perform rigorous simulations and comparisons to evaluate our methods. Finally, we will perform in- depth analysis on several large-scale real data sets, including data from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, T2D-GENES and METSIM projects, to demonstrate the power of the proposed methods."
"9475379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Embolotherapy involves the occlusion of blood flow for therapy, such as treatment of tumors or fibroids, and has traditionally used solid emboli.1 In our novel approach, gas bubbles, rather than solid particles are used for occlusion. The bubbles originate as < 6 ?m-diameter albumin- or lipid- encapsulated liquid droplets of perfluorocarbon (PFC), mixed in saline,2, 3 and are injected into the vascular system. The droplets are small enough to pass through capillary beds, so they can circulate until the next stage of the therapy. By strategic placement of an ultrasound source, vaporization of the droplets, which we have termed Acoustic Droplet Vaporization (ADV), can be induced in or near the tumor. The resulting bubble volume is ~125-150 times the droplet volume, and the bubbles resulting from an approximately 5 ?m droplet are large enough to lodge in the microcirculation and occlude blood flow to the tumor. This gas embolotherapy approach is minimally invasive, would allow selective delivery of gas emboli to the tumor or fibroid, and is well suited to repeated doses and long-term use. The first funding period of this grant was focused on understanding the underlying biofluid mechanics involved in ADV, transport, and lodging of these novel emboli. Now that we understand the bubble and droplet dynamics well enough to allow us to effectively target regions of healthy tissue for occlusion, we are ready to apply this knowledge to study the potential for lodged microbubbles to induce bioeffects that may lead to localized hypoxia and tissue necrosis. Successful treatment of cancer by the proposed methodology is one of our long-term goals, and understanding how lodged microbubbles affect tumors is essential to reaching that goal. Therefore, the specific aims of this renewal application are: 1. Characterize ADV of adherent droplets, and transport and lodging of resulting bubbles, including ability of functionalized droplets to increase residence time of resulting bubbles. 2. Characterize the ability of lodged bubbles to induce hypoxia. 3. Characterize the ability of lodged bubbles to induce hypoxia related changes in tumors. 4. Assess the ability of lodged bubbles to induce tumor cell apoptosis and to slow tumor growth."

"9269208","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for The OSU College of Optometry Clinical Center to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter  randomized, placebo controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence insufficiency (Cl) on measures of reading performance and attention in children.  'In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-lll] reading comprehension subtest score) and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fissional vergence at near) will be other secondary outcome measures; also included will be assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading                                                                comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention will be assessed 1-year post treatment. This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them fo 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center. Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading 'slowly,-trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9029824","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the abuse of prescription opioid medications is a pervasive problem in the U.S. In addition, co-abuse of opioids and alcohol represents a significant problem from the perspective of increased toxicity and decreased success in treatment. Surprisingly few studies have examined the effects of combined administration of opioids and alcohol in humans, and no clinical studies have examined the reinforcing effects of this combination. The current proposal will systematically screen medications that show promise for treating both opioid and alcohol use disorders (OUD and AUD). The guiding principle is that a medication's effects on positive subjective responses and reinforcing effects are the best laboratory procedures to date in predicting its clinical efficacy.In separate studies, we will test suvorexant (Study 1), oxytocin (Study 2), varenicline (Study 3), and gabapentin (Study 4) for their ability to alter opioid-, alcohol-, and combined opioid/alcohol-mediated responses. Participants in all of the studies will meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate-severe OUD and be physically dependent on opioids. In addition, all participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate-severe AUD, but they will not be physically dependent on alcohol. All of the participants will be maintained on sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone throughout the studies and different doses of suvorexant, oxytocin, varenicline, and gabapentin will be evaluated. Overall, the proposed studies will provide a great deal of information about the safety and clinical utility of buprenorphine/naloxone in combination with each of the test medications for treating co-abuse of opioids and alcohol."
"9278189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growth-promoting signals and changes in metabolism are important mechanisms in the development and progression of cancer and other proliferative disorders, but the mechanisms that mediate interactions between these key regulatory events are poorly understood. Recently, we discovered a surprising and novel mechanism for control of nucleotide synthesis by Ack, a growth-factor regulated tyrosine kinase. Ack controls the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in CTP synthesis, CTP synthase (CTPS) by regulating the assembly and disassembly of an enzymatically active macromolecular structure composed of CTPS and the rate-limiting enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, IMPDH. We call these structures FINS for filaments involved in nucleotide synthesis. Based on this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that inadequate cellular nucleotide pools trigger Ack-dependent FINS assembly to stimulate balanced purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Here, we will test this hypothesis using mechanistic biochemical studies that will be subsequently validated in vivo in Drosophila, where we have shown a critical requirement for this pathway in oogenesis. The work will illuminate how two important fields, signaling and metabolism, intersect through the dynamic assembly of a macromolecular protein assembly. The current use of drugs that inhibit IMPDH and trigger FINS assembly in patients highlights the importance of this work and its potential for discovery of additional therapeutic avenues for immuosuppression as well as anti-neoplastic and anti-parasitic interventions."
"9492191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organophosphate (OP) anticholinesterases, e.g., nerve agents or insecticides, are potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. High dose poisoning causes excitotoxicity that leads to seizures and subsequently brain damage. The current therapy in the US includes an oxime reactivator, 2-PAM, which has little, if any, ability t cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and consequently cannot stop seizures and prevent brain damage. Our laboratories have developed a library of phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes designed to have greater lipophilicity than 2-PAM. Through a paradigm using high sub-lethal dosages of highly relevant surrogates for sarin or VX in rats and administering the novel oximes at 1 hr after OP compound treatment when seizure behavior was on- going, we have demonstrated the ability of a number of these oximes to penetrate the BBB, reactivate AChE, and to attenuate seizure behavior. The objective of this application is to further characterize a limited number of these novel oximes (initially 6, then down-selected to 3) to ultimately select a single lead oxime for an IND application. Additionally we will expand the OP chemistries tested to include an insecticidal chemistry, paraoxon (the active metabolite of parathion; tested first to avoid any confounders that could occur because of the need for bioactivation) and parathion. Endpoints of characterization include brain and peripheral AChE reactivation, seizure attenuation, neurodegeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein accumulation), oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes), neuropathology (apoptosis, neuron survival), and behavior. Concurrently molecular dynamics computations will determine if one or two additional oxime structures are predicted to have greater efficacy than our current selections; if so, it/they will be synthesized and substituted for our current selections. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1. In vivo efficacy characterization aim: To provide expanded measures of neuroprotection on our currently identified BBB-penetrating oximes using the sarin and VX surrogates and also a common insecticidal OP chemistry (i.e., diethyl phosphate) using parathion and its active metabolite paraoxon. Efficacy endpoints for the 4 OP's include: 1a, efficacy screening endpoints with 6 oximes: reactivating rat brain AChE, and the attenuation of seizure behavior and neurodegeneration; and 1b, detailed efficacy characterization endpoints with 3 down-selected oximes: oxidative stress in the brain, neuropathology and behavioral deficits. 2. Pharmacokinetic aim: To determine for the 3 down-selected oximes hepatic in vitro metabolism, plasma protein binding and levels of oxime in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (obtained through microdialysis). 3. Computational chemistry aim: To model the docking of oxime with AChE and BBB penetration to suggest improved oxime structures. 4. Chemical synthesis aim: To produce sufficient quantities of the test OP's and the test oximes for the experiments proposed, as well as the synthesis of a few new oximes if suggested by the computational chemistry aim. The ultimate outcome will be the identification of the most efficacious novel oxime for further development as a potential substitute for current therapy."
"9358669","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Identifying potential targets for interventions to reduce age-related cognitive morbidity in diverse elders is of critical importance to the rapidly expanding aging population in the U.S. Substantial evidence from observational studies suggest that modifiable positive psychosocial factors (i.e., well-being, self-efficacy, social support) are associated with better cognitive functioning among older adults. These effects are independent of negative affect (e.g., depression). However, little attention has been given to subgroups of older adults who are particularly vulnerable to age-related cognitive morbidity: African Americans, Hispanics, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition, it is unclear whether these positive psychosocial factors buffer against the negative cognitive effects of brain pathology, as measured with structural magnetic resonance imaging. This K99/R00 proposal lays the foundation for an independent research career focused on characterizing the mechanisms underlying psychosocial factors that protect against age-related cognitive morbidity among a diverse population. Together, the research and training plans will provide the applicant (1) supplementary training in modeling neuroimaging biomarker data in an aged population, (2) broader experience with psychosocial variables in aging, and (3) a strong foundation in cross-cultural neuropsychology. These experiences will supplement the applicant's strong existing background in geriatric neuropsychology and quantitative methods. The research plan expands an existing community-based longitudinal study of multi-ethnic older adults at Columbia University. This diverse population is followed every 18-24 months with cognitive testing, medical evaluation, health measures, and consensus diagnoses of MCI/dementia. A subset receives structural neuroimaging. This proposal adds well-validated, computer-based measures of psychosocial functioning and cognition from the NIH Toolbox. Cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models (SEM) will test relationships between positive psychosocial factors, cognition, and quantitated measures of hippocampal volume, regional cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity volume, and infarcts. The primary goal is to characterize the role of positive psychosocial factors in late-life cognitive decline and to determine whether they reduce the impact of structural MRI markers of brain pathology on cognitive functioning."
"9360788","Treatment of chronic pain continues to rely on old drugs such as gabapentinoids, reuptake blockers and opioids, all of which have severe side effects that diminish quality of life. Tolerance develops to opioids with chronic use, and an increase in opioid prescriptions has contributed to the growing opioid addiction epidemic. There is an urgent need for finding alternative treatments for treatment of both acute chronic pain. The goal of the COBRE Phase II is to continue the development of a Center for the Study of Pain and Sensory Function that will significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the neurobiology of acute and chronic pain, facilitating the discovery of novel therapies. Significant progress was made during Phase I: four project leaders were successful in receiving NIH support and three COBRE pilot project grants seeded studies that subsequently received extramural support. Targets for recruitment were exceeded with the addition of both senior and junior faculty members to our Center. Two research cores were established and new lab space was created through renovations. The Center will continue to build on these accomplishments, leveraging COBRE support to garner additional institutional investment in the program. Our research cores will continue to collaborate with those at other regional IDeA program funded institutions, efficiently utilizing our resources as we work towards increased sustainability. Specific Aim 1 will create a critical mass of pain researchers necessary to sustain a vibrant research center and enhance their ability to compete for extramural research support. This Aim will be accomplished by fostering the pain related research programs of four current UNE faculty members who have not received R01 or comparable Research Project Grant support. In addition, funds will be provided for pilot projects to support early stage yet innovative pain-related studies. Finally, we will recruit an additional three investigators whose research programs will complement those of the existing faculty. Specific Aim 2 will expand neuroscience research infrastructure at UNE, providing access to core facilities that allow investigators to carry out cutting edge research on the neurobiological processes involved in the development of chronic pain. This aim will be accomplished through funding key support personnel and the purchase of equipment for the two research cores established during Phase I (the Behavior Core and the Histology and Imaging Core). Expanded research core services will include mouse genotyping and expert consultations for breeding strategies required for maintaining transgenic mouse colonies (Behavior Core), and a service to validate antibodies used by COBRE center researchers (Histology and Imaging Core). With continued investment provided through Phase II funding and institutional support, we will build on our early success and clearly establish the Center as a leader in pain research."
"9353279","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the elderly population of the United States grows, identifying determinants of aging trajectories is of heightened importance. This project investigates the effect of immigration on the trajectories of health, disability, living arrangemens, and well-being of the native-born elderly age 75 and up. Fully 22 percent of health service workers are foreign born; in some states the fraction exceeds 50 percent. By expanding the pool of caretakers, inflows of foreign-born workers may affect the access to, cost, and quality of in-home or institutional care for the elderly. Immigration may also encourage substitution from informal family care to professional care for the elderly, and may allow the elderly to purchase support services such as house cleaning or gardening that allow them to age in place longer. The care-taking and living situations of the elderly, in turn, may have profound implications for their morbidity, mortality, and subjective well-being, especially among those who cannot manage the activities of daily living on their own.  The specific aims of the project are as follow: (1) To investigate the link between immigrant concentrations in local areas and living arrangements of the native born elderly. Are immigrant-exposed elderly individuals more likely to age-in-place, less likely to live with or near their own children, or less likely to live in an institutional setting? (2) To investigate the link between immigrant concentrations in local areas and care-taking arrangements of the native born elderly. Does immigrant labor substitute for informal family care-taking arrangements among those who need assistance? (3) To investigate the link between immigrant concentrations in local areas and the health trajectories, disability, and mortality of the elderly. Conditional on baseline health, does aging in an area with many immigrants affect limitations to activities of daily living, morbidity, the management of chronic disease, or the probability of death? If so, what are the mechanisms? (4) To investigate the link between the outcomes in Specific Aims 1 through 3 and the subjective well-being of the elderly.  The project incorporates secondary analysis of four large national datasets. It uses an innovative methodology to account for endogenous migration of both native born elderly and immigrants. This allows the causal impact of immigration on the health and caretaking arrangements of the elderly to be isolated.  High rates of immigration in recent decades may transform the aging experiences of the native born elderly, but the impacts of immigration on the native elderly have received little attention. As the nation debates admissions policies for immigrants and as baby boomers reach retirement age, the role of immigrants in the provision of health and other services to the elderly has direct and urgent policy relevance."
"9387634","In the United States, about 1 in 8 women in the Unites States will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~15-20% of all breast cancer incidences. They are highly aggressive, malignant, and with the worst prognosis among all types of breast cancers. Despite the fact that targeted therapies have become the first-line treatment for many different types of cancers, no targeted therapy is now available for TNBC. Chemotherapy is the current mainstay of treatment for TNBC. Besides severe side effects associated with chemotherapies, the selection pressure induced by nonspecific chemo drugs and development of drug resistance can promote metastasis. A targeted therapy will revolutionize treatment regimens for TNBC patient by replacing interventions that have life-threatening toxicities. Among all genetic alternations, the tumor suppressor TP53 gene (encoding p53) is inactivated by mutation or deletion in 60-88% of TNBCs. A tremendous effort has been made to restore p53 activity in cancer therapies. However, no effective p53-based therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment. In 67.2% of TNBCs containing partial TP53 deletion, we identified a drug target gene, POLR2A that is co-deleted with TP53. Inhibiting POLR2A with small compound drug ?-Amanitin selectively inhibits proliferation, survival and tumorigenic potential of TNBC cells with partial loss of the TP53 gene. Previous clinical applications of ?-Amanitin have been limited due to its liver toxicity. We found that ?-Amanitin-based antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly effective therapeutic agents with significantly reduced toxicity. In this proposal, we will use Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody specific for TNBCs, to develop ?-Amanitin-based ADCs. We propose that ?-Amanitin-conjugated Cetuximab is a specific and effective drug for TNBC treatment. Successful development of this project will revolutionize treatment regimens for TNBC patient by replacing interventions that have life-threatening toxicities with novel antibody- drug conjugates that are safe and effective."
"9271184","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is universally recognized as the number one barrier to the safe, effective management of blood glucose in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In previous experiments in the dog, we observed that an increase in liver glycogen content augments counterregulatory hormone secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, thereby increasing hepatic glucose production. The experiments in this proposal will determine to what extant an increase in liver glycogen content can improve hypoglycemic counterregulation in humans with and without T1D. The canine model will be used to improve our understanding of how this comes about.  Specific Aim #1 is to determine the effect of increasing liver glycogen deposition on insulin-induced hypoglycemic counterregulation in humans with and without T1D. This question will be addressed by studying two groups of people; one with T1D and one without. Both of these groups will undergo one experiment in which their liver glycogen content will be significantly increased using an infusion of fructose an another in which they receive a saline infusion so as to change liver glycogen only modestly. Then, all subjects will undergo a hypoglycemic/ hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine their counterregulatory responses in the presence and absence of increased liver glycogen content.  Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a temporary condition that affects people with T1D. Therefore, Specific Aim #2 is to determine the effect of increasing liver glycogen deposition on insulin- induced hypoglycemic counterregulation in T1D humans with HAAF. The design of Aim #2 will be similar to that of Aim #1. However, on the day prior to metabolic testing,  T1D subjects will undergo a hypoglycemic/ hyperinsulinemic clamp to solicit HAAF. Then, on day 2, the liver glycogen content of each individual will be either increased or remain unchanged, followed by a hypoglycemic/ hyperinsulinemic clamp identical to Aim #1.  The final aim will utilize the canine model to more closely examine the mechanisms by which increased liver glycogen content improves hypoglycemic counterregulation. Specific Aim #3 is to determine the importance of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the brain and in the liver to the improved counterregulatory responses that occur as a result of increased liver glycogen content in the dog. To answer this question we will increase the liver glycogen content of animals and then, during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, selectively make either the head, or the liver euglycemic via glucose infusion, while the rest of the animal's body remains hypoglycemic."
"9263968","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroendocrine factors have been convincingly implicated in the etiology of obesity. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified scores of genes and loci associated with obesity, insight into the functional roles for these genes, particularly within the human brain, is lacking. Many brain banks do not have a single body mass index (BMI) measure. However, brain donation programs within longitudinal, cohort studies represent a unique resource of brain samples with up to six decades of ante-mortem data including BMI. This proposal is a collaboration among three such longitudinal cohort studies: 1) The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) 2) The Religious Order Study (ROS) and 3) the Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Selection from over 1,300 post mortem brain samples already donated via these studies enabled identification of 75 samples from consistently obese individuals and 75 samples from individuals with consistently normal BMI (18.5<BMI<25). These carefully selected samples provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship of gene expression in specific brain regions to BMI providing key insight into the neuroendocrine control of BMI. This application proposes to apply next generation RNA sequencing and microRNA sequencing technology and state of the art statistical approaches in highly characterized, selected samples from the FHS, ROS and MAP brain banks to further the understanding of the genetic basis of obesity. The return on investment in generating these data will be maximized by creating a publicly available resource of extensive brain derived genomic data of value for studying a wide range of diseases and clinical measures. In Aim 1 we propose RNA and microRNA sequencing in 2 brain regions: lateral hypothalamus and striatum to determine region specific gene expression patterns in 75 samples from consistently obese individuals and 75 controls (consistently normal BMI). RNA-sequencing will identify coding sequence variants, novel gene transcripts, & splice junctions and estimate brain region specific RNA expression levels for individual exons of genes. MicroRNA sequencing will identify short RNA sequences implicated in regulation of gene expression. We will use these data to characterize genes previously identified in genomewide association studies and to identify novel genes differentially expressed between brain tissue from obese and non-obese individuals. In Aim 2 we will integrate the genome-wide SNP and transcriptome data to perform eSNP, eQTL, and pathway analyses to identify underlying biological mechanisms. These studies will provide insight into the role of genes in the initiation and pathophysiology of obesity and create a valuable public database containing comprehensively characterized regional gene expression in brain in a cohort of comprehensively phenotypically characterized participants."
"9367941","PROJECT SUMMARY Tissue acidosis is a major contributing factor to neuronal cell death associated with neurological diseases, such as stroke, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as Alzheimer's, Huntington, and Parkinson?s diseases. It has been well established that acid-sensing ion channels subtype 1a (ASIC1a) is critically involved in acidosis-induced neuronal cell death in both in vitro and in vivo models. The protective effects of ASIC1a knockout and pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a function shown in the mouse models of ischemic stroke, MS, HD, and ALS testify the potential of targeting ASIC1a to mitigate neuronal damages in multiple types of neurological disorders. However, the mechanism(s) by which ASIC1a activation causes neuronal death remains mysterious despite extensive investigations. Conventionally, ASIC1a is believed to form cell surface cation channels activated by extracellular protons to mediate Na+ and Ca2+ entry into the cell. The ion conducting function, especially Ca2+ influx, is thought to cause Ca2+ overload that eventually leads to acid-induced cytotoxicity. However, our recent results suggest that the cell killing effect of ASIC1a is dependent not on its channel conductance, but on the recruitment and phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1) to the C-terminus of ASIC1a protein. RIP1 is a key mediator of death receptor-induced necroptotic pathway. In rodent model of ischemic stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), inhibiting RIP1, just like inhibiting ASIC1a, was shown to be neuroprotective even when the drug was administered several hours after the onset of brain ischemia. Therefore, acidosis neuronal death most likely occurs through ASIC1a-RIP1 physical coupling and the consequent activation of RIP1-dependent necroptosis. The goal of the proposed project is to elucidate this novel mechanism of acid-induced, ASIC1a/RIP1-mediated necroptotic cell demise in neurons. Aim I will define the death pathway mediated by ASIC1a-RIP1 interaction in response to acidosis through systematic evaluation of key factors involved in ASIC1a-mediated cell demise in cultured neurons and in the mouse MCAO model. Aim II will examine a novel mechanism by which a chaperone protein facilitates RIP1 activation through disruption of an intramolecular interaction between the cytoplasmic N- and C-termini of ASIC1a. Aim III will elucidate how the C-terminal RIP1 interaction domain of ASIC1a triggers and mediates acidosis-induced necroptosis and test whether disrupting such interaction can mitigate neuronal damage caused by acidosis and brain ischemia. Successful completion of this project will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of neuronal acidotoxicity, which will shed lights on new treatment strategies for several major types of neurological disorders."
"9402787","ABSTRACT  Ras proteins are GTPases that activate multiple signaling cascades, which modulate cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Ras proteins are regulated by almost all known post-translational modifications, including farnesylation, palmitoylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. However, it remains unknown whether Ras proteins are modified by sumoylation. We recently discovered that all three forms of Ras protein are SUMO3-modified. Our further studies reveal that lysine 42 (K42) is the primary residue for sumoylation, whereas PIAS? and MEKK1 are candidate E3 ligases that sumoylate Ras. Sumoylation is essential for activating K-Ras and its downstream signaling. Furthermore, we have discovered a series of SUMO E1 inhibitors that target SUMO conjugation both in vitro and in vivo. The lead compounds 27A and SB-264 potently inhibit sumoylation, but not ubiquitination or neddylation. Significantly, these compounds display excellent bioactivities toward killing transformed pancreatic cells with K-Ras mutations at glycine 12 or glycine 13 and suppress their migration. Given the role of sumoylation in controlling functions of key cellular regulators and the paramount importance of K- Ras in cell proliferation and transformation, we hypothesize that sumoylation promotes K-Ras activity and that the SUMO regulatory pathway is an excellent target for development of anti- cancer drugs. Three Specific Aims are proposed to test the validity of the hypothesis. We will determine the mechanism by which sumoylation regulates K-Ras activation, elucidate the regulatory network that controls K-Ras sumoylation, and investigate the efficacy of SUMO E1 inhibitors in suppressing proliferation of pancreatic cancer growth in preclinical mouse models. Further characterization of K-Ras sumoylation promises to have a profound impact on our understanding of the fundamental cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate cell growth. Given the discovery of novel SUMO E1 inhibitors, our proposed studies will help to accelerate the development of therapeutic applications that target ubiquitin-like modifications. !"
"9353220","Background: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at exceptionally high risk for HIV infection in the United States, accounting for 72% of new HIV infections among all persons aged 13 to 24, and 30% of new infections among all MSM. Increasing awareness of HIV status and expanding access to PrEP for high risk HIV-uninfected YMSM is essential for reducing the population burden of disease; however, overall rates of testing and PrEP uptake among young adults are suboptimal. Mobile app use is common among YMSM in the U.S., and thus they offer unique opportunities for HIV prevention interventions to be provided to YMSM via a modality that is familiar and discrete. Overview: Informed by our formative research with YMSM in the US and guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), our team developed ?MyChoices?, a mobile app aimed to increase HIV testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM in the U.S. MyChoices? uses interactive capabilities and reminder systems to support self-regulation and self-efficacy around HIV testing and PrEP uptake?core factors that influence behavior change in the SCT model. We propose to refine and pilot test the ?MyChoices? app, laying the groundwork for an R01 efficacy trial as part of this same iTech U19 application. We propose to: (Aim 1) conduct theater testing with YMSM to refine ?MyChoices? for HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake promotion. ?MyChoices? will be demonstrated in up to 4 groups with up to 20 YMSM at two iTech clinical research sites to obtain detailed feedback on displays, features and functions of the ?MyChoices? app. Data will be used to make final app refinements; (Aim 2) conduct a technical pilot to optimize MyChoices app functionality, technical performance, and user satisfaction. The app will be piloted with a group of up to 15 YMSM at two iTech clinical research sites for a 2-month period. Participant exit interviews will be used to finalize all study procedures, questionnaire and intervention manual for use in the next phase (RCT; Aim 3); (Aim 3) conduct a pilot RCT to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of MyChoices to increase HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM. 60 YMSM at two iTech sites (30 at each site) will be enrolled and randomized (2:1) to one of two conditions: a) MyChoices app; or b) control condition which consists of links to local HIV/STI testing resources. The primary outcomes will be feasibility and acceptability of the app over 6 months. We will also assess preliminary efficacy of the app to increase HIV testing (via self-report) and PrEP uptake (via self-report). Innovation: If the app proves to be efficacious in a future efficacy trial (proposed as part of this iTech U19), this innovative technology has the potential to reach a large population of at-risk YMSM across the United States, increase HIV testing and PrEP uptake among those at highest risk and reduce the burden of HIV in this population."
"9313947","SUMMARY: Multiphoton Imaging Core The goal of the Multiphoton Imaging Core (MPI Core) is to provide NINDS-supported Primary Center Investigators, and other neuroscientists at JHU who perform research consistent with the mission of NINDS, access to advanced imaging technology and training to further their ongoing research programs. In particular, the MPI Core will help investigators analyze protein localization, protein dynamics, and protein-protein interactions with high temporal and spatial resolution in situ and in vivo; perform in vivo time-lapse imaging of multiple fluorophores to monitor cell dynamics; combine imaging of ion indicator dyes/proteins with physiological monitoring of electrical activity to assess cellular communication; obtain quantitative information about neuronal morphologies in situ in health and disease to define cell identity and cellular networks; and enable neuronal and glial activity to be monitored in freely moving rodents. This Center grant will provide funds necessary to support two full-time technicians who will manage day-to-day Core activities, provide training and assist in data collection and analysis. It will also support service contracts to maintain Core equipment, and funds to purchase supplies and additional microscope components (e.g. objectives, stages) to adapt existing instrumentation to the needs of its users. In the next funding period, we will substantially expand the capabilities of the MPI Core, by providing access to fiber optic imaging platforms that enable fluorescence imaging in awake, freely moving rodents, by adapting the custom two photon microscope for resonant scanning to enable rapid collection of 3D datasets and reduce motion artifacts, and by establishing a brain clearing and light sheet imaging service to define cell distribution and morphology in the intact CNS. These additional capabilities will allow Core users access to the most recent technology for observing cell structure and cellular activity to determine how these features influence normal behavior and neurological disease. The unique capabilities of the MPI Core will continue to serve as a crucial resource for NINDS-funded investigators at JHU by extending the research capabilities of individual investigators and by serving as a focal point for dissemination and practical training in advanced microscopic methods. Through these efforts, the MPI Core will help establish new strategies for studying brain function in health and disease that will benefit the broader neuroscience community."
"9505455","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are neuropsychiatric brain disorders that affect more than 2% of the population worldwide and cause enormous human suffering. Both disorders are highly heritable (>60-80%), but the 100+ loci that have been identified to date collectively do not account for a significant percentage of overall disease causation. A better understanding of gene expression patterns and the role of environmental factors in forming these patterns is crucial. Using cultured neuronal cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium (CNON) from 50 patients with schizophrenia and 50 healthy controls, we will determine epigenetic chromatin marks in a sample with sufficient statistical power to discover mQTL and ChIP-QTL in developing neurons. Available long RNA-seq (strand-specific ncRNA and mRNA >100bp), small RNA-seq (piRNA and miRNA), and >30x whole genome sequence will be combined with data from NOMe-seq at >18X and ChIP-seq of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27Ac. The in- vitro data will be complemented by data from analyses of high-quality, post-mortem adult brains derived from Caucasian males with schizophrenia (SCZ; n=8) or bipolar disorder (BPD; n=8) and normal controls (CTL; n=8). Analyses will include long RNA-seq (strand-specific ncRNA and mRNA >100bp), small RNA-seq (piRNA and miRNA), NOMe-seq at >18X and ChIP-seq of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27Ac in dissected sections from the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), dorsal caudate (DC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We will map genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic changes specific to either brain region or disease and develop an easy-to-use, web-based informatics framework for communication of the raw and computed data of this PsychENCODE project to other neuroscientists."
"9327474","Project Summary Homeostatic plasticity bidirectionally constrains neuronal activity to a target firing range, allowing stable neuronal and network function throughout development. In rodent visual cortex, monocular deprivation causes the firing rate of neurons responding to the deprived eye to initially decrease before gradually rebounding to within 15% of the baseline firing rate, even in the face of continued deprivation. This homeostatic activity rebound occurs in neurons with baseline firing rates spanning three orders of magnitude, demonstrating that each neuron has a firing rate set point maintained by cell-autonomous homeostatic mechanisms. However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that control this firing rate set point in vivo. CaMKIV, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, plays a critical role in Ca2+-dependent gene transcription and has been implicated in multiple forms of homeostatic plasticity. I have designed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that CaMKIV signaling coordinates different forms of homeostatic plasticity in vivo in response to changes in activity, shifting firing rate towards a target rate influenced by CaMKIV protein levels. First, I will measure the relationship between neuronal activity and CaMKIV protein levels in cortical slices and test the effect of prolonged activity deprivation in vivo on CaMKIV protein levels. Then, by manipulating CaMKIV protein levels in vivo, I will test the role of CaMKIV signaling in coordinating different types of homeostatic plasticity ex vivo and establishing the firing rate set point in vivo. These experiments will provide fundamental mechanistic insight into how neurons and networks maintain stable function despite varying inputs. The ability to adjust firing rate set points in vivo could lead to conceptually novel treatment approaches for neurological disorders characterized by dysregulated neuronal activity, such as autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy."
"9306096","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of primary visual cortex is its organization into maps of visual space, orientation and ocular dominance. Despite remarkable advances in our ability to measure the structure of cortical maps and their mutual relationships, many important questions remain unanswered. How do these maps develop? Why are maps missing in some species? What role do maps play, if any, in cortical computation? The central goal of our research is to seek answers to these fundamental questions of cortical development, organization and function that have eluded us for decades.  Our working hypothesis is that the blueprint for the formation of simple-cell receptive fields and orientation maps in primary visual cortex is encoded in the spatial layout of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics. To test the idea we will analyze the spatial statistics of RGC mosaics, reconstruct the retinal input to given orientation domains, and test the micro-organization of cortical maps. If the these ideas are confirmed, they can offer a  definitive account for the origin of orientation maps in primary visua cortex and, more broadly, profoundly influence the way we conceive of cortical maps, their development and function."
"9273507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metformin is the first-line agent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms of metformin action. The genetic parsing of metformin responders versus non-responders remains similarly underexplored. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) includes 988 participants randomized to metformin. We propose to complete a genome-wide association study (including exome content) for metformin response in the DPP. In parallel, we will explore genetic determinants of metformin response for diabetes prevention and for lowering glycated hemoglobin: the latter will be meta-analyzed with data from 3,500 participants in the GoDARTS cohort. To prioritize human findings we will leverage information from an siRNA genomic screen for metformin response in the roundworm nematode C. elegans, integrating genes and pathways identified in the course of this screen with the human findings. Results that emerge from this integration will undergo further replication in three independent human cohorts. Top signals will be carried forward for functional validation in an established human hepatocyte model, where knockout and point mutation approaches using CRISPR technology will be used to confirm the causal gene and variant. If successful, this project will accomplish the twin goals of elucidating the mechanism of action of metformin and identifying genetic predictors of clinical response, while illustrating the arc of progress from genetic association to identifying the causal gene/variant in order to illuminate function."
"9402972","Abstract In response to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), -Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), -Request for Application (RFA), -Targeted Research (TR), -16-019 we propose to apply the Organ- Chip technology of Emulate Inc., to assess the effects of space flight in human organs in vitro. Emulate is a newly founded start-up based on technology developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The proposed work focuses on the development of automated hardware for space to enable experiments in human, in vivo relevant microphysiological systems for understanding of the impact of microgravity and other space flight-imposed stressors on human physiology, disease development and response to drugs. The organ we will apply to all proposed studies is the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-Chip, both in normal and inflamed states, which causes a major compromise in the BBB and allows for evaluation of clinically relevant endpoints. In this proposal, we will first validate Emulate?s Organ-Chip technology, and the automated instrumentation to be developed together with implementation partners SpaceTango, in terrestrial experiments simulating the space flight protocols. Next, we will use the platform to conduct two separate organ-chip experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) to understand the effects of this unique environment on BBB physiology. Further, terrestrial experiments will assess the specific contribution of each of the individual, primary cell stressors in space that can be simulated on Earth. Imaging, biochemical, and transcriptomic data from all studies over different time points will be analyzed, compared and provide the inputs for building a model of the system. We believe that our integrative approach will reveal new aspects of the effects of microgravity on the BBB in normal and disease states, and provide insights into drug discovery for this critical organ that maintains homeostasis or propagates a number of serious diseases. Successful implementation of our space compatible hardware and our BBB-Chip findings will provide an in vivo relevant, in vitro platform available to the scientific community for the evaluation of the impact of microgravity in physiology and disease of a number of human organs, and support drug development in novel, clinically relevant ways."

The fellows will pursue programs of advanced research training in the field of aging for up to two years.  The postdoctoral program in aging at RAND offers highly individualized training to the fellows, including on-the-job training in the study of aging issues and other training designed to enhance the fellows' analytical and communication skills, and understanding of the responsible conduct of research. Specifically, fellows can enroll in seminars in the Pardee RAND Graduate School (PRGS); participate in courses offered by RAND's statistical, computing, survey, and communications experts; and attend numerous seminars offered at RAND and neighboring universities. The Training Director, mentor, and other training faculty and research support staff will help the fellows prepare research presentations for professional meetings and papers for submission to journals. Fellows will also be encouraged to develop an application for a research project (to be executed after completing their postdoctoral tenure) for submission to a federal agency."
"9315186","Project Summary The long range goals of the proposed research are to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which metabolic states and 17?-estradiol (E2) regulate arcuate nucleus (ARC) kisspeptin (Kiss1) neuronal circuits that are critical for coordinating energy homeostasis and reproduction in females. It is well known that E2 is anorexigenic, and that Kiss1 neurons which are directly regulated by E2, are essential for pubertal development and adult reproductive success. However, their role in the control of energy homeostasis is less understood. We have shown that the ARC Kiss1 neurons are directly excited by leptin and insulin indicating that they may serve an important role in the control of energy homeostasis. Also, we have evidence that glutamate is released from ARC Kiss1 neurons and targets anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons. In addition, we have found that glutamate can differentially regulate POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons by acting on separate groups of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Moreover, we have discovered that E2 increases vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) mRNA in female ARC Kiss1 neurons, an indication of heightened vesicular glutamate packaging and release. We also have evidence that ARC Kiss1 neurons project to and excite AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons, which are important for the induction of the GnRH/LH surge. Thus, we believe that ARC Kiss1 neurons integrate metabolic hormone and steroid cues to regulate both energy homeostasis and reproduction. Therefore, we propose the novel hypothesis that the excitability of ARC Kiss1 neurons is increased in high estrogenic states thereby releasing glutamate to excite POMC neurons and inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons via group I and group II/III mGluRs, respectively, which decreases food intake. In addition, excitatory glutamatergic input to AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons from ARC Kiss1 neurons constitutes a critical stimulatory drive to GnRH neurons at the time of GnRH/LH surge. Our multidisciplinary approach incorporates a powerful set of cellular, molecular and optogenetic tools to address the following aims: 1) To elucidate in ARC Kiss1 neurons the effects of E2 on the mRNA expression and function of Cav3 and HCN ion channels and the expression of vGluT2 mRNA; 2) to elucidate the direct synaptic input to ARC POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons from ARC Kiss1 neurons using optogenetic stimulation in combination with whole-cell recording in E2-treated females; 3) to elucidate the direct synaptic input to AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons from ARC Kiss1 neurons using optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell recording in E2-treated females; 4) to elucidate the effects of high frequency optogenetic stimulation of ARC Kiss1 neurons on GnRH release and on food intake in E2-treated females. Therefore, elucidating the circuits and signaling cascades underlying the actions of E2 in the hypothalamus will provide a neurophysiological framework whereby Kiss1 neurons could coordinate reproduction with changes in energy status."

These data will enable us to break through to the next level of biomedical understanding of causation in complex disorders. While ongoing efforts have made significant strides in the analysis of big data in the areas of genomics, imaging, and EHR, significant new investment is needed to develop and disseminate data analytics tools specific to the unique features of mobile sensor data (e.g., high volume, velocity, variety, variability, and versatility) to convert this wealth of data into information, knowledge, and action. Investment in  strong, open, scientific, and computational infrastructure for mobile big data at this early stag promises outsize returns to advance science and improve health.  The Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (MD2K) will generate generalizable theory, methods, tools, and software, to address major barriers to processing complex mobile sensor data and its use in biomedical knowledge discovery and just-in-time care delivery, laying the foundation for P5 Medicine. It will develop and implement a standards-based, interoperable, extensible and open-source big data software platform for efficient implementation of MD2K data analytics. The MD2K Center will  demonstrate the feasibility, utility, and generalizability of the MD2K approach by implementing the entire  MD2K data analytics system in the context of two biomedical applications - reducing relapse among  abstinent daily smokers and reducing readmission among congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. All the tools and software developed by the Center will be freely available as standards-compliant and open-source with documentation to engage data science researchers in advancing the science of MD2K and its integration with other biomedical big data such as EHRs, genomics, and imaging. The Center will provide training materials to help biomedical researchers install the MD2K software on their mobile devices and servers to collect mobile sensor data and analyze these data for biomedical discovery."
"9377981","PROJECT SUMMARY Mu-opioid receptors are widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system and upon activation have manifold actions including; depression of respiration, activation of the reward pathway, disruption of normal gastrointestinal motility and analgesia. Chronic administration of opioids results in a decline in the response (tolerance) the degree of which differs depending on the agonist and the measure under study. Analgesic tolerance to opioids limits the therapeutic efficacy. The link between the initial activation of receptors and the development of long-term tolerance is the subject of intense study and is dependent on multiple mechanisms. One repeatable and robust measure of opioid action measured on single cells is acute desensitization. This is thought to be an initial adaptive step in the pathway to cellular tolerance. Studies of desensitization have centered on (1) agonist occupancy (2) receptor phosphorylation (3) arrestin binding and (4) receptor internalization. By examining receptors where phosphorylation is blocked this proposal will determine the link between desensitization and the development of long-term tolerance. There are two possible outcomes. One is that the block of desensitization disrupts the development of long-term tolerance measured at the cellular level. The second is that the block of desensitization results in continued signaling that augments homeostatic mechanisms at the cellular and synaptic level that counter the continued activation of receptors. The results from this study will address a long-standing question surrounding the mechanisms that underlie a significant therapeutic problem with the use of opioids as analgesics."
"9251214","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spatial memory impairment and disorientation are a common problem associated with aging and they are often one of the first symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the properties of cells involved in the formation of spatial memory in a mouse model with early AD pathology will enhance our understanding of the earliest forms of cognitive decline in AD. The cells known to be important in spatial memory are place cells of the hippocampus (HPC) and grid and head direction cells of the entorhinal cortex (EC). We will use a novel approach to simultaneously record the electrophysiological properties of grid and place cells using 128-channel electrode recordings from 3 regions of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal (EC-HPC) circuit in AD mice. We will then analyze the large-scale electrophysiological data and measure synaptic plasticity using a spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) model. Predictions from this model will be used as a guide to adjust spike timing in neurons, either enhancing or suppressing the synaptic strength of cell populations in affected regions of the EC-HPC, using optogenetic modulation. We anticipate that this will allow us to correct the spatial impairment deficits. To recapitulate te spatial orientation impairments seen in early-stage AD patients, behaviorally equivalent tasks in mice such as morphing open fields, spatial novel object recognition task and T-maze alternation tasks will be applied. These tasks have been chosen specifically to study the functioning of EC-HPC circuit neurons (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus, lateral and medial entorhinal cortex) that get activated in relevant behavioral modes.  The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, molecular neuroscience and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate and restore function in an important circuit that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease."
"9298678","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions);    Female sex is the best established risk factor for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), yet women have preserved right ventricular (RV) function and survival compared to men with PAH. This so-called estrogen paradox is as yet unexplained. RV function determines outcome in disease, but the mechanisms and determinants of RV failure are unknown. We hypothesize that high estrogen states promote pulmonary vascular angiogenesis and RV myocardial collateral flow, resulting in pleiotropic effects on the pulmonary vasculature and the RV. In postmenopausal women, the hormonal mileu (e.g., sex hormone and estradiol [E2] metabolite levels) can be characterized; in premenopausal women the normal menstrual cycle (marked by a predictable spike in E2) provides a physiologic model to characterize these relationships. We propose: 1) a prospective cohort study (N=75) to determine whether the sex hormone milieu is associated with markers of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], angiopoietins [Ang], endothelial progenitor cells [EPCs]) and RV function assessed by hemodynamics in postmenopausal women wdth PAH and 2) a prospective case-control study (N = 40) to determine whether the menstrual cycle is associated with markers of angiogenesis (VEGF, Ang, EPCs) and RV function assessed by echocardiography in premenopausal women with PAH as compared to controls. We anticipate that in both pre and postmenopausal women, high E2 states will be associated with higher levels of angiogenesis markers but improved surrogates of RV function.

DESCRIPTION: Our laboratory recently published a report demonstrating the ability of integration defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV's) to cure hemophilia B in preclinical settings, providing additional proof of their therapeutic potential. However, further improvements of the IDLV gene delivery system are required in order to establish IDLV's as a therapeutic modality for nonfatal human diseases such as hemophilia B. Thus, we propose: a) to employ a novel PPT-deleted vector to further reduce the low risk of insertional mutagenesis associated with systemic administration of IDLV's, b) to develop and test a novel IDLV-based human factor IX (hFIX) expression cassette as a means to minimize IDLV vector load required to fully correct FIX deficiency in hemophilia B mice, and c) to establish a novel packaging cell line to facilitate production of mobilization resistant IDLV's carrying expression cassettes in opposite orientation to the vector's LTR's. The proposal comprises three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will focus on characterizing the ability of novel PPT-deleted IDLV's with reduced illegitimate integration to mediate efficient hepatic gene delivery, in vivo. Aim 2 will focus on the development and testing of a novel hFIX cDNA with prolonged in vivo half-life (t1/2) and enhanced specific activity using IDLV's for hepatic gene delivery. The efficacy of the new IDLV's to correct FIX deficiency will be tested in hemophilia B mice. The focus of Aim 3 will be establishing of a novel RNA-regulated protein kinase (PKR) resistant packaging cell line generating high titers of gp64- pseudotyped vectors. A PPT-deletion will render the cell line-generated IDLV's less likely to illegitimately integrate, and internal expression cassettes incorporated in opposite orientation to the LTR's will render them less likely to be mobilized. Overall the proposed studies will yield a highly efficient and significantly safer gene delivery system most suitable for gene replacement therapy of nonfatal human diseases."
"9355564","Mineralization is a process through which an organic substance becomes impregnated by inorganic substances. It is critically important to biology and when disrupted or hyperactivated contributes to wide-ranging effects on human health particularly in aging populations. For example, deficiencies in mineralization contribute to osteoporosis and cancer progression in bone, whereas elevated mineralization contributes to vascular disease such as atherosclerosis and kidney disease. The mechanism of action of the most commonly used drug class for treating several of these conditions, Nitrogenous Bisphosphonates (NBPs), is poorly understood. Through genetic screening in human cells we identified several genes whose loss of function led to resistance to the cytotoxic effects of the NBP, Alendronate (Fosamax®). We named these genes, Targets of BisphOsphonate NitrogEnous (heretofore TBONE1, TBONE2?). We show that TBONE1 is required both for biochemical responses triggered by NBPs as well as for bone function. Endogenous nitrogenous phosphonates (NPs), which are chemically related to NBPs and come from our diet and microbiome, potently regulate mineralization in bone-synthesizing osteoblasts in a TBONE1-dependent manner. Lastly, TBONE1 deficient mice have low body mass, deregulated markers of bone remodeling and reduced lifespan. These findings suggest that phosphonates acting through TBONE1 are critical for tissue mineralization. In this proposal, we will test TBONE genes with the following aims: 1) Dissection of the mechanisms of TBONE molecular interactions; 2) Elucidation of the TBONE1-phosphonate pathway in the bones and vasculature of mice. The identification of novel TBONE genes suggests an unexpected new understanding of and path of investigation for some of the most widely used medications, bisphosphonates. Additionally, that naturally occurring phosphonates stimulate mineralization suggests an important new determinant and safer therapeutic approach for numerous aging-associated conditions."
"9275487","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation of elaborate molecular structures is a hallmark of biological systems, resulting in enzyme networks, regulatory complexes, membrane signaling and packaging systems, scaffolding networks, and . The instructions for assembly are encoded within the molecules themselves. Understanding how to read these instructions is a major goal in modern biology and in modern medicine, where understanding may lead to rational manipulation of disease mechanisms. One relatively simple yet no less spectacular self-assembly process is the protein folding problem. Understanding the rules, rates, and mechanisms of protein folding would help interpret all aspects of biology, including disease states relating to protein misfolding and aggregation. One of the central features of protein folding is cooperativity. Single-domain proteins fold in all-or-none reactions. This remarkable coupling phenomenon is likely to be important for avoiding misfolded/partly folded states in biology, but it complicates experimental studies of the folding process, masking intermediates, processes, and routes along the way to the native state. The proposed research uses a series of linear symmetric repeat proteins that display all the features of globular proteins, but greatly reduce the complexity of the problem, and allow nearest-neighbor models to be applied to quantify the energetic coupling that underlies cooperativity. This internal symmetry also permits detailed kinetic mechanisms to be tested and parameterized, including parallel pathway nucleation and propagation steps. These modes of analysis will be applied alpha helix and beta sheet containing repeats to measure cooperativity and nucleation kinetic processes and determine their structural origins. Using a recently identified length-variable set of repeats, the size of the repeats and their interfaces with their neighbors will be correlated to cooperativity terms. Further, we will delineate the sequence features that modulate length in this group of proteins, and explore the structural and energetic features of high-ID repeat protein sequences and their relation to consensus sequences."
"9346669","Abstract  Vascular complications in elderly people with diabetes continue to be major health problems throughout the world, yet lipid-associated mechanism for disrupting vascular integrity is unclear. As a major type of covalent lipid modifications, reversible protein S-palmitoylation has emerged as a potentially critical post-translational process in signaling pathway. Our studies suggest that the protein depalmitoylation enzyme APT1 is critical for ischemic vascular remodeling that is relevant to peripheral artery disease. By integrating in vitro studies, mouse models and patient specimen analysis, the research plan will lead to the identification and characterization of APT1-dependent R-Ras palmitoylation dynamics in vascular complications of diabetic patients. The result of the study will warrant the future focus on the role of lipid modification in pathophysiology and offer the promise of discovering novel targets for peripheral artery disease in elderly patient with diabetes."

My lab aims to transform our ability to engineer biology by developing broadly applicable tools that dramatically accelerate the study of uncharacterized genes. In this New Innovator project, we will use chemical genetics to assign functions to thousands of uncharacterized genes in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a powerful model system central to studies of ciliary biogenesis and motility, centrosomes, photosynthesis, electron transport, inter-organelle communication and optogenetics. We will leverage game-changing tools developed by my lab, including the first genome-wide collection of indexed mutants in this organism and methods for tracking mutant abundances in pools of 100,000 mutants. We will quantify the growth defects and enhancements of mutants representing nearly all genes in the genome across 200 growth conditions. Additionally, in a thrust focusing on ciliary function, we will quantify ciliary phenotypes for all mutants in the presence of 50 recently discovered small molecule modulators of cilia function. We will use these data to accurately predict functions for thousands of uncharacterized genes based on the principle that mutants in genes that function in the same pathway usually show similar phenotypes. Furthermore, we will identify the genetic targets of the small molecule modulators of cilia function using chemical-genetic interactions. We will dissect gene functions in collaboration with the scientific community, with a focus on novel genes essential for cilia biogenesis. More broadly, the project will serve as a platform for advancing the development of cutting-edge tools to systematically and quantitatively probe gene functions throughout the tree of life."
"9476676","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this application is to understand how autophagy supports the maintenance and function of blood-forming hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and how corruption of this stress-response mechanism in transformed HSCs contributes to the development of myeloid malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We recently demonstrated that HSCs survive metabolic stress by inducing a robust protective autophagy response (Warr et al., 2013). In particular, we showed that the transcription factor FoxO3A is essential to maintain a pro-autophagy gene program that poises HSCs for rapid autophagy induction. However, how HSCs sense metabolic stress and activate autophagy is still unknown, and much remains to be understood about the role of autophagy in normal and transformed HSCs. We will use both pharmacological and genetic approaches to dissect the contribution of autophagy to HSC biology, and our established Scl- tTA:TRE-BCR/ABL (tTA-BA) mouse model of human chronic phase CML (Reynaud et al., 2011) to probe the function of autophagy in leukemia-initiating stem cell (LSC) activity and CML development. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which HSCs activate autophagy. We will use our established protocols to induce metabolic stress in HSCs ex vivo upon cytokine withdrawal and in vivo upon food deprivation, and will take advantage of existing genetic mouse models and chemical inhibitors to identify how HSCs sense metabolic stress and trigger autophagy induction. These approaches will establish how HSCs elicit a protective autophagy response upon metabolic challenges. In Specific Aim 2, we will address how loss of autophagy affects HSC function and genomic stability in vivo, and investigate whether alternative forms of protein and organelle turnover can support the long-term maintenance of autophagy-deficient HSCs. These approaches will delineate how autophagy is normally utilized by HSCs in vivo, and how its abrogation alters normal hematopoiesis. In Specific Aim 3, we will probe the function of autophagy in transformed BCR/ABL- expressing HSCs, and will take advantage of our inducible tTA-BA mouse model to investigate the contribution of autophagy to CML pathogenesis and response of CML LSCs to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments. These approaches will provide important new insights into the mechanisms of malignant transformation in the blood system. They will elucidate the contribution of autophagy in HSC transformation and CML development, and determine how the autophagy machinery can be manipulated to achieve a therapeutic benefit. Taken together, these studies will uncover how corruption of an essential mechanism of cell preservation normally used by HSCs to maintain blood homeostasis contributes to the aberrant function of transformed HSCs and the development of blood diseases."

The Consortium's objective is to establish a national, multisite, longitudinal cohort to prospectively examine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance use (SU) from early adolescence through the period of risk for SU and SU disorders. This 10-year longitudinal study of 11,000 children will measure brain development, SU, cognition, emotion, executive function, mental health, physical health, environment, and collect biospecimens for future genetics and epigenetic studies. The Consortium has an optimized research protocol and 4 specific aims: 1) Using advanced multi-modal neuroimaging to evaluate premorbid factors and the impact associated with diverse patterns of SU on the structure and function of the developing brain. 2) Disentangle the predictors and consequences of diverse patterns of SU on physical health, psychosocial and cognitive development, academic achievement, motivation and emotional regulation. 3) Examine how the quantity and combination of substances used affect the expression of psychopathology and, conversely, how the emergence of psychopathology influences SU. 4) Assess how each substance used contributes to the use of other substances (gateway interactions). The Utah site has three sets of specific aims involving (1) Imaging; (2) Family/Genetics; and (3) Special Populations. Imaging Aims: (a) participation in the MRS/QSM substudy with JHU and UH (see JHU project for details) and (b) participation in the perfusion imaging substudy along with Penn, UCLA, and UH (see Penn project for details). Family/Genetics Aims: (a) Cross register all Utah subjects with data contained in the Utah Population Database (UPDB: http://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/research/updb/, the UPDB is the only database of its kind in the United States and one of few such resources in the world). The central component of the UPDB is an extensive set of Utah family histories, in which family members are linked to demographic and medical information and (b) over-enroll siblings, which is made possible by the large family size and the relatively short inter-pregnancy interval of Utahns. Special Population Aims: (a) evaluate a unique adolescent population, those who use marijuana but who have never used other drugs and (b) over-enroll Native American participants, who are known to have substantially higher rates of alcohol-related mortality. Our site is uniquely qualified to be part of the Consortium because of our extensive experience with cognitive assessment and imaging studies of drug-using youth. In addition, the UPDB creates an unprecedented research opportunity at our site. We believe that our contributions in these areas complement those of other outstanding consortium members to collectively achieve the overall goals of the PRISM Consortium."
"9314955","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to predict the length of time from disease onset to major disease outcomes in individual patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has important implications for patient care, the development of interventions and public health. The major aim of the Predictors Study is to further the understanding of AD progression in order to develop predictor algorithms to address this issue. Over the past funding periods, we have followed two clinic-based cohorts of AD patients recruited from three major medical centers, and have made major progress in characterizing the natural history of AD and identifying predictors of disease course. While the Predictors study has had a major impact on our understanding of AD and its progression, the patient cohorts are clinic- based and ethnically homogenous, and the true date of disease onset was unknown. We therefore have assembled and initiated follow-up a new, well-characterized, population-based cohort of ethnically diverse elders with AD. Many of these individuals were followed from a point prior to the onset of AD, so the onset date of clinical AD is known. Another portion are at-risk for AD, allowing us to track the disease process from it preclinical state. We propose to continue intensive follow-up of this cohort in order to validate our previous Predictors study findings in this population-based cohort and to implement new research questions based on novel predictor and outcome variables. We will use linkage to Medicare and Medicaid data to understand correlates of the economic impact of AD in this multiethnic community cohort, focusing on costs associated with transition to dementia, medication utilization, the relation of dementia status to the cost of comorbid conditions, end of life costs, and lifetime economic burden based on predicted disability-free and disabled survival. We will also continue to refine a unique predictive approach that uses longitudinal Grade of Membership (L-GoM) modeling to accurately summarize the AD process. We will validate and apply an updated L-GoM model to external datasets, extend it to include the pre-dementia phase, explore the genetic correlates of heterogeneity of disease course, incorporate AD biomarkers, determine the extent to the model refines analysis of AD treatment effects by applying it to data from recent AD clinical trials, and develop and support software for calculation of the L-GoM model predictions in individual patient data."
"9270058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mounting evidence suggests that abnormal placental development in early gestation is highly associated with many maternal and fetal pathologic conditions, which can manifest later in pregnancy. The ability to evaluate in real time human placental structure and function in early gestation by using novel ultrasound tools will allow for the identification of early markers of placental dysfunction with the ultimate long- term goal of prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes. As initial steps in accomplishing this long-term goal, we propose this study designed to find which of the novel ultrasound tools are best at discriminating between women who will develop adverse pregnancy outcomes and those who will not. We have formed collaboration with Toshiba Medical Systems, one of the ultrasound industry leaders, that is focused on evaluating recently developed novel ultrasound tools that substantially expand our ability to study placental structure and function in vivo. This collaboration will advance the field through technology development and translational research. Our collaboration brings together novel tools, strong technological expertise, leadership in obstetrical ultrasound, and a track record of clinical research. The novel ultrasound tools that will be used in our study include Superb Micro-Vascular Imaging (SMI) for the comprehensive assessment of placental microvasculature, Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) for the evaluation of placental tissue stiffness and MicroPure(r) for the visualization of placental microcalcificatios content. We plan to apply these novel ultrasound tools, along with fetal and placental biometric and 3D ultrasound measurements, on a control group of normal pregnancies and a study group of at-risk pregnancies starting from early gestation and in a longitudinal cohort design. Maternal and neonatal outcome will be collected along with storage of biospecimen and placental pathology for future evaluation. Pregnancy ending at less than 37 0/7 weeks' gestation for any cause will be the primary study outcome and will differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancy. The ultrasound data will be analyzed to identify significant early markers of placental dysfunction. We have 3 study aims. First is to develop longitudinal nomograms for the novel ultrasound tools in normal human pregnancies. Second is to apply these novel ultrasound tools to study placental development in at-risk human pregnancies. Third to develop and evaluate an overall novel placental ultrasound marker: The Placental Index as an early gestation, non-invasive, marker of placental dysfunction for the prediction of adverse human pregnancy outcomes."
"9281636","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While inflammation is a common component of many clinical disorders, the contributing factors can be distinct. In recent years, the complement system has been associated with a growing number of inflammatory conditions that include acute and chronic tissue inflammation, adverse reactions to biomaterials, and transplant rejection. It is evident that excessive or insufficiently controlled complement activation on host cells can cause an immune imbalance that, exacerbated by factors such as oxidative stress or infection, may fuel a vicious cycle between complement, inflammation, and tissue damage. As a consequence, therapeutic modulation of complement emerges as attractive target for upstream inhibition of inflammatory processes but requires profound understanding of underlying processes, identification of rewarding targets, and careful selection of suitable inhibitors. This Program Project therefore employs a highly integrated and holistic approach to describe common and distinct denominators of complement involvement in inflammatory conditions and open avenues for improved therapeutic strategies. For this purpose, three disease models that are representative of the wide spectrum of complement-mediated conditions and have high impact for health care and the clinic will be thoroughly investigated. Whereas inflammatory reactions to hemodialysis and kidney transplantation (Project 2) represent distinct disorders of complement activation by artificial and foreign surfaces and major complications in end-stage renal disease, periodontitis (Project 3) is an emerging and very attractive model of local tissue inflammation with a strong infectious component. Using relevant in vitro assays, sensitive instrumental methods (Core 6), and translational models in rodents and non-human primates, disease processes will be investigated in relation to complement triggers and activity, but also to associated pathways (e.g., TLR), effects on downstream inflammatory processes, and influences of modulating factors (e.g., oxidative damage, infection). A diverse panel of potent, validated, pathway-specific and/or targeted complement inhibitors will be generated (Project 1, Core B) that allows for the dissection of involved complement pathways and processes in each disease. This 'inhibitor toolbox' includes analogs of the central C3 inhibitor compstatin, which will serve as a benchmark compound, and entities acting at individual initiation, amplification, and effector pathways. Optimization of efficacy, pharmacokinetic, administration, and targeting properties will be guided by results and requirements of the disease models of Projects 2 & 3. At the same time, the evaluation of promising and pre-validated inhibitor candidates in such relevant disease models is expected to allow rapid translation into therapeutic concepts. Established models, methods, and inhibitors of this P01 can easily be applied to future disease studies. Thus, this P01 will have a high impact on the elucidation and management of complement-related disease and benefit patients and the research community."
"9271188","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of the human liver are essential to life since the liver is the only organ capable of regeneration. Human liver stem cells (HLSCs) have been extensively studied for their reparative, regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. Several studies, using different animal models of diseases, showed that treatment with exogenous HLSCs ameliorates acute organ injury including hepatic disorders. The mechanisms may involve paracrine factors promoting proliferation of surviving intrinsic epithelial cells. Whil stem cell therapies have been in pre-clinical use for the treatment of liver diseases, very little s known about the stem cell derived microvesicles (MVs) and their related non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which can mediate genetic changes that promote the progression and recovery of liver disorders. Many ncRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner that is aberrantly altered in human alcoholic liver injuries. The biological function of the majority of ncRNAs in livr diseases is undefined. In our preliminary studies, we have shown that selected ncRNA genes are altered after cholestatic liver injuries, and aberrantly expressed in human liver stem cells and their derived MVs that can modulate the response to liver injury as well as cell anti-senescence and remodeling potentials. Based on these compelling data, we propose the central hypothesis that ncRNAs in stem cell derived microvesicles contribute to the recovery of cholestatic liver injury through induction of growth and anti-senescence/anti-fibrosis of hepatobiliary tissues and cells. To test this hypothesis, we have established techniques for ncRNA gene manipulation, functional and interaction analysis, and generated stably transfected or knockdown cell lines as well as animal models of cholestatic liver injury. Our long-term objective is to identify and isolate stem cell derived microvesicles and to characterize their functional properties of tissue repair. In this application, we propose the systematic evaluation o stemness dependent ncRNAs as markers in stem cell derived MVs with the therapeutic potentials for cholestatic liver injury. We will address our central hypothesis by focusing on the following specific aims: First, we will define the functional stemness regulated ncRNAs signaling involved in tissue repair-related cellular functions in hepatobiliary cells. Second, we will identiy functional LPS/TGF-ß dependent miRNAs involved in survival and anti-senescence during cholestatic liver injury. Third, we will determine the effects of stemness related ncRNAs enriched microvesicles on accelerating the morphologic and functional recovery of cholestatic liver injury in vivo using BDL or CCl4 treatment and in Mdr2 deficient mice, the genetic mouse model of PSC. Therapeutic effects of MVs derived from stem cells with anti-miRNAs or over-expression of T-UCRs on hepatobiliary cell growth, anti- senescence and anti-fibrosis will be evaluated. The results of the proposed studies may lead to new therapeutic strategies for human cholestatic liver diseases. Meanwhile, the acquired fundamental new knowledge about stem cell derived MVs is expected to advance the general field of stem cell biology."
"9271182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced pancreatic ?-cell function and enhanced ?-cell death are key events in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. In normal conditions, the pancreatic ?-cell responds to acutely elevated blood glucose with insulin secretion, and to persistently elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia) with compensatory increase in insulin secretion and ?-cell mass. Persistent hyperglycemia may also lead to paradoxical 'glucotoxic' pancreatic ?-cell dysfunction, reduced ?-cell mass and loss of insulin content, although underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Chronic hyperglycemia will lead to hyperstimulated metabolism, membrane hyperexcitability and increased [Ca2+]i. It has been suggested that hyperexcitability, high [Ca2+]i and insulin hypersecretion may play a key role in ?-cell desensitization and glucotoxicity. However, a mouse model of neonatal diabetes with genetically inexcitable ?-cells and persistently low [Ca2+]I demonstrates a marked loss of insulin content, disruption of the pancreatic architecture and loss of ?-cell mass over time. Thus, it is imperative to understand the independent contributions of hypermetabolism and hyperexcitability in ?-cell pathology of T2DM. This mouse therefore provides a diabetic model in which to examine glucotoxic effects of hyperstimulated metabolism, independent of the normally coupled hyperexcitability and high [Ca2+]i. One major goal of this proposal to address this question using in vivo and in vitro approaches in these unique animal models. Hyperglycemia induces hyperstimulated metabolism and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which can be detrimental for ?-cells. Excessive ROS can induce mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which are likely to be major contributors in pancreatic ?-cell glucotoxicity. A second major goal of this proposal is therefore to address the question of what is driving the gradual reduction of ?-cell mass in diabetes in vivo. I will specifically test whether the decrease in ?-cell mass in underexcitability-driven diabetes is a consequence of glucotoxicity, wheher this effect is mediated by an increase in glucose metabolism and ROS production, and whether it involves mitochondrial dysfunction. In seeking answers to these questions, the experiments proposed in this project represent a significant effort to understand mechanisms underlying diabetic glucotoxicity and will be of direct relevance to the progression of human diabetes."
"9265965","Sleep has a profound impact on brain plasticity, pathologies, and repair processes, and is critical for one's wellbeing. Although interleukin-1? (IL1) is a well-characterized sleep regulatory substance and has important roles in these processes, knowledge is lacking as to IL1 sleep signaling mechanisms and brain cell types expressing IL1 that are involved. The broad hypothesis tested in this application is that the neuron-specific IL1 receptor accessory protein (AcPb) plays a role in physiological sleep and is required for responses to sleep loss via signaling pathways in neurons that include Src phosphorylation. The alternatively spliced isoform of AcPb, AcP, is hypothesized to recruit additional IL1 signaling pathways during pathology including Src, p38MAPkinase and I?B phosphorylation in neurons and astrocytes which leads to a robust cytokine response and triggers sleep fragmentation. This application is focused on how AcPb and AcP signaling mechanisms manifest as emergent neuronal/glial properties that characterize sleep both in vivo and in vitro. In Aim 1 we use wild type (WT), AcPb knockout (-/-), or AcP-/- mice and determine responses to sleep loss, quantify cytokine mRNA and protein in brain, and measure phosphorylation of Src, p38MAPkinase, and I?B. In Aims 2 and 3, we use a neuronal/glial cell culture model derived from the three strains of mice. We will characterize several in vitro electrophysiological parameters that manifest in sleep of intact animals; they include action potential burstiness (BI ? burstiness index), synchronization (SYN) of slow waves (SW) (0.5-3.5 Hz), SW power (µV2) and enhanced evoked response potential (ERP) amplitudes. Over the course of neuronal/glial culture development these parameters emerge as the networks mature. If cultured networks are stimulated electrically, BI, SYN and SW power decrease suggesting a more wake-like state. Cultures also exhibit sleep homeostasis; after electrical stimulation a rebound increase in BI, SYN and SW power occurs. Preliminary data indicate that if cultures are treated with IL1, these parameters and ERPs increase indicating a deeper sleep-like state. Further, cultures derived from AcPb-/- mice fail to ?wake up? if electrically stimulated, have distinct ERP responses to IL1, and fail to phosphorylate Src if IL1-stimulated. These data suggest that the in vivo sleep rebound deficits in AcPb-/- mice are directly linked to the in vitro response deficits. In Aims 2 and 3, cultures are stimulated electrically, with IL1, and optogenetically to test the hypotheses that mild sleep loss and low doses of IL1 elicit their sleep responses via AcPb-mediated Src phosphorylation. Further, by optogenetically stimulating neurons and astrocytes separately we will determine the contributions of these cell types to IL1-AcPb mediated responses. In Aim 4, we also use the three mouse strains to stimulate astroglial G-coupled proteins using DREADDs technology to determine the influence of IL1-mediated astroglial stimulation on these biochemical measures. The projects use cutting-edge techniques including; optogenetics, DREADDs, multi electrode arrays, and in vivo mouse recordings to elucidate IL1 sleep signaling mechanisms."
"9278251","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this grant is to determine the mechanism of activation of the cell surface receptor Notch by transmembrane ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) superfamily. DSL-Notch signaling is an important and pervasive mechanism of intercellular communication, conserved in all multi-cellular animals, from sponges to man. It has enormous implications for human health, as genetic and environmental perturbations of DSL-Notch signaling cause a wide range of cancers, as well as developmental, immune, and neurological disorders. Thus, determining how DSL ligands activate Notch is critical for developing diagnostic and therapeutic tools to treat human disease, a central mission of the NIH. Our past work was instrumental in defining the basic mechanism of signal transduction by Notch. Using Drosophila as a model system, we discovered that Notch is a membrane tethered transcription factor that is cleaved in response to ligand, allowing the intracellular domain to enter the nucleus and turn on target genes. In the proposed work, we will address the still unanswered and crucial question of how ligand binding induces the initial cleavage responsible for activating the receptor. We will build on our previous discovery that to activate Notch on signal-receiving cells, DSL ligands must undergo endocytosis in signal-sending cells specifically by the adaptor protein Epsin. This finding, together with recent structural and biophysical studies, has suggested that ligand endocytosis by Epsin induces an allosteric change in the Notch codomain that exposes an otherwise buried cleavage site to the activating protease. In the proposed research we will use new approaches to manipulate ligand and receptor structure in vivo to test three hypotheses. First, that mechanical force generated across the intercellular ligand/receptor bridge is responsible for the allosteric change that renders the receptor susceptible to cleavage. Second, that this force is exerted by the ligand as it undergoes Epsin-dependent endocytosis into the sending cell. Third, that receptor plays an active role in generating this force by (i) inducing the ligand to enter the Epsin pathway, and (ii exerting an opposing force that depends on its own endocytosis. The results of these experiments will either establish the mechanical force model and the role of Epsin- dependent ligand endocytosis in generating the required force, or lead to other testable hypotheses for the basic mechanism by which ligand activates Notch. The innovative methods and reagents we generate will also be applicable to other problems in signal transduction and animal development.2"
"9298673","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):    Plasma adenosine is increased in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sustained elevation of adenosine in adenosine deaminase (ADA-/-) mice causes increased permeability lung edema. ADA activity is decreased in rats and humans by cigarette smoke (CS) exposure, a risk< factor of ALI. The fundamental hypothesis is that prolonged exposure to increased adenosine increases lung vascular permeability. The long-range goal is to develop novel therapeutic approaches to prevent/treat lung diseases associated with sustained increased adenosine and CS exposure. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms of deleterious effects of prolonged adenosine exposure on lung endothelial (EC) barrier function using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Preliminary studies show that subacute CS exposure elevates lung adenosine and worsens lung edema and that prolonged exposure to elevated adenosine causes lung EC barrier dysfunction via transporter (ENTI)-dependent, not receptor-mediated, mitochondrial oxidative stress and p38 activation. I hypothesize that sustained exposure to elevated adenosine causes EC barrier dysfunction, leading to lung edema, via ENT1-dependent uptake and mitochondrial oxidative stress mediated p38 activation. Specific Aim 1 will determine the extent to which ENT1 and oxidative stress mediate sustained elevated adenosine-induced lung edema in animal models. Specific Aim 2 will identify the mechanism of deleterious effects of sustained exposure to elevated adenosine on barrier function in cultured lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVEC). I anticipate that sustained exposure to elevated adenosine causes ENT1-mediated disruption of EC barrier function and lung edema and that CS increases adenosine and similarly disrupts EC barrier function. The approach is innovative since it uses ADA deficiency as a model for sustained adenosine elevation and a novel model of CS priming ALI. These studies will elucidate a novel pathway for adenosine effects mediated by intracellular uptake of adenosine. Inhibition of ENT1- facilitated adenosine transport and downstream signaling may likely provide significant and greatly needed new approaches to treat diseases associated with sustained elevated adenosine and CS exposure."
"9420719","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) affects about 1.7 million people in the US per year. More than 47% of total injured population had non-superficial eye injuries and a large subset of this population is under the risk of blindness. TBI-induced increase in visual problems includes binocular vision dysfunction, light sensitivity, photophobia and visual field defects. These are often associated with deficiency in both acute and chronic PERG responses due to damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGC). The pathophysiology of these injuries is not well understood but impacts negatively the daily living activities of our soldiers and veterans. We hypothesize that TBI-dependent severe RGC death and subsequent deficiency in PERG and vision disturbances can be ameliorated or prevented by inhibiting Brn3a-sulfhydration (Brn3a-SSH), the key mechanism responsible for degradation and inactivation of Brn3a. The hypothesis is based on our recently published data showing that CBS is highly enriched in RGC and our compelling preliminary data showing that TBI leads to increased RGC death concomitant with degradation of sulfhydrated Brn3a through its interaction with an E3 ligase Siah. In CBS heterozygous mice (cbs+/-) or administration of sulfhydration mutant of Brn3a, (Brn3a-C406S), TBI-induced RGC cell death was reduced significantly. We outline three Specific Aims to test the above hypotheses: Aim 1 Test the hypothesis that TBI leads to Brn3a-sulfhydration via modulation of CBS expression and intracellular H2S levels. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that Brn3a-sulfhydration triggers RGC death following TBI. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that reducing Brn3a-sulfhydration rescues TBI-induced functional and structural alterations in RGC. Accomplishing these aims will lead to a clearer understanding of the mechanism(s) by which Brn3a- sulfhydration contributes to induction of RGC loss following TBI. Given the impact of inactivation of Brn3a on induction of RGC loss after TBI, preventing Brn3a-sulfhydration will have far-reaching translational implications."
"9283357","DESCRIPTION: Despite optimal antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected individuals continue to have an increased risk of mortality and several aging-associated morbidities than the general population. The chronic inflammatory state of treated HIV infection appears to predict many of these morbidities and is also thought to lead to premature immunosenescence, functional T cell defects typically seen in much older HIV-uninfected individuals. However, the specific T cell defects that impair functional immune responses in treated HIV infection are unknown and may be quite distinct from those observed in aging. Preliminary data from our group suggests that the proliferative history marker CD57 is abnormally low on effector CD28- CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals, increases during suppressive ART, but fails to normalize. This persistently low CD57 defect during ART is associated with monocyte activation and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) induction, known drivers of proliferative T cell defects, and strongly predicts increased mortality in this setting. These CD8+ T cell defects are quite distinct from aging-associated immunosenescence, which is typically characterized by increased CD57 on effector CD8+ T cells. These data motivated the hypothesis that the phenotypic T cell defects responsible for functional adaptive immune defects in treated HIV disease are quite distinct from those observed in elderly HIV-infected individuals. We will address this hypothesis directly in a cohort of 200 HIV-infected and 100 HIV-uninfected individuals with the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether HIV-infected individuals maintaining ART-mediated viral suppression have poorer vaccine responsiveness than age-matched HIV-uninfected individuals and whether these defects can be reversed by early initiation of ART, 2) to characterize the phenotypic T cell defects that predict poor vaccine responsiveness in both treated HIV infection and aging, and 3) to characterize the relationship between innate immune activation pathways and poor vaccine responsiveness in treated HIV infection and aging. By characterizing the immunologic determinants of impaired vaccine responsiveness in treated HIV infection and how they may differ from those of aging-associated immunosenescence, this project will help identify targets for novel interventions to restore immune function and health in HIV-infected individuals."
"9353828","Project Summary Animals, including humans, contain a small number of cells in their gonads called germline stem cells (GSCs). These cells are essential for making sperm or eggs throughout the lifetime of the animal. The decision for a dividing stem cell to renew as a stem cell or to differentiate, and the regulation of early divisions during GSC are some of the most critical decisions in development. Studies in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have identified many of the key genes involved in the cellular signaling for GSC maintenance and differentiation. Several of the key GSC regulatory genes are rapidly evolving under adaptive evolution in two closely related species of Drosophila (D. melanogaster and its sibling species D. simulans) but not in several additional closely related species. The key ?switch? gene for GSC differentiation, bag of marbles (bam) has accumulated a highly significant excess of amino-acid changes between these two closely related species (13%). This proposal focuses on identifying the functional consequences of these changes and gaining insight into possible evolutionary forces driving these changes, including interactions with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia. This knowledge is essential for understanding how GSCs are regulated during normal development and how their misregulation due to mutation and interaction with germline parasites can lead to infertility, germline cancers, and reproductive isolation. Our proposed studies provide a framework with which to test the functional consequences and evolutionary forces driving these evolutionary changes in genes controlling stem cell fate decisions in Drosophila as well as in other organisms, including humans."
"9284884","Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in adults 65 years and older. Unchecked, the disease will reach epidemic proportions in the United States and worldwide by 2050, and presently, there is no intervention that has shown a clear effect on AD progression. Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in repurposing the use of lithium for diseases involving neurodegeneration. Lithium treatment has been associated with neurogenesis in the hippocampus, up-regulation of important neurotrophic factors such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) isoforms ? and ?. In particular, GSK-3? interacts with gamma-secretase playing a critical role in the conversion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid-beta (A?); lithium has been shown to reduce A? production and memory deficits in AD transgenic mouse models. GSK-3? phosphorylates tau, a critical step in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and lithium has been shown to reduce tau phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. That lithium may alter the AD trajectory is supported by numerous observational reports showing delay of dementia onset in those treated with it. However, the results of the few human lithium trials conducted have been mixed. Additional research is needed to determine whether lithium has a role as an anti-dementia agent. In contrast to previous studies, we will implement an RCT with a more integrative, comprehensive approach than done before involving state-of-the-art ultra-high field (7T) human MRI, neurocognitive assessment, and blood- and CSF- based biomarker measurement to investigate the role of lithium as an anti-dementia agent. The specific aim of this pilot-feasibility study is to examine the potential disease modifying properties of lithium in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in delaying conversion to dementia. The study will enroll and randomly assign 80 individuals 60 years and older with MCI (amnestic type, single or multiple domain) to take lithium, titrated to a maximally tolerated blood level (0.5 to 0.8 meq/L), or placebo for two years to assess lithium?s effects on preserving cognition and delaying conversion to dementia. Participants will receive annual neurocognitive assessment, blood- and CSF-based biomarker measurement, and 7T MR imaging of structural brain volumes (e.g., hippocampal, total cortical gray). At baseline, all subjects will undergo PET imaging for A?. The following hypotheses will be tested: H1: a) Participants randomized to take lithium for two years, compared to placebo, will better maintain cognitive function, primarily in memory, which b) will be associated with changes in biomarkers (e.g., GSK-3?, BDNF). H2: a) Participants randomized to take lithium, compared to placebo, will have larger hippocampal volumes and lower total gray matter thinning, which b) will be associated with changes in biomarkers and c) better cognitive function, primarily in memory. The exploratory aim examines whether lithium is related to additional markers of enhanced brain integrity (e.g., lower level of microbleeds, higher white matter integrity, better network connectivity, or decreased CSF phospho tau levels)."
"9269554","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is the principal biological methyl donor, precursor of polyamines and GSH. SAMe is made in all mammalian cells via the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). In liver, SAMe biosynthesis is carried out by MATI/III isoenzymes (tetramer and dimer of a1 encoded by MAT1A). Patients with chronic liver disease have reduced hepatic MAT activity and SAMe levels. We showed that mice lacking MAT1A exhibit increased oxidative stress and develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) spontaneously. SAMe is widely available in the United States as a health supplement and is used therapeutically in Europe and Asia. Despite its wide usage, the molecular mechanisms of its actions are largely unclear. We have reported that many of SAMe's actions are mimicked by its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA). In particular, both are selectively pro-apoptotic in liver and colon cancer cells and inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. SAMe is a methyl donor but MTA inhibits methylation. Our accumulated results show three key post- translational protein modifications, methylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation, are dysregulated in the setting of chronic hepatic SAMe depletion that can be corrected by SAMe. There is interesting crosstalk and interplay between these pathways, which are frequently dysregulated in HCC, and are targeted by pharmacologic administration of SAMe and MTA. This application is designed to examine how hepatic SAMe deficiency impacts on these protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and how pharmacologic SAMe/MTA work on these pathways. Four specific aims are proposed: 1. Define the effect of SAMe depletion on sumoylation machinery and protein PTMs. We will elucidate the effect of hepatic SAMe deficiency on sumoylation machinery and changes in the SUMO-, Ser/Thr-phospho- and methyl-proteomes. 2. Examine how SAMe depletion affects activity of MAPKs, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and Tyr-phospho- proteome. Our preliminary data indicate the activity of several MAPKs and RTKs are affected by SAMe level. We will elucidate the mechanisms involved and how SAMe level impacts on the Tyr-phosphoproteome. 3. Examine pharmacologic SAMe and MTA actions on protein PTMs. Pharmacologic SAMe and MTA reduce ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole E2 enzyme for sumoylation, and inhibit ERK and Akt signaling. We will determine the molecule responsible, mechanisms involved, and examine their effects on protein PTMs in liver cancer cell lines and normal human intestinal epithelial cells. 4. Examine effectiveness of SAMe/MTA or sorafenib alone or in combination in HCC treatment. We will examine the efficacy of oral SAMe or MTA ± sorafenib versus sorafenib alone in the treatment of HCC growth and recurrence. The effect of these treatments on protein PTMs will also be examined in tumor tissues. Successful completion of these aims should enhance our knowledge of the complex interplay between the protein PTMs that is regulated by SAMe and assess SAMe/MTA efficacy in HCC treatment, topics that are highly relevant to public health."
"9263936","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inactivating mutations in KATP channels cause the most common and severe form of congenital hyperinsulinism (KATPHI). Children with KATPHI are usually unresponsive to medical therapy and require pancreatectomy to control the hypoglycemia and prevent permanent brain damage. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the ß-cell pathophysiology in KATPHI through the examination of fuel metabolism and stimulus-secretion coupling in islets isolated from children with KATPHI. Our overall hypothesis is that disturbances in KATP channels function result not only in dysregulation of the triggering pathway of insulin release, but also have secondary consequences that drastically disturb glucose and amino acid metabolism and alter fuel-stimulated insulin secretion through both the triggering and the amplification pathway. This hypothesis will be examined in three related and overlapping specific aims: Aim 1 characterizes fuel metabolism and fuel-mediated insulin release in human islets with inactivating mutations in KATP channels and examines the role that elevated cytosolic calcium plays in determining the fate of metabolic fuels in these islets. Aim 2 focuses on examining the metabolic and cAMP-mediated amplification of insulin secretion within the framework of energy production in human KATPHI islets. Aim 3 examines the differences in gene expression between KATPHI islets and normal islets and integrates the metabolic and transcriptional profile of these islets to understand the mechanisms underlying the differences in fuel metabolism and insulin secretion. KATPHI is a severe genetic disorder associated with high rates of neurodevelopmental impairment. It has been almost 20 years since the discovery of the molecular basis of this condition. However, the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the dysregulated insulin secretion has precluded the development of effective therapies. Thus, outcomes with current treatment approaches continue to be suboptimal for children carrying the most severe mutations. Our study aims at examining the pathophysiology within the framework of the energy production/insulin secretion relationship to identify new targets for therapy. This study will improve our understanding of the mechanisms and second messengers mediating the amplifying pathway of insulin secretion, which in turn, will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms implicated in the progressive ß-cell failure that leads to type 2 diabetes. Thus, these studies may lead to the identification of novel targets for therapy not only for hyperinsulinism but also for diabetes."
"9381056","The long-term goal of our work is to understand how heparanase promotes the aggressive behavior of tumors and to use that knowledge to develop curative cancer therapies. We have identified multiple mechanisms through which heparanase drives cancer progression, metastasis and chemoresistance and established heparanase as a viable target for cancer therapy. Moreover, we catalyzed collaborative efforts aimed at developing and testing novel anti-heparanase drugs and demonstrated their efficacy in pre-clinical models of cancer leading to a currently ongoing clinical trial. The challenge now is to maximize anti-heparanase therapy to enhance its anti-tumor effects; a goal that will be attained through a thorough understanding of heparanase mechanisms of action. The overarching hypothesis guiding our work is that heparanase is a master regulator of the aggressive phenotype of cancer, an important contributor to the poor outcome of many cancer patients and a prime target for therapy. This hypothesis is supported by studies focused predominantly on the impact of heparanase expressed by tumor cells. Our latest discoveries have revealed two novel, previously unexplored mechanisms related to heparanase regulation of cancer. We found that: (i) heparanase expressed by non-tumor (host) cells within the microenvironment can substantially contribute to tumor progression, and (ii) tumor secreted exosomes can shuttle heparanase to recipient cells and enhance their chemoresistance. Our working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that heparanase produced by host cells acts within the tumor microenvironment to support and accelerate tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. This will be studied in pancreatic carcinoma and myeloma tumors growing in mice that express different levels of host heparanase (transgenic and knockout mice). We will investigate the type of host cells involved (e.g., macrophages, stromal cells), their impact on tumor progression and chemoresistance and the ability of heparanase inhibitors to block those effects of host heparanase. Our working hypothesis for Aim 2 is that heparanase present as cargo in exosomes is delivered to recipient tumor cells and enhances their chemoresistance. We will determine mechanistically how exosomes drive chemoresistance and investigate the potential of anti-heparanase therapy for inhibiting exosome-mediated chemoresistance. In addition, work in Aim 3 will develop new, highly specific anti-heparanase monoclonal antibodies as anti-cancer therapeutics. The proposed work is significant and innovative because it couples the discovery of new heparanase mechanisms of action with the objective of maximizing anti-heparanase therapy and improving patient outcome."
"9402866","ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and a huge biomedical problem of increasing concern. Currently, there are no treatments that can prevent, delay, or restore deficits in learning and memory associated with DS. Thus, the identification of novel neuronal targets for the development of pharmacotherapies to treat memory decline associated with DS is an important goal.  It has been hypothesized that alterations in protein synthesis (mRNA translation) could contribute to the molecular, synaptic, and behavioral abnormalities of neurodevelopmental disorders, but whether dysfunctional protein synthesis is responsible for the DS pathology remains unknown. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify and correct the aberrant translational control program underlying DS pathophysiology. We focus on protein synthesis controlled by the PKR-eIF2? signaling pathway because a) our preliminary findings indicate that PKR-eIF2? signaling is selectively perturbed in the DS brain, and b) during the previous funding period, we discovered PKR-eIF2? signaling as a central mechanism regulating not only the formation of long-term memory, but also the two major and opposing forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain. We will combine genetics, state-of-the-art intersectional molecular genetic approaches, pharmacology, electrophysiology, cell- type-specific manipulation, genomics, and behavior to define the translational and synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in Down syndrome. We anticipate that the results of these Aims will provide new fundamental insights into the biological basis of intellectual disability and could open avenues for new therapies."
"9281904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global mortality of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continues to rise. Unfortunately, the predominant techniques for assessing its progression exhibit important shortcomings. Spirometry, the most commonly used surrogate marker in clinical trials, offers only global indications of functional alteration, and it has encountered substantial difficulty in sensitively and specifically assessing the heterogeneous abnormalities associated with COPD. While computed tomography (CT) produces excellent high-resolution images of key regional abnormalities, most of these images are anatomic and only indirectly related to physiology, and the exposure of patients to ionizing radiation can proscribe its use in longitudinal studies. To address these drawbacks, this project aims to refine and test a hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance imaging (HP gas MRI) approach for the measurement of several important aspects of COPD pathophysiology in human subjects. The proposed method will allow for the simultaneous obtainment of three regional parameters that together offer a nuanced body of data on pulmonary physiology and microstructure: specific ventilation (SV), alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (pAO2), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ability to extract all three of these metrics in a single acquisition period over multipe breaths confers several advantages. Most importantly, the use of a multi-breath sequence leads to more physiologically meaningful measurements. The simultaneous technique also results in inherent co-registration of all three parameters. Once the multi-breath HP MRI approach has been optimized, we will use it to study pulmonary function and structure in 120 COPD patients recruited from the Temple cohort of the COPDGene study. This cohort has already been well characterized by CT and spirometry. Our research on these subjects will first focus on correlating HP MRI metrics with these more established techniques. We will then compare HP MRI parameters with CT parameters in terms of their ability to predict whole-lung functional change, exacerbation frequency, and emphysematous remodeling over a two-year follow-up period. The broad impact of this research will be the development of a technique that can simultaneously derive multiple non-invasive markers of obstructive lung disease. These metrics will supply important physiologic data on the development and progression of COPD that will make a valuable contribution to the ongoing effort to better phenotype this protean disease. The parameters will also provide safe and sensitive markers for longitudinal studies of novel COPD therapies."
"9313960","Pain is a multidimensional experience that includes sensory and affective components. Human imaging studies have identified patterns of activities within key cortical areas that can encode different pain experiences, but it remains unclear how pain can also be encoded reliably at the level of individual neurons or populations of neurons. The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) has been thought to be important in the sensory-discriminative aspect of the pain, yet the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to play a crucial role in the affective-motivational experience of pain. However, imaging studies cannot provide causal relationship between circuits and behavior and are further limited by poor temporal resolution. Therefore, a complete understanding of neural codes for acute pain in physiology remains missing. Neuromodulation is a potential option for pain treatment; but current techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) lack optimal targets and require constant stimulation with undesired side effects. We will use a rat model to uncover pain mechanisms of key central neural circuits and develop a demand-based brain-machine interface (BMI) that integrates timely detection of the pain signal and precise temporal analgesic control. In Aim 1, we will identify cortical circuitry for encoding acute pain. We will collect simultaneous S1 and ACC ensemble recordings from freely behaving rats and characterize their firing patterns at both single cell and population levels. In Aim 2, we will determine how the central pain circuitry is altered by central vs. peripheral analgesic strategy using optogenetic and pharmacological approaches. In Aim 3, we will develop reliable computational strategies to decode acute pain based on neural ensemble recordings from the central pain circuits involving S1 and ACC. In Aim 4, we will develop a real-time closed-loop BMI system for modulating acute pain by combining a detection arm of neural decoding with a therapeutic arm of central neurostimulation. We will test its effectiveness using established pain behavior assays. Together, these results will enable us to dissect neural circuits and mechanisms for acute pain and provide a template for next-generation demand-based pain treatment. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): This project is aimed to dissect circuit mechanisms of acute pain and develop closed-loop BMI system for pain control. We will combine experimental, computational and engineering techniques to decode acute pain signals and apply them to develop real-time BMI system for pain modulation using neurostimulation. The proposed research will not only reveal important mechanisms of acute pain, but will also provide new insiahts on theraoeutic treatment of oain analaesia."
"9282779","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Keratoconus (KC), with an incidence of ~1/1,000, is a degenerative weakening and thinning of the corneal connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM), causing high astigmatism, scarring, and vision loss in severe cases. There are no curative treatments: the disorder is managed by hard contact lens use and UV cross-linking of collagens (CXL) to temporarily strengthen the connective tissue, at early stages, and cornea transplants, at advanced stages. However, the long-term effects of CXL are unknown and as KC onsets at a young age, it impacts ones productivity and quality of life tremendously. We hypothesize that dysregulated stress response in keratocytes, the specialized cells of the cornea and disruptions in the stromal ECM they produce are major disease underpinnings. KC is multifactorial with a strong genetic component: 18% of cases have a positive family history, concordance is significantly higher in monozygotic than dizygotic twins, and KC is positively associated with heritable traits like central corneal thickness and genetic disorders like trisomy 21 and Ehlers- Danlos syndrome types. Past linkage, candidate gene sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to suggestive clues but have not identified causal genes. Consequently, we propose a functionally- complemented exome sequencing study that relies on three major advances from our laboratory: (1) We have performed proteomics and preliminary RNA-Seq screens of KC and control corneas to identify the universe of known and novel corneal RNAs and proteins within which genetic defects occur. (2) We have established a 'disease-in-a-dish' model using keratocytes from individual donor (DN) and KC corneas, where KC cells mimic degenerative features of the cornea. (3) Our expression and functional studies of KC indicate a dysregulated network involving cytokines, TGFb and AKT, as major effectors of cellular stress and ECM perturbations in KC. Aim I will investigate TGFb and PI3K/AKT signal transductions in cellular stress and ECM/collagen disruptions in KC cell cultures. Aim II will identify transcriptional alterations in individual KC and DN corneas by RNA-sequencing. Aim III will identify KC susceptibility genes by exome sequencing of familial and isolated cases. We have established an active Keratoconus Research Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Institute for long-term patient recruitment, locally and through national/international collaborators, with an experienced research team in ocular medicine (Walter Stark, Albert Jun), bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics (Steven Salzberg, Aravinda Chakravarti, Akhilesh Pandey) and ECM cell biology and biochemistry (Shukti Chakravarti). Our findings will elucidate keratoconus pathogenesis at a molecular level and lead to strategies for therapeutic interventions."
"9312118","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although MDD often emerges in adolescence, research in this age group remains scarce. The heterogeneity of adolescent MDD has further hampered identification of the disorder?s neurobiological underpinnings. To address these challenges, this research training fellowship utilizes a dimensional approach focusing on the core MDD symptom of anhedonia?the reduced capacity to experience pleasure. Anhedonia severity is highly variable in adolescent MDD, with increased severity predicting poor prognosis and suicide. Our research aims to delineate reward circuitry deficits associated with anhedonia. Converging preclinical data suggest that hyperactivity of the habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, may underlie such deficits by excessively inhibiting reward signaling by the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and downstream Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Characterizing and even visualizing these regions in vivo has been a challenge in humans, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The propose research aims to comprehensively examines these critical reward regions using high resolution functional MRI approaches spearheaded by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and high-fidelity analysis techniques. The project is supported by substantial data from our laboratory documenting a wide range of anhedonia severity in adolescent MDD, as well as relationships between anhedonia severity and intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the NAc with the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). More recently, we reported iFC of the Hb with targets including the VTA and ACC in healthy HCP subjects; moreover, subjects with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with MDD, including the amygdala and insula. This study therefore proposes to examine the role of the Hb and VTA, as well as the NAc and cortical regions, in human reward circuitry and test the overall hypothesis that alterations in this circuitry are associated with MDD and anhedonia. We will examine high resolution resting-state and reward task fMRI data from (Aim 1) healthy young adult HCP subjects and (Aim 2) 35 psychotropic-medication free adolescents with MDD and 20 matched controls (ages 12-18, Tanner stage ? 4). Study procedures for adolescents will include diagnostic evaluations, dimensional measures of anhedonia, and an MRI session. Analyses will focus on the Hb, VTA, NAc, and cortical reward regions, examining iFC, activation during specific reward processes, group differences, and associations with anhedonia severity. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed research addresses the heterogeneous nature of adolescent MDD by focusing on a narrow phenotype of anhedonia to examine the role of critical reward circuitry. The proposed multimodal training will provide experience in both clinical translational research and advanced imaging methodologies. This line of work has the potential to inform etiological models, improve diagnostics, and facilitate the development of targeted interventions."
"9282542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre mortem tests of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology are increasingly popular in research on cognitive aging and AD. Due to concerns that information from such tests may be misunderstood, psychologically harmful, and of unclear clinical significance, results of pre mortem tests of AD pathology have typically been withheld from research participants. However, as the reliability and potential clinical significance of test like brain amyloid imaging have become clear, there is a pressing need to revisit the practice of unilaterally withholding such information from research participants and identify responsible approaches to communicating individual results. Amyloid imaging results may be particularly relevant to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a population for whom a growing body of evidence suggests that such testing may provide valuable prognostic and planning information, despite the unavailability of interventions to alter one's clinical course. Our preliminary work suggests that research participants with MCI and their family members are receptive to and capable of understanding information about the purpose, results, and implications of amyloid imaging when presented using a standardized approach developed by our interdisciplinary team. Building on this work, the proposed study, led by an early stage investigator in response to PA-11-180, will follow a well characterized sample of at least 40 MCI care dyads (patient + family member) who are, and a matched comparison group of dyads who are not, presented with the option of receiving the patient's amyloid imaging research results. Aim 1 will test hypotheses that examine how receiving amyloid imaging research results will impact understanding of, and perceived self-efficacy for coping with, MCI among both patients and care partners. Aim 2 will use a series of qualitative interviews and content analysis to identify the information and support needs of MCI care dyads who are offered amyloid imaging research results. A third, exploratory aim will document, within the subgroup of MCI care dyads who receive amyloid imaging research results, the frequency, nature, and range of psychological and behavioral responses to receiving such results. In addition to having implications for research conduct, our findings may also inform clinical practice as clinicians begin to incorporate amyloid imaging into clinical evaluation and respond to patient requests for such imaging."
"9281640","Complement can be produced locally or systemically and is a major link between infection and local or  systemic inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis or sepsis, respectively. However, little is known about  local mechanisms that disrupt mucosal tissue-microbe homeostasis and set the stage for unwarranted  complement activation. In this regard, periodontitis represents an attractive study model, as it is readily  accessible for obtaining both microbial and host tissue samples to longitudinally investigate local  inflammatory mechanisms. This highly prevalent disease (>47% of US adults) is initiated by a dysbiotic  microbiota, leads to inflammatory destruction of tooth-supporting bone, and adversely affects systemic health  in its severe form (8.5% of US adults). Periodontitis therefore urgently requires innovative treatments. The  overarching concept in Project 3 of this POl is that complement is crucially and centrally involved in the  initiation and amplification of destructive local inflammation in periodontitis through cross-talk interactions  with the microbiota and other inflammatory pathways; hence, it represents a prime target for therapeutic  intervention. Experiments have been designed to dissect the mechanisms of complement involvement in  local tissue regulation of interieukin-17, a key cytokine produced by innate and adaptive immune cells and  mediating inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis (Aim 1). On the basis of preliminary studies and those  to be performed in Aim 1, appropriate complement inhibitors (Core B & Project 1) will be tested for their  efficacy in treating periodontal inflammation and bone loss in non-human primates (Aim 2), a disease that  shares key clinical and immunohistological features with human periodontitis. Local inflammation in this  model will be investigated at the clinical, histological, and cellular/molecular level in a longitudinal approach  that will also include periodic sampling of the periodontal biofilm to monitor complement-dependent  dysbiosis. The C5a receptor (C5aR), a crucial target of microbial immune subversion leading to dysbiosis,  and C3, required for the amplification of inflammation by the dysbiotic microbiota, will serve as initial targets  of therapeutic intervention. Moreover, using a panel of pathway-specific inhibitors, we will dissect the  initiation mechanism(s) leading to C3 activation and other complement pathways that may contribute to  disease pathogenesis. Complement-specific drugs have already undergone successful safety trials, and  promising interventions established in this project have potential for rapid translation to the clinic. Our longterm  objective is to apply the mechanistic insights gained from studying local complement inflammation to  the treatment of local infection-driven inflammatory diseases."
"9298235","ABSTRACT Up to one-half of those in treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a co-occurring anxiety disorder (?comorbidity?), a condition that marks a high degree of treatment resistance, severity and relapse risk in AUD treatment patients. We conceptualize comorbidity as a feed-forward system (?vicious cycle?, [VC]) of interacting negative affect/stress, drinking motives/behavior, coping skills deficits, environmental circumstances, and neurobiological adaptations. Based on this model, we developed and validated the VC cognitive-behavioral therapy (VC-CBT) to disrupt this system at several key linkage points. In a recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found that adding the VC-CBT to standard AUD inpatient treatment resulted in better alcohol outcomes 4 months following treatment than did adding an anxiety treatment or standard AUD treatment alone. With a number needed to treat (NNT) index of 8 (relative to standard AUD treatment alone), the VC-CBT could, if broadly disseminated, have a large positive impact on AUD treatment. Unfortunately, several significant barriers related to the resource- and expertise-intensive delivery of the VC-CBT limit its dissemination potential and, hence, the impact of this otherwise effective treatment. Therefore, to maximize the public health and scientific potential of our work, we propose to adapt the therapist-delivered VC-CBT to a computer-delivered format to facilitate reliable and economical dissemination of the VC-CBT while maintaining its established efficacy. The first phase of the work (Year 1) will be to adapt the 6-session therapist-delivered VC-CBT for delivery on an internet-based computer platform. This work will be done using a standard iterative process for developing e-content in partnership with local technology experts experienced in producing engaging and effective e-learning products. Approximately 24 patients (6 to test and supply feedback on each of three 2-session therapy modules and 6 to test and supply feedback on all 3 modules given together) will be employed in this phase. The second phase (Years 2 and 3) will be devoted to conducting an RCT to test the efficacy of the refined computer-delivered VC-CBT. We will randomize AUD treatment patients with co- occurring anxiety disorder to receive either the computer-delivered VC-CBT or standard AUD treatment alone (50 patients in each group) to establish significance and effect size estimates of clinical effect for the adapted e-therapy. In addition to analyzing the RCT data, we will perform quasi-experimental contrasts of the process and outcome measures from the computer-delivered VC-CBT group in the RCT with parallel data from the therapist-delivered VC-CBT obtained in an earlier clinical trial. These contrasts will provide a reasonable estimate of how well the computer format compares to the therapist format of the VC-CBT. The proposed work aims to provide an easy and inexpensive computer-delivered version of the VC-CBT that has comparable efficacy to the validated but resource-intensive therapist-delivered version. Achieving this will enable the VC- CBT therapy to benefit more AUD treatment patients and to be more easily studied by other investigators.  "
"9317819","Project Summary Tracheobronchomalacia is the most common congenital defect of the central airways and has been identified in up to 15% of infants and 30% of young children undergoing bronchoscopic examination for respiratory distress. Intrinsic weakness of the airway leads to collapse during expiration resulting in air trapping and poor gas exchange. These neonates and infants are typically treated with positive pressure ventilation where the positive pressure acts as a pneumatic stent. During the 3-9 month treatment period, the child remains connected to the ventilator and close monitoring is required to provide regular suctioning of the endotracheal tube. Even with suctioning, the inability to clear mucus increases the risk of airway infections, e.g., pneumonia. Alternatively, stents can be used to prevent airway collapse, however, existing airway stents are sized for adults. While some neonates have been treated with metal mesh vascular stents, these stents induce the growth of granulation tissue through the mesh requiring a very invasive removal procedure. To avoid this issue, solid silicone tubes have been developed for adults, but they too have shortcomings. They block mucociliary function over the length of the stent resulting in mucous plugging and inspissated secretions that impede gas exchange. They also have a high migration rate. The goal of this project is to create a stent technology for neonates and infants that avoids the risks and costs of positive pressure ventilation while providing five innovations. First, stent geometry will minimize impairment of the mucociliary function by providing an unobstructed path along the stent length following observed mucus streaming patterns. Second, stent design will also facilitate atraumatic removal. Third, reduction of stent migration will be addressed through design of the contact geometry between the stent and airway. Fourth, stent geometry will be optimized to minimize the amount of foreign material in contact with the airway while still providing support equivalent to ventilation. Fifth, an in vivo molding process will be developed that can quickly and inexpensively produce a customized stent inside a patient's airway. Personalized stents can be vital for neonates and infants given the variability in airway anatomy associated with tracheobronchomalacia and the impact of adjacent cardiovascular structures. Aim 1 addresses the first four innovations and will involve optimizing stent geometry and dimensions for two design concepts using analytical models as well as FEM. To provide for rapid evaluation, the optimized designs will be fabricated using standard techniques (silicone-coated NiTi) and tested through ex vivo and in vivo experiments in a porcine model. Aim 2 will develop the fifth innovation of in vivo molding of customized stents. The stent will be comprised of a flexible polymer shell filled with a liquid UV-curable polymer. It will be delivered over a balloon catheter that is inflated to press the stent against the airway wall. UV light will be transmitted through the balloon catheter to cure the liquid polymer to the shape of the airway. This technique will be developed for one of the optimized designs from Aim 1 and tested in ex vivo and in vivo experiments."
"9276014","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells use selective degradation of misfolded and intrinsically unstable proteins to maintain physiologically appropriate levels of functional proteins. Imbalances between intracellular protein folding and degradation cause severe human diseases, via excessive degradation of mutated proteins (e.g. cystic fibrosis, retinitis pigmentosa), or toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins that overwhelms cellular degradation capacity (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). A key gap in understanding of protein folding-degradation relationships and mechanisms is its current restriction to only water-soluble (cytosolic) proteins, whereas little is known about membrane proteins, despite their major physiological and pathogenic importance. This knowledge gap is mainly due to inherent difficulties of analyzing folding of membrane proteins within their native lipid bilayer environment. Based on our strong preliminary data and novel steric-trapping molecular tools, the long-term objective of this project is to elucidate molecular mechanisms and determinants of membrane protein degradation, by defining the molecular and quantitative relationships between intrinsic folding properties of membrane proteins, including global vs. local stability, unfolding rates, and hydrophobicity of transmembrane segments, and their degradation. We will use an innovative combined model consisting of the membrane- integrated ATP-dependent E. coli protease FtsH as model degradation machine, and the intramembrane protease GlpG from E. coli as model substrate, both of which are widely conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The aims are: 1) To develop new methodologies for determining the stability of membrane proteins in their native bilayers, by adapting our prior steric trapping innovations, supported by preliminary findings. 2) Because substrate unfolding is a prerequisite to degradation mediated by ATP-dependent proteases, using these new methods, we will elucidate how the perturbation of GlpG structure caused by the force generated by FtsH-mediated ATP hydrolysis drives its unfolding, including cooperativity mechanisms, and identify the conformation of the resultant unfolded state that is targeted for degradation. 3) To define the quantitative relationship between folding and degradation rates of GlpG, including the influences of conformational stability and hydrophobicity, by analyzing degradation in a series of variants. Outcomes of this research will provide quantitative methods for analyzing membrane protein folding, will advance fundamental understanding and current concepts of cellular quality control systems for membrane proteins based on their folding properties, and will inform progress towards new therapies for diseases caused by aberrant protein- folding."
"9404736","Abstract: The opioid dependence (OD) epidemic in the US affects a high proportion of women of reproductive age. OD impairs interpersonal interactions including parenting. Mothers with OD exhibit caregiving deficits leading to child maltreatment, high utilization of foster care, and intergenerational perpetuation of OD. Importance of maternal OD as treatment target is further increased because, unlike cocaine where abstinence is the goal, the recommended treatment for maternal OD is agonist maintenance, which entails continued exposure to exogenous opioids after remission. Yet, while opioid abuse and dependence are at an all time high, knowledge on the phenomenology and neurobiological correlates of maternal behaviors in OD is profoundly underrepresented in the literature. Infantile cues elicit motivation for caregiving in healthy people, even if they?re unrelated to the child. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show that this behavior may be conveyed by the mesocorticolimbic (MCL) system, which includes the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and mediates motivation and reward. ?Baby schema?, a set of juvenile features (e.g. large head and big eyes), is perceived as ?cute?, elicits motivation for caregiving, and parametrically activates the NAcc in healthy unrelated nulliparous women. These findings suggest that baby schema is what makes babies ?cute? and is the natural reinforcer that initiates caregiving behaviors through the MCL system. Preclinical data indicate that (1) endogenous opioids enable maintenance of social bonds including maternal attachment and (2) exogenous opioid agonists cause complex changes in maternal caregiving. Our preliminary data show reduced brain response to baby schema in heroin abusing women, suggesting that these preclinical observations may extend to humans. Our project will prospectively evaluate the brain response to baby schema as a probe of caretaking in mothers with babies who are enrolled in a methadone medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependence. Building on the limited largely preclinical data from multiple disciplines and our preliminary fMRI studies in healthy and OD women, we hypothesize that the baseline brain fMRI response to baby schema in OD mothers will be lower than in controls and predict quality of parenting and child development at a six-month follow up visit. These data would enable further research on the markers of vulnerability to caregiving deficits in OD mothers and science-based preventive interventions aimed at improving parenting skills in OD mothers, which could be extended to other substances. This high-risk research has the potential to change the current thinking and practice on the effects of opioid agonists on maternal behaviors, and is a timely contribution to the efforts to stem the ongoing opioid abuse epidemic."
"9423738","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect that is associated with a significant mortality rate. CDH newborns die largely because of insufficient lung function. Those that do survive are more susceptible to developing asthma and pulmonary hypertension. A popular view of the cause of CDH is that it arises from diaphragm malformations, which then allows abdominal organs into the chest, compressing the lung. We present data from mouse genetic models of CDH that demonstrate diaphragm-independent origins of disease. We propose to use these models to uncover the primary cause, trace disease progression, and identify novel nodes of the pathogenesis process where informed clinical interventions would increase survival and decrease morbidities."
"9507001","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem worldwide. Identifying modifiable risk factors is key in decreasing the incidence and associated economic burden of T2D. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of T2D. The fetal nutrient environment during pregnancy is as a major factor that modifies the risk for developing T2D. Studies from humans and animal models show robust associations between poor fetal growth and the development of T2D due to maternal malnutrition during pregnancy, which results from permanent changes in pancreatic ?-cell function and increases susceptibility to T2D. The overall research objective of this K01 proposal is to understand how maternal low-protein-diet during pregnancy (LP0.5) alters the offspring's ?-cell function and susceptibility to T2D and to identify the mechanistic link between LP0.5 and sensitivity to cellula stress dysregulation in chronic hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia conditions (glucolipotoxicity). The roles of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a nutrient-sensing protein and a key regulator of cellular stress responses, in LP0.5 ?-cell susceptibility to T2D will also be identified. Thus, th central hypothesis to be tested is that LP0.5 predisposes offspring to T2D by regulating OGT levels, which enhances the susceptibility of ?-cells to glucolipotoxicity-induced ER stress and cell death. Three specific aims will be carried out to test this hypothesis: 1) Identify the mechanisms of how LP0.5 ?-cell susceptibility to glucolipotoxicity; 2) Identify how OGT activity (enhanced O-GlcNAcylation) modulates ?-cell susceptibility to glucolipotoxicity-induced ER stress; and 3) Determine the extent to which gain of O-GlcNAcylation during pregnancy rescues the abnormalities induced by LP0.5. Based on preliminary data, the working hypothesis of these specific aims is that LP0.5 predisposes ?-cells to increased sensitivity to glucolipotoxicity by enhancing ER stress and cell death responses by regulating OGT activity. This hypothesis will be tested in vivo by subjecting LP0.5 mice to in vivo infusion of glucose and lipid. ?-cell functin, molecular markers of ER stress and cell death, and morphology of the ER will be assessed. The working hypothesis that enhancing O- GlcNAcylation during pregnancy will protect the offspring against T2D by inducing long-term gains in ?-cell mass and function will further show the importance of OGT in ¿-cell development and function. Thus, the metabolic profile and ?-cell phenotype of LP0.5 offspring exposed to a drug that enhances O-GlcNAcylation during gestation will be assessed in normal and diabetogenic conditions. These studies will fill significant gaps on the roles of OGT in ?-cell development and function and the pathogenesis of T2D and the results will have a significant impact on multiple levels. In the short-term, the generated data will identify the molecular mechanisms by which LP0.5 alters ?-cell development, impacting sensitivity to cellular stress and the susceptibility to T2D. The long-term objective is that these studies will aid in the development of drugs targeting OGT and dietary approaches to prevent T2D and other chronic diseases."
"9297087","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory information, such as a visual scene, is broken down (encoded) in the early visual pathway into features which increase in complexity before being tied together (decoded) in higher brain areas. The thalamocortical projection of the visual pathway is involved in encoding, such that neurons in the thalamic population transform the visual input very differently than neurons one synapse away in the input layers of visual cortex. We do not understand the underlying circuits that contribute to this transformation of visual input at the thalamocortical synapse. One complication is that cortical cells which receive direct thalamic input also receive input from other nearby cortical cells, so it is difficult to understand the role of the thalamic input. The goal of this proposal is to tease apart the thalamocortical circuit by simultaneous observation and manipulation of the pre and post-synaptic population, in the thalamus and cortex respectively. We propose two novel techniques to study single thalamocortical synapses and to isolate the contribution of the thalamic projection to response properties of cortical cells. In Aim 1, we will use simultaneous extracellular recordings of many LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus) cells with intracellular recording of a cortical cell to study synaptic connections. This will allow us to directly study the LGN population that converges onto a cortical cell. In Aim 2 we take advantage of this prep by adding dynamic clamp, which we use to create monosynaptic connections in vivo. Dynamic clamp is a method similar to current clamp, which allows the 'injection' of fixed conductances into a cell. We will generate the conductance that will be injected to the cortical cell by by triggering synaptic conductance injections based on the spike time of a population of LGN cells. We can select this population and manipulate their spiking output in desired ways. We will also ensure that the cortical cell only receives visual input from the conductance injections. This allows us to study the response properties of the cortical cell as  a function of the properties of the input thalamic population. Collectively, these studies will define several important but unknown properties of thalamocortical synapses and will test several existing hypotheses regarding visual encoding, leading to improved understanding of visual processing."
"9266399","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the US is disproportionately high among minority women. In order to participate as partners in healthcare, DM patients need self-management education and support. Diabetes self-management (DSM) support is effective in helping DM patients make good choices and achieve clinical goals but is difficult to deliver in medical practice settings. Virtual reality technology can assist DM patient and their clinical teams with DSM support by providing effective educational tools in an engaging, learner-centered context that fosters self-efficacy and skill proficiency. Our prior work demonstrated that virtual worlds, like Second Life (SL), are suitable for supporting DSM education for patients. SL, an Internet-based virtual world, is an example of an immersive, three-dimensional environment which supports social networking and interaction with information. We now aim to enhance our curriculum using a medical group visit design to study whether the Women in Control virtual world group medical visit leads to similarly effective health and educational outcomes compared to face-to-face group medical visits. Our aims are to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of the comparative effectiveness of a virtual world DSM group medical visit format vs. a face-to-face DSM group visit format to increase physical activity and improve glucose control among Black/African American and Hispanic women with uncontrolled DM at six month follow up, and to conduct a qualitative, ethnographic study of participant engagement with the virtual world platform during the virtual world group sessions, between group sessions, and following completion of the eight-week curriculum to characterize learners' self-directed interactions with the technology platform and assess the correlation of these interactions with DSM behaviors and diabetes control."
"9402522","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Presentation of cues involved in prior learning can elicit retrieval of memory for the learning. Retrieved memories are unstable before they are reconsolidated back into long-term storage. While unstable, the memories can be disrupted such that behaviors previously supported by the memories are significantly altered or eradicated. Drug addiction is multidetermined but one major etiological factor in the development and maintenance of addictive behavior is drug-associated memories, which form as a consequence of frequent pairings between drug-associated cues and drug administration. A growing body of basic neuroscience research suggests that administration of the ?-adrenergic antagonist propranolol contiguous with cue-elicited retrieval of memory for drug reinforced learning can lead to disruption of reconsolidation (DoR) as indicated by attenuation/elimination of drug-reinforced behavior(s). We recently completed a NIDA funded-R21 showing, for the first time in cocaine dependent (CD) persons, that administration of 40 mg propranolol vs. placebo following a single session of cocaine cue exposure or CCE (i.e., exposure to cocaine cues/paraphernalia in a laboratory setting) resulted in substantially attenuated craving and cue reactivity during a test session of CCE performed 24 hours later. A test session of CCE 1 week later revealed only trend level evidence of craving attenuation in the propranolol vs. placebo group. Although insufficiently powered to do so, we preliminarily examined cocaine use during the 1-week follow-up period. The propranolol treated participants did report a greater reduction in dollar amount of cocaine used, but this difference was not statistically significant. While thes findings are encouraging, the essential next step in the development of a DoR-based treatment is to enhance the response dampening 'signal' detected in the R21 and assess its durability, generalizability and effects on cocaine use. We will attempt to augment the DoR effect by (a) doubling the number of propranolol- medicated retrieval sessions of CCE, and (b) increasing the dose of propranolol. Accordingly, 3 groups of CD participants will receive two sessions of CCE, each separated by a 24 hr. period and both conducted while the participants remain in hospital. One group (PBO) will receive placebo following each CCE session while the second (40PP) and third (80PP) group will receive 40 mg and 80 mg propranolol, respectively. Participants will return two days, and 1, 3, and 6 weeks after discharge and will be administered a CCE session to assess for maintenance/generalization of DoR effects on craving and cue reactivity to familiar and novel cocaine cues. Participants will also be assessed 3 times weekly for cocaine use (self-report & urine drug screen) during follow-up. It is expected that groups 40PP and 80PP, relative to PBO, will evidence greater attenuation of craving, cue reactivity and cocaine use during follow-up. Also, these effects will be greater in group 80PP than 40PP. Confirmation of these expectations will set the stage for a clinical trial where the outcome enhancing properties of this novel pharmacy-behavior therapy could be systematically evaluated."
"9310383","Project Summary: This project aims to develop a novel non-invasive technique, coherent hemodynamics spectroscopy (CHS), for the local measurement of brain perfusion and autoregulation at the microvascular level. This new technique consists of three components: (1) An experimental method based on diffuse near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to non-invasively collect brain perfusion data at the microcirculation level; (2) Mild perturbations in the systemic mean arterial pressure to evoke oscillations or transients in the cerebral hemodynamics; (3) The application of a new hemodynamic model to translate NIRS measurements of cerebral hemodynamics into measurements of physiological and functional quantities. Specifically, this proposal focuses on CHS measurements of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) and capillary transit time (CTT), which yields absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF). The capability of CHS to measure local CTT, CBF, and dCA will be capitalized by developing spatially-resolved CHS (for brain mapping) and depth-resolved CHS (for discrimination of extracerebral and brain tissues). We plan clinical tests at two units at the Tufts Medical Center, namely the dialysis unit and the neurological critical care unit, to demonstrate the clinical potential of CHS. The first clinical test, on diabetic hemodialysis patients, aims to validate CHS measurements of CBF and dCA in a comparative study with age-matched healthy controls, and to demonstrate the potential of CHS to detect a reduction in cerebral perfusion during hemodialysis. The second clinical test, on patients who suffered from aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), will directly test the clinical potential of CHS in monitoring cerebral perfusion and autoregulation deficits. The broad objective of this application is the development of a new tool for the quantitative, non-invasive assessment of local cerebrovascular hemodynamics at the microcirculation level. CHS offers a significant clinical potential as a result of its ability to non-invasively assess and monitor brain tissue perfusion, which is impaired in a variety of clinical conditions, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, hemodialysis treatment, ischemic stroke, and cardiopulmonary bypass."

"9293903","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With over 2000 deaths each year in the United States, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains a leading cause of death in infants under 1 year of age. In order to reach the ultimate goal of the NICHD to eradicate this emotionally devastating syndrome, it is vital to understand the underlying etiologies and pathogenesis of this multifactorial syndrome. However, the fundamental causes of SIDS remain poorly understood. Underlying genetic susceptibility for sudden death, involving genetic determinants of the central nervous system and serotonergic signaling, immune dysfunction, metabolism/energy pathway, nicotine response, and cardiac repolarization, may represent pathogenic substrates for infant vulnerability in accordance with the SIDS triple risk hypothesis for a significant number of SIDS cases. The genetics of SIDS is most likely multigenic and complex yet there has been no studies performed to elucidate the global genetic load. Through the use of monumental technological advances in genomic research, including array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation whole- exome DNA sequencing (WES), it is our broad objective to perform the first whole genome interrogation of one of the world's largest assembled, multi-ethnic SIDS cohorts (n=625; 303 Caucasian, 203 African American, 96 Hispanic, 14 Asian, and 9 mixed race) in order 1) to explore the novel concept of increased radical de novo mutation (DNM) rate among SIDS victims as a paradigm shift in explaining the paradoxical sustained world-wide prevalence of SIDS by performing aCGH and WES on SIDS case-parent trios, 2) to establish the spectrum, prevalence, and biological pathway involvement of copy number variations (CNV) as an underlying genetic susceptibility for SIDS, and 3) to establish a Genetic Blueprint of Infant Vulnerability across multiple disciplines using WES and pathway/network analysis of genes identified with rare non-synonymous genetic variants, to ascertain whether specific SIDS-associated molecular biological pathways (i.e. serotonergic pathways, immune response deficiencies, cardiac repolarization abnormalities, etc.) or signaling networks are predominantly effected. The proposed experiments will test our three-fold hypothesis that 1) rare DNMs with clear functional significance will be identified in novel SIDS-susceptibility genes and pathways and the underlying DNM rate, defined as the ratio of non-synonymous (NS) to synonymous DNMs, and the ratio of nonsense to missense DNMs in SIDS will exceed the ratio previously established in healthy living subjects, 2) a significant number of SIDS cases are due to rare CNVs typified as deletions and/or duplications of DNA segments of e 1kilobase in length that alter either imbalances of dosage or disruption of neurodevelopmental, CNS signaling, metabolic, immunologic, and/or cardiac channelopathic genes, and 3) rare genetic variants in SIDS will be over-dispersed to genes comprising SIDS-susceptibility pathways with classical (2 to 4 months of age) SIDS cases harboring an increase burden of rare variants in a neurodevelopmental pathways while non-classical (<2 months or > 4 months) SIDS cases will harbor an increased burden of rare variants in metabolic, immunologic, or channelopathic pathway(s)."
"9301696","ABSTRACT The adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells has produced remarkable clinical results in patients with viral disease. However, broader implementation of this therapy has been limited by the (i) prohibitive production costs, (ii) complexity of manufacture, (iii) prolonged time for preparation and product release, and (iv) the requirement for individualized, patient-specific products. Over the past 6 years we have systematically addressed these problems: we simplified and refined our manufacturing technology, removed biohazardous components and employed a new cell expansion platform using a gas permeable culture device which promotes the proliferation and survival of large cell numbers in a GMP-compliant closed system with minimal technician intervention. Finally, we have established the clinical benefit associated with the infusion of partially HLA matched virus-specific T cells that are prospectively generated and banked, making them available for immediate ?off the shelf? use.  Thus, with the purpose of moving beyond highly specialized academic centers we established a Baylor College of Medicine-affiliated company called ViraCyte with the goal of commercializing ?off the shelf? virus- specific T cells. Our product - Viralym-B - is a bank of T cell lines with specificity for BK virus, which, in immunocompromised individuals including children, is responsible for severe clinical syndromes like hemorragic cystitis and nephropathy that can lead to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. Our therapy is intended for the treatment of drug-resistant infections/disease, a condition that afflicts less than 200,000 persons in the United States and for which there is no standard of care. Thus, in the current application we will test the safety and potential for anti-viral activity of Viralym-B in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In addition, we will further de-risk the transfer of this technology to a private sector contract manufacturing organization (CMO) by transitioning our cell production from an open to an entirely closed system and validating our scale-up manufacture protocol. Success of this application will lay the foundation for a Phase IIb study to confirm the efficacy of ?off the shelf? Viralym-B cells and facilitate market approval, thereby moving T cell therapy for BK virus into the public domain as a standard of care."
"9296178","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year millions of children are faced with the severe consequences associated with war and political conflict. Although it is well established that children exposed to war are at increased risk for the development of mental health problems, some children show remarkable psychological resilience. Vulnerability and resilience to war-related experiences have been associated with a variety of risk and protective factors across different levels of analysis including social, psychological, and biological factors. However, not much is known regarding the dynamic interplay between these factors, particularly how environmental factors interact with biological systems in the prediction of risk and resilience. The proposed research will advance the field by investigating the biological underpinnings of individual differences in refugee children's response to acute war-related trauma exposure. Applying a modern multilevel perspective, the study aims to explore the intricate interplay between psychosocial, neuroendocrine, epigenetic, and genetic factors in the prediction of risk and resilience related to the experience of war in 1,000 8-16 year old Syrian refugee children (and their primary caregivers) in Lebanon. Besides questionnaire and interview data, we will also collect cheek swabs (for DNA) and hair samples (for cortisol and other stress- related hormones) applying recruitment strategies that proved highly successful in a recent study conducted by the Lebanon-based collaborators. Overcoming limitations of existing work, we will take into account both maladaptive and adaptive outcomes in response to both risk and protective factors and investigate the development of resilience over the period of 12 months in a subsample of 650 children. The proposed interdisciplinary project includes research groups in the UK and Lebanon and has the following research aims:  1. Examine epigenetic, endocrine, and genetic differences between resilient and vulnerable children  2. Investigate genetic moderation of trauma exposure (gene-environment interaction)  3. Examine associations between environmental factors and genome-wide DNA methylation  4. Investigate the effects of protective factors on adaptive outcomes  5. Examine the development of refugee children's psychological resilience over time. A better understanding of how social, psychological, and biological factors contribute to the mental health of refugee children will be important in order t better protect war-affected children from the negative effects of political conflict and displacement and to promote their psychological resilience. In addition, the proposed project will elucidate more generally how environmental influences get under the skin, particularly, how risk and protective factors exert their effects on psychological outcomes through biological pathways and processes."
"9425319","Abstract Opioids, such as heroin and morphine, have been shown to cause abnormalities in the functioning of immune cells and to render these cells more ?susceptible? to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection. In addition, heroin, morphine, and other intravenous opiate drugs may accelerate/amplify the neurotoxic mechanisms of HIV that lead to the development of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), even in the presence of antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV positive opiate users undergo cycles of withdrawal, which could modify several cellular mechanisms that negatively impact synaptic repair. Few studies have addressed the neurotoxic effects of opioid withdrawal in conjunction with HIV and their mechanisms. Our preliminary data indicate that these mechanisms may include the proliferation of pro-inflammatory (e.g. M1-like) microglia. Therefore, we propose to test the hypothesis that opiate withdrawal, through proliferation of reactive microglia, augments the neurotoxic property of the HIV protein gp120. To test this hypothesis, we will examine whether morphine withdrawal accelerates neuronal degeneration observed in gp120 transgenic mice and whether methadone reverses this effect. Other experiments will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby withdrawal is neurotoxic. To this end, we will examine the hypothesis that morphine withdrawal promotes microglia proliferation by increasing colony-stimulating factor 1, a chemokine that regulates the proliferation of adult microglia. The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish whether the neurotoxic effects of HIV could be managed in opioid abusers by reducing the cycles of opioid withdrawal. These studies are of high significance since they could elucidate a novel mechanism contributing to HAND in drug abusers. A better understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel and more effective drug therapies to delay HAND."
"9367311","Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence. Using contemporary multimodal therapies, more than 75% of patients with localized RMS are cured However, patients with recurrent disease experience 5-year survival rates of only 30%, and this outcome has not significantly improved in more than 20 years. Over the past 6 years, comprehensive genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and drug-sensitivity profiling of RMS has been completed and integrated into a central database (iRDb). In addition, a multidisciplinary RMS translational research team (RMS-TRT) has been assembled to use the iRDb to identify tumor vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. Three signaling pathways have been identified that appear to be vulnerable to novel molecular-targeted regimens, which have shown promise in laboratory studies. In this proposal, comprehensive preclinical testing of those regimens (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, imaging and efficacy studies) will be performed to determine the most effective treatment. The results from these studies will be used to design the next RMS clinical trial at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Therefore, the successful completion of the Aims presented here will directly affect human health. One unique and innovative aspect of this proposal is the Childhood Solid Tumor Network (CSTN), a website (http://www.stjude.org/CSTN/) through which all of the iRDb data are shared freely with the international biomedical research community with no obligation to collaborate. The majority (>95%) of the data available through the CSTN is unpublished, but all of it is shared to accelerate discovery and advance cures for pediatric cancer. To date, 314 requests from 122 investigators at 46 institutions across 11 countries have been fulfilled. I have a proven record of moving basic science discoveries into clinical trials and then sharing findings with the national and international research communities to affect the greatest change in global human health. No other center has the team, resources, expertise, or tools available to perform the studies presented here and efficiently move the most promising findings directly into a clinical trial."
"9249575","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic mutations are major causes of renal disease, but the underlying mechanisms of many renal diseases caused by specific mutations remain largely unknown. A highly efficient model system that could be used to identify renal genes, to recapitulate disease-causing genetic mutations, and to serve as a primitive drug testing platform will be highly valuable and significant for the renal disease research field. We have developed a genetic screen for renal function in Drosophila, and identified hundreds of genes required for filtration and protein reabsorption. Most of these genes are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans, and many of them have been linked to renal disease. These genes encode proteins in a variety of biological processes and renal-specific structures, including slit diaphragm components, glomerular basement membrane components, membrane receptors, actin cytoskeletons, TRP channels, vesicle trafficking molecules, myosin and dynein motors, transcription factors and the Coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis pathways. Our findings demonstrated that the genetic control of key renal function such as filtration and protein reabsorption is evolutionarily conserved and Drosophila can be used as a model system to study the genetic mechanism of renal disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop specific renal disease models using Drosophila and to establish Drosophila as a primitive drug testing platform for specific genetic renal disease. In Aim 1, we will use the CoQ pathway as a proof-of-principle to demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the new model to identify novel genes required for renal function, to generate the exact recapitulation of human disease mutations, and to test a known drug that could cure specific genetic renal disease in Drosophila. In Aim 2, we will study the disease mechanism of two novel renal genes (RhoGDI and KANK2) that were both identified from our genetic screen and the human patient exon sequencing from our collaborator. We will generate Drosophila renal disease models for these novel genes and test a collection of chemical inhibitors to identify a potential drug to treat patients with genetic mutations in related pathway. The set of experiments outlined in this proposal have broad significance not only for understanding and treatment of these specific rare genetic renal diseases, but also could be highly applicable to any kinds of renal disease with a genetic cause."
"9269572","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocyte transplantation has been proposed as a cellular therapy for patients with inherited metabolic disorders of the liver. However, hepatocyte transplantation has several shortcomings that limit its clinical application. These limitations include a shortage and inconsistent supply of transplantable hepatocytes and a life-long dependence on immunosuppression after transplantation. We hypothesize that screenable inborn errors of metabolism, such as Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1 (HT1), can be treated by an individualized approach involving ex vivo gene therapy and in vivo cell transplantation. Our approach is individualized since the patient's own cells may be used in the treatment. In our initial proof of concept studies, mature human hepatocytes and less mature hepatocyte-like cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells will be evaluated. These human cells will be expanded in a novel, genetically engineered large animal (pig) possessing homozygote mutations of two genes: 1) fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH-/-), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in tyrosine metabolism; 2) recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2-/-) to produce severe immunodeficiency. FAH deficiency causes functional instability in effected hepatocytes and results in a selective milieu for robust expansion of normal (FAH+) donor hepatocytes. Rejection of FAH+ human cells in immunodeficient FAH-/- RAG2-/- pigs will be further prevented by fetal tolerization, transplanting donor cells in utero prior to immune development. We postulate that in utero cell transplantation will also provide a more natural fetal environment for differentiation of iPS-derived hepatocyte-like cells. One or more injection(s) of donor cells wll be performed postnatally to enhance engraftment. Tapered use of the protective drug, 2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl-1,3- cyclohexanedione (NTBC), will allow robust expansion of transplanted cells in FAH- deficient pigs. These proof-of-concept studies performed in a large animal model of HT1 will provide a foundation for hepatocyte transplantation as an individualized treatment of screenable inborn errors of liver metabolism."

There is no cure, and the few available treatments have limited efficacy. Therefore, novel molecular targets and new therapies are urgently needed. The hallmark of tauopathy is the accumulation of tau, a microtubule-associated protein, in the brain, leading to progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Tau accumulation in brain regions coincides with areas of glucose hypometabolism, implicating metabolic dysregulation in those areas, and metabolic disorders such as type2 diabetes increase the risk of developing AD. However, it is unclear which signaling pathways are critically involved in metabolic dysregulation in tauopathy brains, whether they contribute to neurodegeneration, and what the underlying molecular mechanisms are. In preliminary studies, I discovered that AMPK?a key energy sensor and regulator in cells?is dysregulated in tauopathy animals, which might contribute to the accumulation of pathogenic tau. This study aims to use multidisciplinary approaches to elucidate how metabolic dysregulation modulates tau-mediated neurodegeneration, focusing on defining the mechanistic role of AMPK in tauopathy models. Specifically, I will determine whether AMPK regulates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in tauopathy mouse models (Aim 1) and dissect the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of AMPK (Aim 2). Based on my preliminary research, I will test the hypothesis that AMPK protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration by a) inhibiting p300-induced tau acetylation and b) enhancing autophagy, in mouse and fly models. I will assess how metabolic changes effect AMPK- p300/autophagy pathways and tau pathology in tauopathy brain (Aim 3). Finally, I will perform a genetic screen in Drosophila to identify novel genes and pathways that regulate metabolic deficits in tauopathy animals, and investigate the roles of these regulators in tau-mediated neurodegeneration (Aim 4). In the mentored phase, I will continue to use fly genetics and in vitro and in vivo tauopathy models, and acquire additional skills in mouse genetic models and metabolic characterization. This training I receive will enable me to complete the proposed studies and launch an independent research laboratory within 2 years. Completion of my proposed studies will provide a proof of concept for targeting AMPK pathway for tauopathy treatment, and enable me to establish a working system beginning from identification of new regulators of tau-dependent metabolic deficits and neurodegeneration, to mechanistic studies using multi-disciplinary approaches, to provide basis formulating new therapeutic strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The K99/R00 mechanism will provide the support necessary to advance my goal of successfully establishing an NIH R01-funded, independent laboratory to study metabolic regulation of neurodegeneration."
"9494830","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is among the deadliest cancers worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of ~30% in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and ~50% in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). It is a rare cancer, affecting ~8,500 (5,500 ICC, 3000 ECC) patients in the U.S. each year. Often cancers develop from an imbalance between signals that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. While most advances in cancer therapy have been made by inhibition of cell proliferation, the re-establishment of cell differentiation has resulted in the cure of certain forms of leukemia. In this proposal, we will focus on the interaction between hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4?), the master regulator of hepatic differentiation, and the Wnt/?- catenin signaling pathway, which enhances cell proliferation. We will use zebrafish for our studies, which has advantages as a model organism because of in vivo imaging, time resolution, and chemical screening methods not available or feasible in rodent models. Importantly, zebrafish display disease morphology and pathophysiology that is similar to mammals. We hypothesize that an HNF4?/?-catenin interaction is important in hepatobiliary development playing an important role cell fate during both development and cholangiocarcinoma formation. Our first aim is to characterize and define the importance of HNF4?/?-catenin interaction in regard to hepatobiliary development. We have recently generated novel HNF4? knockout zebrafish and are in the process of generating a heat shock-inducible HNF4? over-expression zebrafish. These models will allow us to not only define the role of HNF4? in hepatobiliary development, but, in combination with genetic and pharmacologic models of Wnt/?-catenin modulation, will allow us to characterize an interaction between these two pathways. We will use these mutants and and chemical modulators to characterize liver growth, morphology, and physiology during hepatobiliary development and assess perturbations in normal hepatic and biliary cell fate. Our second aim is to determine a role for the HNF4?/?- catenin interaction in cholangiocarcinoma formation. We will first characterize tumor incidence, progression, and mortality in zebrafish with mutations resulting in dysregulation of the HNF4?/?-catenin pathway. Further, we will utilize both genetic and pharmacologic means to re-establish a normal HNF4?/?-catenin interaction and observe changes in tumor burden. These studies will not only reveal novel mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma pathogenesis, but also will allow us to develop new targets for therapeutic development for this devastating disease."
"9270015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance and a relative deficiency of insulin secretion. T2D affects ~300 million people worldwide, >25 million in the US alone. 27% of Americans aged e60y suffer from T2D. T2D incidence and prevalence are increasing rapidly. In the US alone, medical costs of diabetes in 2012 were estimated at $176 billion, ~10% of US health care costs. The increasing number of younger T2D cases amplifies the socioeconomic impact of T2D and increases the urgency with which we must act to identify causes and new treatments. The goal of the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study is to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D and that are responsible for variability in T2D-related QTs. Improved understanding of the genetic basis of T2D and related QTs has the potential to reduce the impact of the T2D epidemic by supporting identification of novel drugs and therapies, enabling better targeting of drugs and therapies, and providing more accurate T2D risk prediction. In this proposal, we propose to (1) discover genetic loci and variants that influence T2D risk and variability in T2D-related QTs using association studies based on GWAS and sequence data with increasing emphasis on low-frequency and rare variants; (2) identify muscle and adipose tissue regulatory elements that increase risk of T2D and contribute to variation in related QTs by molecularly characterizing muscle and adipose biopsy samples from 324 individuals from across the glucose tolerance spectrum; and (3) identify the likely causal genes (and other functional units) and disease mechanisms at known T2D and QT loci through genotype-based callback detailed phenotyping in appropriately consented individuals with likely high-impact variants and in non-carrier controls. These efforts will contribute to improved understanding of the etiology of T2D, and have the potential to point the way to novel methods of treatment and prevention. Methods developed and lessons learned in the FUSION study will be useful in the study of other complex genetic diseases."
"9283293","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal application seeks to continue a project on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As part of the funded project we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) on our case-control sample that has contributed to the identification of multiple novel loci for AD as part of national and internationl collaborations. In addition to GWASs, we also performed several association studies on candidate genes that resulted in >50 publications during the current grant period. Confirmed loci identified for AD risk using the case-control association design account for only ~30% of the phenotypic variance. An alternative approach focusing on AD quantitative phenotypes/endophenotypes may help to identify additional genes for AD, as this approach can be more powerful than using the binary case-control design. As part of our preliminary data for this renewal, we have completed GWASs on four AD-related phenotypes: deposition of Aß in the brain measured by amyloid imaging, short-term disease progression measured by change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score over 12 months, disease progression measured by time to reach MMSE 9 score (indicator of moderate to severe AD), and survival time in AD. We have identified novel loci for each AD- related phenotype. Using pathway analysis we have also identified multiple potentially novel candidate genes in the networks of GWAS-implicated genes. Since GWAS arrays use an indirect approach that relies on linkage disequilibrium to detect association signals, rarely are the identified significant variants the causal variants. Thu, it is important to resequence the candidate gene regions implicated by GWASs and those that participate in their networks in order to characterize the full spectrum of common, low-frequency and rare causal variants associated with AD-related phenotypes. The objective of this renewal application is to perform targeted resequencing of selected top gene regions implicated by GWASs and additional candidate genes in the networks of GWAS-implicated genes in order to identify causal variants associated with four AD-related phenotypes. Replication of significant variants obtained in the discovery stage will be sought in independent sets of replication samples. Finally, we will examine the functional nature of the identified significant variants usin bioinformatics tools and brain gene expression data. The successful completion of the proposed comprehensive studies will likely lead to the identification of new AD-related genes/variants."
"9278059","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria are multi-faceted organelles in eukaryotic cells that stand at the nexus of energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Consequently, circumstances (genetics, environmental factors, aging) that result in mitochondrial dysfunction disrupt a multitude of cellular processes that can cause human disease pathology, ranging from heart, skeletal muscle and nerve dysfunction to diabetes, blindness, and deafness. Of course, a major function of mitochondria is to generate ATP through the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). ATP is the main energy currency in cells and tissues that require sustained energy production to perform their physiological function (e.g. muscle, nerves, and major organs such as heart and brain). Mitochondria contain a DNA genome (mtDNA), which in humans encodes thirteen essential protein components of the mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes and is maternally inherited. Knowledge of the unique mechanism of human mtDNA expression is essential to understand how this important cellular organelle functions and contributes to human diseases and age-related pathology. While defining the core factors and mechanisms required has advanced significantly through the efforts of my lab and others, only a handful of mitochondrial factors involved in events downstream of transcription initiation in human mitochondria have been characterized to date and their mechanisms of action are largely unknown. These significant gaps in our knowledge of human mitochondrial gene expression are addressed in this competitive renewal proposal through the following three specific aims: 1) To determine how altering mitochondrial gene expression affects metabolism and provides resistance to diet-induced obesity using the Tfam+/- mouse model, 2) To determine the mechanism of transcriptional activation of free mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12, and 3) To dissect the multiple functions of the Leigh Syndrome protein LRP130 in transcription and post-transcriptional processes in human mitochondria. Altogether the proposed studies are part of a larger continuum and strategy over the last 15 years on this project in my lab, which is to 1) identify new factors involved in human mitochondrial gene regulation, 2) determine their mechanism of action, and 3) to study how they influence cellular physiology and metabolism and contribute to human disease using mouse models. In the current proposal, Aim I is at stage 3 of this process (in vivo studies in mice/disease relevance), while Aims II and III are at stage 2 (determining mechanisms of action of new factors), but also employ a novel strategy for identifying new key players in this important process (i.e. stage 1). Knowledge gained from these studies holds therapeutic promise for mitochondrial disease and age-related pathology based on augmenting mitochondrial gene expression and directly addresses the human disorders obesity and Leigh Syndrome."
"9296199","PROJECT ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of disability, with an estimated 795,000 cases in the US each year. As many as 70% of patients who suffer a stroke exhibit long-term impairment in upper extremity motor function. The development of rehabilitative strategies to improve the recovery of motor function is of key importance. Neuroplasticity is believed to support recovery after stroke; therefore, manipulations that enhance plasticity may increase recovery. Stimulation of the vagus nerve during motor training drives robust, specific neuroplasticity in rat motor cortex. Recent evidence indicates that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) delivered during rehabilitative training significantly improves recovery of forelimb function in multiple models of stroke, but the mechanisms underlying VNS-dependent enhancement of recovery are not defined. The cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulatory systems are engaged by VNS and represent potential pathways through which VNS may support recovery. We propose to delineate the neuromodulatory pathways and mechanisms by which VNS acts to increase recovery of forelimb motor function after stroke. The first aim of the study will determine whether the cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are required for VNS-dependent enhancement of recovery after stroke. The second aim of the study will evaluate whether direct stimulation of the cholinergic or noradrenergic systems during rehabilitative training is sufficient to enhance recovery. The third aim of the proposal will examine whether anatomical reorganization in descending motor networks is enhanced by VNS therapy to support functional recovery. The results of the proposed experiments will delineate the neuromodulatory pathways and mechanisms by which VNS paired with rehabilitative training enhances recovery after stroke. Insights from these studies will help to determine whether common disease-related and pharmacological factors that influence these neuromodulatory systems may interfere with the beneficial effects of VNS. Ultimately, results from this study will improve the likelihood of successful translation of VNS therapy for stroke patients."
"9274969","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the data coordinating center's grant proposal for the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial- Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART). The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will be housed in the College of Optometry at The Ohio State University. The CITT-ART is a multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence insufficiency (Cl) on reading performance and attention in children. In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic convergence insufficiency will be randomly assigned to: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy with home reinforcement. After 16 weeks of treatment, examiners masked to treatment group assignment will administer the primary outcome measures for: 1) reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest and 2) attention (Strengths & Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]). The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Other secondary outcome measures include: a test of reading fluency (WIATT III), the SNAP test of attention, the CI Symptom Survey, clinical measures of CI (i.e., near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near), and assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension (pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension). Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention will be assessed 1-year post treatment. This application provides the rationale for the design of the clinical trial ad a description of the goals and responsibilities of the DCC. This proposal also includes some results from previous studies performed by the core members of the CITT planning committee including personnel from the DCC.  Symptomatic CI is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of CI treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9332496","PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Kentucky (UK) Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) proposes to establish a Career Development Core to build upon the current KL2 program, which is in its fifth year of NIH support. The current program provides two to three years of release time (75% effort) and research funding support for mentored career development designed to accelerate academic growth of the next generation of clinical and translational scholars. This program has garnered strong institutional support with notable scholar productivity; in five years, two NIH-supported training slots have been expanded to six slots. All eight program graduates have each made important contributions to science through research and have successfully competed for extramural funding, seven as PIs. The current KL2 cohort consists of six scholars. The scholar program supports career development across the full spectrum of clinical and translational science, including translational, clinical, community/policy studies and novel methodology development (e.g., biomedical informatics) focusing on a broad array of health topics. Scholars and mentors represent a wide range of colleges and disciplines, including Medicine, Nursing, Health Sciences, Public Health, Education, Engineering and Arts & Sciences (Health Psychology). To build on these achievements, this new program requests NIH support for four KL2 scholars. The training of three additional institutionally sponsored early-career scholars will be integrated with these NIH-supported scholars to establish a cohort of seven scholars. The foundation of the proposed program will continue to be practical research experiences within interdisciplinary teams guided by experienced mentors. In addition, to prepare future leaders of the evolving academic discipline of Clinical and Translational Research (CTR), new efforts designed to promote program excellence are proposed. They include: 1) new Faculty Oversight and Workforce Integration Committee structures; 2) use of educational technology to develop vigorous yet efficient new competency programs designed to strengthen the foundational training for future leaders in CTR; and 3) developing a new institutionally sponsored Clinical Scientist Pipeline Program targeting residents, fellows and early career clinical faculty to provide a stronger linking of our successful undergraduate and early faculty career training programs. These initiatives are designed to accelerate the career development of future leaders of the biomedical research workforce who will be prepared to address today's complex research challenges and spearhead advances in human health."
"9265150","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year millions of Americans are diagnosed with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and various forms of cancer. In concert with environmental variation, risk for these diseases is controlled by large, heterogeneous sets of genetic factors. By characterizing those genes that increase risk, the biomedical community can describe the molecular pathways involved in human health and disease, ultimately enabling the rational design of novel treatments. Unfortunately, progress towards identifying the catalog of genetic risk alleles has been slow. Despite our ability to carry out massive population-based case-control genetic association studies in humans, only a tiny fraction of causative sites are known for any given complex disease.  Over the last few years several groups, including ourselves, have been exploring the utility of advanced generation, multiparental mapping panels for routine, powerful, and high-resolution dissection of complex trait variation in model genetic systems (e.g., the mouse Collaborative Cross, the rat NIH heterogeneous stock, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, or DSPR). Model systems exhibit similar genetic, cellular, physiological, and behavioral processes to humans, and offer a complementary avenue for obtaining insight into the factors that underlie complex trait variation. We successfully developed the DSPR during the first period of grant funding, and provide this as a freely-available community resource for the genetic dissection of trait variation in flies. Our project delivered a framework that can map causative variants to small genomic intervals, and has the power to map rare variants, and genes that harbor multiple causative alleles, both of which human association studies struggle to interrogate. Here we will continue to extend our work developing the DSPR as a powerful set of enabling resources for the Drosophila biomedical community.  First, we will employ long-read, high-throughput sequencing to generate genome assemblies for all lines founding the DSPR. These novel assemblies will allow us to identify structural, and copy number variants in the lines, complementing our existing data to provide the complete catalog of segregating variation in the DSPR. Second, we will carry out genomewide gene expression profiling on multiple tissues for a large set of lines, allowing us to identify genes contributing to expression variation. Additionally, we will identify regions of the genome likely t recruit regulatory proteins. Integrating these datasets will facilitate the detection of causative, regulatory variants, which are thought to contribute significantly to trait variation. Finally, buiding on our considerable success mapping loci underlying biomedically-relevant trait variation in the DSPR, we will carry out extremely large-scale phenotyping screens for two traits in a testcross design (crossing each DSPR line to a set of unrelated strains). This work will allow us to detail the degree to which mapped loci have effects that are dependent on the genetic background of the mapping population. These results will have important implications for the design of mapping experiments in model systems."
"9380211","Obese and type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients have a high incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a continuum of chronic liver diseases ranging from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Because of its strong association with the obesity epidemic, NAFLD is rapidly becoming a major public health concern in western societies. Surprisingly, there are no FDA approved NAFLD therapies; and current therapies treat the co-morbidities associated with NAFLD, viz., obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, & hypertension. Our focus is on prevention of NAFLD and stopping its progression to NASH. We developed a preclinical Ldlr-/- mouse model of western diet (WD)-induced NASH. High fat-high sucrose diets, like the WD, have been implicated in promoting the obesity epidemic. Our preclinical model recapitulates the features seen in the metabolic syndrome (MetS)-NASH patient, i.e., obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hepatosteatosis, systemic and hepatic inflammation & hepatic fibrosis. The key premise of this application is that there is a causal link between hepatic C20-22 ?3 PUFA content and the onset and progression of NASH. This premise is based on the following research from our lab: 1) WD induced NASH is associated with hepatic depletion of C20-22 ?3 PUFA and bioactive ?3 PUFA-derived oxidized lipids (oxylipins); findings that parallel recent reports on NASH patients; 2) repletion of hepatic C20-22 ?3 PUFA and oxylipins with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6,?3) supplementation prevents NASH and stops its progression; 3) New evidence shows that DHA attenuates WD-mediated induction of key NASH pathways [SREBP1, NF?B, TGF?-Smad3, Notch, Hedgehog (Hh) and osteopontin (Opn)]; and 4) more New evidence shows that ?6-PUFA-derived, but not ?3-PUFA-derived, oxylipins augment TGF? induction of a key fibrosis marker (smActin) in human hepatic stellate cells. Thus, DHA and its oxylipin derivatives regulate multiple NASH-linked pathways. We are well-positioned to uncover the metabolic and molecular basis for DHA-mediated suppression of NASH using our preclinical Ldlr -/- mouse model. Our goal is to provide the mechanistic foundation for the use of DHA in NASH therapy. We hypothesize that DHA attenuation of diet-induced NASH and fibrosis involves both direct and indirect mechanisms controlling major regulatory pathways (TGF?, Notch, HH & Opn) linked to NASH. AIM 1 will use an in vivo time course approach to test the hypothesis that DHA will induce changes in hepatic membrane lipid composition and PUFA-derived oxylipins that precede changes in the expression/activity of signaling pathways linked to NASH & fibrosis. AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that PUFA & oxylipins act directly on isolated liver cells (hepatocytes, macrophage & stellate cells) to regulate signaling pathways (TGF?, Notch, Hh & Opn) linked to NASH pathology."
"9439345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials with tumor cell-based vaccines to stimulate broad unbiased tumor specific adaptive responses have shown promise but none have yet shown sufficient clinical efficacy. One critical shortcoming of these cellular vaccines has been the limited number of activated antigen presenting cells that can marshal multiple cell types to destroy the malignant cells. In order to increase these activated anti-tumor APCs and the subsequent T-cell responses, we formulated cyclic di-nucleotides (CDN), a novel class of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules that activate Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling adaptor molecule, into a tumor cell vaccine (STINGVAX). STINGVAX resulted in significant anti-tumor response in vivo in multiple murine models, including the treatment of palpable and established B16 tumor. Another shortcoming of many of the cancer immunotherapy clinical trial is the presence of immune checkpoint pathways that can prevent an effective adaptive immune response. We combined TLR agonists formulated tumor cell vaccine (TEGVAX), with a blocking anti-PD-1 antibody that targets the PD-1/B7-H1 immune checkpoint pathway, and we were able to induce regression of established B16 tumor. We hypothesize that multiple PAMP molecules formulated with cellular vaccines can augment anti-tumor cytokine responses, which can be paired with immune checkpoint blockade molecules to limit the adaptive immune resistance of the tumor microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to introduce optimally formulated STINGVAX in clinical trials as a critical component of a combinatorial cancer vaccine regimen that incorporates maximal activation of tumor specific T-cells with antibodies that block the immune checkpoint pathways. Toward this goal, we propose to optimize the formulation of STINGVAX using in vivo treatment assays in murine models. Second, we propose to examine how STINGVAX increases the number of activated antigen presenting cells to prime and polarize anti-tumor T-cells. Third, we propose to utilize magnetovaccination MRI imaging method to study the enhanced trafficking of activated dendritic cells that is induced by STINGVAX. Magnetovaccination has a high translation potential to quantify APC trafficking. Lastly, we propose to combine STINGVAX with blocking anti-PD-1 antibody to limit the adaptive resistance of immune escape and thereby develop a combinatorial immunotherapy regiment for cancer patients."
"9273333","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR project will augment and investigate a digital game that was designed and successfully tested during a Phase I trial in a long-term care facility. The game, called Memory Matters (MM), is designed to trigger reminiscing by persons with mild to moderate dementia-related memory loss, often caused by Alzheimer's Disease, by immersing these individuals in game content reflecting the cultural and historical facets of their youth and early adulthood. The MM digital game brings together two key elements which are key to enhancing communication and interaction with people living with mild to moderate dementia; reminiscence triggers and game-playing. Game-embedded content, including pictures and music, serves as strong memory triggers, leading to a range of interaction and often a stream of memories spreading out from the initial topic. Playing games and having fun, helps relaxation and interaction, and avoids the stress of many cognitive activities, which put pressure on the person with dementia. Having a rich bank of memory triggers adds interest and takes the pressure off caregivers and family members to come up with ideas and prompts to engage in conversation from their own experience and knowledge. The game often opens up the possibility for the person living with dementia to `teach' the caregiver or family member about something that is outside their experience, building esteem and a sense of purpose. Digital games offer a novel approach to promote improvements in mood, social interaction, cognitive stimulation, and quality of life for persons with dementia-related memory loss. This Phase II SBIR will evaluate the efficacy of MM in offering improvements in mood, social interaction, cognitive stimulation, and quality of life to persons with memory loss who will use th game over a 6-month period. Evaluation will be done using semi-structured interviews and participant observation data collected on 100 persons with mild to moderate dementia-related memory loss, their family caregivers, and professional care providers via an embedded randomized controlled evaluation."
"9410575","Background. Consistent with NIDA's and NIH's HIV priorities, this early career award aims to elucidate behavioral and social mechanisms associated with substance use and optimize treatment success among men who have sex with men (MSM) who are sub-optimally engaged in care. Internalized stigma and related emotions, such as shame, are under-addressed modifiable barriers to engagement in HIV care across the cascade, which theory indicates may mechanistically occur via avoidance coping behaviors, including substance use. As stigma-related emotions are notoriously under-reported, improved measurement and assessment of these pathways are needed to more strategically intervene on these barriers to HIV care. Research. Using two pre-existing datasets (n=313), I will assess the interrelationships between HIV care cascade indicators (i.e., linkage and engagement in care), substance use, and stigma-related emotions, informed by three measurements (recently validated nonverbal behavioral coding, narrative coding, and self- report). I will also assess whether avoidant coping mediates these relationships. I will then conduct focus groups with this target population, and use the obtained feedback with the results from the secondary data analysis to inform the refinement of a previously developed emotion regulation intervention (PI Batchelder) designed to improve engagement in HIV-care among substance using HIV+ MSM sub-optimally engaged in care. I will then conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the refined intervention with substance using HIV+ MSM sub-optimally engaged in HIV care. Outcome data from this pilot will be used to assess the clinical utility for improving engagement in HIV care and reducing substance use. Training. To address gaps in my training, I will develop expertise in 1) content and methods to better understand the interrelationships between the HIV care cascade, substance use, and internalized stigma and related emotions, 2) targeted advanced statistics, and 3) developing and conducting clinical trials with substance using HIV+ MSM sub- optimally engaged in care. Mentorship. Providing complementary expertise central to my research and training goals, Dr. Conall O'Cleirigh is an expert in HIV-related intervention development and implementation involving MSM and Dr. John Kelly is an expert in substance use treatment interventions. Both have mentored K awardees that have successfully transitioned to independent investigators. The advisory team will provide additional expertise related to the training goals including the medical treatment of HIV, affective science, stigma, latent variable modeling and mediation, advanced RCT statistics including EMA, and text interventions. Candidate. I have been productive as a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow, with over 20 publications (4 additional manuscripts under review). I have received two pilot grants as principal investigator that enabled me to develop and conduct an open pilot of the aforementioned intervention. This K23 would address targeted gaps in my training that are crucial to my research agenda and development as an independent investigator."
"9279194","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection and intervention for children with ASD leads to better outcomes (e.g., Dawson et al., 2010). Intervention depends on accurate identification; therefore, early screening and diagnosis are crucial (Filipek et al., 1999). The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) has become the most widely used early autism screening tool for children 16-30 mos. However, though the M-CHAT and other screening instruments have been available for 10 years or more, and universal screening has been endorsed by national organizations, the median age of ASD diagnosis in the U.S. is still four years or older. Children diagnosed at four years or later miss the possibility of crucial earl intervention. Furthermore, no screener can detect every child; therefore, physician surveillance of children's development, which involves integrating behavioral observation with screening, parent concern, and history information, is essential. Therefore, although a strong screening tool is necessary for effective screening, it is not sufficient on its own. Effective screening policies must consider issues such as when screening should occur, how best to implement screening in the context of ongoing developmental surveillance, and what child, family, physician, and practice factors influence the success of screening and surveillance. The proposed study builds on the seminal M-CHAT work, which did the foundational work for an effective screener. This study will investigate three key questions: (1) what is the best age to initiate screening (12, 15, or 18 mos)? (2) Can accuracy of physician surveillance be improved with a brief, focused intervention? (3) What are the factors associated with disparity in effective ASD screening and surveillance at the child/family level (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex) and at the physician/practice level (physician beliefs and self-efficacy, practice location, and patient demographics)? With a total of 12,000 toddlers screened for ASD, this study will examine how the variables in these three aims influence age and accuracy of ASD detection, allowing this team to identify targets for future intervention to reduce disparities and facilitate early and accurate diagnosis for all children. Much of the work done in early ASD screening comes from the team assembled for this proposed study, and the large sample of children from diverse geographic areas will make these results immediately generalizable. The proposed study will answer key remaining questions about early ASD screening, thereby impacting the early health monitoring of children across the nation, and helping ensure that the promise of early ASD detection can become a reality."
"9443428","Summary Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at increased risk for problems with adherence and suboptimal glycemic control, and novel approaches are needed to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. The majority of adolescents obtain insufficient sleep (defined as <8 hours/night), and in our data, sleep disturbance was significantly associated with poorer adherence and predicted greater problems with quality of life and worse glycemic control. Yet, no interventions have addressed sleep in youth with T1D. Working from a biopsychosocial and contextual model of sleep, we propose to tailor a sleep-promoting intervention to meet the needs of adolescents with T1D by conducting interviews with to identify the barriers and facilitators to adequate sleep specific to this population. We will then develop and pilot test a brief, behavioral sleep-promoting intervention, building on successful interventions in other populations, including components such as limiting caffeine, establishing a media curfew, and positive bedtime routines, while addressing the needs unique to adolescents with T1D, such as fear of hypoglycemia. The study will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of Sarah Jaser, PhD, a pediatric psychologist, Beth Malow, MD, MS, a neurologist with specialty in sleep medicine, Cindy Lybarger, MSN, APRN, CDE, a nurse practitioner and certified diabetes educator, and Jill Simmons, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. Sleep is a potentially modifiable risk factor that may have both a physiological and behavioral impact on diabetes outcomes. Given the strong associations between sleep and diabetes outcomes in our preliminary data, and accumulating evidence indicating the impact of insufficient sleep on insulin sensitivity, behavior, and mood, there is reason to believe that a sleep-promoting intervention has the potential to improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D indirectly by improving self-management and directly through its effect on metabolic function and glycemic control. Therefore, the proposed study offers a novel approach to improve glycemic control, adherence, and quality of life in adolescents with T1D."
"9353761","Project Summary  The purpose of the renewal of this mid-career investigator award titled, ?Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD)? by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics and Public Health at the University California Irvine School of Medicine and UCLA School of Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research endeavors with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several University of California and Veterans Affairs-affiliated campuses in Southern California. These centers provide care to underserved, indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis for survival. In the US, African Americans and Hispanics have a substantially higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively) than non-Hispanic Whites. While the overall 5-year survival of ESRD patients is less than 40%, with the highest mortality risk observed among malnourished patients, minority dialysis patients exhibit lower mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival differences and the contribution of nutritional status and dietary factors to these disparities may have major clinical and public health implications.  The PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race/ethnicity. Several alternative hypotheses related to racial/ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms, bone and mineral disorders, mental health and psychosocial factors, and dialysis treatment characteristics will also be examined. The PI proposes a 5-year prospective patient-oriented research study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,500 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African American and 1/3 Hispanic), in collaboration with Southern California dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status, quality of life, clinical events, and survival will be longitudinally assessed. Genetic factors such as APOL1 risk alleles will also be examined, and biospecimens for future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects, additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be developed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 150,000 HD patients.  The support of the K24 award for this prospective study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue to expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator for early-career investigators in renal nutrition and CKD disparities by leveraging his networking relationships across several campuses and centers including the University of California system and its Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente of Southern Calif., UCLA Public Health, and LA and Orange County Health Departments; (2) continue to expand his persistent efforts in increasing the participation of minority populations in CKD research studies across Southern California; and (3) continue his cultivation of an innovative area of CKD disparities and nutrition research through promising early career investigators and the ongoing support of collaborators in Southern California. The data and hypotheses generated during this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to promote additional patient-oriented studies by mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve patient outcomes."
"9319324","Abnormal maturation of brain circuitry during development is a critical determinant of pathological manifestations in neuropsychiatric conditions including intellectual disability, Fragile X syndrome and schizophrenia. A growing body of evidence from studies in human subjects and animal models has established a link between dysfunctions in glutamatergic neurotransmission and developmental brain abnormalities associated with these conditions. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGlu1 and mGlu5, are G protein- coupled receptors critical to formation and maintenance of brain circuitry and synaptic plasticity, a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Dysregulation of group I mGluR activity is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders including Fragile X syndrome and schizophrenia. The broad spectrum of deficits linked to group I mGluR dysfunctions is not adequately explained by existing knowledge of receptor properties. We identified a new mGlu1-interacting protein, fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1 (FEZ1) encoded by a schizophrenia candidate gene. Preliminary findings indicate that mGlu1 may function via FEZ1 to regulate autophagy in neurons. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process critical to neuronal homeostasis and brain development. The proposed studies build on this progress to elucidate a fundamentally new mechanism by which group I mGluRs can contribute to regulation of neuronal homeostasis under physiopathological conditions.  We propose to 1) determine the cellular mechanisms by which group I mGluRs regulate autophagy in neurons; 2) define the molecular pathways by which the receptors control autophagy initiation; 3) establish whether constitutively enhanced group I mGluR activity leads to autophagy impairment in an animal model of Fragile X syndrome; and 4) investigate the function of autophagy in group I mGluR-dependent remodeling of dendritic spines. Collectively, findings from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular and cellular substrates underlying metabotropic functions in the brain and build a molecular framework to understand cellular perturbations associated with synaptic pathologies in neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9327025","This Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network ?eMERGE Phase III: Central Genome Sequencing and Genotyping Facility? (RFA-HG-027), will provide state-of-the-art capabilities for the generation of the DNA sequence of key genes and genomic regions in eMERGE patients. The work will be performed within the Baylor DNA Diagnostic Laboratories, a collaborative effort of the Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) and the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics (DMHG), merging the complementary expertise of both groups to enable CAP and CLIA certified clinical sequencing tests. A complementary, collaborative group at Partners-Broad will work in parallel to achieve similar goals. An appended document ?BCM-Partners-Broad eMERGE Sequencing Core Collaboration Plan? details the collaboration. At BCM, the complete sequences of ~100 selected genes, followed by validation of putative variants, will be carried out initially via a custom DNA capture panel, with alternate methods potentially introduced as the program matures. In this revised proposal, a total of 12,500 samples will be analyzed over the course of the project (2,700 in year one; 3,267 per year, thereafter) at BCM. As described in the original application, the methods will be based upon the NimbleGen DNA capture technology and Illumina DNA sequencing procedures that were pioneered at the HGSC. The content of the capture panel at BCM will be coordinated with the panel designed and utilized by Dr. Heidi Rehm?s group at Harvard, ensuring simple but robust cross reference between platforms. Further, we will utilize the Codified variant interpretation and reporting to provide automated reports to eMERGE participants. Sanger methods for validation of key variants will be available. A key modification of the Aims will be to expand the use of distributed computing to enable facile access to all project data from multiple (and potentially all) sites. Data will be collected from sequenced samples and securely stored in a single harmonized format. These data, interpretation results and clinical reports will be accessible to qualified users via secure access and transfer protocols. The eMERGE data commons will allow for rapid, secure and equitable transfer of data and information across the eMERGE investigator network and will create an environment for real-time reinterpretation of results as new tools and knowledge become available. To facilitate progress, four working groups from the two Centers will be formed: 1. Assay Design; 2. Sequencing Production; 3. Physician Interface; 4. Data Commons."
"9282599","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cell-driven inflammation is a key component of several inflammatory airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recently identified subset of effector T cells, known as T helper type (Th)-17 cells, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, including COPD. Yet, the role of these cells in chronic airway inflammation remains to be elucidated. Th17 cells secrete the cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 which act on surrounding epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as on resident antigen presenting cells, to elicit production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to the recruitment of other inflammatory cells, including neutrophils. Differentiation of Th17 cells in the gut lumen has been closely linked to specific microbiota. However, whether the microbiome of other mucosal sites, such as the airways, is intimately linked to differentiation of Th17 cells at other sites is unknown. Airway neutrophilia is a common feature of COPD that parallels decline in lung function. Furthermore, COPD patients often present with high bacterial burden in the lower airways and the extent of airway colonization is closely associated with reduced lung function and enhanced co-morbidity. Our recent analysis of a cohort of smokers, a population that is at high risk of developing COPD, revealed that a distinct repertoire of airway microbiota is closely associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased Th17 cells in the airways. Based on the paradigm that gut microbiota are critical in shaping the mucosal immune response in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, and in light of our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that airway microbiota plays a central role in directing the differentiation of Th17 cells, which in turn promoe chronic airway neutrophilia in COPD. To examine this, we will assess airway microbiota, cytokines and T cell populations in a unique cohort of asymptomatic smokers and smokers that develop COPD. To interrogate the connection between airway microbiota, Th17 cells and airway inflammation further we will take advantage of our novel mouse model that develops airway inflammation reminiscent of chronic airway inflammation seen in COPD. We will use this mouse model and a cigarette smoke inhalation model to gain mechanistic insight into the contribution of Th17-produced IL-17 and IL-22 to airway neutrophilia, mucus production, remodeling, emphysema and associated abnormalities in lung function. Furthermore, we will take advantage of our germ free facility to examine the contribution of airway microbiota and bacterial products in driving Th17-mediated airway inflammation and pathogenesis of COPD. We will accomplish this through re-introduction of bacterial communities or heat-killed bacteria into the recently rederived germ-free mice. These studies will provide new insight into the link between microbiota, Th17-mediated airway inflammation and COPD pathogenesis."
"9284375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia."
"9274256","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and worldwide. Identification of genes increasing susceptibility to T2D would substantially affect the public health by providing biological and clinical data about development and treatment of T2D and by advising lifestyle changes in at-risk individuals. Our overall goal is to identify the functional variants, target genes, and mechanisms responsible for T2D and diabetes-related quantitative trait (QT) association signals. Previously, we have identified novel loci for T2D and QTs using both low-frequency and common variants. We developed strategies to annotate regulatory variants and, at several loci, defined variants and the mechanisms by which variant alleles bind transcriptional regulators and increase or decrease expression of specific target genes. In this proposal, we extend these previous successes to further define molecular and biological mechanisms and assess the contribution of hundreds of specific plasma metabolites to QT variation and T2D risk. Specifically, guided by experimental evidence of regulatory elements and resources correlating genotype, regulatory element activity, and chromatin structure with expression level, we will test variants for allele-specific differences in transcriptional activity and protein-DNA interactions, identify transcriptional regulators, and validate results in primary cells, transient expression in model organisms, and genome editing in human cell lines. For insulin processing and secretion loci at which we have already implicated single variants, we will perform detailed characterization of the genes and their encoded proteins and determine the effects of the reference and alternate alleles on basal and glucose-stimulated proinsulin and insulin secretion. In addition, we will test association of genetic variants with >700 metabolites, determine their role in T2D risk and QT variation, and assess prediction of future T2D in unaffected at-risk individuals. We will use metabolite associations to annotate loci, identify causal contributions by Mendelian randomization, and assess the contribution to models that predict T2D risk using resources from the 20-year Finland United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study. Successful completion of these aims will translate T2D association signals into biological insights and potential therapeutic targets. Risk variants, the mechanisms by which they affect gene function, and their pathological effects on disease processes will be determined, guiding studies that evaluate novel therapies and intervene in at-risk individuals to prevent disease. The productive and longstanding collaboration of the investigators make achievement of these aims feasible and likely highly informative to the public health crisis posed by T2D."
"9278156","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherence to effective cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor medications is associated with improved CVD risk factor control, fewer hospitalizations, and lower mortality in patients with diabetes. However, many patients are poorly adherent to medications, and there are persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in medication adherence. Traditional clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence are often resource-intensive, and focus exclusively on patient-level barriers to behavior change. Unsurprisingly, these trials have not led to sustainable, cost-effective approaches to improve adherence. Health system-level medication adherence interventions that can be implemented, scaled up, and sustained across a wide range of health care delivery settings are urgently needed. Delivering efficacious prescription drugs through existing mail order pharmacies can be considered a system-level approach to enhancing access to medications. Previous research using observational data has shown that mail order pharmacy use is associated with improved adherence to CVD risk factor medications, and with improved CVD risk factor control. Despite this evidence, and although mail order pharmacy use is potentially cost-saving to both patients and health plans, fewer than 25% of patients with diabetes use the mail order pharmacy to obtain their diabetes medications. Mail order pharmacy use is even lower among non- whites and patients with lower socioeconomic status. We propose a randomized encouragement trial to encourage use of existing mail order pharmacy services among diabetes patients with poor adherence to CVD risk factor medications and who only use retail pharmacies in 3 health care systems: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Harvard Pilgrim, and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii. These combined systems include approximately 300,000 patients with diabetes with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Patients with no history of mail order pharmacy use will be randomized into 3 arms: 1) a standardized intervention to encourage mail order use and provide easily accessible information on how to access the service; 2) a personalized intervention that includes components of the standardized intervention as well as additional information tailored to patient-specific characteristics such as prescription regimens and individualized potential savings by switching to the mail order pharmacy; and 3) usual care. In addition to examining the impact of the intervention on medication adherence and CVD risk factor control, we will examine factors affecting the sustainability and dissemination of the intervention, assess the intervention's impact on utilization and health care costs, and determine whether the intervention's impact differs across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups. This research will provide a foundation for developing sustainable, system-level approaches to addressing medication adherence in diabetes patients that can be widely disseminated and implemented across a diverse array of health care systems."
"9292997","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The burden of diabetes is greater for racial/ethnic minorities, including African Americans. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for the development of diabetes and are also more prevalent in racial/ethnic minorities. The Diabetes Prevention Program and subsequent translation studies demonstrated the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention on reducing weight and risk of type 2 diabetes. Increasing evidence supports efforts to engage CHWs to help extend our reach to reduce obesity and diabetes risk in underserved communities. Research is needed to identify standard, effective, and scalable CHW training models to equip them to help extend our reach in racial/ethnic minority communities, especially at-risk African Americans. Internet-based immersive 3- dimensional (3-D) virtual world environments offer the opportunity to reach populations with standardized and tailored approaches that can overcome common barriers to participation and allow for engaging and experiential educational opportunities. Building on our prior work and experience, we will tailor/adapt, implement, and evaluate an internet-based 3-D virtual world model to remotely deliver a CHW training program (CDC ?Road to Health?; RTH) to support CHWs' efforts to educate at-risk African American communities about lifestyle changes to reduce obesity and diabetes risk. We will use a sequential mixed-methods design to address these specific aims: Aim 1. Use community-based participatory research methods to guide the overall study and inform tailoring and adaptation of our virtual world model to deliver the CHW training program; Aim 2. Conduct a randomized pilot study (N=40 CHWs) to compare change in primary outcomes (0, 12 weeks) after the in-person versus virtual world delivery of the training program. Participants will be experienced African American female CHWs who share characteristics of the at-risk population they serve. Primary CHW outcomes include program content knowledge and delivery skill, self-efficacy, adherence, and change in lifestyle behaviors; and Aim 3. Conduct summative focus groups to refine the CHW virtual world training program and study methodology to guide subsequent development of an RO1. If our virtual world CHW training model shows promise in this study and subsequent effectiveness in an RCT, it could be tailored/adapted for diverse groups and scaled for broad remote dissemination."
"9279095","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There exists a fundamental gap in our understanding of how intestinal microbiota impact the ability of their animal hosts to harvest energy-rich dietar fats. Moreover, the microbial and nutritional signals and responsive host transcriptional mechanisms that control host gene expression in the intestinal epithelium, remain unresolved. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions in the intestine and how those interactions impact human health and disease. The overall objectives of this project are to define the mechanisms by which members of the intestinal microbiota promote absorption of dietary fats, and how microbe-induced alterations in fat metabolism regulate gene expression programs in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Our preliminary studies in gnotobiotic zebrafish and mice reveal a novel role for microbiota in promoting absorption of long- and medium-chain fatty acids (FA) in intestinal epithelial cells, and implicate the FA-regulated transcription factor family Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4) in mediating IEC transcriptional responses to microbiota. The proposed research will address the central hypothesis that soluble products from gut bacteria stimulate host absorption of dietary FA and reduce activity of Hnf4 transcription factors to reduce expression host target genes in IECs. Our rationale is that an improved understanding of bacterial control of host FA absorption and transcriptional regulatory programs in the intestine could lead to new microbiota-based strategies for controlling fat metabolism and energy balance in humans and other animals. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify host and bacterial mechanisms underlying bacterial stimulation of dietary FA absorption in the intestinal epithelium. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the regulatio and function of Hnf4 in the intestinal epithelium in response to microbial colonization. The expected outcomes will vertically advance the field in several ways. First, they will generate foundational mechanistic insights into how gut bacteria regulate host assimilation of energy-rich dietary fats. Second, they will establish Hnf4 transcription factors for the first time as key mediators of host-microbe commensalism in the intestine. Third, they will provide a novel molecular pathway linking microbial stimulation of host FA absorption to important host transcriptional programs in the intestinal epithelium. These results are expected to have a significant impact because they are likely to lead to new strategies for treating human diseases such as obesity and undernutrition by manipulating dietary fat assimilation and gene expression programs in the intestinal epithelium."
"9329152","PROJECT SUMMARY For several decades, researchers have studied the neural mechanisms of spatial attention (i.e., the enhancement of neural activity for specific spatial locations) and target similarity (i.e., the enhancement of neural activity for specific inputs that look like a search target) in prefrontal cortex. The vast majority of this research has been carried out with tasks using impoverished stimuli?typically a small number of targets and distractors that abruptly flash against a uniform background. This is very different from sensory stimulation in natural environments, where boundaries between objects are less clear, the background is more complex, and most objects remain relatively static. Furthermore, artificial search tasks typically require just one saccade to a rewarding target, while natural search behavior consists of many saccades, each with different strategic goals (e.g., to explore and find potential targets, or to exploit known targets). It is currently not known how attention operates in these natural conditions. Therefore, the overarching goal of this research is to understand how attention is allocated in the real world. Neural activity from the prefrontal cortex (frontal eye fields) will be recorded while monkeys perform search tasks at different levels of abstraction from natural scene search. Specifically, the goal Aim 1 is to determine how the spectrum of saccadic strategies during natural scene search (e.g., explore or exploit) influences the allocation of attention. While monkeys freely search for a target embedded in a background of patterned noise, the allocation of attention will be flexibly and continuously sampled by rapidly (5-10 Hz) flashing a salient probe at a random location. The goal of Aim 2 is to test whether a map of target-similarity is encoded in prefrontal cortex before an object is recognized and attended spatially (i.e., target similarity guides spatial selection), or whether it is dependent upon prior allocation of spatial attention toward a detected object. This will be accomplished by constraining saccadic behavior while providing naturalistic sensory stimulation. The monkeys will be trained to detect and discriminate a target that gradually emerges from a noisy background. The target will be psychophysically detectable before the monkey detects it, allowing us to test whether FEF encodes target similarity even when spatial selection has not occurred. Together, these experiments will provide key insights into the dynamics of spatial attention and target similarity when sensory stimulation is natural and saccadic search behavior is unconstrained."
"9373452","Project Summary This is an exploratory/developmental research proposal which seeks to build on and to enlarge our data into the role of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in Fear (Acute Threat) and Approach Motivation, two constructs within the Negative Valence System and Positive Valence System, respectively, in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. FGF2 is one of a family of growth factors that impact neural development and that play neuromodulatory roles throughout life, shaping the organism's response to the environment. Disruptions in the Negative Valence and Positive Valence Systems characterize anxiety and depressive disorders, which account for the majority of psychiatric disability over the lifespan. The animal and sparse adult human studies implicating FGF2 in models of anxiety and depression led to FGF2's inclusion in RDoC as a target biological unit of analysis of the Fear construct. We know of no study that has examined FGF2 in humans with anxiety and its disorders, nor do we know of a study that examined FGF2 in clinical and nonclinical pediatric samples, anxious and/or depressed. Our team collected pilot data of FGF2 levels in a clinical sample of 50 anxious and depressed children and their mothers in addition to self-report and behavior data that corresponded with Fear, and Approach Motivation, respectively. We examined the associations between FGF2 levels, self-reports, and behavior in the children and mothers and found significant associations between the measurement units, and in the expected directions. These data, consistent with the animal and human studies, suggest FGF2 may play a role in modulating Fear, and Approach Motivation, which can lead to exciting, new research directions. We have since accumulated serum samples in 150 anxious and/or depressed children and mothers, and self-report and behavior data. We request R21 funds to conduct immunoassay analysis to measure FGF2 concentrations in this sample data. We also propose to broaden our sampling frame by collecting FGF2, self-report, and behavior data on 100 additional children who represent ?normal? controls, and subclinical or subthreshold anxiety and/or depression, and mothers. With these cumulative, dimensional data, we will study these measurement units' associations with Fear, and Approach Motivation in a measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis. Our final, exploratory aim is on the question of stability of FGF2, in relation to self-reports and behavior."
"9277237","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  A major long-term goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) has been to develop a quantitative systems analysis of cardiovascular (CV) dynamics and related control systems, including the kidneys, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), endothelial factors, and the endocrine system. Our experimental studies have focused on understanding the basic molecular and physiological control mechanisms of each component of the circulation, the feedback systems that coordinate these components, and integration of this information into a composite systems analysis of CV regulation. Another key objective has been to translate our research on basic mechanisms of CV control to understanding the pathophysiology of disorders such as hypertension (HT). The current focus of the PPG is on neurohumoral, endothelial, and intrarenal mechanisms that contribute to impaired pressure natriuresis and increased blood pressure (BP) in experimental models that are highly relevant to common, and difficult to treat, forms of human HT caused by obesity, preeclampsia, and postmenopausal hyperandrogenemia. Four unique features of this program are: 1) it utilizes an integrative approach to understand complex interactions between multiple components of CV control systems; 2) it focuses mainly on long-term control of the circulation because many CV diseases, such as HT, are manifestations of abnormal control mechanisms that develop slowly over long periods of time; 3) it utilizes unique experimental models that mimic common forms of human HT, including obesity, preeclampsia, and postmenopausal-induced HT; 4) it uses mathematical modeling and systems analyses to provide a conceptual framework for understanding cardiovascular dynamics and renal, endothelial, hormonal and neural mechanisms of HT. The research proposed in this application is described by the titles of the projects as follows: I. Neurohumoral and Renal Mechanisms of Hypertension: this project will elucidate the neurohumoral mechanisms, central nervous system (CNS) circuits and signaling pathways that mediate obesity induced SNS activation, impaired renal-pressure natriuresis, and HT as well as regulation of energy balance and metabolism; II. Endothelial Factors, the Kidney and Hypertension: this project will determine the role of obesity in altering multiple factors released by the placenta that cause endothelial dysfunction, impaired renal-pressure natriuresis, and HT during chronic reductions in uterine perfusion pressure in pregnancy. III. Hormonal and Intrarenal Mechanisms of Postmenopausal Hypertension: this project will determine the role of increased SNS activity, CNS signaling pathways, and intrarenal mechanisms that increase renal vascular resistance, blunt pressure natriuresis and raise BP in postmenopausal HT associated with hyperandrogenemia. The total program, including core support services, provides a unique interdisciplinary approach toward developing an integrative analysis of long-term regulation of BP and circulatory dynamics in forms of experimental HT that have great relevance to human HT."
"9291423","Project Summary/Abstract ? Core B  Core B will provide two technologies for the three Projects that are difficult to import into individual laboratories.  1) The CD4+ T cells that will studied in these Projects recognize self-peptides that have bound to a class II   major histocompatibility molecule (MHCII). In recent T cell research fluorescently labeled multimerized   MHCII molecules uniformly occupied by a single antigenic peptide (?tetramers?) have become standard   reagents for tracking antigen-specific T cells in vivo. However, producing these tetramers has been   difficult and standard protocols have not been generally available. The problem has been exacerbated   in autoimmune diseases such as type-1 diabetes (T1D) because the important peptide-MHCII   complexes often have usual, unstable conformations. Over a number of years the personnel in Core B   have solved many of these problems and made many homogeneous MHCII tetramers including some   containing the major antigens of T1D. The Core will begin by making a standard set of MHCII   tetramers for distribution to the three Projects. As new important peptides are discover in the courses   of these studies, new tetramers will be added to the Core.  2) Understanding how the recognition of self-peptide-MHCII complexes differs from the recognition   conventional foreign peptide-MHCII complexes has been hampered by a limited set for detailed   structures of the interacting molecules. This Core begins a group with many years of experience in X-   ray crystallography and TCR and MHCII expression to bear on this problem. They will pursue the   structures of the novel peptide-MHC complexes to emerge in the three projects and of the relevant   TCRs bound to these complexes."
"9481248","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Massive reorganizations of zinc have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of human physiologic activities. Recently, it was discovered that intracellular and extracellular zinc fluxes are vital to successful mammalian oocyte development and occur both pre- and post-fertilization. However, there is little understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the zinc-dependent switching events that dictate oocyte maturation. Without this knowledge, the biomedical community lacks the ability to assess what makes a good egg and develop potential reproductive therapies. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the cellular needs for zinc by tracking its accumulation and localization during oocyte maturation. I hypothesize that variation in intracellular zinc content during maturation drives cell cycle progression by fulfilling the metal requirement of key Zn-proteins in the maturation process. These proteins include vital Zn-containing enzymes needed to catalyze certain cellular processes as well as zinc-receptor proteins where the presence or absence of their metal cofactor serves as a regulatory switch. This hypothesis will be addressed by employing radioactive zinc tracers to track and quantify Zn2+ accumulation and redistribution. In addition, these studies will elucidate the physiological significance of the efflux event at fertilization known as the zinc spark. Lastly, changes in zinc metalloproteome will be characterized using radioactive zinc tracers in conjunction with native electrophoresis to reveal which Zn-proteins are activated during oocyte maturation. The data obtained from this study will serve as a framework for establishing a novel Zn-dependent mechanism that dictates cell cycle progression in the oocyte, thus providing new means for assessing oocyte health. Insights gained from this research project will be applicable to other zinc-dependent physiologies as well. This award will support a broad array of multi-disciplinary training activities and experienc with the goal of providing robust preparation for a tenure-track position in a Research I university. Training activities will increase key competencies in the areas of scientific communication, mentoring, lab management, in addition to broadening technical skills."
"9288196","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishment of the maternal-fetal interface is critically important since is at this level that uteroplacental and fetoplacental blood flows are regulated, and dysfunction is associated with diseases of pregnancy, e.g. preeclampsia. We observed a central role for Gap junctions and specifically Gx4S assembly in enabling pregnancy adaptation of endothelial vasodilatory capacity. We now provide evidence that it may be altered quite negatively by the numerous chemokine's reported to be secreted by the trophoblast. cAMP/cGMP as well as shear stress is also implicated by our studies to promote Gap junction formation for endothelial cell-cell communication. Under chronic hypoxic conditions (preeclampsia), increases in growth factors and inflammatory cytokines e.g. VEGF and TNF are reported to cause severe detrimental alterations in the functional angiogenic and NO synthetic responses to VEGF and FGF2 via alterations in specific G-protein coupling transducers (GNA14 and GNA14). The central theme of this POl is that cell-cell communication between endothelial cells underlies normal functions and that the high levels of growth factors and cytokines (VEGF & TNF) released in preeclampsia will disrupt Gap junction assembly/function thus compromising vasodilator and angiogenic function. We also explore therapeutic strategies to reverse Gap junction dysfunction.  Project I ERK and Src as negative regulators of pregnancy adapted uterine artery endothelial function.  Project II Shear stress and Gap junction-mediated pregnancy adaptations of uterine artery and human umbilical vessel endothelial cell function.  Project III the roles of GNA14 and GNA11 in human fetal endothelial cell function. Continuing strong synergy of these projects is facilitated through leadership in the Administrative core (Gore A) and efficient utilization of the Live Cell Imaging and Protein Analytical Gore B and Cell and Immunocytochemistry Gore G. Interactions between with Projects will also provide novel insights into cell-cell communication between endothelial cells, so providing a much deeper understanding of the inter/intracellular mechanisms in normal and abnormal pregnancies (e.g. preeclampsia).           RELEVANCE: The studies represent major advancements in understanding the effects of uterine and placental endothelial adaptation via Gap junction-mediated cell-cell communication at the maternal fetal interface. This leads to indepth understanding of the inter/intracellular mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface in normal and abnormal pregnancies (e.g. preeclampsia with lUGR)."
"9284371","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01), submitted by Dr. Sydney Schaefer, Assistant Professor at Utah State University. The purpose of this K01 application is to strategically enhance the candidate's career in the areas of neuropsychology, disability, and geriatric physical rehabilitation through targeted coursework, clinical exposure, and career products. The candidate's supportive and successful institutional environment ensures that the formal career development plan will add to her existing expertise in human movement. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent, tenured scientist with an externally funded research program that will impact the field of physical rehabilitation for older adults. Currently more than 40% of ll physical rehabilitation cases are adults age 65 or older. A commonly used treatment is task-specific training, in which patients repetitively practice a functional motor skill that underlies  meaningful activity of daily living. Current rehabilitative practice does not, however, provide older patients with enough time in therapy to address multiple skills; thus, older adults must be able to generalize the benefits of their rehabilitative treatment. The purpose of this four-year research plan is to test whether older adults can generalize learned information after task-specific training, and if generalization is influenced by cognitive status, as many older adults ar susceptible to cognitive decline. In this project, adults age 65 or older will train on one functioal motor task that simulates feeding, but will be tested on a different untrained functional motor task that simulates dressing. The central hypothesis is that the untrained task (simulated dressing) will become less difficult and less distractible after practicing the trained task (simulated feeding), but that these generalized benefits will be attenuated in adults with lower cognitive status. Results will be compared to control data from subjects with no motor training, and this hypothesis will be tested using cost-effective real-world tools. If the generalization of motor learning between functional motor tasks depends on cognitive status, then future research will identify which specific cognitive impairments best predict physical rehabilitative outcomes. Alternatively, if older adults can generalize motor learning between functional motor tasks regardless of cognitive status, then physically disabled adults with dementia may benefit equally from rehabilitation as adults without cognitive impairment. The candidate's additional training in cognitive assessment and disablement models will complement her research plan, preparing her for future R01 submissions that address physical rehabilitation in older adults and thereby maximize their quality of life."
"9461437","Project summary Dysfunction within the circuits connecting the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic system is the cause of nearly every psychiatric condition, including anxiety disorders. Determining how individual pathways within these circuits function to drive specific aspects of cognition and affect would revolutionize our understanding of the biological bases of psychiatric disorders and provide the critical foundation for pathway-specific treatments in humans. In order to establish the function of these circuits, we must be able to characterize and manipulate the activity of distinct neural pathways that connect the prefrontal and limbic system. The ability to do this in monkeys would be a major advance in basic neuroscience research and would also have significant translational impact. This is because the macaque PFC is more similar, in both its cytoarchitecture and its connections, to the human PFC than that of any other available animal model. What we discover in macaques can be directly translated to humans and have the greatest possible bearing on the understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Our goal here is to develop the use of pathway specific manipulations of neural activity in monkeys and to combine them with recordings of single neurons to answer a fundamental question relating to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Neuroimaging studies of people with anxiety disorders have observed dysfunction between the ventrolateral PFC and amygdala, but little is know about the specific contribution of this circuit to behavior and the role of specific pathways within this circuit. We hypothesize that the ventrolateral PFC-amygdala circuit is vital for encoding the probability that an event will occur. Furthermore, we theorize that dysfunction within the specific pathway from amygdala to ventrolateral PFC heightens anxiety related to the likelihood that a negative outcome will occur. To test our hypothesis we will use an innovative combination of single-neuron recordings, field potential recordings, and pathway specific chemogenetic silencing, analyzing the timing of reward-related neural responses (Aim1) and the LFP synchrony (Aim 2) within this circuit under normal physiological conditions and when neurons in the amygdala that specifically project to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex are transiently inhibited (Aim 3). Completing the aims of this project will fundamentally advance our understanding of the neural pathways and mechanisms involved in representing uncertainty as well as providing a pathway specific understanding of how amygdala influences outcome probability representations. In addition, achieving the aims of this project will not only provide unique insights into the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, but it will also lay the foundation for pathway specific manipulations of neural activity in the monkey brain. Given the close correspondence between the human and monkey brains, these experiments in monkeys are a necessary first step to refining and evaluating the potential use of these techniques to treat humans with anxiety disorders."
"9280930","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous recent studies link development of diabetes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a condition that occurs whenever protein-folding requirements overwhelm protein-folding capacity in the secretory pathway. Notably, there is mounting evidence that ER stress contributes to diminished glucose-responsive insulin secretion in ?-cells, to ?-cell apoptosis, and to general peripheral insulin resistance, all hallmarks of type 2 diabetes; additionally ER stress is evident in type 1 diabetes. ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which slows translation and transcriptionally upregulates genes that enhance ER protein-folding capabilities. If homeostasis is not restored through these outputs, the UPR triggers apoptosis instead. We hypothesize that key components of the UPR, act as toggling switches between homeostatic and apoptotic outputs, ultimately controlling ?-cell fate. Our project goal is to study these switches at the molecular level, using interventional approaches."
"9282808","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use (SU). Identifying the pathways to SU and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain function and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of Southern California/Children's Hospital Los Angeles and UCLA is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (8/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of SU on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 850 9-10 year olds enriched for high-risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of SU, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of SU patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of SU on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and SU patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and SU outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: Our Research Project focuses on the mediating or moderating effects of 1) pubertal hormones and sex differences, 2) socioeconomic (SES) factors, and 3) prenatal exposure (PE) to drugs of abuse on SU and other psychopathologies. These three factors are known to influence timing and trajectories of neurodevelopment, and have been linked to SU, but are seldom studied in tandem in neurodevelopmental studies of typically developing children. In this proposal, in conjunction with the larger ABCD-USA consortium, we are in a unique position to investigate the extent that SES and PE individually or interactively perturb the timing or outcomes of maturation of frontolimbic circuits important in reward processing and decision making, and, how pubertal changes (independent of age) may correspond with the onset of SU and co-occurring psychopathology within the context of the developmental environment. In Y03, we will focus on studying cross-sectional relationships between brain structure and function and puberty, SES and PE prior to onset of SU, and in subsequent years, we will focus on longitudinal studies from onset of SU and SU disorder progression, and precursors or consequences of SU on brain structure and function in Y6-Y10."
"9321449","Project Summary.  Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States, with an incidence of roughly 800,000 events each year. With the annual incidence of stroke expected to surpass 1 million U.S. adults by 2025, there will be escalating stroke-related disability and economic burdens over the next decade. Thus, there is a great clinical and economic need to develop targeted neurorehabilitative strategies that are based on better charac- terization of the motor impairment after stroke using outcomes that are detailed, objective and quanti?able.  Kinematic data are densely-sampled recordings of entire movements, and provide exactly the kind of data that are needed for detailed assessments motor control following stroke. While these data are commonly col- lected, typical analyses do not take advantage of their inherent richness; instead, these analyses focus on a small number of derived summaries such as including endpoint bias and variability  Our proposal develops functional data approaches for kinematic data motivated by three existing datasets. Our ?rst aims introduce statistically novel method for functional response models by incorporating covariates into registration, mean regression and covariance modeling. We combine these analysis components, which are typically treated as distinct problems, to assess the relationship between motion speed and quality, and introduce novel techniques for variable selection. Our second aims use neuroimaging to provide insights into the anatomical processes underlying motor control impairments, and consider stroke location, structural con- nections, and increased cortical activity as drivers of impairment and recovery. Throughout, we use a Bayesian approach that jointly models all parameters of interest. All new methods will be implemented in robust, publicly available software, be validated on simulated datasets designed to mimic real-data scenarios, and be deployed on the motivating datasets to generate insights into the mechanisms behind motor control impairment following stroke."

"9274262","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The regulation of glucose transport by insulin represents the rate-limiting step in glucose utilization and storage, and is known to represent a primary lesion in patients with insulin resistance. The exocyst complex was found in our laboratory to play a role in the regulation of glucose transport, targeting Glut4 vesicles to sitesof docking and fusion in fat cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular details of exocyst assembly and recognition, focusing on the key events that define its role in insulin-stimulated glucose transport both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that insulin stimulates the activity of Akt2, which phosphorylates the Ral GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) complex (RGC), resulting in sequestration from its target G protein, RalA. We propose that RalA is thus activated, and then directs Glut4 vesicles along the final steps of the journey to the exocyst, where it binds to the exocyst components Sec5 and Exo84. Once bound to RalA, both Exo84 and Sec5 undergo phosphorylation, in the process releasing RalA from the exocyst and readying the vesicle for fusion. We propose to explore this hypothesis by focusing on four specific aims: 1) understanding the physiological role of the RGC in glucose homeostasis by investigating conditional knockout mice that we have created; 2) investigating the physiological role of RalA in glucose homeostasis using a combination of knockout mice and selective Ral inhibitors; 3) understanding how a G protein cascade operates in adipocytes through recruitment of the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rgl2 by the upstream G protein Rab10; and 4) investigating the important role of Exo84 phosphorylation by the protein kinase TBK1. We anticipate that these data will present a clearer picture of the role of the exocyst in the regulation of Glut4 trafficking, docking and fusion."
"9336334","Project Summary  Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases are prevalent causes of death and disability in the developed world. Current anti-platelet therapies have not conquered these diseases, and we lack suitable targets for new anti- thrombotic approaches and agents. Platelets are regulated by phosphorylation, but we now find also by remodeling of ubiquitinated proteins.  We find platelets continuously ubiquitinate their proteome and continuously remodel these adducted chains. Inhibition of this remodeling by broadly acting deubiquitinase inhibitors suppresses activation in response to any of several agonists within minutes, and blocks platelet adhesion under high shear flow in microfluidic channels. Inhibition of cellular deubiquitinases also sharply suppresses occlusive thrombosis in damaged carotid arteries in vivo. Our data now show that inhibition of specific deubiquitinases suppresses platelet activation. We can inhibit aggregation, adhesion, spreading and migration of washed human platelets by inhibiting the unique deubiquitinase USP7 (Herpes virus-associated ubiquitin specific protease, HAUSP). We also find selective inhibition of just the two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5, which trim poly-ubiquitin, also inhibited platelet function. This leads us to propose deubiquitinases act in tandem to enable agonist signaling and thrombosis. The essential role of ubiquitin remodeling is also present in megakaryocytes cell lines allowing genetic interventions to confirm our pharmacologic approach.  This work shows ubiquitin metabolism regulates platelet reactivity, and shows platelet ubiquitin metabolism can be manipulated. This not only defines new anti-thrombotic targets, our work shows we can successfully intervene in this metabolism in vivo to suppress arterial thrombosis. Moreover, two specific deubiquitinases each have essential roles in platelet action. Specific inhibitors of these enzyme are available and in one case can be safely administered over long times. This allows us to rapidly suppress platelet reactivity through their currently unappreciated roles in thrombosis. Aim 1. Establish the role of targeted deubiquitination in platelet activation and thrombosis. We will identify proteins selectively deubiquitinated by the selective deubiquitinase after stimulation, and will identify proteins in signaling cascades that are regulated by ubiquitin remodeling. Aim 2. Elucidate the role of ubiquitin remodeling in in vivo thrombosis. Here we will determine currently available specific inhibitors suppress intravascular thrombosis."

"9386578","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Despite affecting 1 in 68 United States children, the mechanisms and early course of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are largely unknown, delaying initiation of interventions known to alter the course of behavioral and neural development. Current studies of ASD emergence largely focus on infant siblings of children with ASD (ASIBs) who exhibit 20 times higher ASD risk than children without a family history. As a complement to this approach, studying the emergence of ASD in high-risk neurogenetic syndromes informs: (1) the generalizability of behav- ioral ASD ?red flags? to non-ASIBs, given the majority of children with ASD do not have positive sibling histories, and (2) genetic and biological pathways subserving ASD features, facilitating mechanistically-sensitive treat- ments. However, syndromic ASD studies are rarely attempted in infants due to the high costs, travel demands, and logistical challenges of assessing low-incidence groups. Furthermore, existing telehealth methods that could circumvent these challenges are not compatible with experimental, laboratory-based methods (e.g. visual atten- tion tasks, psychophysiology) sensitive to ASD risk. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Develop- ment Award (K23) will prepare Dr. Tonnsen, a clinically trained psychologist with expertise in ASD emergence in syndromic infants, to address these barriers by establishing a novel, telehealth-based assessment framework for prodromal ASD surveillance. This project leverages the candidate?s current expertise in biobehavioral pre- dictors of ASD through additional mentored training in (1) new ASD risk domains outside of her current expertise (e.g. social communication, motor skills), (2) telehealth-based clinical research, (3) mechanisms and pathways of syndromic ASD, (4) psychometrics and measurement, and (5) program management, academic writing, and ethics. Primary mentors are experts in the measurement of developmental psychopathology (Don Lynam, Ph.D.), syndromic ASD and telehealth (Leonard Abbeduto, Ph.D.), and social communication development in infants (Amanda Seidl, Ph.D.). Additional training is provided by a national team of experts across both patient-oriented (e.g. clinical profiles, treatment trials, healthcare engineering) and basic (e.g. genetics, mouse models) domains. With the support of her mentorship team, Dr. Tonnsen will develop and validate a telehealth assessment battery of prodromal ASD risk in local infants with syndromic intellectual disability (Aim 1). She will then remotely apply the battery to a national longitudinal sample of infants with Angelman syndrome (50% ASD risk) and fragile X syndrome (25-60% ASD risk; Aim 2) to generate preliminary data and hypotheses for a subsequent R01. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from current methodological frameworks and participant samples for prospective ASD studies, laying the foundation for higher-powered, lower-cost, and wider-reaching studies of ASD emergence. Furthermore, the protected time, training, and data afforded by this project will crystallize Dr. Tonnsen?s path to independence as an interdisciplinary expert in re- mote surveillance of syndromic ASD in infants."
"9269567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, arise from disordered energy utilization and storage, and are therefore directly linked to the physiology of adipose tissue. Many adult humans possess metabolically active beige adipose tissue, and its mass shows an inverse correlation with adiposity and a direct correlation with metabolic health. How this tissue arises, responds to environmental cues, and its potential for diagnostic and therapeutic use are exciting questions currently under investigation. However, adequate models to study this tissue from humans are lacking. This proposal is based on an exciting recent finding from our laboratory that enables the isolation and expansion of human primary pre-adipocytes that give rise to white and beige adipocytes. We discovered that human beige pre-adipocytes are localized within the adipose tissue vasculature, and proliferate only under conditions that promote capillary network expansion in vitro. We now seek to leverage these findings to understand the cell and molecular basis for the formation of these cells, and the mechanisms underlying their beneficial metabolic effects. Specific Aim 1: Using new deep sequencing and bioinformatics approaches that enable cell annotation using very low RNA input we will determine whether white and beige adipocytes emerge from the same or distinct pre-adipocyte progenitors. Specific Aim 2: Our preliminary studies indicate that implantation of human beige adipocytes into NOD-scid IL2r?null (NSG) mice improves glucose disposal, suggesting that cells per-se can confer a metabolic benefit. We will determine whether implanted human beige adipocytes improve systemic glucose metabolism by acting as an energy sink for glucose and lipid utilization, or by secreting factors that enhance glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in other tissues. Specific Aim 3: Our new findings from gene expression analysis of human beige adipocytes has revealed induction of mRNAs for potent neuroendocrine factors, including the pro-protein convertase PCSK1 which is genetically associated with obesity in numerous human populations. Thus, the beneficial effect of human beige adipocytes may be due to a neuroendocrine function. Mass spectroscopy has confirmed the secretion of fragments of PCSK1, and identified novel secreted peptides. Proteomic analysis proposed here will further define the secreted proteome from these cells, and provide information necessary for analyzing its impact on systemic glucose tolerance. The work proposed will answer pivotal questions regarding the origin, characteristics and functional properties of human beige adipocytes and their secreted products, and provide the foundation for clinical studies leveraging these findings for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in human metabolic disease."
"9271269","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Proper brain function requires an active maintenance program to sustain neuronal health. In essence, neurons and glia have to repair the damage that is induced by neuronal activity, injury, toxins, and aging. Environmental stressors impact the nervous system and lead to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration if the protective mechanisms are weakened. Recent studies revealed that NMNATs (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase) maintain neuronal integrity and facilitate proper neural function throughout life. NMNAT2 is the major NMNAT isoform expressed in the mammalian brain and is extremely labile with a short half-life in neurons. We and others have found that NMNAT2 levels are significantly reduced in CNS tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies, or Parkinson's disease. Reducing NMNAT2 function in mice leads to axonal deterioration, while NMNAT2 overexpression offers neuroprotection. In the proposed work we will address three specific aims: How does NMNAT2 reduce toxic tau species and protect neurons against tauopathy? Is NMNAT2 required to maintain neuronal health in adult brains? Is small molecule up-regulation of NMNAT2 levels neuroprotective? A combination of molecular/biochemical, genetic, anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging, viral vector and high-throughput screening approaches will be employed to accomplish these aims. This study will provide insight into how NMNAT2 maintains neuronal health in mature brains. NMNATs are potential drug targets for therapeutic interventions in neurodegeneration. A detailed knowledge on how NMNAT2 maintain neuronal integrity and its role in neuroprotection is critical not only for understanding normal brain function, but will also provide necessary insights to assist in drug discovery."
"9331835","Project Summary. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by retinal degeneration (RD), obesity, polydactyly, renal defects, and genital defects. This proposal focuses on one BBS-associated gene, Centrosomal protein of 290 kDa (CEP290), with the goal of understanding the role of CEP290 in the normal structure and function of the rod sensory cilium, and the mechanisms of pathophysiology in RD caused by CEP290 deficiency. CEP290 was chosen because depending on the allele and background, CEP290 defects cause an array of diverse defects, all involving RD. In contrast to most other BBS gene products, CEP290 protein does not form a stable part of the BBSome membrane coat complex, but it interacts functionally and physically with other BBS proteins. While CEP290 has been proposed to be a ciliary gate-keeper or a structural scaffold within the connecting cilium (CC), the field is currently divided on the localization and the structural and functional roles of CEP290 within the CC, and the mechanism for CEP290 regulation of ciliary trafficking is not well understood. The Specific Aims are: 1. Chronology of CEP290 (BBS14) Subcellular Localization and BBS Protein Localization in CEP290- or BBS4-Mediated Retinal Degeneration To test the hypothesis that CEP290 localizes peripherally to microtubule doublets and elucidate the structural role of CEP290, the superresolution imaging techniques, Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) will be used. To assess the hypothesis that mislocalization of interacting proteins such as BBS4 and BBS8,in CEP290-mediated RD is the direct result of the absence of CEP290, the localization of BBS4 over the course of RD will be tracked as well as CEP290 localization in BBS4-mediated RD. To correlate mislocalization with disease progression over time, histology, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and electroretinography (ERG) will be used. 2. Identification of the BBSome Interacting Domains of CEP290. BBS4 and BBS8 are BBSome subunits that both depend on the presence of CEP290 for proper localization. To test the hypotheses that CEP290 interacts with BBS4 and BBS8 through its N-terminal SMC homology domain, and that BBS4 and BBS8 interact with CEP290 through their tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) domains, the proposed domains, or full length proteins with and without mutations within the proposed interaction domains, will be expressed in hRPE1 cells and tests for both proper co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation will be performed. 3. Functional Rescue of Retinal Degeneration with In Vivo CEP290 domain Expression. To determine the in vivo role of CEP290 and its domains in protein mislocalization, CEP290 mutant mice will receive sub-retinal injections and electroporation of expression constructs for rescue domains and full-length CEP290 protein. Understanding the functions and disease mechanisms of CEP290 is essential for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of BBS and other retinal ciliopathies, and designing new therapies. "
"9262901","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Investigations from our laboratory have revealed that Notch1 plays a critical role in osteoblastic cell differentiation and function, and its expression n immature osteoblasts causes osteopenia secondary to an inhibitory effect on osteoblastogenesis. Although Notch2 appears to have an important and distinct function from Notch1, most of the work conducted in skeletal cells has examined the effects of Notch1, and there is limited information on the function of Notch2 in the skeleton. Hajdu-Cheney Syndrome (HCS), a devastating disease characterized by acro-osteolysis, osteoporosis and fractures, was recently attributed to gain-of-function mutations of NOTCH2 leading to NOTCH2 protein stabilization. The aim of the proposed research is to create and study mouse models of HCS, to understand the skeletal disease and mechanisms involved in HCS. As a consequence, the function of Notch2 in the skeleton will be defined. Our specific aims are: (1) To characterize the HCS and determine the function of Notch2 by studying global and conditional mouse models of Notch2HCS mutant activation in skeletal cells. The skeletal phenotype of global and cell lineage-specific Notch2HCS conditional by inversion (COIN) mutants will be compared to that of wild type mice and determined by contact radiography, densitometry, micro CT scanning and histomorphometry. The biomechanical properties of the skeleton from HCS mutant mice will be analyzed; (2) To determine the mechanism responsible for HCS in the skeleton. To this end, mechanisms responsible for the skeletal phenotype will be established, and we will determine whether the Notch canonical signaling pathway is responsible for the HCS phenotype. In addition, we will explore interactions with Wnt signaling, and determine whether Notch2 mRNA and protein are stabilized in cells from Notch2HCS mutants and explain the phenotype observed. Levels of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of genes modified by Notch2HCS mutants will be examined in vitro; and (3) To determine the role of Notch target gene(s) in the skeleton and in the HCS. To this end, we will determine whether the Notch2HCS mutant phenotype is secondary to the activation of Hairy-Enhancer of Split (Hes) 1. Notch2HCS mutants will be studied in the context (or not) of the conditional Hes1 inactivation for changes in their skeletal phenotype determined by micro CT scanning and histomorphometry and for changes in osteoblastic gene expression."

"9324060","PROJECT SUMMARY Mammals, including humans, are generally considered to have lost the capacity to regenerate their limbs after amputation. However, both human and mouse are able to regenerate the extreme tip of their digits through a true regeneration response similar to that observed in amphibians. This regeneration response establishes the foundation on which we can explore methods to stimulate more extensive regeneration in humans. The mouse digit is a good mammalian model because its regeneration process closely resembles that in humans. The extreme distal tip can regenerate via the formation of a bud of undifferentiated cells (a blastema). But amputations and injuries in more proximal level of the digits and limbs usually result in scar wounding. In these clinically more important situations, the inability of blastema formation is the biggest barrier for successful regeneration. In our studies on limb regeneration in the anuran amphibian, Xenopus laevis, and on the normally non-regenerating middle phalanx amputations in mouse, we have demonstrated that transplantation of a fibrin matrix containing limb progenitor cells, in the presence of additional growth factors, can stimulate regeneration of a complete limb in Xenopus and regrowth of bone in mouse digits. However, the overall regeneration of the amputated digit in mouse is still limited. In this project we propose to achieve good regeneration by constructing a vascularizable 3D fibrin scaffold to mimic a regeneration blastema for transplanting to the digit stump after middle-phalanx amputation. We will generate specific progenitor cells from iPS cell lines established in our labs and engineer a 3D fibrin scaffold for transplantation to test our hypothesis that a mimicking regeneration blastema can stimulate regeneration. We will determine the optimal conditions for constructing a regeneration-stimulating matrix and investigate the tissue interactions between the host and donor and within the donor scaffold. The outcome of this project will establish an approach for stimulating digit regeneration, with the engineering of a transplantable, re-vascularizable 3D scaffold containing a combination of multiple types of progenitor cells and growth factors. Since the cell supply is based on iPS cells, a successful outcome will lead directly to the ability to make similar transplants for repair of human digit and limb injuries."
"9386587","Abstract/Summary: Subarachnoid hemorrhage affects 40,000 Americans in the prime of their lives; half of them will die in 12 months, and one third of the survivors will have a poor cognitive outcome. The only treatments we can offer these patients in the Neuro-ICU are securing the aneurysm with a clip or coils and giving them a 32-year-old drug called nimodipine. Neither of these treatments addresses the red blood cell-induced cerebral inflammatory response which persists. Our preliminary, as well as published, data establish a role for TLR4 and microglia individually. In this proposal we will be investigating the function of cell specific TLR4 within the innate immune system. Specifically, we have created 2 novel conditional knockouts of TLR4 on microglia and myeloid cells. We will measure fever, neuronal apoptosis, hematoma clearance, and cognitive outcome in these novel conditional knockout mice to determine the extent to which the tissue resident macrophage versus neutrophil affects these outcomes. Furthermore, we will also be examining the in vivo effects of lack of TLR4 on inflammatory and apoptotic pathways using western blot and pharmacological inhibitors of TLR4-dependent inflammation. To our knowledge, the role of TLR4 in hematoma resolution has not been examined, let alone in a cell-specific manner, nor have cerebral inflammatory and apoptotic signal transduction pathways in these novel conditional knockouts. Based on our findings, novel strategies to tip the balance between TLR4-dependent inflammation and apoptotic inhibition may be exploited. Additionally, our preliminary data indicates that TLR4 might have a role in hematoma clearance; a cell-specific strategy might be employed to decrease hematoma burden and abrogate the RBC-induced cerebral inflammatory response."

These structures are incredibly small, less than 1 femtoliter in volume, and remarkably plastic in their functional properties. Unique ensembles of protein networks that are enriched within postsynaptic structures orchestrate the development, maintenance, and plasticity of synapses. Genetic mutations associated with risk for intellectual disability, schizophrenia, autism, and other developmental brain disorders (DBDs) are predominated by genes encoding synaptic proteins. These observations have led to the hypothesis that many DBDs are synaptopathologies that alter synaptic development and function. However, while histological evidence in human postmortem samples and mouse models supports this theory, the molecular mechanisms of synaptic pathology remain poorly understood. This proposal will address this gap in knowledge by combining recent advances in CRISPR-genome editing paired with two highly innovative proteomics approaches we have developed to enable: 1) the discovery of synaptic protein complexes in vivo that are associated with DBDs and 2) how these complexes are disrupted in diverse models of DBD. This will significantly advance our understanding of potential synaptopathic mechanisms that may be comorbid across DBD mutations. Uncovering these molecular mechanisms of synaptopathology can be expected to lead to better insights of disorder etiology and potential therapeutic approaches."
"9352560","Project summary  Efficiency of CTL responses against viruses and cancer may vary and is often linked to MHC class I (MHC-I) variants and repertoire of available T-cell receptor (TCR). This suggests that parameters of TCR interactions with peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands control the quality of CTL responses. Adoptive transfer of in vitro activated or engineered T cells with the specificity of interest has proved to be a useful modality to treat viral infection or cancer (1-3). However, this approach often causes off-target toxicity in vivo (4, 5). On the other hand, HIV elite controllers are capable of controlling the virus without any treatment (6, 7) and utilize selective clonotype of HIV-specific TCR genes (8). These and other findings led to a notion of an ?optimal? TCR (7). Similarly, optimal TCRs have been implicated in ?excellence? of cancer-specific T cells (10). Based on these and our previously published data (11-13), we hypothesized that a particular combination of TCR, peptide, and MHC-I variants determines the initiation of a rapid proximal signaling that is linked to efficient CTL response. To test the hypothesis, we will utilize HLA-A2 and HLA-B57 MHC-I proteins that contain mutations associated with either control of HIV infection (?favorable?) or those that are linked to HIV progression (?unfavorable?). We will solve crystal structures of selected cognate soluble scTCR bound to the pHLA-A2 or pHLA-B57 ligands that carry favorable or unfavorable mutations in the MHC moieties. Using X-ray data, we will delineate the mode of TCR engagement, i.e., relative TCR orientation over pMHC, and will calculate the pattern of molecular interactions at the interface of the TCRs with favorable and unfavorable pMHC proteins by means of Nobel Prize winning technique, Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM), using supercomputer available at Moscow University. We will then perform virtual TCR CDRs maturation to modify TCRs recognizing unfavorable pMHC and will select variants of the receptors whose interactions with unfavorable pMHC ligands would become favorable as established by QM/MM calculations, mode of TCR engagement, and measurements of the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the TCR-pMHC interactions. Results of the proposed experiments are expected (i) to reveal optimal mode of TCR engagement by pMHC that facilitates greater contribution of MHC-bound peptide to TCR binding and faster kinetics of TCR-pMHC interactions; (ii) to demonstrate the ability to convert unfavorable mode of TCR interactions to favorable one that is associated with an optimal TCR signaling and efficient CTL response.  The novel strategy will allow to engineer effective virus- or cancer specific CTL that could be utilized for adoptive transfer therapy to treat viral infection and cancer."
"9348065","PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds all of new HIV infections in the United States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) are the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence. Among youth, 67 percent report not disclosing to their first time sex partners.4 Disclosing of one?s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved medication adherence and retention in care. Those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners5 and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%.6,7 Further, disclosure may motivate uninfected sex partners to seek testing and reduce their own HIV transmission behaviors. Given the potential benefits and challenges associated with disclosure, there is a need for sophisticated interventions that can assist MSM, with the disclosure process. Virtual reality provides a unique environment for users to practice HIV disclosure. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven disclosure may offer advantages over in-person role play through the use of realistic avatars that represent potential romantic partners, and probabilistic settings where users envision having disclosure conversations. Users have the opportunity to practice disclosing and experience a variety of responses and outcomes. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research. The aims of this Phase II SBIR are: 1) Refine and enhance the current Tough Talks disclosure scenarios to include additional content, characters and virtual environments. Formative work with YMSM (aged 16-29 years) will inform development and we will work with a leader in AI software to incorporate natural language into the AI driven scenarios; 2) Develop the Tough Talks stand-alone intervention. This fully automated intervention will include the AI driven disclosure scenarios created in aim 1 as well as a virtual disclosure coach to guide participants through the intervention goal-setting interactive exercises and interactive educational videos. Following development, a technical pilot to optimize functionality and technical performance will be conducted with 8-10 YMSM and; 3) Conduct a three-arm combined efficacy/effectiveness trial to compare the intervention delivered online (Arm 1) versus in the clinic (Arm 2) compared to standard of care (SOC) disclosure messaging only. Primary outcomes of HIV viral load and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) will be assessed at intervention completion (1 month) and at 6-month follow-up. We will estimate transmissions averted and program costs of each arm (Months 19-36)."
"9364079","Abstract Our goal is to understand the mechanism by which a large family of transport proteins moves small molecules and ions across biological membranes. In recent years it has become apparent that many families of transport proteins are related at the structural level. The transporter proteins are responsible for moving a wide variety of substrate molecules across cell membranes. They mediate neurotransmitter re-uptake in the brain, sugar and amino acid transport in kidney and intestine, iodide transport in thyroid, and many other important transport processes that are critically important in health and disease. These transporter families are all based on a protein fold containing two structurally similar repeats in opposite orientations relative to the membrane. Recent structural evidence indicates that transport requires a conformational change in which a 4-helix bundle rearranges within the protein structure. However, the ability of these transporters to accumulate substrates within the cell using the coupled movement of ions is a separate issue not addressed by previous studies. The specific aims of this project are to use biochemical, biophysical and computational approaches to test proposed mechanisms, and to understand how binding of substrate and ions can trigger conformational changes relating to the movement of the bundle and the consequent opening and closing of permeation pathways."
"9492988","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our laboratory has conducted two research programs at the interface of chemistry and evolution. In the first program, we developed new approaches to protein evolution and protein delivery that have dramatically increased their effectiveness. In the second program, we developed a new approach to the synthesis and discovery of bioactive small molecules that combines powerful aspects of biological evolution with synthetic organic chemistry. The resulting method of DNA-templated synthesis has enabled DNA sequences encoding synthetic molecules to undergo translation, selection, and amplification paralleling biological evolution. This proposal seeks to integrate these two research programs into a single effort under a Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA).  In the first program, we developed a system that enables proteins to evolve continuously in the laboratory, requiring virtually no researcher intervention. The resulting system, phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), allows proteins to undergo directed evolution at a rate ~100-fold faster than conventional methods. We propose to apply these developments to continuously evolve four classes of proteins or RNAs, each with the ability to manipulate the covalent structure of genes or gene products, and each with potential relevance to the development of next-generation human therapeutics: recombinase enzymes that insert DNA of interest into safe-harbor loci in the human genome, proteases that specifically cleave disease-associated proteins, orthogonal Cas9 (CRISPR) nucleases with altered PAM specificities and enhanced activities, and smart Cas9 guide RNAs that mediate genome engineering only in those cells that are in specific disease-associated cell states. Success would establish the novel therapeutic potential of these proteins and RNAs to address a wide range of human diseases, including many human genetic disorders.  In the second program, we developed the foundations of DNA-templated synthesis, generated libraries of DNA-templated small molecules, and performed in vitro selections on these libraries for affinity to an initial set of targets of biomedical interest. The results led t the discovery of novel kinase and protease inhibitors with remarkable selectivity and potency, including the first physiological inhibitor of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). We used this compound in mice to validate inhibition of insulin degradation as a potential therapeutic strategy for improving glucose tolerance. We propose to develop second-generation IDE inhibitors with increased therapeutic potential, to explore our recent discovery that IDE inhibition can lower blood pressure in vivo, and to expand the application of this approach by creating a new DNA-templated library of >250,000 macrocycles and to selecting this library for binding to >150 protein targets implicated in human disease. These efforts will collectively result in the evaluation of more than 30,000,000 potential small molecule-protein interactions in a manner that leverages the remarkable efficiency of in vitro selection, PCR, and modern DNA sequencing."
"9291430","Project Summary/Abstract ? Project 3  Type-1 diabetes (T1D) is a serious autoimmune disease, whose incidence has been steadily  increasing in recent years. It results from an immune attack on the pancreas by the patients T cells  that selectively eliminates the insulin-producing beta cells that reside in the organs Islets of  Langerhans eventually. The risk of developing T1D is tied to both environmental and genetic factors.  The main genetic factor is tied to the polymorphisms in the genes encoding Class II molecules within  the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHCII).   The usual function of MHCII molecules is usually to capture antigenic peptides derived from  foreign proteins for presentation to and activation of CD4+ T cells in order direct these cells fight off  infections. Since MHCII molecules can also capture and present peptides derived the host's own  protein, the immune system has developed an elaborate two stage mechanism for preventing these  self-peptides from inducing an autoimmune response against the hosts on tissues. The first stage  involves a pre-check of CD4+ T cells in the thymus early in their development eliminating T cell whose  antigen recognizing receptor (TCR) can engage an MHCII molecule containing a self-peptide. The  second stage involves a set of regulatory T cells in the peripheral organs to deal with T cells that have  somehow escaped the thymic pre-check. However, under the right conditions some of CD4+ T cells  specific for certain peptides derived from pancreatic islet proteins sneak through both of these filters  to cause T1D. The main objective of Project 3 is to determine why the T cells specific some  pancreatic peptides are deleted in the thymus, while others are not, and to see if this information can  be used to beef up the peripheral regulatory T cells to prevent the activation of the escapees.   In Project 3 our main hypothesis is that the thymic escapees recognize peptides that bind poorly in  the thymus to the relevant MHCII risk alleles and therefore break through the thymic first filter. We  will test this hypothesis by altering the expression of various pancreatic peptides in the thymus to see  what effect this has on the appearance of CD4+ T cells of those specificities. We will also test the  idea that by engineering the relevant peptide to bind better to the MHCII risk alleles we can create a  ?super agonist? that can be used to delete pathogenic T cells or to boost the activity of the peripheral  regulatory T cells to prevent the activation of the pathogenic ones."

"9382210","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Prostate cancer remains a worldwide public health issue and cause of mortality, with annual diagnosis and mortality rates exceeding 1.1 billion and 307 million patients, respectively.1 Brachytherapy is widely accepted and utilized in the management of prostate cancer. Due to recent evidence showing improved disease control in patients with potentially lethal cancers using approaches incorporating brachytherapy, its utilization is expected to increase. Successful brachytherapy hinges on adequately dosing prostate while avoiding excessive radiation to adjacent tissues. Well-recognized contributors to poor dosimetry are source positioning errors, poor source visualization and edema, which in aggregate lead to regions of excessive as well as inadequate dose.  In response to the recognized need for dynamic visualization of sources and intraoperative dose analysis during the procedure, our work has led to the development of a system of intraoperative ultrasound and fluoroscopy (iRUF) dynamic dose calculation using fluoroscopy-based seed reconstruction and fusion with intraprocedure ultrasound imaging. Following our pilot feasibility trial, we developed an FDA-approved dedicated brachytherapy platform, and have confirmed this technique in a Phase II trial, with outstanding dosimetry on a consistent basis.2,3  Currently, whole-gland treatment is standard in prostate cancer therapy. The need for whole-gland treatment stems from the uncertainty and difficulty in precisely identifying tumor foci within. Unfortunately, such approaches inevitably result in radiation exposure of adjacent critical structures, with potential toxicity and permanent quality of life effects. As long as whole gland therapy is delivered, the ability to limit normal tissue doses remains constrained by their proximity. New advances in PET imaging targeting Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and second-generation PSMA-binding agents now allow highly specific and sensitive identification of extraprostatic and intraprostatic tumors.4,5,6 Focal therapy using PSMA PET/CT-and dynamic dosimetry-guided seed placement promises to further improve the standard of care in brachytherapy, allowing the physician to precisely tailor the dose to the individual?s tumor. This requires precise tumor imaging combined with dynamic intra-operative localization of the implant in relation to the target volume, as well as surrounding uninvolved prostate and normal anatomy.7,8,9,10 Combining iRUF and PSMA PET/CT would break new ground through addition of precise targeting via purely computational methods.  We aim to develop a clinically feasible image-guidance platform for dynamic, quantitative evaluation of partial-gland, focal dosimetry during brachytherapy. The system would allow personalized brachytherapy, achieving excellent cancer control while avoiding unnecessary toxicity for prostate cancer survivors."
"9285795","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to combine two novel technologies in order to improve the capacity of pancreatic islet transplants to cure type 1 diabetes. The first technology involves transplantation of vascularized islets in the form of composite islet-kidneys (IK), which has the capacity to cure both diabetes and renal failure in swine and baboon model as we have recently demonstrated. In this protocol, pancreatic islets obtained after partial pancreatectomy are first transplanted under the autologous kidney capsule to allow for re- vascularization, and then the composite islet-kidney is transplanted in a recipien diabetic animal. Though composite autologous IK technology substantially reduces the extent of graft damage due to immunologic events, there is still considerable islet loss in IK composite due to hypoxia and ischemic loss ultimately requiring a 70% pancreatectomy of the living donor. To improve IK composite survival and significantly reduce the number of donor islets we propose to use the second technology that utilizes theranostic magnetic nanoparticles as carriers for siRNA, which upon accumulation in islet cells could silence genes responsible for islet damage prior to IK creation. In addition to serving as siRNA carriers these theranostic nanoparticles could be used as in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporters providing information about graft volume longitudinally and non-invasively. We have previously shown the applicability of this technology for improving graft survival in a mouse model of transplantation. In this application we propose to investigate pre-clinical utility of this approach in non-human primates by delivering siRNA-nanoparticle probes targeting genes implicated in apoptosis to islets prior to creating the IK composite. Specifically, we will target caspase 3, caspase 8 and Fas, alone or in combination, as the most important mediators of apoptosis. In vivo MR imaging will be used to monitor autologous IK graft volume followed by continuous imaging of the IK transplant in recipient diabetic animals since magnetic nanoparticles are retained in the islets long term. We expect that by targeting apoptotic genes we will reduce the damage to the islets in autologous IK composite and as a consequence will reduce the number of donor islets required for IK composite to correct hyperglycemia in diabetic recipients. By further minimizing the amount of excised pancreas and non-invasive assessment of islets volume by the MN-siRNA technology, the clinical applicability of this procedure will be more favorable for living donor IK transplantation."
"9373285","The human immune system is often exposed to bacterial ligands through interactions with the microbiome and infections. Bacterial biofilms are associated with numerous human infections. The predominant protein expressed in enteric biofilms is amyloid curli that forms highly immunogenic complexes with DNA. Infection with curli- expressing bacteria or systemic exposure to purified curli-DNA complexes of Salmonella biofilms trigger autoimmunity via the generation type I interferons and anti-double stranded (ds)DNA. However, the mechanisms involved in the pro-autoimmune effects of curli/DNA complexes remain unknown.  The primary objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms by which bacterial amyloids are recognized by the immune system, leading to their pathogenic effects in the host. Our central hypothesis is that curli/DNA complexes are pathogenic molecules that act by accessing multiple cellular compartments and engaging several Pattern Recognition Receptors, including, TLR2, TLR9 and NLRP3 resulting in inflammation and autoimmune responses. It is our expectation that successful completion of the proposed studies will identify bacterial amyloids as a novel powerful Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) that is recognized by the immune system via multiple receptors and establish a new paradigm that infections with amyloid- expressing bacteria are major environmental trigger fir complex human diseases."
"9429481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of childhood obesity may have started to plateau for some groups of children, other groups such as low-income and minority children are experiencing increases in childhood obesity. These growing disparities may be linked to unanswered questions regarding the home environment and childhood obesity. For example, research has shown that healthful food availability/accessibility in the home, frequent family meals, and authoritative parenting style are associated with healthful dietary intake, bette psychosocial health, and fewer unhealthy weight control behaviors in youth, but findings are inconsistent across studies with minority and low-income families. These conflicting findings suggest that mixed- methods studies are needed for an in-depth examination of the home environments of diverse families to identify potential explanatory mechanisms of childhood obesity that may have been overlooked in prior research. In addition, previous studies have not included state-of-the-art measures that may help illuminate factors in the home environment that differ by race/ethnicity. The primary objective of this study is to identify how familial factors, including interpersonal relationships that exist between family members, of racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children act as risk or protective factors for predicting childhood obesity. To achieve this objective, a two-phased incremental mixed-methods approach will be used. Phase I (yrs. 1-2) will include in-home observations of diverse families (n=120; 20 each of African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Hmong, Somali and white families) to identify individual, dyadic (i.e., parent/child; siblings), and familial factors that are associated with, o moderate associations with, childhood obesity. The in-home observations, using our community-based participatory research partners, will include: (1) an interactive observational family task and family interview; (2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 17 of parent stress, mood and parenting practices; and (3) child accelerometry and 24-hour dietary recalls. Using state-of-the-art measures, such as EMA, will allow for identifying within-day fluctuations in parenting practices or parent stress levels, which may help to identify nuances within the home environment that amplify or exacerbate childhood obesity risk. Results from the in-home observations will be used for rich analyses and to inform the development of a culturally-appropriate survey in Phase II (yrs. 3- 5). The survey will be administered at two time points to a diverse sample of up to two caregivers (n=2400) of children ages 5-7. Individual, dyadic, and familial factors that are longitudinally associated with child BMIz score and weight-related behaviors will be identified. Phase I and II recruitment will occur via the electronic Primary Care Research Network in Minnesota primary care clinics (n=82). This comprehensive evaluation of diverse home environments will identify potential factors that increase childhood obesity risk in order to create culturally-tailored interventions that will be effective in reducing childhood obesty disparities."
"9337979","ABSTRACT The Philippines is currently experiencing one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in the world. HIV prevalence in the Philippines had initially remained low and dormant until 2006, but in 2007 an epidemic shift occurred such that HIV transmission became attributed primarily to male same-sex behavior. Following this turning point the HIV epidemic has expanded rapidly, with an estimated 812% increase in reported cases from 2008-2013 and 90% of new surveillance cases concentrated in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. Health services in the Philippines currently do not adequately meet the HIV prevention, testing, or treatment needs of the country?s most vulnerable populations such as MSM and transgender women. This lack of HIV services parallels the limited capacity in the Philippines to conduct high-quality research on HIV prevention/treatment and to design effective interventions with vulnerable populations such as MSM and transgender women. The University of the Philippines Manila (UPM) is the premier health sciences research university in the Philippines, and is strategically positioned to be a leader in HIV research with vulnerable populations. However, UPM currently lacks a sizable cadre of research scientists who have the training to conduct cutting-edge HIV prevention/treatment research with MSM and transgender women, and lacks necessary coursework and curriculum to train the next generation of HIV research scientists in the Philippines. The proposed D43 training program will respond to this need by establishing a partnership between UPM and Brown University. This training program builds on a previous successful partnership and collaboration between UPM and Brown: the Fogarty AIDS International Training Research Program (AITRP), which trained 21 HIV scientists in the Philippines on clinical aspects of HIV infection, basic HIV epidemiology, and behavioral prevention counseling. The program will further expand research and educational/curricular capacity at UPM by accomplishing the following Specific Aims: (i) Use long-term training to expand the cohort of research scientists focusing on HIV intervention research with MSM and transgender women in the Philippines (2 PhD and 5 Master?s students over 5 years); (ii) Facilitate revision and expansion of UPM curriculum on HIV interventions with vulnerable populations; (iii) Establish an annual Workshop for Research on HIV Interventions with Vulnerable Populations, based at UPM, for dissemination of research findings, professional networking, and mobilizing new research projects. This program proposal represents a long-term commitment and collaboration between researchers at both partner Universities, and planning of this program was informed by consultation with clinical professionals, governmental and non-governmental HIV service providers, and stakeholders in the Philippines. The training plan aligns with priorities set forth in the Trans-NIH strategic plan on HIV/AIDS, by improving the infrastructure for research training capacity and growth of the current body of scientific knowledge on HIV in this rapidly growing epidemic in the Philippines."
"9256533","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this renewal R01 is to advance our understanding of the biology and pathology of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2), whose mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a large and complex protein (285kD) including a kinase and a GTPase domain. Previously multiple lines of evidence have led to a gain-of-function hypothesis that LRRK2 pathogenic mutations cause increased kinase activity that is attributable to the neurotoxicity. Recent studies in cell cultures implicate LRRK2 in vesicle trafficking, neurite outgrowth, cytoskeletal dynamics, protein translation and degradation, mitochondria dynamics and inflammatory response. Importantly, the study of genetic animal models show that the pathogenic LRRK2 mutations impair dopamine transmission without causing neurodegeneration, suggesting a pathophysiological role of LRRK2 in neurotransmission at early disease stage prior to neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence has also linked LRRK2 to neuroinflammation that is a contributing factor to neurodegeneration in PD. But the precise mechanisms whereby LRRK2 mutant mediate the neural dysfunction and neurotoxicity remain unclear. Therefore, we hypothesize that (1) LRRK2 regulates SV protein functions and neurotransmission that is impaired by LRRK2 pathogenic mutations; 2) LRRK2 plays a critical role in neuroinflammatory response in glial cells; LRRK2 mutants deregulate glial inflammatory pathway and cause neurotoxicity in PD. Our specific aims are to (1) determine the pathogenic role of LRRK2 in SV traffic and neurotransmission; (2) examine dysfunctional LRRK2 in glial neuroinflammatory response. A major challenge of LRRK2 research is the lack of well-defined neurodegeneration models of LRRK2 that are relevant to the PD pathogenesis. In fact, the incomplete disease penetrance of the common mutation G2019S suggests a significant contribution of environmental factors to PD pathogenesis. Our third aim is then to test the hypothesis in animal models that LRRK2 causes neurodegeneration in PD through genetic lesion and environmental toxin-linked neuroinflammation. Successful completion of the study not only will gain insight into LRRK2 biology and pathophysiology, but also will deliver valuable cell and animal models for interrogating neurodegenerative pathways in PD and developing platforms for LRRK2 inhibitor screening."
"9397899","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Most children treated for cancer in the US will achieve long-term survival, and survivorship presents unique challenges for this growing population. Brain tumor survivors are at particular risk for a range of functional impairments, including cognitive, educational, and social difficulties. Cranial radiation therapy is an essential lifesaving treatment but is associated with cognitive decline. Proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) is one of the most promising recent advances in pediatric brain tumor treatment. The proposed medical advantage of PBRT lies in the precision of radiation delivery with proton beams, depositing maximum dose to clinical targets while minimizing radiation to surrounding tissues. By eliminating unnecessary radiation to surrounding healthy brain tissue, PBRT may spare cognitive functioning better than conventional photon or x-ray irradiation (XRT).  Using volumetrics and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we will examine associations between white matter (WM) toxicity and neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric brain tumor patients treated with PBRT. Study 1 is a prospective, longitudinal study of WM change and associated neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric brain tumor patients treated with PBRT vs. Surgery Only followed from diagnosis through Early Survivorship. Specific aims include: (1) to compare change in WM volume/integrity over time by treatment group (PBRT vs. Surgery Only and vs. healthy controls (HCs)), and (2) to examine associations between WM toxicity and neurocognitive test scores over time. Study 2 is a cross-sectional study of associations between WM and neurocognitive outcomes during Intermediate Survivorship for pediatric brain tumor survivors treated with PBRT vs. Surgery Only with the following specific aims: (1) to compare WM volume/integrity in survivors by treatment type (PBRT vs. Surgery Only and vs. HCs), and (2) to examine associations between WM toxicity and neurocognitive test scores. Study 3 is a cross-sectional study of WM associations with neurocognitive outcomes during Late Survivorship for pediatric brain tumor survivors treated with PBRT vs. XRT including the following specific aims: (1) to compare WM volume/integrity in survivors by treatment group (PBRT vs. XRT and vs. HCs), and (2) to examine associations between WM toxicity and neurocognitive test scores.  This proposal is consistent with NCI's objective to ?reduce the long-term adverse effects of cancer and its treatment? in children and to ?improve the quality of life for cancer patients, survivors, and their families.? Neurocognitive late effects lead to significant educational, social, and occupational limitations for many survivors, greatly affecting their quality of life and functional independence long-term. Research is needed to determine which treatments are best able to limit the suffering associated with post-treatment neurocognitive decline. Our results will have clinical value, providing a timely report of WM correlates of neurocognitive functioning and comparison between treatment modalities."
"9380009","ABSTRACT  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Cigarette smoking is the most important causal factor. The smoking cessation program and antismoking campaign over the past 50 years has reduced the prevalence of cigarette smoking by two-thirds in the US. Currently there are more former smokers than current smokers. However, former smokers remain at high risk of lung cancer even after quitting smoking for many years. Majority new lung cancer cases occur among former smokers. Unfortunately preventive intervention for lung cancer among former smokers is still lacking. This proposed proof-of-principal study is to evaluate the chemopreventive potentials of sulforaphane, a natural product formed from glucoraphanin in certain cruciferous vegetables, on reducing the cellular and molecular risk biomarkers of lung cancer pathogenesis.  Sulforaphane and other isothiocyanates derived from cruciferous vegetables have shown promising chemopreventive properties in preclinical animal experiments, and in epidemiological studies and short-term randomized clinical trials in humans. Dietary intake of sulforaphane significantly reduced the incidence of tobacco-carcinogen induced lung adenocarcinoma in animal models that mimicked the scenario as former smokers, along with the concurrent reduction of cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and the increase of apoptosis markers caspase-3 and TUNEL. In short-term clinical trials in humans, intake of sulforaphane enhanced the detoxification of environmental carcinogens and reduced Ki-67 index. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that high intake of cruciferous vegetables or isothiocyanates was associated signficantly with reduced risk of lung cancer in humans. However, clinical trials with a relatively long-term treatment of sulforaphane on the modulation of lung cancer pathogenesis biomarkers are lacking.  This proposed randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial will enroll 72 former smokers at high risk for lung cancer. All subjects will be randomly assigned to either treatment (daily minimal dose of 120 µmol sulforaphane for 12 months) or placebo. Bronchoscopy-guided bronchial biopsy and brushing, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasal brushing, blood and urine samples will be collected pre- and post- intervention. The specific aims are (1) to determine if sulforphane modulates the changes of bronchial dysplasia index, cell proliferation marker Ki-67, and apoptosis markers caspase-3 and TUNEL in bronchial biopsies, all of which have shown to be directly associated with lung cancer pathogenesis; and (2) to determine if sulforaphane modulate the changes of the gene expression markers in bronchial and nasal epithelia that have been shown to be directly linked to the development of lung cancer. The findings of the proposed study will have significant public health implication in reducing lung cancer incidence and mortality in former smokers. The ultimate goal is to develop, evaluate, and validate the efficacy of this readily available, widely accessible, inexpensive, natural compound as a primary chemopreventive agent."

The Institute of Medicine deemed that sustaining and nurturing the research interests of residents is vital to the future of psychiatry research.  This proposal systematically addresses these issues through four specific aims: AIM 1 will establish an Enhanced Research Curriculum for a broad-based exposure to research approaches and critical thinking for all residents. This aim will incorporate formal didactics, hands-on experiental learning activities, exposure to faculty researchers in a Particle to Professor Series, a Mentor Match program to facilitate early integration with program faculty and their research programs, and a two-month Research Intensive Elective to engage and embed motivated residents in research labs in the PGY-2 year. AIM 2 will establish the CSTP Recruitment and Admission process to proactively identify and engage promising residents for participation in the structured, mentor-based CSTP research track. We anticipate the Emory CSTP will become an attractive draw for applicants to the general psychiatry residency program, thus further promoting recruitment of promising physician scientists. AIM 3 will establish the CSTP Mentored Research Track, where CSTP research track residents will have protected time for mentored research and intensive research didactics as well as specialized research training available through the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute. AIM 4 will establish the Evaluation and Dissemination component of the CSTP, which will monitor measurable benchmarks of progress for research track residents and the program, and will work toward engaging other residency programs to incorporate Emory CSTP strategies to promote resident research training.  The overarching goal of the Emory CSTP is to supplement an already thriving and successful Psychiatry Residency Training Program with a strong, research-focused component that includes enhanced research training for all residents, while providing specialized mentored research training opportunities for residents poised to become physician-scientists. The proposed program emphasizes increased access, proactive engagement and innovative mentored research opportunities through internet-based strategies, experiential research learning activities, mentorship throughout residency and exposure to innovative research faculty and research programs in areas including neuromodulation, the neurobiology of fear and trauma-related disorders, behavioral immunology and endocrinology, neurodevelopment, translational social neuroscience and community psychiatry. Given a solid research training base, ongoing faculty support, mentorship, and independent research experiences as well as specialized research training, CSTP research track residents will be well-equipped to pursue academic careers, working to solve the most pressing problems in psychiatry."
"9373088","PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly."
"9377035","Project Summary Anxiety and trauma-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder are common and debilitating mental health disorders, but conventional treatment options are limited in long-term efficacy. Common therapeutic strategies aim to enhance fear extinction, the process by which the fear response to a fear-eliciting cue decays over time. However, fear extinction memories are labile and susceptible to the return of fear (relapse), even following successful extinction. Unfortunately, many of the manipulations that have been reported to enhance fear extinction memory either have not been tested for their ability to reduce fear relapse, or have failed to reliably do so. Identification of novel strategies to prevent fear relapse after extinction is thus of utmost importance to mental health. The nigrostriatal dopamine (NS DA) pathway, consisting of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) projecting to the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), is classically considered in the context of motor behavior, but growing evidence supports a role for NS DA in emotional regulation. Further extending the purview of NS DA functions to include fear extinction learning, we observed that increasing high-frequency (phasic) activity of the NS DA pathway during fear extinction with viral-mediated chemogenetic techniques enhances extinction memory and prevents the return of fear after extinction. Phasic DA release preferentially signals through low-affinity D1 receptors, and our preliminary data suggest that D1 receptors in the DMS mediate the observed effects of NS DA pathway activation. We observed both that 1) neurons expressing D1 receptors in the DMS are recruited during fear extinction learning, and 2) pharmacological activation of DMS D1 receptors during fear extinction strengthens fear extinction memory. These data suggest that the NS DA pathway represents a previously unidentified component of fear extinction; activation of which could strengthen extinction. Harnessing NS DA during extinction could be especially important for females, who have a particularly high prevalence of anxiety, as well as a fear extinction retrieval deficit when fear extinction is learned during phases of the estrus cycle when estrogen is low. Consistent with the idea that phasic activity of NS DA enhances relapse- resistant fear extinction, we observed that voluntary exercise increases phasic DA release in the DMS, strengthens fear extinction, and reduces fear relapse in males. In females, exercise rescues the fear extinction retrieval deficit present when extinction is learned during estrus phases when estrogen is low. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis, supported by our preliminary data, that NS DA represents a novel circuit for the enhancement of relapse-resistant fear extinction in males & females. Using chemogenetic, neurochemical and pharmacological strategies, we aim to determine whether activation of the NS DA pathway & D1 receptor signaling in the DS 1) enhances the learning of relapse-resistant fear extinction & 2) is necessary for the ability of acute exercise to augment fear extinction & prevent relapse."
"9339735","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are common neurodegenerative disorders that are progressive, fatal, and without effective treatment. Recently, the most common known cause of ALS and FTD was identified as an intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72 (C9FTD/ALS). This repeat triggers synthesis of toxic proteins via a process known as Repeat Associated Non-AUG (RAN) Translation. These RAN peptides kill neurons and are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in model systems. We know very little about how RAN translation at C9 repeats (C9 RANT) actually occurs. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms underlying C9 RAN and to identify methods of blocking it as a first step towards novel therapeutic development. Our central hypothesis is that C9 RAN utilizes a non-canonical translational initiation pathway that can be selectively blocked. Moreover, we predict that preventing C9 RAN will stop neurodegeneration elicited by GGGGCC repeats. To test these hypotheses, we developed robust and quantitative in vitro and cell based assays of C9 RANT, as well as a collection of models derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells, rodent neurons, and Drosophila. Using these tools, we will define the mRNA species that undergo C9 RANT, identify the critical RNA and protein based factors that allow for C9 RANT and test whether suppressing C9 RANT by modulating the surrounding sequence or protein factors can block toxicity in model systems. Together, these studies should provide us with a working map of how C9 RAN occurs and what steps can be taken to prevent it. This project has broad reaching implications both for our understanding of how RAN translation contributes to disease as well as providing a logical path towards therapeutic development in C9FTD/ALS and other neurodegenerative nucleotide repeat disorders."
"9258917","Project Abstract  Mitochondrial diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of genetically inherited disorders resulting from mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear encoded genes that cause failures in mitochondrial energetic and metabolic function which, in the most severe cases, will lead to death. Incidence rates of 1:5000 have been reported placing mitochondrial disorders as one of the most commonly inherited human diseases. To date, there are no effective treatments, and as such, represents an urgent medical need to develop new technologies and platforms to uncover novel therapeutic opportunities. Identification of specific targets and drugs that increase mitochondrial bioenergetics can be of therapeutic value to treat mitochondrial diseases. To address this goal, we performed an unbiased high-throughput chemical and complementary genome-wide CRISPR editing screen in trans-mitochondrial hybrid (cybrids) cells harboring a mutation in a mitochondrial encoded complex I subunit. The IBET 525762A bromodomain and extraterminal domain (IBET) inhibitor emerged as the most potent compound to enhance the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity in these cells. IBET 525762A functionally targets bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) and its inhibition enhances oxidative phosphorylation genes, protein, and activity. Furthermore, Brd4 inhibition promotes human cybrid cell survival under high energetic demands and protects against galactose-induced cell death (a standard clinical assay to identify mitochondrial defects). To explore the mechanism detailing how Brd4 inhibition controls mitochondrial bioenergetics, a series of comprehensive biochemical and metabolic analysis will be performed. Two specific aims will be assessed. In the first aim, we would like to explore on a molecular and functional level how Brd4 controls mitochondrial gene expression programs in cybrid cells. We will map the occupancy and interacting partners of Brd4 to gain insights into this mechanism. Aim 2 will assess the cellular, metabolic, and bioenergetic effects of Brd4 inhibition in other human cybrid and patient-derived fibroblasts cells with diverse mitochondrial disorders. We will determine if IBET 525762A-mediated increases in the OXPHOS program can persist to other cellular models of mitochondrial disease. The results from the proposed studies will improve our understanding of how Brd4 inhibition restores mitochondrial energetic function in mitochondrial disease cellular models. This will lead to the development of effective therapies for patients with mitochondrial disorders."
"9410700","Zika virus (ZIKV) has been identified as a neuroteratogen similar to the TORCH agents cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rubella. Neurotropic teratogenic viruses such as CMV cause a wide range of sequelae in the infected human fetus and infant, yet we have little definitive information about the range of outcomes related to congenital Zika syndrome. These questions are difficult to study, largely due to the rapid emergence of Zika virus and our incomplete understanding of the virus's natural history and mechanisms of pathogenesis. However, our previous research on congenital CMV in the rhesus monkey model offers a precedent and template for improved appreciation of Zika virus pathogenic outcomes, and for the rational design of diagnostic, preventative, and interventional strategies for this rapidly spreading global teratogen. The studies in this proposal capitalize on our considerable expertise with the rhesus CMV (RhCMV) in utero infection model, which defined the pathology associated with disease and has been used to investigate the safety of new vaccines and protective interventions. It has become increasingly apparent that environmental factors such as infectious teratogens and inflammation together exert a persistent or even lifelong impact on neurodevelopment and immune function. The objectives of these studies include the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the fetal immunologic effects of placental ZIKV and test if immune activation is associated with the extent of central nervous system (CNS) infection, neural precursor cell loss, and brain malformations. In these investigations we will test the hypothesis that Zika virus infection results in maternal cell ingress, alteration of decidual cytokine production, increased microchimerism, and fetal/neonatal systemic inflammation. (2) Evaluate the impact of neonatal ZIKV infection on immune activation, immune ontogeny, and neurodevelopment. In these studies we will test the hypothesis that in neonates, Zika virus infection has a significant correlated influence on immune function and neurodevelopment. Overall, these investigations will provide new insights into the developmental perturbations resulting from Zika virus infection, and will leverage our experiences in developing outcome metrics and interventions that can protect the fetus and infant from the devastating consequences of congenital disease."
"9265059","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in wide range of human malignancies, and their enhanced growth potential suggests a major role in cancer initiation, maintenance, relapse, and progression. However, the scarcity of data demonstrating CSCs are clinically important and the lack of clinically applicable targeting strategies are the critical gaps that must be addressed before the CSC hypothesis can become a basis for the treatment of cancer patients. The candidate for this K24 award is an Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University who has begun to build a translational and clinical research program focused on CSCs and has established a strong track record of patient-oriented research, peer-reviewed funding, and successful mentoring. This group originally isolated CSCs in multiple myeloma (MM), identified novel CSC-targeting strategies, translated these laboratory findings into innovative clinical trials, and developed novel biomarkers to quantify CSCs in the clinical setting. This research has significantly advanced basic knowledge regarding CSCs and led efforts to test their clinical significance. A critical part of the success f this program has been the mentoring and training of young and early investigators in patient-oriented research. Specifically, the candidate has been committed to providing guidance for the acquisition and mastery of skills to formulate significant and innovative hypotheses from important clinical questions, execute sound and rigorous scientific inquiry to decipher disease pathogenesis and develop novel therapeutic approaches, translate these findings into clinical trials, and carry out meaningful correlative studies addressing the original hypothesis in the clinical setting. Through this K24 application, the candidate seeks support and protected time to improve his mentoring skills and expand his research expertise. In terms of mentoring, he will carry out a deliberate plan of didactic course work, mentorship from a senior academic leader, and a structured plan of mentoring his trainees within the context of the proposed research plan. With respect to new research skills, the candidate will gain expertise in a new area, bioinformatics, through coursework and supervised training with leading bioinformatics experts while carrying out the proposed Specific Aims. Finally, the candidate will expand his research program by exploring the tumor microenvironment and probing specific genetic changes within MM CSCs through next generation sequence analysis. The research Aims will lead to the development of new biomarkers that can act as surrogates for CSCs and address the hypothesis that CSCs correlate with clinical outcomes. A second hypothesis is that novel therapeutic targets based on these experimental approaches can target MM CSCs. Accordingly; the scientific Aims of this proposal are to (1) determine the clinical relevance of MM CSCs and (2) identify novel strategies to inhibit MM CSCs. These training and scientific endeavors will significantly expand the candidate's research program and improve his mentorship skills to further build a leading and paradigm-shifting program in CSC-focused patient oriented research."
"9384427","Project Summary/Abstract  Engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) initiates a complex cascade of stimulatory and regulatory signals that orchestrate highly precise control of T cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. We have recently defined TCR-induced autophagy (TCR-IA) as a novel mechanism that regulates TCR signal transduction via highly selective degradation of key signaling molecules. We have shown that TCR-IA is independent of Vps34, the class III phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) implicated in most autophagy pathways. Our preliminary data suggest that TCR-IA is dependent on class I PI3K and inositol phosphatases, including SHIP1/2 and Inpp4A/B. In studies of the terminal steps in TCR-IA, we have demonstrated that the selective targeting of T cell signaling intermediates to autophagosomes requires a cytoplasmic signaling complex we have named the ?POLKADOTS signalosome,? in which the multi-functional adaptor molecule p62 plays a central role. Our recent data show that the signaling adaptor, Bcl10, is targeted to the TCR-IA degradative pathway via interaction with p62. We have also shown that degradation of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p27, requires p62 expression, suggesting that p62 is a crucial component of a molecular machine (the POLKADOTS signalosome) that directs TCR-IA-dependent proteolysis of specific targets.  The purpose of our proposed studies is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that connect antigenic stimulation of the TCR to selective degradation of targets of TCR-IA, and to determine the consequences of disruption of terminal steps in this pathway on T cell effector differentiation and function. We will achieve these goals through three Aims. The goal of Aim 1 is to define the cytoplasmic signaling pathway by which TCR signaling leads to de novo production of autophagosomes, with a particular emphasis on SHIP1/2 and Inpp4A/B. Our studies in Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanism by which p62 and POLKADOTS signalosome partners direct TCR-induced selective autophagy of target molecules. In Aim 3, we will use an inducible p62 knockout model to determine the role of p62 and p62-dependent TCR-IA in generation of in vivo T cell effector responses. Together, we expect these data to define key molecular mechanisms in the TCR-IA pathway, and to define how TCR-IA impacts T cell differentiation for control of pathogen infections. This work may ultimately lead to novel and highly specific strategies for manipulation of in vivo T cell responses, which may be applicable to diverse human diseases such as autoimmunity, transplant rejection, and cancer."
"9271175","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The legalization of marijuana in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington is the most dramatic change in U.S. substance abuse policy since the end of Prohibition. These states are implementing regulatory and enforcement systems for the retail sales of recreational marijuana to adults 21 years or older, akin to state controls on the sale of alcohol. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued directives that it would monitor whether these states implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that among other DOJ priorities, prevented distribution of marijuana to youth. A retail sales intervention that has been effective at reducing illegal alcohol sales to minors (and intoxicated patrons) is alcoholic beverage server training (or Responsible Beverage Service training - RBS). Recently, Colorado enacted a law for incentivized responsible marijuana vendor (RMV) training, Oregon will require RMV training, and Washington proposes to incentivize it. In SBIR Phase I research, our team established the feasibility of creating and evaluating an online RMV training by a) exploring the concept/content of RMV with owners/managers and clerks in retail outlets and state and local regulators and enforcement officials; b) examining under-age sales with owners/managers, clerks, and underage individuals; c) developing and evaluating a prototype RMV training, Way To Tend, in an outline and storyboards and by programming one module with retail outlet personnel and local officials; d) identifying licensed marijuana retail outlets eligible for a randomized trial; and e) estimating current refusal rates of sales of marijuana to minors with a pseudo-patron (PP) buyer assessment. An Expert Advisory Board (EAB) comprised of state and local regulators, licensed retail cannabis sellers, and experts in responsible beverage service from these states confirmed the feasibility of the Way To Tend training. In this SBIR Phase II application, we propose to 1) produce the Way To Tend responsible marijuana vendor (RMV) training presenting retail marijuana sales laws, methods for preventing sales to minors (i.e., ID checking and preventing third party sales), the health effects of marijuana (e.g., driving under the influence; fetal exposure; dosing; and safe storage), and rules of the trade (e.g., tracking and safety procedures and sales to intoxicated patrons) and 2) conduct a randomized trial of Way To Tend in a sample of 150 retail marijuana outlets in Colorado, Oregon and Washington against control outlets who receive usual and customary (UC) training and examine Way To Tend's impact on RMV outcomes (refusals to PP without apparently valid IDs). The long-term objectives of the SBIR research are urgently needed and extremely significant as increased drug availability is linked to marijuana initiation. The proposed research will have a very large impact. Our effective RMV training by a third-party (not the cannabis industry) will be a first-of-its-kind for a highly uniqe circumstance, the first legal U.S. retail marijuana markets. The commercial potential for Way To Tend is untapped and potentially very large, for the market is poised to grow tremendously as more states consider legalization of marijuana."
"9397704","Project Summary/Abstract African American (AA) women have a 40% higher breast cancer mortality than U.S. women of European ancestry (EA). This disparity reflects a number of underlying factors, including differences in clinical presentation [e.g., later stage at diagnosis and higher incidence of more aggressive tumors such as estrogen receptor negative (ER-) tumors] and distribution of established risk factors. One of the strongest and most well- established risk factors for breast cancer in EA populations is high mammographic density (MD), which refers to the proportion of breast tissue comprised of fibroglandular tissue (vs. adipose tissue) and can be readily measured on screening mammograms. Yet, there is very limited knowledge about the determinants of high MD or associations of high MD with breast cancer risk in AA women. Of the three studies to date, each with <200 cases in AA women, only one found a statistically significant association. To address these gaps in knowledge, we propose to establish a mammogram repository within the Black Women?s Health Study (BWHS), an ongoing cohort study of 59,000 AA women with over 20 years of comprehensive epidemiological and clinical data. Multiple screening (pre-diagnostic) full-field digital mammogram images will be retrieved for 6700 women, including at least 700 incident breast cancer cases. This resource will constitute the largest screening mammogram repository among AA women in the U.S. with individual-level risk factor data spanning 20 years. Percent and absolute MD will be quantitatively measured on all mammogram images using an established and validated interactive thresholding technique. The overarching goals of this research are to understand associations of MD with breast cancer in AA women and to identify predictors of high MD in this population. Relative risks will be precisely estimated for associations of high MD with breast cancer overall in AA women and, for the first time, by ER subtype. AA women have been greatly underrepresented in research on MD to date. This population-based research overcomes methodological limitations of the few previous studies and will generate new knowledge that is critical and necessary to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. The large sample size ensures sufficient statistical power for carrying out the Aims proposed here as well as for providing a database for future research questions that will no doubt emerge with advances in the field of digital mammography imaging. In summary, this innovative research has great potential to advance current knowledge about breast cancer etiology in AA women, to inform opportunities for risk reduction or prevention, and to close the gap in racial disparities in breast cancer. In particular, information gained from the proposed research will be useful for risk prediction models for breast cancer in AA women."
"9381376","Project Summary  Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are berry- or balloon-like defects in the wall of a major intracranial artery and are present in 1-2% of the population. They commonly result in subarachnoid hemorrhage, which leads to death in 30-40% of the patients. There is currently no effective therapy to treat SAH and only limited treatment options to prevent IA rupture. Both environmental and genetic factors have been attributed to the aneurysm formation; however, the genetic factors and their underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown.  We have identified mutations in collagen COL22A1 as potential contributors to the development of IAs in human patients. In the Familial Intracranial Aneurysm study, led by our collaborators, whole exome sequencing resulted in identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a highly conserved region of COL22A1 present in only affected family members. However, biological function of COL22A1 is currently not known, and it is not clear if the identified mutation is causative of aneurysms in humans.  We propose to use a zebrafish model to determine the function of COL22A1 in maintaining vascular integrity and to identify potential therapeutic strategies that would lead to the prevention of aneurysm formation and rupture. The protein sequence of COL22A1 is highly conserved between humans and zebrafish, and the zebrafish have emerged as a highly advantageous model system for in vivo analysis of vascular function and disease mechanisms. Our preliminary data indicate that COL22A1 zebrafish mutants display increased susceptibility to hemorrhages and show abnormal vascular dilations comparable to aneurysms in human patients, while inducible expression of the human mutant SNP results in increased frequency of hemorrhages in zebrafish embryos. We hypothesize that COL22A1 is involved in regulating vascular integrity and permeability and that mutations in COL22A1 cause intracranial aneurysms. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the functional role of COL22A1 in the maintenance of vascular stability; 2) Determine if mutations in COL22A1 cause intracranial aneurysms; 3) Perform a chemical screen to discover drug candidates that suppress hemorrhages in COL22A1 mutant embryos. Zebrafish COL22A1 mutant embryos and adults will be analyzed for morphological and functional defects. The human mutation will be modeled in zebrafish by creating a knock-in allele using a CRISPR / Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair and analyzing it for IA related phenotypes. A chemical library screen will be performed using zebrafish COL22A1 mutants to identify candidate drugs that may compensate for the deficiency in COL22A1 function.  The proposed project will identify the biological function of COL22A1 homolog in vivo. It will further determine if mutations in COL22A1 cause IAs, and identify drug candidates that can be used for IA treatments. Understanding genetic causes of aneurysms will enable screening to identify patients at risk and will promote development of new treatments that can prevent devastating consequences of intracranial hemorrhages."

"9331934","Thiazides are one of the most cost-effective and medically beneficial first line antihypertensive agents. However, they don?t work for everyone, and in some patients they may lower blood pressure for a while but then wear off. The mechanisms responsible for thiazide resistance have been mysterious, until recently. Our recent systems-biology investigations revealed a salt-transport process is activated by a novel mechanism to limit urinary salt wasting when NCC, the thiazide target, is inhibited or hypokalemic intravascular volume depletion occurs. We discovered that a salt reabsorption pathway is created by the coordinate induction of a multi-gene transport system in non-? intercalated cells, highlighting the Cl/HCO3- exchanger, pendrin, alpha-ketoglutarate (?-KG) and the ?-KG G-Protein Coupled Receptor, OXGR1. Our recently published and preliminary data strongly suggest that paracrine delivery of ?-KG stimulates OXGR1 in non-? cells and this activates pendrin, stimulates salt reabsorption, and potentially lowers the diuretic response. Here, we have assembled a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team to rigorously test the central tenants of the ?- KG /OXGR1/pendrin hypothesis (Aim 1), explore the underlying molecular mechanism(s) linking OXGR1 to pendrin activation (Aim 2), elucidate the physiological stimuli and consequences of the Renal ?-KG/OxGR1 Paracrine system (Aim 3), building on our recent discoveries. We expect these investigations will have a major impact on understanding how the kidney controls salt balance in health and disease, in ways that illuminate the central underpinnings of the variable diuretic response. Ultimately, these studies will provide new information and diagnostic tools that lead to the better treatment of hypertension."
"9293219","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One in three community dwelling people over age 65 and one in two over age 80 fall each year. The consequences of falls among older adults are often devastating, resulting in loss of independence, institutionalization and premature mortality. Falls also are responsible for greater than 20 billion dollars a year in healthcare costs in the United States. Although many fall prevention strategies targeted against clinical risk factors have been tested, their success in reducing falls has been modest. Current falls research in aging is mostly focused on clinical predictors of falls and there is a knowledge gap regarding underlying biological and neural mechanisms of falls. Emerging evidence from our and other studies implicates biological derangements in inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular pathways in the occurrence of disorders of gait, balance, and cognition, which are major risk factors for falls in older adults. We hypothesize that abnormal biological pathways initiate atherosclerosis leading to cerebral vascular damage that increases risk of falls in older adults. We draw together a multidisciplinary team to conduct high-quality research to establish biological and neural mechanisms of falls building on our extensive cognitive and mobility research. We will cross-enroll 530 participants, age 65 and older, from the ongoing Central Control of Mobility in Aging study offering a cost and time efficient strategy to study biological and neural mechanisms of falls. This proposal will employ rigorous clinical assessments, many developed and validated in our other aging studies, to assess fall risk. We propose the following three synergistic aims focusing on our common theme of biological and neural contributions to falls in aging. 1). Determine biological mechanisms (inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular pathways) contributing to falls. 2). Establish contributions of central microvascular pathology to fall risk using state of the art neuroimaging techniques. 3). Establish the contribution of the prefrontal cortex to falls using an innovative functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), that enables imaging during walking. While biological risk factors for falls are potentially modifiable, the paucity of data is a critical barrier for translation to clinical interventions. While many fal prevention strategies targeted against clinical risk factors have been tested, their success in reducing falls has been modest in research settings and even less so in the real world. A deeper understanding of underlying biological mechanisms and neural substrates for falls may lead to more efficient risk identification and improve the effectiveness of current interventions for fallsin older adults."
"9370652","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease."
"9382701","PROJECT SUMMARY Chromatin structure is highly dynamic and can be modulated through a number of different mechanisms, including nucleosome remodeling, histone post-translational modifications and, relevant to this proposal, the nucleosomal incorporation of histone variants. This proposal focuses on the macroH2A histone variants, which are primarily associated with condensed chromatin and inactive genes, and act as tumor suppressors across a spectrum of cancers (Vardabasso et al., 2014). We showed that macroH2A variants inhibit tumor growth and metastatic potential of melanoma cells (Kapoor et al., 2010). Here we will use a unique macroH2A double knockout (dKO) mouse model (Pehrson et al., 2014) to study cancer initiation and progression in the absence of macroH2A variants in vivo. We previously used these mice to demonstrate that macroH2A isoforms present a barrier to the reprogramming process of somatic cells towards a pluripotent state (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2013). However, macroH2A-deficient animals have yet to be crossed with any genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. Owing to the importance of macroH2A in suppressing melanoma progression and our unpublished studies showing a defect in mammary gland differentiation coupled to increased stem cell activity, we hereby propose to model melanoma and breast cancer in the context of a living organism. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of macroH2A in suppressing melanoma pathogenesis by crossing macroH2A dKO mice to an established melanoma mouse model (Tyr-Cre/BRAFV600E/Pten-flox) (Dankort et al., 2009). We will investigate whether loss of macroH2A isoforms promotes tumor growth and/or metastasis in the induced tumors. These analyses will be coupled to xenograft models, as well as genetically defined melanocytes and melanoma cell lines in vitro for probing the underlying molecular mechanisms of macroH2A tumor suppression via genomic approaches. In Aim 2, we will challenge the macroH2A-deficient mice by crossing them to an established mammary tumor model (MMTV- NeuY1227D). Given the mammary gland phenotype we identified in the dKO mice, as well as the loss of macroH2A isoforms in human breast cancer specimens, we hypothesize that in the presence of mammary driver mutations, macroH2A dKO mice will develop more proliferative and invasive cancers. These studies will also be coupled to genomics approaches. In both aims, we will determine which macroH2A isoforms, domains and modified residues allow inhibition of tumor development by reconstituting macroH2A in mouse and human cells devoid of this histone variant. This unique mouse colony provides us with exciting opportunities for studying macroH2A histone variant regulation in development and cancer, allowing for a deeper understanding of human disease."
"9381966","Aim of this research is to understand why endocrine ?-cells in the pancreas of diabetic patients fail, with an eye toward identifying new genetic, biochemical, and cellular pathways that can be exploited as therapeutic targets to prevent and reverse this disease process. This grant has supported several original and widely reproduced discoveries, identifying a homeostatic loop orchestrated by Foxo transcription factors that integrates disparate hormonal and nutrient signals into a gene expression program intended to preserve ?-cell function and identity. Signal achievements of this work have been the demonstration that ?-cell failure can be due to ?-cell dedifferentiation into an endocrine progenitor-like state, and their partial conversion into other pancreatic cell types. Since the last competing renewal, this grant has supported five major new findings: (i) metabolic inflexibility (i.e., a curtailment of the ability to transition from lipids to glucose as energy source) is a hallmark of early b-cell dysfunction; (ii) ?-cell mass is genetically programmed by the number of endocrine progenitor cells in the developing pancreas; (iii) increasing ?-cell mass does not necessarily improve function, as proliferating ?-cells display reduced insulin secretion; (iv) ?-cell dedifferentiation, initially described in experimental animals models of diabetes, occurs also in humans with type 2 diabetes; and finally (v) identification of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 isoform A3 (ALHD1A3) as a marker of failing murine and human ?-cells that allows the pursuit of genes involved in the transition from a metabolically inflexible to a dedifferentiated ?-cell. The PI proposes to extend this work with the following specific aims: In Aim 1, to develop mouse models of ALDH1A3 gain- and loss-of-function and test whether ALDH1A3 affects ?-cell mitochondrial function or differentiation, and to investigate the different patterns of ALDH1A3 expression in human and rodent islets using single-cell transcriptome analyses. In Aim 2, the PI identified cytochrome b5 reductase isoform 3 (Cyb5r3), as a candidate contributor to ?-cell failure. Cyb5r3 is involved in mitochondrial function and FA synthesis. In this aim, they will test the involvement of Cyb5r3 in ?-cell dysfunction by developing mouse models of loss-of-function. In addition, they will address the role of Cyb5r3 in ?-cell mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid synthesis. In Aim 3 the PI shows, using genome-wide histone acetylation analyses, that Foxo ablation in ?-cells results in an enrichment of active enhancers containing Hnf4a motifs, indicating a mechanistic relationship between these two transcription factors. Using a newly developed in vivo reporter of real-time Foxo1 activity, they will combine epigenetic and cell biological analyses to understand how Foxo cooperate with other important ?-cell transcription factors, starting with Hnf4a, with the goal of identifying shared pathways mediating ?-cell failure."
"9275039","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in the field of motor control is to understand how descending systems control spinal cord interneurons (INs). However, descending axons target thousands of spinal INs and form complex neural circuits. This complexity limits the usefulness and efficiency of conventional investigation techniques. To solve this roadblock and accelerate progress, we recently developed alternative approaches that transfer functional connectivity studies to the in vitro mouse. We use optical imaging to record individual and population neuronal activity following stimulation of subcortical descending systems. This novel approach allows us to study synaptic connections in descending networks with an efficiency and throughput that has not been possible previously in mammals. In this proposal, we focus on a major player in motor coordination, the reticulospinal (RS) descending system. We propose to identify the functional connections between RS neurons and a population of commissural INs with descending axonal projections called dCINs. CINs are strategically interposed between RS input and motor output to play an important role in locomotor rhythm generation and interlimb coordination. However, they are heterogeneous with respect to transmitter phenotype, input-output connectivity and functional role during movement. We have begun to elucidate organizational principles of RS-dCIN system and made two important preliminary findings. We found; (i) two distinct groups of medullary RS neurons that differentially activate axial and hindlimb motoneurons, and (ii) three subpopulations of dCINs that respond to either RS group or to both. Thus, RS neurons are organized in discrete groups that recruit dCINs selectively. Here, in Aim 1, we propose to test two forms of selectivity that RS neurons may use to recruit dCINs. First, we will test segmental selectivity by taking advantage of the known spinal segmental differences in composition of axial, flexor and extensor motoneurons. Then, we will test transmitter phenotype selectivity using transgenic approaches. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine the extent to which RS-dCIN recruitment depends on the excitability and behavioral state of the spinal motor network. Successful completion of these aims will significantly advance our understanding of the functional organization of the RS system both during quiescence and during the active engagement of a complex motor behavior. Our long-term goal is to define organizational principles by which brainstem descending systems control motor output via spinal interneurons. Such knowledge will undoubtedly provide greater insight into circuit dysfunction after injury and aid identify rational strategies for moto recovery."
"9261509","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene targeting is a technique used to precisely manipulate a specific chromosomal sequences in living cells. It is used to study how genes function and to correct mutations that can cause disease. Since 1999, this grant has funded our research on the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for gene targeting. In that time we have characterized several aspects of the AAV gene targeting technology, which involves a single- stranded linear DNA vector genome that is efficiently delivered to the cell nucleus. Unique aspects of the AAV technology include high targeting frequencies in normal mammalian cells without the use of site-specific nucleases to stimulate recombination, versatility in the typs of sequence changes that can be introduced, high accuracy, and efficient gene targeting in living animals. Because of these advantages, many labs have now used AAV vectors in their gene targeting experiments, and it is being developed for clinical applications as well.  In the lat funding period we studied targeting on a genome-wide level for the first time, and we engineered the chromosomes of human pluripotent stem cells (ESCs and iPSCs), which are especially important for understanding and treating human diseases. Here we propose to extend these studies in three ways. First, we will use strand-specific vectors to understand how the single-stranded vector genome recombines with the chromosome, and how this relates to the transient single-stranded regions observed during chromosome replication and transcription. Second, we will identify and then express small inhibitory shRNAs during the gene targeting process both to decrease random integration and to increase homologous recombination. Third, we will combine AAV targeting vectors with the CRIPSR site-specific nuclease system to introduce site-specific nicks that should increase targeting in vivo with minimal genotoxicity. These experiments will increase our understanding of the gene targeting mechanism, maximize the targeting frequencies that can be obtained by AAV vectors, and develop a robust technology for manipulating genes in human stem cells and in vivo applications."
"9296146","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The medical consequences of impaired selenoprotein synthesis became apparent with the identification by the PI of the first mutations in the selenocysteine insertion sequence binding protein 2 (SBP2) gene causing a syndrome of SBP2 deficiency. SBP2 is an essential factor required for the Sec incorporation and selenoprotein synthesis. Affected subjects present characteristic thyroid tests abnormalities that have not been identified in other inherited or acquired defects and have not been replicated by animal models targeting selenoprotein synthesis. Although the thyroid phenotype is presumed to be caused by abnormal function of the selenoenzymes deiodinases, the exact mechanisms responsible for this consistent pattern remain elusive. Other phenotypic components of this syndromic defect also reflect multiple selenoprotein deficiencies, manifested with growth delay, congenital myopathy, developmental delay, infertility, delayed puberty, complex immune deficits and metabolic parameters with increased insulin sensitivity. The only adult patient reported is 35 years old and has the most complex phenotype, manifesting most of the different abnormalities listed above. This raises concern for the possibility that the young patients known to harbor recessive SBP2 deficiency might manifest new health problems as they age. As many questions have been raised by the human phenotype of SBP2 deficiency, in-vivo studies in a model organism are required to fully assess the pathophysiology responsible for this pleiotropic phenotype. The current proposal addresses this need, using a mouse model of SBP2 deficiency generated by the PI. To bypass the early lethality of complete Sbp2 deficiency, a cre-estrogen receptor/loxP approach was employed to engineer induced mice Null/iCKO. Importantly, phenotypes of human SBP2 deficiency were replicated in the Sbp2 deficient mice. With this critical tool in hand this proposal aims to begin elucidate aspects of selenoprotein-mediated pathology by dissecting the pathognomonic thyroid phenotypes and the metabolic manifestations. To dissect the different components contributing to the unique serum thyroid function tests, components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis will be investigated in detail at baseline and in challenging conditions, such as exogenous thyroid hormone administration. Considering that certain selenoproteins act to promote adiposity and insulin resistance whereas others protect against it, the resulting metabolic phenotype of Sbp2 deficiency is the result of multi-organ contributions. Features of the metabolic phenotype will be investigated in Sbp2 deficient mice through detailed studies in metabolic tissues, metabolic parameters will be determined in mice studied in metabolic cages, at baseline and in challenging conditions when fed high fat diet. The results of the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the role of SPB2 in TH homeostasis and cellular metabolism, and lay the groundwork for a paradigm shift in our understanding of selenoprotein biology."
"9274997","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high prevalence of allergic airway diseases (AADs) including asthma and allergic rhinitis make identifying new disease prevention and treatment strategies a priority. Recent studies have shown that gene expression in airway epithelia is associated with AAD and may underlie different AAD sub-types. With few exceptions, the key transcriptional regulators of epithelial gene expression in AAD are unknown. Their identification represents an important step in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The identification of novel therapeutic targets has also been hindered by the lack of validated mouse models for AAD (in particular, sub-types of asthma). We hypothesize that we can identify mouse models of AAD that more closely mimic human AAD sub- types than currently exists using conserved patterns of gene expression as decision criteria. Further, we hypothesize that these new models can be used to identify and test novel disease targets. In Aim 1, we will build predictive models of transcriptional regulation in AAD in which master regulators of gene expression, namely transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are coupled to their target genes. We will first perform a meta-analysis of six transcriptomic studies of human AAD (N = 218 subjects: 118 asthma cases, 26 allergic rhinitis cases, and 74 controls) to identify genes consistently altered in AAD and which genes distinguish AAD sub-types. We will then identify putative master regulators of the differentially expressed genes (including subsets that are co-expressed) using gene set enrichment analysis for regulatory motifs (transcription factor binding sites and miRNA target sites). In Aim 2, we will identify new strains of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) population, which features enhanced genetic diversity compared to existing mouse genetics resources, that better mimic human AAD sub-types. We will phenotype 40 CC strains for hallmark AAD phenotypes in response to acute and chronic allergen exposure, and measure lung gene expression by RNA-sequencing. Using an innovative statistical approach of the RNA-seq data, we will identify which CC strains exhibit patterns of gene expression most akin to human AAD subtypes. At the same time, we will conduct gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed (and co-expressed) genes to identify key TFs and miRNAs that are shared between human and mouse. In Aim 3, we conduct the validation component of the grant. We will test whether novel candidate master regulators that are conserved between mouse and man (identified in Aims 1 and 2) represent new AAD therapeutic targets. We will perturb two candidate master regulators in vivo using gene knockdown and gene knockout approaches in mice. The effect of these perturbations will be evaluated in acute and chronic allergen models to test whether altering the master regulator can affect AAD onset and/or modify established AAD. Thus in total we will (1) identify conserved master regulators of AAD phenotypes, (2) establish new mouse models of AAD that better mimic human disease, and (3) evaluate whether master regulators of gene expression represent novel drug targets."
"9381905","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among US women and remains a major health threat with high incidence and lethality. Despite the remarkable progress made recently in deciphering the genetic mutations associated with breast cancer, our understanding of the mechanistic basis for metastasis and relapse of breast cancer is still very limited. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these properties of breast cancer cells that are ultimately responsible for patient lethality. FIP200 (FAK-family Interacting Protein of 200 kDa) was initially identified in our laboratory and subsequently shown to be a component of the ULK1/Atg13/FIP200 complex essential for the induction of autophagy. We have shown recently that FIP200 ablation inhibited the development and progression of breast cancer, providing the first evidence of a pro-tumorigenic role for autophagy in animal models with intact immune functions. We also developed an inducible system to delete FIP200 after tumor development in vivo and demonstrated that acute disruption of autophagy by FIP200 deletion in established tumors blocked their growth. In preliminary studies, we identified two distinct populations of breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) and showed that FIP200 ablation impaired the maintenance and tumorigenicity of both BCSCs. Our preliminary data implicated TGF-?/Smad and EGFR/Stat3 signaling pathways in mediating FIP200 regulation of these two BCSCs respectively. In another set of preliminary studies, we identified residues 582-585 in FIP200 for binding to Atg13 and generated a new FIP200 knock-in mutant mouse with these residues mutated to Ala (designated as KI allele, encoding FIP200-4A lacking binding to Atg13). Analysis of KI/KI mice and MEFs derived from KI/KI embryos showed both autophagy and non-autophagy functions of FIP200 in regulating different biological processes. These studies further revealed a new non-autophagy function of FIP200 to protect normal and transformed MEFs from TNF?-induced apoptosis. Thus this unique mutant KI allele as well as additional mouse models prepared in preliminary studies provides us with powerful tools for the genetic analysis of mechanisms of FIP200 regulation of breast cancer through its autophagy and non-autophagy functions in vivo. Based on these strong preliminary data and using our unique novel mouse models, we propose to 1) determine the mechanisms of FIP200 regulation of CD29hiCD61+ and ALDH+ BCSCs in PyMT and BRCA1-deficient mouse models of breast cancer; 2) examine autophagy and non-autophagy functions of FIP200 in the regulation of BCSCs and breast cancer development and progression; and 3) explore the strategies of targeting FIP200 autophagy and non-autophagy functions in BCSCs for breast cancer therapy. Together, these studies will provide significant insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis and relapse that may contribute to novel therapies for this devastating disease."
"9326736","Project Summary / Abstract  Cocaine addiction is a detrimental mental health dysfunction that drives aberrant goal- directed behavior. Data from animal models indicate that repeated cocaine exposure induces synaptic plasticity in the neural circuits for reward and motivation. These circuits, particularly the prefrontal inputs to the ventral striatum, are also thought to play important, though ill-defined, roles in decision-making information processing. Research using animal models to study cognition has been making progress in approximating the complexity of human information processing during deliberative decision-making. Work pioneered by the Redish Lab allows us to study, in rats, cognitive mechanisms dissociable in space and time underlying neuroeconomic decision-making strategies in a novel spatial navigation task. Having recently adapted this task from rats into mice, I now (1) have access to various Thomas Lab  mouse  models  of  drug addiction equipped with the ability to  apply  optogenetic  interventions  optimized  for  mice,  (2) have increased capacity for behavioral testing throughput in mice compared to in rats, and (3) have access to  other advanced transgenic lines readily available in mice enabling additional innovative future research approaches. Here, I propose to investigate (Aim 1) the effects of cocaine addiction on complex neuroeconomic decision-making behavior, and (Aim 2) to what extent in vivo optogenetic reversal of cocaine-induced changes in corticostriatal circuitry can ameliorate addiction-related changes in neuroeconomic decision-making behavior. The work proposed here is part of a larger collaboration translating this decision-making approach into healthy human and addiction patient populations coupled with functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging approaches. Of these collaborators, psychiatrist Dr. Kelvin Lim will be serving a role not only as a research mentor to me, but also as a clinical mentor throughout the remainder of my graduate and medical training. Together with my advisors, we will develop a translational research program seeing my thesis work through into the clinic during my proposed time here. The interdisciplinary collaborative research environment at the University of Minnesota is powerful and unique. As an MD/PhD student training across the neurology and psychiatry disciplines, the training plan proposed here will equip me with invaluable technical and career development skills I need in order to become an exceptional physician-scientist in academic medicine."
"9281620","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to characterize the changes in calcium regulation and cerebral metabolism associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using advanced microscopy. AD has a devastating impact on over 20 million people and their families worldwide, and the incidence rate is expected to double every 20 years. Understanding the mechanisms of AD-related deficits in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism is important for developing new diagnostic criterion and effective preventative therapies. Optical microscopy permits non- destructive, measurement of metabolic markers with high spatial and temporal resolution in animal models of human pathologies. Two-photon / lifetime microscopy has recently proven useful for measuring absolute calcium concentration ([Ca]) and measuring the reduced form of the endogenous electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), reportedly allowing the distinction of NADH species involved in glycolysis from NADH species involved in oxidative metabolism, with unprecedented resolution. Through the use of novel dendritic Pd-porphyrin phosphors, cerebral oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in brain tissue and vasculature can also be measured with high resolution using two-photon microscopy. The central focus of this project is to use two-photon / lifetime microscopy to measure cerebral NADH, [Ca], and pO2 in vivo in an AD mouse model at different disease stages. Characterizing the relationship between these metabolic markers as the disease progresses in vivo will provide detailed insight into the complex metabolic alterations involved in AD pathogenesis. The specific aims of this project are: 1. Develop and validate methods and instrumentation for near-simultaneous 2P measurement of pO2, and either [Ca] or NADH species. A two-photon imaging system will be upgraded and validated to feature two excitation sources, four detection channels, and custom-written control software, enabling non-destructive measurement of cerebral metabolic indicators in vivo. 2. Apply the microscope to identify cerebral NADH species and validate their association with specific metabolic processes in healthy mice Fluorescence lifetime imaging enables resolution between specific enzyme-bound formulations of NADH. The specific nature of these enzyme bound formulations will be comprehensively evaluated and characterized. 3. Apply the microscope to characterize cerebral metabolism in the exposed cortices of transgenic mice modeling AD pathogenesis The technology and knowledge obtained from aims 1 and 2 will be utilized to evaluate and compare cerebral metabolism in vivo in APPswe:PS1dE9 transgenic mice representing distinct stages of AD progression. This project will yield insight into the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis with unprecedented detail, and it will facilitate the development of new therapeutic techniques widely applicable to the growing population of at-risk aging citizens."

"9380787","PROJECT SUMMARY HL-142: Obesity and its accompanying metabolic disorders represent the great public health challenge of our time and is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adipose tissue (AT) expansion and remodeling is an ongoing process that is pathologically altered in the obese state, which is characterized by increased pro-inflammatory state, inadequate angiogenic response and fibrosis. Although adipocytes are key players orchestrating local changes in the microenvironment, much evidence also points towards a pivotal role for macrophages in such remodeling events, by affecting both adipocyte and endothelial cell (EC) angiogenic functions. Because angiogenesis is a rate-limiting step for AT remodeling, it is essential to understand the crosstalk between macrophages and ECs. It is accepted that obesity is accompanied by a change in the composition of macrophages, from an anti-inflammatory and angiogenic form, to a highly inflammatory form responsible for the negative outcomes that arise from obesity. Important players of the post-transcriptional regulatory network are the small non- coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), which have a demonstrated role in the control of transcriptional networks in M?s. Intriguingly, miRNAs can be transferred from cell to cell by exosomes, thus facilitating the exchange of information among cells. The molecular composition and content of exosomes may vary depending on whether the secretion is constitutive or a consequence of cell activation. We hypothesize that in obese AT, activated macrophages produce exosomes that contain a specific set of miRNAs that target ECs modulating their function, by controlling gene expression and therefore affecting AT expansion and remodeling. This project will: answer important questions regarding exosome specificity and function; provide critical insights into the contribution of macrophage-derived microRNAs as vehicles of paracrine communication between macrophage and ECs in the regulation angiogenesis in the AT. These findings will pave the way to the identification of innovative therapeutic strategies to modulate AT expansion and remodeling during obesity."
"9291428","Project Summary/Abstract  As the site of both negative selection of developing thymocytes and generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs),  the thymus plays a critical role in the multi-layered network of immune tolerance. The fate of a developing T  cell is dependent on the affinity of the interaction between the TCR and the peptide-MHC complex it  recognizes, with the highest affinity interactions resulting in deletion or Treg induction and lower affinity  interactions resulting in T cell survival and differentiation. The Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) is a major  transcriptional regulator of peripheral self-antigen expression within the thymus, and loss of Aire leads to  defects in negative selection due to reduced or absent thymic antigen expression in specialized medullary  thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Several lines of evidence point to this process as playing an important role in  the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Here, we will use type 1 diabetes as a model disease system to further  unravel how insulin-specific T cells arise from the thymus that are both T effectors and T regulatory cells.  Our specific aims are:  AIM1: Define the role of Aire and thymic insulin expression on the thymic deletion of insB(9-23) specific T cells.  AIM2: Define the repertoire and specificity of thymic Foxp3+ T regulatory cells selected by Aire-expressing  cells.  These studies will be performed in close collaboration with PPG projects 2 (Bluestone) and 3 (Kappler) and  will help improve our understanding of how the T cell repertoire is shaped in the thymus in the setting of type 1  diabetes."
"9298542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans 65 years and older is expected to increase to ~20% (1 in 5) from the current ~13% (1 in 8) over the next two decades. Scientific research efforts for resolving aging physiology constitute an effective approach towards understanding, treating and preventing the development of cardiovascular disease; the number one killer of American citizens and culprit for diminishing quality of human life. Aging is associated with under-perfusion of vital tissues and organs with an integral role for vascular endothelial dysfunction. In resistance arteries that control blood flow into the microcirculation, the interaction of Ca2+ and electrical signaling pathways underlying endothelium-dependent vasodilation involves endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH). Functional relationships support the initiation [e.g., activation of small- and intermediate-calcium-activated K+ channels (SKCa/IKCa)] and spread (via gap junctions) of hyperpolarization along and among the endothelium of network branches as a highly effective mechanism for coordinating tissue perfusion (i.e., oxygen delivery) with the metabolic demand of tissue parenchymal cells. Whereas aging is associated with oxidative stress (e.g., hydrogen peroxide production by mitochondria), there is a paucity of aging research concerned with EDH in the context of endothelial dysfunction underlying impaired tissue perfusion. Therefore, the goal of this project is to determine how mitochondrial-derived oxidative stress during aging interacts with endothelial cell Ca2+ and electrical signaling pathways that govern vasodilation and functional hyperemia. I will test the central hypothesis that the interaction of mitochondrial-derived Ca2+ and oxidative stress alter electrical signaling in the endothelium of microvascular resistance arteries. To investigate these relationships, I will employ a novel preparation of intact microvascular endothelial tubes, whereby freshly-dissected superior epigastric arteries of mouse abdominal skeletal muscle are treated to remove smooth muscle cells, adventitia, perivascular nerves and blood flow. Using intact endothelial tubes (length: ~3 mm, width: ~60 ?m) isolated from of Young (4-6 month), Intermediate (12-14 month), and Old (24- 26 month) C57BL/6 mice, I will employ simultaneous optical measurements of key signaling events (e.g., intracellular Ca2+ and H2O2 production) with intracellular recordings of membrane potential (Vm). Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which oxidative stress alters endothelial Vm via activation of (SKCa/IKCa) with advancing age. Aim 2 will determine the role of mitochondria in Ca2+ buffering to impact (SKCa/IKCa) for ensuing hyperpolarization with advancing age. Aim 3 will determine mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and evaluate its role governing Vm in old age. This project will uniquely determine the role of mitochondrial handling of Ca2+ and oxidative stress signals in native intact microvascular endothelium. Results from this project will provide critical new insight towards developing therapeutic strategies for reversing endothelial dysfunction to promote tissue blood flow and sustain the quality of life during aging."
"9464799","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Otitis media (OM) is the second most common disease of childhood, and an important OM pathogen that can cause both acute and recurrent disease is nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). We have identified a toxin-antitoxin protein pair in NTHi, VapBC-1, as being crucial for the ability of the organism to survive during experimental OM. Upon encountering stressful conditions, the VapB-1 antitoxin is degraded and the VapC-1 ribonuclease toxin is freed to cleave mRNA, arresting bacterial growth. This state of dormancy facilitates nonspecific antibiotic tolerance, as most antimicrobials are designed to inhibit essential cellular functions necessary for replication. Further, it allows a subpopulation f the infecting bacteria to survive treatment and resume growth, resulting in recurrent disease. Homologues of this protein pair are very highly conserved in numerous bacterial genomes. We intend to target this protease-mediated molecular switch and block the ability of the organism to go into stasis using a high-throughput screening approach to discover and validate novel chemical probes that interfere with VapC-1 toxin activity. These small molecule probes will inhibit the ability of the organism to enter into a bacteriostatic state, allowing antimicrobial therapy to kill the bacteria that were previously tolerant due to dormancy. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Use our innovative miniaturized and validated fluorescence-quenching ribonuclease interference assay to screen the NCATS library of small molecules for toxin-targeted compounds (TTCs); 2) perform secondary screens against the hits including a different detection wavelength, a specificity assay and a cytotoxicity assay; 3) validate the specificity of the non-cytotoxic TTCs in vitro using an engineered bacterial strain with inducible VapC-1 toxin expression, and 4) determine the effectiveness of the TTCs to treat NTHi infections of primary human respiratory tissues held at the air-liquid interface. Treatment with the chemical probes validated in this study could be used in conjunction with antibiotics to achieve a complete eradication of infecting organisms, giving clinicians a novel adjunctive therapy for their patients with recurrent disease."
"9272952","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory diseases are major causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality. These diseases are incompletely understood, which is a barrier to improving clinical care. Therefore, new mechanisms of disease need to be discovered. Optical imaging (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT]) will enable these discoveries since traditional imaging (e.g. x-ray, CT, MRI) cannot visualize structures smaller than ~1 mm. Microfluidic-scale cilia-driven fluid flow clears pathogen and allergen-containing mucus out of the lungs, yet we currently lack quantitative imaging technologies to characterize their flow performance. Moreover, while ciliary defects are traditionally considered a feature of rare but severe diseases (e.g. primary ciliary dyskinesia), development of biomechanical biomarkers extracted from quantitative flow imaging will allow us to test a paradigm-shifting hypothesis: intermediate defects in ciliary performance that are undetectable by current diagnostics are major modifiers of clinical severity in common respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma). Our research therefore has three aims. First, we will develop high-speed, cosine ambiguity-free Doppler OCT imaging systems. Cilia-driven fluid flow is three-dimensional in nature and not amenable to simplifying geometric assumptions such as parabolic flow profile. Traditional Doppler imaging suffers from cosine ambiguity that precludes the measurement of three-component flow velocities (v=vxi+vyj+vzk). We will develop a novel class of OCT interferometers that will enable three-dimensional, three-component flow imaging that will be demonstrated using the ciliated skin of Xenopus (tadpole) embryos, an important animal model in ciliary biology. Second, we will develop quantitative imaging assays of ciliary function that exploit cilia-driven microfluidic mixing. Taking a cue from work in biomimetic cilia, we have (a) demonstrated that ciliated biological surfaces can drive microfluidic mixing and (b) developed a novel microfluidic chip that uses a ciliated biological surface as a microfluidic component. Building on these results, we will demonstrate that our microfluidic mixing-based assay can quantify biologically relevant perturbations to ciliary physiology including increased fluid viscosity and altered planar cell polarity. Third, we will demonstrate intermediate defects in Xenopus and mouse ciliary function using quantitative imaging. We will target two different classes of genes relevant in the performance of a ciliated surface in Xenopus embryos: ciliary molecular motors and notch signaling proteins (notch signaling controls the density of ciliated cells on the embryo skin). Given the importance of mouse models of pediatric respiratory disease, it is critical to demonstrate that our optical methods can be used to quantify the performance of mouse respiratory cilia. Moreover, this is an important step towards translating our diagnostic technologies to use in humans. We propose to use flow imaging to quantify performance modified by increased fluid viscosity (mechanical perturbation to decrease ciliary beat frequency) and increased extracellular ATP (pharmacological perturbation to increase ciliary beat frequency)."
"9324643","ABSTRACT The proportions of fat mass (FM) and muscle mass (MM) in the body may have important implications for calibration of chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer (CC). Chemotherapy dosing is currently based on body surface area (BSA), which is derived from information on height and weight. Body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI), especially among cancer patients, is not an accurate measure of FM or MM. Given this inability to predict FM or MM, dosing by BSA may lead to underdosing (which may impact cancer-specific and overall survival) or overdosing (leading to dose-limiting toxicity [DLT] defined as toxicity from chemotherapy that requires subsequent reductions in or discontinuation of life-saving treatment). Results have shown that those with low MM, or sarcopenia, have a higher risk of DLT than those with normal MM. DLT impacts dose intensity and may compromise efficacy of chemotherapy. We propose to examine the effects of a randomized clinical trial conducted during chemotherapy of home based resistance training (RT) versus a waitlist control on DLT. Participants will be 180 newly diagnosed Stage II and III CC patients from Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC), the Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI), and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The intervention will begin during the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy and continue through the completion of treatment. Specifically, we will examine between group differences for resistance training versus weight list control for dose intensity and grade 3 and 4 toxicities as well as changes in MM and changes in inflammatory markers. Since approximately 40-45% of newly diagnosed CC patients have sarcopenia at diagnosis, we will examine if the benefits of exercise are greater for those who have low MM compared to normal MM. We will also examine specific inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6 and TNF-RII) as potential biomarkers of baseline MM, and determine how they change in response to RT. To determine effects of change of MM on chemotherapy-specific drug clearance, we will examine the impact of RT induced body composition changes on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 5-FU and oxaliplatin. If RT helps to reduce DLT and MM and inflammatory markers can identify those patients most-likely to benefit from tailored exercise guidelines, then assessment of these parameters can be used to help target high risk patients. Given that DLT is a common problem and there are large numbers of newly diagnosed CC patients with undetected sarcopenia, many of whom may require dose reductions due to low MM, this study has the potential to have a large impact on clinical care and improve prognosis of colon cancer."

"9309372","Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive primary brain tumor found exclusively in children. The median survival for DIPG patients is about one year from diagnosis, with no treatment in sight. Recent studies have uncovered driver mutations for DIPG, specifically, somatic mutations in the H3F3A gene have been observed in majority of DIPG cases. H3F3A encodes histone H3 variant H3.3 that plays an important role in regulating gene expression during development. The predominant mutation at H3F3A leads to amino acid change at lysine (K) 27 residue of H3.3 to methionine (M) (H3K27M). In human cells, there are two genes that encode H3.3, which is assembled into nucleosomes in a replication-independent nucleosome assembly pathway. In addition, there are 13 genes encoding canonical histones H3.1 and H3.2, which differ from H3.3 by 4 or five amino acids and are assembled into nucleosomes in a replication-coupled process. Lysine 27 is conserved among all these histone H3 proteins. Therefore, it is unknown how H3.3 K27M mutation, which occurs at one allele of H3F3A gene, promotes tumorigenesis. H3K27 is modified post-translationally by either acetylation or methylation. H3K27 methylation is catalyzed by the PRC2 lysine methyltransferase and plays an important role in gene silencing during stem cell differentiation and maintenance. We and others have shown that a global loss of H3K27 methylation occurs in DIPG cells containing K27M mutation, which is due to inhibition of PRC2 enzymatic activity by H3.3M27 mutant proteins. In addition to the global loss of H3K27me3 that is associated with gene activation, we also observed that H3K27me3 is present at the gene promoters of about 800 genes. These genes are largely silenced and are enriched in pathways associated with tumorigenesis. In addition, we performed an shRNA screen to identify genes that when depleted inhibit the proliferation of DIPG cells. We found that Wnt5a, a protein involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, inhibits proliferation of DIPG cells. Based on these exciting results, we hypothesize that H3.3M27 mutation proteins reprogram epigenetic states and gene expression of a key regulator(s)/pathway(s) and thereby promotes tumorigenesis. In this proposal, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby the 800 genes with H3K27me3 and determine to what extent ?gain? of H3K27me3 at these genes promotes tumorigenesis. In addition, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby Wnt5a and several components of Wnt5a signaling pathway are required for the proliferation of DIPG cells and test the hypothesis that inhibition of components of Wnt5a signaling pathway is a viable approach for the future treatment of DIPG. Together, the proposed studies will not only discover the molecular basis of tumorigenesis of DIPG, but also lay the foundation for molecularly targeted therapies for this deadly disease."
"9276678","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will assess the effectiveness and fidelity of a primary care-based, technology-enabled strategy to improve patient-provider communication about prescribed, higher-risk medications to ensure safe use. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that individuals lack essential information on how to safely take prescribed (Rx) medications. Knowledge deficits are greatest for information pertaining to risks and warnings. Inadequate patient knowledge has been cited as a root cause of unintentional misuse, which can lead to serious adverse drug events (ADEs). This is not surprising, as neither physicians nor pharmacists may routinely counsel patients on medication risks and safe use. Instead, patients depend on product labeling, which is limited in clarity and effectiveness. Our team has found that even when evidence-based, health literacy best practices are employed to these written tools, the elderly and those with low literacy continue to be inadequately informed and are therefore at greater risk for medication errors and/or suboptimal treatment. A risk communication and surveillance strategy is needed in primary care to ensure that patients are adequately informed about medication risks and are taking prescribed regimens safely. This is most salient for medications the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has deemed to possess serious public health concerns, warranting a Medication Guide and/or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). To our knowledge, no such strategy exists to support and monitor outpatient Rx use in a cost-sustainable manner. We devised an Electronic health record-based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) Strategy that leverages electronic health record (EHR) and interactive voice response (IVR) technologies to: 1) prompt and guide provider counseling, 2) automate the delivery of Medication Guides at prescribing, 3) follow patients post-visit to confirm Rx understanding and use, and 4) deliver a care alert back to providers to inform them of any potential harms. The proposed study targets 33 higher-risk medications commonly prescribed by clinicians at federally qualified health centers in Chicago. We will conduct a 2-arm, multi-site, physician-clustered randomized trial to: 1) Test the effectiveness of the EMC2 Strategy to improve patient understanding and use of higher-risk medications, and to increase the detection of medication errors and ADEs in primary care 2) Assess whether the EMC2 Strategy can reduce disparities in understanding and safe Rx use by patient literacy level, English proficiency, and age 3) Evaluate the effectiveness and fidelity of the EMC2 Strategy to promote provider counseling, deliver patient Rx information, monitor understanding and use, and inform providers of harms 4) Explore patient, provider, and system barriers to the implementation and effectiveness of the EMC2 Strategy 5) Determine the cost of delivering the EMC2 strategy in primary care from a health system perspective"
"9316430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging in humans is associated with a progressive decline in cognitive function, the consequences of which are enormous for affected individuals. Any scientific advance that could delay or prevent age-related cognitive decline would have a profound impact at every level of society given the demographic changes that are occurring with an exponentially increasing percentage of elderly individuals and the percentage of those individuals who are affected by cognitive decline. The use of animal models has greatly accelerated the pace of research on factors that influence cognitive function and age-related changes. One of the most robust interventions that can enhance cognitive function is physical activity. This has been shown in organisms ranging from rodents to humans. Despite the importance and potency of this intervention, the mechanisms by which exercise enhances cognitive activity remain elusive. Here we propose to test the provocative hypothesis that there are factors secreted by muscle that promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity to maintain cognitive function and that these factors are increased by muscle activity during exercise (exercise factors). This hypothesis is firmly rooted in the expanding field of research on muscle as a secretory organ, participating in various endocrine networks that function to regulate physiological phenomena such as energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and bone formation. Within the context of regulation of cognitive function, we propose that a muscle-brain axis is an evolutionarily conserved endocrine pathway that links two primordial organ systems, with muscle-derived factors promoting maintenance of neuronal homeostasis.  We will use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to explore this hypothesis in murine models of neurogenesis, neuronal function, and cognitive activity. Capitalizing on our expertise in plasma proteomics, we will characterize the muscle proteome from control muscle and muscle altered by exercise or aging. Both muscle and brain (hippocampus) will be tested for transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by exercise, both to explore the mechanisms by which exercise modifies muscular and neuronal function and also to test for any molecular memory to explain any persistent effects of exercise on the brain. Direct tests of secretomes will be performed using parabiotic pairings and plasma injections, and candidate testing will include studies of neurogenesis in vitro and muscle-specific gene deletions in vivo. These multifaceted approaches will allow us to characterize the muscle-brain axis, to examine the molecular basis and regulation of that axis with exercise, and to understand the basis for the lasting effects of exercise on neuronal activity, each of which would provide an entirely new framework within which to understand the beneficial effects of physical activity on brain function and together offering a potentially revolutionary approach to the treatment of age-related cognitive decline."

We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal."
"9392744","PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite rapid progress in defining distinct DNA repair pathways over the past few years, our knowledge of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in DNA repair remains incomplete. My laboratory is interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Since I started my laboratory in 1999, we have discovered and characterized many essential DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins. Our long-term goal is to reveal the complex regulation of the DNA repair network, which will permit us to meaningfully contribute to cancer biology and treatment.  This proposal focuses on 53BP1, a key component in DNA repair. Many years ago, our group was one of the first to demonstrate the role of 53BP1 in DNA damage response. We established the first 53bp1 knockout mice and revealed that 53BP1 is required for DNA repair and acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo. In addition, we elucidated the regulation of 53BP1 after DNA damage. In particular, over the past decade, we and others demonstrated that the H2AX-dependent DNA damage signaling pathway, composed of H2AX, MDC1, RNF8, and RNF168, controls the recruitment and accumulation of 53BP1 at sites of DNA breaks. In particular, we showed that 53BP1, because of its role in DNA repair, is critical for a particular repair process called class- switch recombination, indicating that 53BP1 is involved in a special DNA repair pathway that is distinctly different from the canonical nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Moreover, our recent studies and those of others suggest that 53BP1 controls two downstream sub-pathways and suppresses homologous recombination (HR) repair in BRCA1-deficient cells, which is critically important for response to cancer therapies based on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Together, these data highlight the existence of a bona fide 53BP1-dependent repair pathway that has not been thoroughly investigated. Our goals in this proposal are to further understand the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway and reveal mechanistically how it counteracts the HR repair pathway in response to DNA damage.  To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1) delineate the 53BP1-dependent end- joining repair pathway; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of the RIF1-REV7 branch of the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway; and 3) reveal mechanistically how the HR pathway operates in the absence of BRCA1 and 53BP1. These proposed studies are significant because they not only will elucidate the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway in the complex DNA repair network, but also will provide ways to overcome therapy resistance for cancer patients."
"9392388","Very little information exists on host molecules as virulence factors that directly promote viral disease manifestations. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are ubiquitously expressed and heavily implicated in health and disease. In humans, a variety of pathological conditions including inflammation and neovascularization can result from uncontrolled degradation of HS by a highly specific endoglycosidase, heparanase (HPSE). Since HS is an important constituent of the extracellular matrix, increased HPSE enzymatic activity leads to an enhanced release of cytokines and growth factors promoting neovascularization, inflammation, and tissue damage, which are also typical of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) disease pathologies. HS serves as a common attachment receptor for numerous viruses, and we recently reported a loss of HS from the cell surface and a coinciding increase in HPSE expression and higher enzymatic activity during HSV-1 release from human cells. Our central hypothesis for the current proposal is that HSV-associated disease pathologies can result from the upregulation of HPSE expression and higher enzymatic activity. We propose to use the cornea as a unique model system to establish a role for HPSE in HSV-induced inflammation, angiogenesis and related tissue damage. We have generated evidence that HPSE expression is increased via HSV-mediated activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB, and propose to use organotypic cornea cultures and novel proteomics assays to address this association and search for other potential regulators of HPSE upregulation upon HSV-1 infection as Aim 1 of this proposal. Given recent evidence tying higher HPSE levels with inflammation and angiogenesis, Aim 2 will define the role of human HPSE in driving HSV disease pathologies. We will determine the levels of pro-inflammatory and angiogenic factors after enhancing HPSE activity via over expression of a constitutively active form of HPSE, or knockdown of the proenzyme. We will also assess new vessel formation and corneal scarring as well as immune cell proliferation after modulating HPSE expression and activity levels in murine corneas. With results obtained from these studies, we hope to establish higher HPSE activity as a trigger for viral disease manifestations, identify new host or viral factors that signal HPSE up-regulation, and ultimately validate new target(s) in the treatment of HSV-induced inflammation and angiogenesis. Our findings will be first of its kind implicating HPSE in a viral disease and for developing new strategies to combat viral and non-viral diseases."

The Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (VDRTC) was asked to lead this program because of its experience with a long standing medical student research program. This application, in response to the RFA for creating a National Enrichment Program, proposes an enhanced DK-MSRP that engages medical students from around the country in research and excites them about careers in discovery related to diabetes and its complications. The DK-MSRP consists of: 1) Nation-wide application process available to students from all US medical schools; 2) Matching of selected students with one of 15 NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers; 3) Student-conducted research at a NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Center; 4) Enrichment activities to educate students about diabetes and research opportunities; 5) National Research Symposium at the end of the summer; 6) Robust program evaluation; 7) Short and long-term career follow up of student participants; 8) Experienced administrative supervision, educational support, and advisory panel oversight; and 9) Synergy with other NIDDK-funded programs. Since its inception in 2009, 550 students from more than 100 medical schools have conducted research at one of the 15 NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers during the summer between their first and second years of medical school. This program, with its considerable diversity in geography, ethnicity, and scientific area of research, has become a way to initiate research exposure for students who might not otherwise pursue this career path. The VDRTC and the DK-MSRP propose these specific aims: 1) Create and maintain an organizational structure that provides medical students with an in- depth experience in scientific discovery; 2) Provide access to online educational materials and seminars on bench, translational, and community research in diabetes and its complications; 3) Organize and host a National Research Symposium for DK-MSRP students to present their work and engage with leaders in diabetes research; 4) Develop networking skills and coaching for career development of DK-MSRSP students to nurture future researchers in diabetes, obesity, and metabolism; 5) Develop a social media platform to track students, monitor program outcomes, and create resources for trainees' continued involvement in clinical and research careers in diabetes. Thus the DK-MSRP generates significant enthusiasm about diabetes research and creates momentum toward a research career and is a key example of NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers and other NIDDK programs working together to train future leaders."

"9313943","SUMMARY: JHU Center for Neuroscience Research In this revised competitive renewal of our ?JHU Center for Neuroscience Research? NINDS P30 center grant, we propose to both maintain and expand two of the Scientific Core facilities at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHU SOM) that have anchored this Center for the past 10 years: the Multiphoton Imaging (MPI) Core and the Murine Mutagenesis Core (MMC; formally ?ES Cell Engineering Core?). These Scientific Cores currently provide critical research capabilities and resources that are impractical for neuroscience investigators to provide on their own but that greatly enhance efforts of individual research programs. The experimental opportunities and technical services offered by these Cores complement, but do not duplicate, other facilities available to NINDS-funded investigators at JHU SOM. Use of Center Cores will continue to benefit the 12 NINDS-funded research programs that constitute the Primary Center Investigators of this Center, and also other NINDS-funded and non-NINDS-funded investigators at JHU SOM. The research programs of the Primary Center Investigators address a wide range of significant unsolved questions central to the NINDS mission. These include basic neuroscience investigation into excitatory synapse dynamics and function, the organization of hippocampal place cell circuitry, definition of cortical circuits underlying somatosensation, establishment of local circuitry during adult neurogenesis, cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain and itch, and Ca++ signaling in Na channel regulation. Clinically relevant work encompasses the genetics and molecular underpinnings of stroke, Parkinson's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, and sleep. The unique capabilities of Center Cores will continue to serve as a crucial resource for NINDS-funded investigators at JHU by extending the research capabilities of individual investigators and by serving as a focal point for dissemination and practical training in state-of-the art research approaches. Through these efforts, the JHU Center for Neuroscience Research will help establish new strategies for studying brain function in health and disease that will benefit the broader neuroscience community."
"9479426","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT) patients are treated surgically with more conservative surgical approaches leading to higher rates of recurrence. Research to reduce recurrence of KCOT is very limited and only focused on surgical technique, primarily owing to the severe lack of cellular models for preclinical studies fr the identification and testing of therapeutic options. The aims of this project are designed to utilize novel cell models of KCOT to explore hedgehog (HH) pathway signaling, the role of HH receptor polymorphisms in KCOT, and the potential to use HH as a therapeutic target for KCOT and other craniofacial tumors. KCOT can be non-syndromic or syndromic in association with Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by a mutation in the inhibitory receptors of the HH pathway, Patched 1/2 (PTCH1/2). When the receptor in mutated, it is believed to be unable to inhibit Smo and cause ligand-independent HH signaling, cell proliferation, and tumorigenecity. The K99 phase proposes to (1) to determine if the PTCH1 receptor polymorphism Pro1315Leu, identified in 75% of our KCOTs, has a functional significance in HH pathway activity by accessing cell proliferation, HH transcriptional activity, and tumorigenic and invasive properties in cells expressing PTCH with and without the polymorphisms; and (2) examine the biological effects and therapeutic efficacy of HH inhibition on primary KCOT cell populations, using clinically relevant HH inhibitors (GDC-0449 and LDE225, both currently in clinical trials) as well as selectively targeting the Smo protein using siRNA knockdown. During this time the candidate will complete mentored training in molecular biology and courses in clinical translation research and professional development in preparation for the independent R00 phase where it is proposed to develop animal model of KCOT for testing in vivo efficacy of HH inhibitors, starting with xenograft models of KCOTs. Information gleaned from this work may be useful in understanding the role of PTCH1 in fundamental HH signaling in human neoplasias and used in the generation of future clinical trials focusing on preventing KCOT recurrence."
"9269123","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For patients with hematologic malignancies such as leukemias, lymphomas and other related cancers, allogeneic blood/marrow transplantation (allo BMT) is a critically important therapy that can produce cures when chemotherapy alone cannot. More than 25,000 patients undergo allo BMT world-wide each year. A major risk of allo BMT continues to be graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which results from the donor immune system recognizing the transplant recipient's organs as foreign, leading to life-threatening inflammation. Developing strategies that reduce GVHD but leave global immune function intact should produce a major benefit for patients. One promising approach that we have developed is targeting the complex community of microbes that reside within our intestinal tracts, collectively termed the intestinal microbiota. While a relationship between the microbiota and GVHD has been suspected for many years, it remains imperfectly understood. Gut decontamination with antibiotics is practiced at some but not all centers, and there is no consensus regarding ideal choice of antibiotic coverage.  The preliminary data in this application present a novel finding: the abundance of bacteria belonging to the genus Blautia, commonly found in the intestinal tract of humans, predicts for protection from life-threatening GVHD in allo BMT patients. Furthermore, introducing in murine models a species of Blautia of murine origin, or a mixture of Blautia and related bacteria of human origin reduces GVHD severity. A possible mechanism appears to be generation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), inducing donor regulatory T cells, and modulating inflammation by donor alloreactive T cells.  Additional preliminary data demonstrate that a variety of microbiota-focused strategies appear to alleviate GVHD in mice. Strategies include administration to mice of a SCFA, acetate, selecting antibiotics that spare obligate anaerobes, and targeted introduction of a sugar that is fermented by Blautia.  Our results have identified the microbiota as a potent ally that can be recruited to significantly redue GVHD. The project aims to study the effects of intestinal flora composition on GVHD, to evaluate strategies to treat microbiota injury and GVHD, and to develop strategies to prevent microbiota injury in allo BMT patients. The overarching goal is to lay the foundation for a multi-pronged approach to clinically translate these findings into personalized therapies for allo BMT patients that are tailored to their particular microbiota status."

Building on the outstanding foundation in comparative pathophysiology and medicine provided by DVM curricula, in-depth, rigorous training in biomedical research is ideal to foster research careers for veterinarians. This proposal seeks renewal of support for a longstanding, highly productive NIH-funded T32 program led by Joseph L. Mankowski, DVM, PhD to train veterinarians in biomedical research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. We are requesting funding for seven DVM/VMD trainee slots/year to provide 3 years of support/trainee to facilitate intensive biomedical research training. We offer an outstanding career development opportunity for veterinarians passionate about building careers in biomedical research and becoming innovators and leaders in their fields."
"9352760","The human brain contains diverse neural cell types that are differentially responsible for distinct aspects of human behavior, cognition and neurologic disease. Advances in DNA sequencing are providing new insight into human specific neurobiology by providing lists of genes that increase risk for disease or correlate with behaviors and cognitive properties that differ between individuals. However, the lack of available human neuronal subtypes and our limited understanding of which genes are expressed in different human neurons are major barriers to exploiting these growing genomic resources. One way to overcome this barrier is to use direct reprogramming to produce induced neuronal cells in vitro, by transiently expressing transcription factors (TFs) in fibroblasts. Direct reprogramming produces induced neurons that share many features with endogenous neurons, including characteristic morphologies, ligand-evoked synaptic responses and characteristic patterns of gene expression. Reprogramming therefore offers a new tool to identify transcriptional circuits that establish distinct features of neuronal identity. We, and others, have used candidate gene approaches to engineer induced neurons that functionally mimic well-characterized neuronal subtypes, such as the peripheral sensory neurons that detect pain and itch produced recently by my laboratory. These studies led us to hypothesize that direct reprogramming engages conserved transcriptional circuits similar to those that actively maintain neuronal subtype identity in endogenous neurons. This hypothesis predicts that it should be possible to identify multiple TF combinations that induce distinct features of different neuronal subtypes. To test this hypothesis and establish a systematic method to produce and classify human neuronal subtypes, we will conduct an unbiased screen for new TF combinations that can induce human neuronal subtypes in vitro. We will then characterize the induced neurons transcriptionally, morphologically and functionally. We are well suited to perform this study because we recently conducted a pilot screen of ~600 TF pairs and identified more than 70 new pairs that produce candidate induced neurons from mouse fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling and functional analyses of these cells confirm that they exhibit extensive subtype diversity. Therefore, by using unbiased screens to define sets of human TFs that can induce neuronal identity in fibroblasts, we will identify new methods to produce human neuronal cell types with defined functional properties in vitro and establish a database of transcriptional programs and cellular properties that emerge from transient expression of different sets of TFs. These studies will have impact on our understanding of the basic biology of human neuronal diversity and will provide conceptual and practical tools to enable neuroscience researchers to produce diverse subtypes of human induced neurons for research and translational applications.  "

"9276067","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The prime goal of this core is to provide expert histopathology services, facilities, and resources for investigations involving cell and tissue microscopic analyses. Our Histopathology Core was established in 2004 with funding from the COBRE in Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (8P20GM103465), with Dr. Volkhard Lindner as the Core Director. The success of this core has engaged all Center investigators, attracted many investigators from our Institute?s COBRE in Vascular Biology and Maine Medical Center, and a number of regional clients. Current services provided include the fixation and processing of specimens for frozen, paraffin and plastic embedded sectioning. A comprehensive spectrum of histological stains and specialty stains are offered. Detection of specific proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a key service, and our staff expertly develops and optimizes antigen retrieval, analysis, and versatile detection methods. This core facility has also developed and characterized highly specific rabbit monoclonal antibodies for the detection of several antigens where quality antibodies do not exist. In transitioning to Phase III, we outline several innovative features. First, we recently have developed the capacity to prepare custom tissue microarrays, and this is being applied to genetically engineered mouse models, human specimens, and mice generated from the Knockout Mutant Mouse Project (KOMP) at The Jackson Laboratory. This core will collaborate with the Mouse Transgenic Core of our sister COBRE in Vascular Biology to generate unique tissue arrays from this mutant mouse resource. In addition, Histopathology will collaborate with our Molecular Phenotyping Core (Oxburgh) to facilitate quantitative analysis of immunostained antigens. The ability to quantify both histological and immunostained specimens will significantly sharpen cellular and pathological phenotypic analysis of disease models and human pathological specimens. Thus, for Phase-Ill, our Histopathology Core is well-positioned to provide, and expand, comprehensive expert analyses of a broad spectrum of cell and tissue specimens."
"9413635","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant alcohol and substance abuse disorders and mental health disparities have had devastating impacts in many American Indian/First Nations (Indigenous) communities. Evidence from diverse tribal groups demonstrates early onset, high frequency substance use with substantial rates of co-occurring mental disorders among Indigenous youth throughout their adolescence. Yet, how these early life patterns affect trajectories and outcomes in adulthood for Indigenous people is unknown. General population studies have shown that early adulthood (20 - 30 years of age) is a critical period of transitions in roles, responsibilities, and relationships impacting patterns of substance use and mental health. Cultural norms and contexts may translate into potentially unique developmental pathways, risks, and protective factors for Indigenous substance use and mental health outcomes. We propose to investigate these possibilities in Indigenous early adulthood, a critical period for understanding transitions from adolescence to longer-term alcohol, substance use, and mental health problems and resilience. The project will link data from our 8-wave panel study of Indigenous adolescents with 3 years of proposed new data in early adulthood. Data will be collected via computer-assisted personal interviews. The result will be the only longitudinal data set spanning Indigenous childhood, adolescent, and early adult years of which we are aware. Three major aims guide this community- based participatory research: 1) Determine trajectories of Indigenous substance use and mental health problems from late childhood to early adulthood, 2) Identify early life-course predictors of substance use and mental health among Indigenous young adults, and 3) Describe culturally appropriate definitions of wellbeing in early adulthood and document the prevalence and predictors of these positive outcomes. Results of this research will increase awareness of the nature, etiology, and consequences of alcohol, substance use, mental health problems and their comorbidity in Indigenous reservation/reserve communities. Another outcome is enhanced understanding and novel measurement of protective factors and positive Indigenous development. The results of this project have potential to inform the timing of and risk/protective factors targeted by prevention programs in Indigenous communities."
"9281720","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant recent breakthroughs in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in substance use (SU) and addiction, progress remains modest toward integrative knowledge on how psychosocial, neurocognitive, and neurobiological risk factors jointly influence SU initiation, escalation, and addiction, and how they are affected in return. The complexity of SU behaviors, their emergence during critical periods of neurodevelopment, and their strong linkages with physical and mental health, demands a comprehensive large- scale, prospective longitudinal study that begins with youth prior to initiation of SU and that incorporates genetic, psychosocial, cultural, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging measures. The aims of this study align with those of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study Consortium as set forth in RFA-DA-15-015. These are to: (1) Establish how diverse patterns of SU use impact the structure and function of the developing brain; (2) Identify the impact of SU use on health, psychosocial development, neurocognition, academic achievement, motivation, and emotional regulation; (3) Understand how SU and addiction affect the onset, course, and severity of psychopathology, and vice versa; (4) Identify factors that influence trajectories of SU and its consequences; and (5) Establish how use of one substance contributes to use of other substances. As the largest ethnic minority group in the US, Latinos merit a significant position in the enrollment plan for th ABCD study. The Florida International University (FIU) ABCD site will uniquely contribute to achieving these aims and enhance their impact and significance through enrollment of 900 multi-ethnic Latino youth from South Florida who will be 9 to 10 years old at baseline and substance naïve. The vast majority of our sample will be normally developing, but 30% will have a diagnosis of a disruptive behavior disorder (DBD; i.e., ADHD, Conduct Disorder, or Oppositional Defiant Disorder) to increase likelihood of observing initiation and escalation of SU in the sample and to better understand mechanisms accounting for the strong linkages between DBDs and SU trajectories. Furthermore, multidimensional assessment of cultural factors at the individual, intra-familial, and community level in this unique sample, will allow for characterization of how dynamic relationships between cultural factors (e.g., acculturation and biculturalism) influence SU initiation, escalation, and addiction, as well as underlying mechanisms. Participants will complete six assessment waves during the first 5 years of the study, which includes detailed assessments of SU and various psychosocial, cultural, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging measures. In conjunction with the ABCD Coordinating Center, Data Center, and selected sites, this study will reveal how psychosocial (including cultural), neurocognitive, and neurobiological factors dynamically interact to influence SU trajectories during development from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. The findings of the ABCD Study will further NIDA's mission to apply cutting-edge science to issues of SU and addiction in order to inform policy and improve prevention and treatment."
"9244137","The goal of this multidisciplinary pilot and feasibility proposal is to study the impact of systematic control and prevention of chronic periodontitis, a forgotten comorbidity in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). This proposal is significant because it offers a novel approach on the management of the inflammatory burden by targeting oral infections and improving quality of life. Periodontitis, a polymicrobial oral infection, is highly prevalent in ESRD and linked to malnutrition, inflammation and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Our preliminary data and other reports have revealed that the magnitude of the inflammatory response to periodontal treatment is similar to the one observed after converting catheter vascular access to fistula in ESRD patients on dialysis. This innovative proposal of repeated and systematic oral health interventions aims to change the paradigm of care by reducing oral and systemic inflammatory burden and improving the well being of this population. Unlike the previously reported episodic interventions, we propose to control periodontal infections in a continuous pattern with frequent maintenance and oral health behavior modifications in a long-term observation period. We have the expertise to implement this model in the outpatient dialysis units in order to improve access to oral care and promise better management of this population characterized by fatigue and physical limitations. We hypothesize that this strategy will improve: a) systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, b) oral health and c) quality of life within the 6-month observation period. We aim to measure true and surrogate outcomes. The first aim will assess the changes in Oral Health Quality of Life (a 14-item survey) and clinical oral parameters at baseline, 2-, 4- and 6-months. The second aim will evaluate the changes in markers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in the same time points. Our long-term goal is to identify appropriate and well-perceived oral health guidelines to improve health outcomes in this population and to reduce all cause and CVD mortality (Healthy People 2020 objective).  "
"9269618","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A long-standing and significant barrier to understanding the mechanisms behind Kennedy disease (KD) is the assumption that the agent of disease (a mutated androgen receptor (AR)) acts directly in motoneurons to cause their death. While skeletal muscle are also affected in KD, muscle atrophy and weakness was attributed to a loss of innervation; i.e., effects of disease on muscle was assumed to have a neurogenic cause. A transgenic (tg) mouse model developed to identify the cells that androgens act on to drive sexual differentiation of a neuromuscular system led to the serendipitous discovery that AR acts in muscle fibers (not motoneurons) to trigger KD. This finding has prompted a major paradigm shift in the field. Mouse models developed by other investigators since this discovery also conclude AR acts directly in muscle to cause KD, questioning whether AR in motoneurons has any role in this disease. The current proposed Aims continue to build on this new appreciation for muscle as a key player in KD, using an innovative systems approach and cross-model comparisons to identify critical mechanisms in muscle that directly impart disease to the muscle and indirectly to the motoneurons. Aim 1 will extend pilot data using qPCR to further characterize the expression of neonatal isoforms of critical membrane channels and cytoskeletal proteins that control muscle contractile properties in diseased adult KD muscle. Aim 2 will use classic physiological approaches to determine whether muscles are functionally denervated. Aim 3 will continue efforts to test FDA approved AR antagonists as immediately available treatment options for KD patients by testing the AR antagonist bicalutamide which does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in three KD mouse models. Aim 4 will directly test whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) produced in skeletal muscle mediates motor dysfunction in KD using two in vivo complimentary approaches, 1) reversing a disease-related deficit in muscle BDNF via expression of a BDNF transgene in KD muscle and 2) disabling the endogenous BDNF gene in KD muscle. This last Aim takes advantage of floxed and cre recombinase mouse models that we have ready access to."
"9346657","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-associated osteoporosis is a major health problem, which is characterized by an imbalance in bone remodeling and metabolism due to the increase of osteoclastogenesis and activity with age. The current treatment options have been constrained with lower response rates or side-effects and ineffectively tackle the burden and heterogeneity of osteoporosis. Further progress in establishing successful treatment urgently requires a clearer understanding of the mechanisms of osteoclast (OC) differentiation and bone remodeling with age. Evidences have documented that RANKL -evoked Ca2+ oscillations play a switch-on role in the activation of PLC? and NFATc1, and OC differentiation. Further study showed that FcR? and DAP 12 regulate the phosphorylation of PLC?, which is the critical component involved in the RANKL-induced Ca2+ oscillations- NFATc1 pathway. Despite these new insights, it remains unclear how RANKL evokes the essential Ca2+ oscillations that triggers NFATc1 activation and OC differentiation, and it is unknown whether and how this mechanism is involved in age-associated bone loss. Our recent research demonstrated that Regulator of G protein signaling protein 12 (RGS12) was prominently expressed during OC differentiation and that RGS12 expression was significantly increased with increasing age. Knockdown of RGS12 expression inhibited Ca2+ oscillations, NFATc1 expression and OC differentiation. Deletion of RGS12 from hematopoietic/early OC lineage cells (RGS12 / /cre) led to a significantly increase of bone mass, and this increase of bone mass was protected from age-associated bone loss in RGS12 / /cre mice. We also found that loss of RGS12 in mice decreased OC number and levels of marrow adipogenesis with age. Based on these results, we hypothesize that age-associated bone remodeling and metabolism requires RGS12 expression and function, and RGS12 is a critical regulator in controlling Ca2+ oscillation and OC differentiation during aging. We will test the hypothesis through the following two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will reveal the function of RGS12 in OC differentiation and function during aging through characterization of the phenotypes and pathomechanism of RGS12 conditional knockout mice. We will analyze bone phenotypes in young (6 months (m)), mid-aged (14m) and aged (24m) mice to determine how deletion of RGS12 in early and late OC lineage cells affect postnatal age-associated bone metabolism by using Mx1-cre and Cathepsin K-Cre mice. We will further characterize in vitro of OCs derived from aging RGS12 / /cre mice and determine the contribution of mesenchymal lineage cells to the OCs and skeletal phenotype in aging RGS12 / /cre mice. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism of RGS12 interactions that confer specificity of Ca2+ oscillation and OCs with age by characterizing pathomechanism and pathways, RGS12 domain functions and its heterodimerization partners. The goal of this project is to discover the role and mechanism of RGS12 in OC differentiation and activation in pathologic age condition, and provide new and more effective therapeutic targets to age-associated osteoporosis and other bone diseases."
"9273585","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) inherit the mutation from their mothers, almost all of whom carry the premutation - defined as 55 - 200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Premutation carrier mothers have participated in clinical studies and have been reported to suffer from elevated risk of motor, neurocognitive, health, and psychiatric symptoms, although there is controversy regarding whether these symptoms are primary characteristics of the premutation phenotype. Alternatively, the symptoms could emanate from stressful parenting for a child with full mutation FXS. This application proposes research that will advance understanding of the FMR1 premutation phenotype, conducted by Drs. Marsha Mailick, Jan S. Greenberg, Leann Smith, Elizabeth Berry-Kravis, and Murray Brilliant from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Waisman Center, Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, and Rush University Medical Center. The project will characterize the FMR1 premutation phenotype by studying 344 women: (1) 144 women drawn from a 20,000-person population-based sample who constitute the Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) of the Marshfield Clinic, of whom 72 are premutation carriers (who have between 55 and 190 CGG expansions) but are unaware of their genotype and do not have children with diagnosed FXS, and 72 are matched controls (< 41 CGG repeats); and (2) 200 premutation carrier mothers of full mutation children with FXS who are participating in our ongoing studies and clinics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to include both a population-based sample of women with the premutation who were not reverse-ascertained from a child with full-mutation FXS as well as clinically- ascertained women with the premutation. Thus, it offers the opportunity to determine whether the phenotypic characteristics of the premutation carrier mothers of full mutation children with FXS are representative of the full range of carriers in the population. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Define the motor, neurocognitive, health, and psychiatric phenotypes of female premutation carriers in a population-based sample (not confounded by knowledge of their genotype or parenting a child with FXS) and determine how the phenotype differs in a clinically-ascertained sample; (2) Determine the effect of stress exposure on the phenotype of FMR1 premutation carriers; and (3) Identify the age-related profile of symptoms in premutation carriers.. Additionally, we will incorporate the genotype of the FMR1 premutation into the analyses (CGG repeat length, activation ratio, and AGG number and location) to determine genotype-phenotype correlations and gene-by-environment interactions in predicting the phenotype. We have assembled an exceptionally strong interdisciplinary team of scientists including those with expertise in biostatistics, cognitive and developmental psychology, epidemiology, genetics, neurology, pediatrics, psychoneuroendocrinology, and social science to carry out these Aims."
"9281599","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy activation is tightly regulated in the cell based upon nutrient availability and cell stress. As the mTOR signaling pathway serves as a focal point for integration of metabolic information and cell stress, the principal arbiter of autophagy pathway activity is the mTORC1 complex. In light of numerous essential roles in cellular homeostasis, we hypothesized that autophagy would be subject to sophisticated regulatory control, and over the last 5 years, we have defined key regulatory nodes that occur both upstream and downstream of the mTORC1 complex. When we interrogated the transcriptomes of primary neurons subjected to nutrient deprivation, we discovered that members of the let-7 family of microRNAs exhibited marked up-regulation. We then determined that let-7 activates neuronal autophagy by repressing the expression of genes that comprise a recently delineated amino acid sensing pathway that includes a family of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins (RagA/B/C/D), a MAP kinase (MAP4K3), and five proteins (LAMTOR 1/2/3/4/5) that anchor mTORC1 to the lysosome. Another important advance in defining the transcriptional regulation of autophagy was the Ballabio group's discovery of a principal role for transcription factor EB (TFEB) in promoting autophagy. Although mTORC1 phosphorylation of TFEB has emerged as a key step in control of TFEB function and autophagy activation, we have discovered an unexpectedly crucial role for MAP4K3 as a major regulator, by demonstrating that its phosphorylation of TFEB determines TFEB localization and activity. As we have also shown that TFEB regulation is critically important for proteostasis in the CNS, our studies during the initial period of this project have advanced our understanding of the regulatory network that controls the autophagy pathway and its potential physiological relevance for CNS homeostasis. In this renewal project, we propose to define the transcription regulatory network that responds to nutrient stress to activate let-7 and thereby initiate autophagy induction. Building on provocative preliminary data placing MAP4K3 upstream of TFEB lysosomal localization and mTORC1 phosphorylation, we will determine if MAP4K3 phosphorylation of TFEB at a specific serine is responsible for its localization to the lysosome and inactivation, and we will examine the significance of this TFEB PTM in dictating autophagy activation status. Finally, we will evaluate the potential utility of modulating let-7 and MAP4K3 expression to regulate autophagy activation in the CNS to establish if such modulation could represent a viable path to the development of novel autophagy-inducing therapies."
"9381881","There is a tremendous clinical need for improved treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Currently, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA approved drug for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, less than 5% of people suffering an ischemic stroke receive tPA due to increased risk of secondary cerebral hemorrhage and edema formation. Thus, an unmet need exists to develop novel therapeutics that work in combination with tPA to improve stroke outcome, reduce secondary complications, and extend the time window for administering tPA. Bryostatin-1, an ultrapotent PKC modulator, may provide substantial benefit for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The long-term goal of our research is to identify and develop therapeutics that markedly improve the safety profile of tPA so that more victims of ischemic stroke are eligible for thrombolysis. The objective of this proposal is to determine if tPA time window can be extended in aged rats co- administered bryostatin-1 with tPA. The central hypothesis is that PKC? activation by administration of bryostatin-1 during the acute phase of ischemic cerebral infarction attenuates cerebral endothelium dysfunction; thus, decreasing the degree of injury & increasing the window, in which reperfusion can be safely accomplished. Rationale is that using two separate models of neurological injury (MCAO & mild traumatic brain injury), administration of bryostatin-1 reduced hemispheric swelling & BBB permeability with improved survival & functional recovery. Using our clinically relevant ischemic stroke model, we will use biochemical, neuropathological, and behavioral measures, to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this proposal, as described in these two specific aims: (1) Identify optimal dose of bryostatin-1 & validate PKC? as a therapeutic target & (2) identify therapeutic target of bryostatin-1 that improves cerebrovascular function post- MCAO. Specific aim 1 tests the working hypothesis that co-administration of bryostatin-1 with tPA at 6 h after MCAO will selectively activate PKCe in neurons & cerebral microvessels & it will be lower doses of bryostatin-1 (10-30 mcg/m2) that produce the most efficacious stroke outcome. Specific aim 2 test the working hyothesis that co-administration of bryostatin-1 with tPA at 6 h after MCAO reduces cerebral swelling, mitigates hemorrhagic transformation & improves stroke outcome by selective PKC? activation in cerebral endothelial cells attenuating BBB dysfunction in the infarcted hemisphere. Due to the prevalence & debilitating effects of ischemic stroke, the need for better therapeutic strategies cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, the ability to translate promising preclinical findings into effective drugs that clinically mitigate post-stroke brain damage has, to date, failed. This proposal will determine if co-administration of bryostatin-1 with tPA improves stroke outcome & extends the tPA time window following acute ischemic stroke. Results from this proposal have the translational potential to vastly improve the way ischemic stroke is treated."
"9277456","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our recent discovery of MTNR1B, encoding for the high-affinity melatonin receptor MT2, as a novel genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and glycemic traits in genome wide association studies (GWAS) has sparked great interest in the role of melatonin in glycemic control. However, the exact mechanism is not yet understood. Two major limitations in all previous GWAS are that: 1) the clinical assessment of glycemic traits is based on daytime assessments, when circulating concentrations of the ligand of the MT2 receptor, i.e., melatonin, are near-undetectable; and 2) that the impact of the MTNR1B risk variant has not been assessed in vulerable populations with elevated endogenous melatonin concentrations concurrent with food intake, such as shift workers and natural late night eaters. Our preliminary data suggests that exogenous melatonin administered during the daytime acutely decreases glucose tolerance in healthy participants, with an exaggerated response in risk carriers, and the increase in the odds ratio for T2D with shift work is 5-fold higher in MTNR1B risk allele carriers as compared to the non-carriers. Our long term goal is to use mechanistic understanding of the role of melatonin and MTNR1B in glucose metabolism to design interventional strategies for the prevention and treatment of T2D, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as night shift workers and late night eaters. Our objectives are to: 1) determine the effect of concurrent food intake and melatonin on glucose tolerance; and 2) assess the role of MTNR1B SNP*food timing interaction in the deleterious effect of melatonin on glucose tolerance. In this proposal, we address two specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that the concurrence of meal timing with elevated endogenous melatonin concentrations associates with adverse glycemic changes in shift workers versus non-shift workers, including elevated T2D risk, decreased glucose tolerance and decreased disposition index, and that these effects will be magnified in risk carriers; and 2) test the hypothesis that the concurrence of meal timing with elevated endogenous melatonin concentrations associates with decreased glucose tolerance and decreased disposition index in late night eaters versus early eaters, and that these effects will be magnified in risk carriers. These hypotheses will tested in a large scale cohort with information on T2D risk and shift work history (UKBiobank, n=287,635); and two new cohorts, shift workers versus non-shift workers (US; n=1,000) and late night eaters versus early eaters (Spain; n=1,000), with detailed information on meal timing, endogenous melatonin concentrations, as well as morning (low endogenous melatonin levels) and evening (high endogenous melatonin levels) OGTTs. Completion of this project will lead to important novel insights into the role of MTNR1B, melatonin and food timing on glucose regulation. This work is also expected to result in personalized recommendations to reduce risk of T2D in carriers of the MTNR1B risk allele, translating GWAS and physiologic research into a practical clinical application."
"9282376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In aging rodents and humans, decreased muscle mass does not fully account for the decrease in strength, indicating that atrophy only partially explains muscle weakness. Publications from our laboratory and others support the concept that aging impairs muscle activation-contraction efficiency. Altered transmittal of membrane depolarization to SR Ca2+ release decreases specific force in a process termed excitation- contraction uncoupling (ECU). Previous works from our laboratory identified the mouse specific Cav1.1 subunit gene 5'-flanking sequences necessary for basal transcription and control of Cav1.1 expression. However, the mechanism leading to impaired Cav1.1 transcription with aging and its treatment is unknown. Troponin T (TnT) is known to mediate the interaction between the Tn complex and tropomyosin (Tm) in the myoplasm, which is essential for calcium-activated striated muscle contraction. We have preliminary evidence of a nontraditional role for TnT3, the TnT isoform expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers. We found full-length (FL)-TnT3 and its fragments in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of myofibers isolated from mouse skeletal muscle. More important, the myonuclei from old FVB mice had less of the full-length protein and more of the COOH-terminal (CT) fragment than those of young mice. When we knocked down endogenous TnT3 by shRNA in muscle in vivo, the calcium channel a1 subunit, essential molecule for muscle contraction, was down-regulated at both the RNA and protein levels. The following specific aims will test the hypotheses that: (1) TnT3 regulates voltage-gated Ca2+ channel ?1 subunit (Cav1.1) expression in fast adult myofibers, and (2) decreased nuclear FL-TnT3 and increased CT-TnT3 fraction result in decreased Cacna1 expression and impaired excitation-contraction coupling with aging. These hypotheses will be tested by the following specific aims. (1) To establish that TnT3 regulates Cav1.1 expression and excitation-contraction coupling. (2) To determine that TnT3 is enzymatically cleaved in aging skeletal muscle and (3) To determine whether inhibiting skeletal muscle ?-calpain prevents age-dependent increase in TnT3 fragmentation and reduced Cacna1 expression and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. The proposed studies will define a novel role for TnT3 as a regulator of Cav1.1 expression and a tool to ameliorate or prevent muscle weakness with aging."
"9385436","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. The goal of the proposed project is to provide me with the advanced training necessary to establish an independent program of research in perinatal psychiatric disorders, and specifically in the contributions of immunological and endocrinological factors to perinatal psychopathology. To facilitate this long-term career goal, I will examine biological correlates of anxiety across pregnancy and the postpartum. I propose a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework in immunology and biostatistics with individual mentor meetings, applied training experiences, and participation in conferences, seminars, and workshops. Specific short-term training goals include: 1) Develop expertise in the psychoneuroimmunology of pregnancy and the postpartum 2) Gain a fuller understanding of reproductive hormonal physiology 3) Improve my understanding of biostatistics and epidemiology and develop a solid understanding of longitudinal data analysis 4) Refine my skill in measuring perinatal anxiety by learning how to administer laboratory stressors to pregnant women and measure the resultant autonomic reactivity and 5) Become adroit at integrating information about perinatal anxiety across numerous RDoC units of analysis, including cells, physiology, behaviors, self-reports, and paradigms. The training plan will be executed in conjunction with a proposed set of research studies based on preliminary data that I have collected and/or analyzed. These data demonstrate a relationship between inflammatory cytokines and TRAIT anxiety in pregnancy; between pro-inflammatory cytokines and STATE anxiety across the perinatal period; between allopregnanolone and obsessive symptoms in pregnancy; and between allopregnanolone in pregnancy and subsequent postpartum affective symptoms. The proposed research will build upon these preliminary findings by prospectively following a cohort of anxious pregnant women and healthy matched controls; by analyzing their blood samples for inflammatory cytokines, immune cells, and allopregnanolone; and by measuring maternal reactivity to a validated pregnancy-specific laboratory task that will measure attentional bias to threat and act as a stimulus for autonomic arousal."
"9352731","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer?s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields."
"9276146","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cortical electrical stimulation can improve motor function after stroke, but which regions should be targeted for maximal recovery is not known. A human clinical trial of epidural motor cortex stimulation after stroke failed, but post hoc analysi revealed that the treatment was effective when targeted to spared corticospinal circuits. The critical cortical regions for restoration of motor function are being identified by studies of spontaneous recovery of function in various stroke models. These data lead to the hypothesis that the motor cortex regions that enable spontaneous recovery of motor function differ depending on the location of the stroke and that targeting electrical stimulation to these regions will produce the greatest recovery of function. To test this hypothesis, the proposed study will employ rat models of internal capsule and brain stem strokes, the most common forms of subcortical stroke in humans. Aim 1 seeks to identify the circuits responsible for spontaneous recovery in each of the models. Forelimb motor function, including a novel measure of supination, will be measured for 6 weeks after lesion to quantify spontaneous motor recovery. Adaptation of spared descending motor pathways to injury will be assayed with anatomical tract tracing and physiological motor mapping. The cortical region which enables spontaneous recovery of the impaired forelimb is hypothesized to be different for the two lesions: hindlimb motor cortex after internal capsule infarction and forelimb motor cortex after a pyramidotomy, through a brain stem bypass circuit. The necessity of these pathways for motor recovery will be tested using a viral technique that selectively and reversibly inactivates each of the circuits tha enable recovery. Aim 2 seeks to determine the efficacy of forelimb versus hindlimb motor cortex stimulation on recovery of forelimb motor function in rats with chronic subcortical stroke. For the first time, the efficacy of on- target versus off-target motor cortex stimulation will be tested. Epidural motor cortex stimulation will be applied 4 weeks after injury. The effectiveness of stimulation is hypothesized to be opposite for the two lesion types: hindlimb motor cortex stimulation will produce greater motor recovery after internal capsule infarction, and forelimb stimulation will be best after pyramidotomy. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that motor cortex electrical stimulation will selectively strengthen the pathways that mediate spontaneous recovery, using the same anatomy, physiology, and inactivation methods as in Aim 1. The proposed research is highly innovative because of the approach-comparing different stimulation locations for different lesion types-and because it employs advanced behavioral and viral tools to identify and inactivate discrete descending motor pathways. By targeting spared connections, the therapy could be applied to many of the 7 million people living with chronic stroke. Understanding the effects of targeted epidural stimulation will enable the design of more effective protocols to restore arm and hand function in people with subcortical stroke and persistent motor impairment."
"9297187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ten to 25% of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with prominent executive deficits. Names such as frontal variant AD, executive prominent AD, and dysexecutive AD have been applied to this phenomenon. Little is known about traditional or genetic risk factors for dysexecutive AD. The overarching goal of this project is to further our understanding of the genetic architecture and clinical epidemiology of dysexecutive AD in the hopes of ultimately developing disease- modifying treatments. This project will leverage large-scale genome-wide genotype and sequence data and cognitive data collected on >17,000 participants across 19 collaborating studies. The investigators will use modern psychometric methods to co-calibrate cognitive data to develop scores on the same metric for memory and executive functioning. The investigators will use these scores to determine a continuous dysexecutive spectrum phenotype they have found to be highly heritable, with a pattern of heritability entirely distinct from that of AD. The investigators will leverage genome-wide genotype data for Aim 1. Five of the collaborating studies are prospective cohort studies with extensive cognitive and clinical data from >10,000 participants. The investigators will leverage these data for Aim 2. Several funding mechanisms are producing whole genome and whole exome sequencing data for people with AD. The investigators will leverage these data for Aim 3. Taken together, these investigations promise to improve what is known about dysexecutive AD, a highly heritable and devastating AD subtype. This work may identify genetic loci associated with risk for dysexecutive AD, which in turn may lead to development of drugs that could dramatically improve the lives of people with this condition."
"9353709","Personality traits have emerged as important predictors of health outcomes, including mortality risk. Recent findings, including our own from the previous project period, also show that health behaviors such as smoking and substance use are important mediators of the personality-health association. These prior findings can be enhanced, deepened and translated in 3 ways. First, dynamic modeling of longitudinal personality and health data can deepen our understanding of the association between the two. Second, replicability, reproducibility and cumulative science in personality and health can be enhanced through the use of multiple data sets in an Integrated Data Analysis (IDA) format. Third, extension of this work toward health care utilization outcomes can help translate research on personality and health into useful tools that health care providers can utilize. In this competing renewal, we propose to do each of these three. We request support for further data analyses within the Boston VA Normative Aging Study (NAS), as well as to obtain one more wave of longitudinal data (Aim 1). Recognizing that the NAS is rapidly decreasing in size due to high mean age and increased mortality, we are also requesting support to expand our studies to 13 other longitudinal studies that are part of the IALSA, or Integrated Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging (Aim 2). This will transition our research program toward a large group of ongoing longitudinal studies. It will also enhance replicability of our findings through use of multiple datasets. Lastly, we will move to a translational focus by conducting studies of personality and health care utilization (Aim 3). We believe each of our aims are significant and have high health relevance, and in concert they will lead to enhanced knowledge of how personality can affect health, mortality, and health care outcomes."
"9398792","PROJECT SUMMARY Pediatric tumors represent a very heavy social and economic burden with profound emotional involvement not only for the directly affected children but also for their family and friends. Within pediatric tumors, neuroblastoma (NB) is of particular relevance, since it is the most common solid cancer in children outside of the skull and it still kills about 40% of patients diagnosed with the most aggressive forms. Therefore, there is a clear need to improve the treatment for this deadly disease. One of the strategies to achieve this goal is to overcome the emergence of resistance to chemotherapy by cancer cells. Published data show that Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) provide positive support to NB cells and increase their resistance to chemotherapy. The mechanisms that mediate this support and the communication vehicles between these cell types are poorly understood. My preliminary data have started to elucidate this, through the following findings: 1) NB cells secrete exosomes that contain microRNAs (miRs); 2) The miRs are taken up by surrounding macrophages and can bind to Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), triggering TLR8 activation in macrophages; 3) TLR8 stimulation causes macrophages to secrete exosomes that contain specific miRs; 4) the NB cells uptake TAM-derived exosomic miRs which silence BRG1, RHOB, and FBXW7 in NB cells. These proteins are well known inhibitors of MYC (aka as c-MYC) and MYCN expression in NB; 5) the levels of MYC and MYCN are significantly higher in NB cells co-cultured with human monocytes and in primary NBs with higher TAM infiltration. NB is a very MYC-driven tumor. It is known that MYCN increases multi-drug resistance in NB. We provide evidence that also MYC promotes NB resistance to chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. We also identified a panel of cytokines secreted by TAMs when co-cultured with NB cells, which could contribute to the up-regulation of MYC and MYCN in NB cells when co-cultured with human monocytes. Therefore, our hypothesis is that TAMs secrete soluble factors (exosomic miRs and cytokines) that induce up- regulation of MYC and MYCN in NB cells, increasing their resistance to chemotherapy. This proposal has three Specific Aims. In the first we will examine the mechanisms by which exosomic miRs induce resistance to therapy in NB. Then we will assess the therapeutic potential of targeting TAM-derived soluble factors (exosomic miRs and cytokines) to overcome NB resistance. Finally, we will correlate circulating TAM-derived exosomes in the blood of NB patients with the degree of TAM infiltration in the primary tumor, traditional clinical imaging techniques and clinical outcome. I have brought together a team of seasoned scientists with well- established expertise in NB and in the field of miRs and cancer therapeutics. This research will lead to the identification of new molecular targets, the development of a new strategy to overcome drug resistance in NB (and possibly other types of MYC-driven cancers), and the possible definition of new circulating biomarkers to identify subsets of NB patients suitable for an anti-TAM therapy."
"9375136","Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) results from a breakdown of self-tolerance that is characterized by immune cell mediated destruction of the insulin-producing ?-cells in the pancreas. Ultimately, glucose metabolism is interrupted resulting in the development of life-threatening complications such as heart disease and renal failure. T1D affects an estimated 3 million Americans, with more than 30,000 new patients diagnosed annually, resulting in roughly $15B in health care costs in the US each year. It is thought that arrest of the autoimmune processes underlying this disease could avert the long-term complications associated with the disease and perhaps even reverse the disease process, given sufficient insulin-producing cells remain. Clinical intervention trials using immunomodulatory agents (e.g., anti-CD3) have failed to meet clinical endpoints, despite positive results in phase I/II trials, and traditional vaccine strategies providing auto-antigen or peptides alone failed to adequately block ongoing beta cell immunity. Thus, a new treatment strategy that is both potent and durable is required to effectively halt the ongoing attack in T1D. Regulatory T-cell (Treg)-based approaches are quickly gaining traction as a therapeutic strategy for treatment of auto-immune conditions. In this personalized therapeutic approach, endogenous populations of Tregs (widely considered the master regulators of the immune system) are expanded ex vivo, conditioned in factors to improve their tolerance-inducing capacity, and then re-introduced to the patient?s body. However, despite the promise exhibited by this approach to curb autoimmune diseases (including T1D) in animal models, the effects in humans are only transient due to rapid Treg death and loss of potency following adoptive transfer. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine known to be critical for Treg survival and function, but systemic introduction of IL-2 results in undesirable off-target effects. OneVax, LLC has pioneered a novel, biomaterial-based nanoparticle-Treg complex system for improved survivability and functionality of adoptively transferred Tregs. In this system, polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating IL-2 and harmine (a naturally occurring compound recently shown to induce ?-cells proliferation) are conjugated to Tregs, allowing for delivery of the encapsulated agents in a continuous and controlled manner. This approach has the potential to restore immune tolerance and ultimately restore glucose homeostasis. The objective of this phase I proposal is to conduct pre-clinical physiochemical and biological in vitro characterization of the nanoparticle-Treg conjugate therapy, and to determine its capacity to prevent diabetic onset in the therapeutically relevant non-obese diabetic mouse model. The preliminary data strongly suggests that this nanoparticle-Treg coupled therapy system holds promise for correcting autoimmune responses in T1D. Additionally, OneVax has established strategic collaborations with the Biomedical Engineering Department, College of Medicine and the Diabetes Institute at the University of Florida to boost OneVax?s capability to complete the desired goals."
"9443649","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women."
"9311521","Project Abstract Prepubertal childhood obesity has emerged as an epidemic and major health problem in the United States. Recent studies suggest that that childhood obesity is associated with increased risk of renal injury in children. Although the link between obesity and the development of type II diabetic nephropathy is well-documented, the consequences of childhood obesity as an independent risk factor in the absence of diabetes in the development of renal disease has received less attention. Currently, there are several obese animal models that develop renal disease, but these models have limited use in the investigation of the early mechanisms responsible for the development of renal injury prior to hypertension, diabetes, and/or puberty. As most of these obese models do not develop progressive proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, we observed our obese rat model (prepubertal obese - PPO) develops podocyte injury and 3-fold increase in proteinuria prior to the development of hypertension and diabetes at 6 weeks of age (childhood), which progresses to severe hypertension, CKD by 18 weeks of age (adulthood). In the current proposal, we will use our model of prepubertal obesity to explore several mechanisms that may contribute to the development of renal disease. The proposed studies will test whether glomerular hyperfiltration and lipid accumulation stimulate podocyte injury and macrophage inflitration leading to proteinuria and renal injury during prepubertal obesity. We will compare early changes in glomerular capillary pressure (Pgc) between the PPO model and their control-lean counterparts and determine whether there is a direct effect of mechanical strain/cyclic stretch on lipid accumulation in podocytes isolated from both strains. We also will evaluate the role of macrophages on the early development of proteinuria in the PPO model. These results should provide the scientific community with an obese animal model system that develops proteinuria, prior to puberty, to study mechanisms involved in renal injury and provide information critical to develop new treatments for the prevention of renal disease associated with prepubertal childhood obesity."
"9298545","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Subtle changes in the aging human brain, such as neuronal sprouting and restructuring, are thought to underlie cognitive decline and may promote neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's and other late-onset neurodegenerative disease. Currently we understand too little of these processes and their consequences to harness knowledge for design of therapeutic intervention. We study fundamental processes relevant to neuronal aging in C. elegans. In this transparent 959-celled animal, we can directly observe individual fluorescently labeled neurons, as well as fluorescently tagged protein aggregates and mitochondria. Recently, we carefully documented how some C. elegans neurons physically change as animals grow old. We find that like human brain aging, there is little neuron loss as C. elegans ages. However, some types of neurons exhibit dramatic novel branching and outgrowth with age; such neurons might have diminished function. We can score this dramatic age-associated dendritic restructuring using a high-magnification dissecting microscope, which facilitates relatively rapid analysis of individual neurons within live, aging animals. Defining th mechanisms by which adult nervous systems maintain their structural integrity and elaborating on the poorly understood mechanisms of age-associated dendritic restructuring is of considerable importance to both normal aging and neurodegenerative disease. We will combine use of fluorescent reporters with genetic manipulations to address three aims: Aim 1 is to define the relationship of proteostasis disruption and dendritic restructuring in individual aging neurons Aim 2 is to define the relationship between mitochondrial status and age-associated dendritic restructuring in individual aging neurons. This study will also break new ground in characterizing the basic cell biology of the aging mitochondrial populations in individual neurons in native context. Aim 3 is to screen candidate gene sets to identify novel factors that influence the maintenance of structural integrity of the aging nervous system. Our studies should address gaps in understanding of the basic biology by which structural maintenance is accomplished in a mature nervous system and inform on mechanisms and interventions that may better maintain the integrity and function of the aging human nervous system."

"9270041","Fragile X-syndrome is caused by functional inactivation ofthe Fmri gene, and represents the most common genetic form of intellectual disability. However, the mechanisms of fragile X-syndrome pathogenesis are incompletely understood. As a result, few potential therapeutic avenues to treat the disorder are available. Based on observations that different forms of synaptic plasticity, most prominently mGluR5-dependent LTD and retinoic acid-dependent homeostatic plasticity, are blocked in Fmri knockout mice, the present project is led by the overall hypothesis that fragile X-syndrome involves an impairment of experience-driven synaptic excitation/inhibition (E/l) adjustments. Guided by this hypothesis, we propose four specific aims that explore the nature and developmental dynamics of FXS pathogenesis in mouse models using conditional and constitutive Fmri gene inactivation and a combination of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral assays, with a focus on activity- and experience-induced changes in the synaptic excitatory/inhibitory (E/l) state. Additionally, we propose to investigate whether activating oxytocin signaling can restore aspects ofthe altered E/l state in the hippocampal circuitry of FXS mice. With these experiments, we aim to establish in a mouse model how synaptic dysfunction, especially that related to synaptic E/l imbalance, is linked to the behavioral defects in FXS, and to obtain a comprehensive understanding ofthe development of FXS-related pathology. These studies will lead to a better and more comprehensive understanding of fragile X-syndrome and define disease mechanisms that could lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Studying the basic pathophysiology of fragile X-syndrome in a mouse model and examining its developmen- tal dynamics will provide insight into fundamental questions relevant to treating this disorder. We will explore the influence of activity and behavioral history on subsequent synaptic E/l state and learning capacity to see if activating oxytocin signaling restores the synaptic E/l state to a normal level to support normal learning."

"9265477","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an essential cell signaling system that detects the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates a cellular response in order to maintain protein homeostasis. Aberrations in UPR signaling can lead to multitude of diseased states ranging from type 2 diabetes to neurological disorders. The most ancient branch of the UPR signaling pathways is initiated by activation of the ER-localized endoribonuclease (RNase) Ire1 upon ER stress. Once activated, Ire1 specifically cleaves the cytosolic mRNA of XBP1 to produce an active transcription factor that drives expression of UPR target genes to mitigate ER stress. In addition, Ire1 also promiscuously cleaves ER-localized mRNAs through the regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway to reduce the burden of the incoming protein load. Although recent progress in understanding molecular basis of the Ire1/UPR pathway, fundamental mechanistic features of this pathway remain poorly understood. The goal of this application is to understand how Ire1 selectively finds and cleaves its mRNA substrates while avoiding non-specific cleavage of other cellular mRNAs. These studies will lead us to discover new steps in the UPR signaling, which can be targeted by drugs to treat diseases. The current research proposal is divided into two specific aims: 1. Determine how the RNase activity of Ire1 is regulated in cells. We have recently discovered that Ire1 is in a complex with the Sec61 translocon-ribosome in the ER membrane that facilitates cleavage of its correct mRNA substrates. We will first test the hypothesis that this complex may also prevent the non-specific RNase activity of Ire1 from accessing and cleaving cytosolic mRNAs by the use of RNA sequencing, biochemical and structural approaches. Second, we will establish a reconstituted proteoliposome system to test the role of the Sec61 translocon in regulating Ire1 oligomerization, phosphorylation and RNase activity in cells. 2. Determine how mRNA substrates are targeted to Ire1 in the ER membrane. We have shown that XBP1 mRNA, which encodes a soluble protein, utilizes the SRP pathway for targeting to the Ire1-Sec61 translocon complex for cleavage by Ire1. These and other studies raise two important questions. How are Ire1 substrate mRNAs that do not follow the SRP pathway targeted to Ire1 in the ER membrane? How Ire1 mRNA substrates are selectively targeted to Ire1-Sec61 translocon complexes in the ER membrane since Ire1 is a low abundant protein relative to Sec61? We will address these questions by a combination of ribosome profiling and biochemical reconstitution."
"9353203","Project Summary/Abstract  Young people at highest risk for HIV in the U.S. will be gay, bisexual transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) in communities with high HIV incidence and overwhelmingly Black and Latino. Focusing on Los Angeles and New Orleans, seronegative youth at highest risk for HIV will be screened in homeless shelters and gay-identified community-based organizations (CBO). A cohort of 1500 seronegative youth will be recruited that is 82% male (79% GBTY), 66% Black, 16% Latino, and 18% white, non-Hispanic. About 27% will be 12-17 and 73% between 18-24 years old. All youth will be followed longitudinally over 24 months at four month intervals and tested for HIV, STI, serious substance abuse, health care utilization, and comorbid conditions ? a Prototypical Retention/Prevention (R/P) Strategy. Over 24 months, acutely HIV infected youth will be triaged to Study 1. This Prototypical R/P Strategy operationalizes the CDC's recommendations for the engagement of GBTY in repeat HIV testing, linkage to care, and options for combination prevention (PrEP, PEP ? with behavioral interventions).  Building on this team's extensive experience with behavioral and mobile/social media interventions, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with four intervention conditions: 1) an Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention (AMMI), which will use texts to diffuse prevention messages daily and to monitor risk behaviors weekly (n=900); 2) a Peer Support intervention on a social media platform (i.e., Facebook) in which young people will post messages and stories about their experiences preventing HIV, plus the AMMI (n=200); 3) an eNavigator intervention in which a B.A.-level staff supports youth, primarily through texting and social media, but also in-person meetings, to provide support in crisis situations, refer to treatment, and assist in gaining access to health care and other services, plus Peer Support and AMMI (n=200); and, 4) a combined intervention of eNavigator, Peer Support, and AMMI (n=200). A single outcome will be composed of six key behaviors (access to medical care, accessing and adherence to PrEP or PEP, treatment of all STI, and 100% condom use). In addition to evaluating the added benefit of increasing levels of intervention, the brief 7- item weekly text-messaging monitoring surveys will provide approximately 100,000 weekly reports of indicators of primary and secondary outcomes that can inform our understandings about the relationships between risk and comorbid states. This study will have policy implications for the allocation of resources to HIV testing resources in local communities, the uptake and scalability of text and social media interventions, and the models for diffusing evidence-based interventions (EBI) globally (without requiring replication with fidelity to a manual)."
"9277453","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The interplay between microbial and genetic susceptibility factors is central to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Innate mechanisms, in particular through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways, are the initiating drivers of host responses to microbes. Of the 163 loci associated to IBD, a broad range of likely genes modulate host responses to PRR at many levels, and confer some of the largest genetic effect sizes observed in autoimmunity. Despite the significant discoveries in IBD-associated polymorphisms over the past few years, the functional consequences of the vast majority of these loci have yet to be identified. A central outcome of PRR activation by bacterial and viral products is induction of cytokine secretion. To a large extent, IBD is characterized by dysregulated cytokines, and modulation of cytokines plays a primary role in IBD treatment. Inter-individual variation in PRR- induced cytokine secretion influences the balance between susceptibility to infection and inflammatory diseases. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in multiple IBD-associated genes contribute to inter-individual variation in PRR-induced cytokine secretion. Systematic, well- powered studies comprehensively defining the functional alterations driven by disease- associated human variation will provide enormous insight into central mechanisms of IBD; leveraging naturally occurring human genetic variation to systematic perturb an experimental system represents a highly innovative approach for precisely defining established and novel PRR-mediated mechanisms of cytokine secretion. Therefore, we will utilize a large, well- powered cohort to screen for IBD-associated polymorphisms contributing to the variation in PRR-initiated cytokine secretion across individuals, and then define the molecular mechanisms wherein the implicated IBD-associated genes, as well as the identified polymorphisms, regulate PRR-induced cytokine secretion."
"9294090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ubiquitin-like proteins. Signal transduction pathways rely on reversible chemical modifications to relay information within and across cells. Covalent modification of protein substrates by ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) contribute to pathways that regulate cellular functions including nuclear transport, cytokinesis, chromosome segregation, G2-M cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation among many others. Post-translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins requires the sequential action of E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases while Ub/Ubl processing and deconjugation is catalyzed by Ub/Ubl-specific proteases. Ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation play an integral role in eukaryotic nuclear metabolism and cell cycle control and our studies are of direct relevance to human health, cancer, and the mission of the NIH. This proposal seeks to address the functional significance for components of the ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation pathways through structural, biochemical and genetic studies that will establish the basis for Ub/Ubl 1) activation, 2) conjugation by E2 and E3 enzymes, 3) and signal transduction through characterization receptors that recognize Ub/Ubl-conjugated substrates. The enzymes, mechanisms and factors that constitute ubiquitin and SUMO protein conjugation pathways are conserved so our studies are broadly relevant to other Ub/Ubl-related pathways. RNA decay. Shifting the balance between RNA transcription and degradation regulates RNA lifetime, quality and abundance. Two principle RNA decay pathways exist in eukaryotes, one catalyzes degradation 5' to 3' while the other degrades RNA in the 3' to 5' direction. The 3' to 5' decay pathway requires the activities of the RNA exosome, a large multi-subunit protein complex that contains a non-catalytic core of nine subunits and two additional subunits that catalyze processive and distributive 3' to 5' RNA exoribonuclease activities. In budding yeast, ten of the eleven genes are essential for life, suggesting the importance of the RNA exosome and its activities in cellular function. Recent efforts illuminated fundamental aspects of eukaryotic exosome structure and function, however many questions remain with respect to the collective activities for exosome subunits in RNA processing and decay and how they are coupled to factors the recruit and modify the RNA substrates. RNA decay pathways play an integral role in eukaryotic nucleic acid metabolism, so our studies are of direct relevance to human health and the mission of the NIH because misregulation of RNA processing and decay is associated with diseases such as cancer, inflammation and neurodegeneration. This proposal will address central issues of human and yeast RNA exosome biology by characterizing individual exosome subunits, by reconstituting multi-subunit RNA exosomes and by analyzing the activities of these complexes in biochemical, genetic and structural studies that will establish functions for the exosome during RNA processing and degradation in vitro and in vivo."
"9284367","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deficits in cognitive control are at the core of many functional declines in healthy older adults. A fundamental contributor to these deficits is compromised regulation of both external and internal attention processes, which leads to a decreased ability to effectively engage in complex, goal-directed behavior. As a result, there is a critical need to develop targeted interventions to reverse or prevent declines in regulation of attention processes in healthy older adults. Targeted cognitive training and focused-attention meditation are two interventions that hold great promise for boosting attention and cognitive control abilities in healthy older adults, but we lack a firm understanding of the neural and physiological mechanisms that underlie this positive neuroplasticity. We also know little about whether such interventions might have multiplicative effects on cognition when administered in a combinatorial manner. The goals of the proposed research are threefold. First, we will determine the unique and synergistic effects of an externally-oriented attention training paradigm and an internally-oriental meditation paradigm on enhancing regulation of external and internal attention in healthy older adults, leading to improvements in functional outcomes. Second, we will examine the impact of potential genetic, physiological, and social moderators of the treatment effects in individuals and subgroups who show variability in their response to the interventions. Third, we will document the neural and physiological mechanisms underlying the unique and synergistic plasticity associated with each individual or combined intervention. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in healthy older adults of two novel cognitive training paradigms that are deployed on wireless mobile devices. We will collect data from two samples: a large (N = 1650) sample that will be recruited nationally who will complete the study entirely on mobile devices and a smaller (N = 225) local sample who will also complete more in-depth lab-based cognitive assessments, EEG, structural MRI, and functional MRI. The national sample will provide the numbers needed to examine individual and subgroup differences in treatment response in an extremely diverse sampling of the general population. The local sample will allow us to dive deeper into the underlying neural and physiological mechanisms that give rise to training effects. Both groups will complete baseline, immediate follow-up, and one-year follow-up assessments of cognitive and functional outcomes, while the local group will undergo neuroimaging at all three time points. We anticipate that the unique methodological approach and experimental design will significantly advance the development of rehabilitation programs directed at the broad range of cognitive abilities and functional outcomes in both healthy and clinical populations that suffer from problematic regulation of attention and cognitive control."
"9266752","Unlike type 2 diabetes, where prevention is possible, type 1 diabetes is currently neither preventable nor curable and its Incidence continues to rise approximately 3% per yr. Thus, the continuing investigation of type 1 diabetes complications remains imperative. The Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study has examined the prevalence and incidence of and risk factors contributing to the diabetes complications for 25 yrs. The study population is a well defined cohort of childhood onset type 1 diabetes identified from the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Registry (diagnosis: 1950-80). All 658 participants attending a clinical exam at study entry (1986-88) have been subsequently followed for up to 25 yrs, leading to over 150 peer reviewed publications. A number of striking observations were made during the last phase of the study which have given rise to questions and hypotheses this continuation will continue to address. These include the increasingly complex interaction between various pro- and anti-glycoxidative and inflammatory cytokines, as well as the rapidly changing natural history of complications which provides further insight into the interrelationships of, and specific risk factors for, complications, and renders historic data outdated for health care and insurance purposes. The current proposal, therefore, focuses on further assessment of complication development for a total follow up period of 30 yrs, thus allowing reasonably stable estimates of complication development over 40 yrs duration of childhood onset type 1 diabetes. This gives the opportunity to document morbidity risk and to estimate life expectancy in the modern era, i.e. for those diagnosed in 1965-80 and who have had more than half their diabetes duration since the availability of HbA1c testing and self monitoring of blood glucose. The roles of glycemic, oxidative and inflammatory stress, and the host's responses they invoke, on complication development will be another major focus along with women's health issues and continuing a number of collaborations. Finally, we will evaluate skin advanced glycosylation end products as a complication predictor for 232 individuals with at least one such assessment. This will be facilitated by continuing the annual surveys and, at 30 yrs of follow up, a full exam. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Type 1 diabetes is currently neither preventable nor curable and its incidence continues to rise about 3% per yr. Thus, the continuing investigation of type 1 diabetes complications remains imperative. The current proposal will not only provide insight on complication incidence, but also fill gaps in knowledge on T1D women's health issues, and the role of stress and host's response and skin AGE on complications."
"9428198","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies identified a nonsynonymous SNP (rs16969968) within the CHRNA5 gene that encodes for the ?5 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subunit. This SNP produces a twofold higher risk for heavy smoking and increases the risk for lung cancer. Consistent with the human genetics, our preliminary studies showed that the ?5 nAChR is necessary for the expression of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome. The ?5 nAChR also regulates sensitive to nicotine-induced behaviors and controls nicotine self-administration at high doses. In these proposed studies, we will investigate ?5's mechanistic action on the midbrain dopamine (DA) systems that reinforce rewarding and addictive behaviors. We will examine the effect of the rs16969968 SNP on DA signaling from its source in the midbrain to its main targets in the striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) which is important for processing reward. Our in vivo multi-tetrode recordings show that nicotine increases the phasic burst firing of DA neurons, and our cyclic voltammetry and in vivo microdialysis data show that nicotine-induced changes in DA neuron firing are translated in a target-specific manner in areas that process reinforcement and reward, including the NAc core and shell. However, little is known about the role of the ?5 subunit or the rs16969968 SNP and about the role of the ?5-subunit in regulating the relationship between DA neuron firing and DA release in targets. Our working hypothesis is that nicotine acts via the ?5-nAChR subunit to modulate DA signaling both at the source (i.e., DA neurons in the midbrain) and at the targets (including the NAc and the dorsal striatum). The aims examine the hypothesis that nicotine-induced changes in the DA system evolve during chronic nicotine exposure and during the withdrawal period. The significance of the study originates from the expectation that these nicotine-induced activities and changes in the DA system contribute to the transition from initial nicotine use to addiction. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and these studies provide a mechanistic basis for nicotine addiction and for developing therapies to aid smoking cessation."
"9264989","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease."
"9271963","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity-linked type 2 diabetes is a major health problem of worldwide epidemic proportions. The onset of the disease is marked by failure of the functional pancreatic islet ß-cell mass to meet metabolic demand, and is thus an insulin insufficient state. It follows that a means to protect and preserve adequate functional ß-cell mass has therapeutic potential for type 2 diabetes. Much is known about nutrient and hormonal regulation of ß-cell function. However, despite it being known for more than 160 years that the central nervous system (CNS) has a significant degree of control over pancreatic islet functions, mechanisms of CNS control over pancreatic ß-cells remain vague. Indeed, the precise regions of the CNS that link to pancreatic islets are unknown. In this proposal it is intended to utilize a novel class of pseudorabies viral vectors (PRV) as retrograde transynaptic neuronal tracers to accurately track the neuronal link between pancreatic islets and specific regions of the CNS in vivo. This will be complemented by several in vivo anterograde-tracing techniques to refine the PRV retrograde tracing. Aim-1 will use both retrograde and anterograde neuronal tracking approaches to reveal a CNS `brain-to-islet topographical map' in mice, at a 5µm-resolution and in 3D. This map will be characterized in detail, particularly to unveil what kind of neuronal cells are within it and to utilize novel anterograde-tracking techniques to identify specific neuronal circuitries that can be activated within this map. In Aim-2 glucose-sensing neurons within the `brain-to-islet map' will be manipulated, using accurate stereotaxic delivery of adenoviral vectors that alter glucokinase activity in specific sub-regions of the hypothalamus. Likewise, in Aim-3, a similar stereotaxic approach will be taken, but aimed at specifically targeting particular hypothalamic insulin-signaling neurons, where insulin receptor and IRS-2 gene function will be manipulated. Then, it will be assessed whether alteration of glucose-sensing and/or insulin-signaling in regions of the CNS which link to pancreatic islets will affect islet cell function in ivo, particularly in regard to control of ß-cell mass, insulin and glucagon secretion. This will be measured relative to metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, so as to distinguish between direct acute effects of the CNS on islet cell function rather than peripheral metabolic effects to which islet cells act secondarily. Thus, the newly revealed `brain-to-islet map' will be validated as a functional guide, and novel mechanistic insight into CNS neuronal control of pancreatic islet cell functions gained. It is anticipated that this research will eventually translate into noel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes/obesity."
"9395731","Project Summary/Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Metastasis reduces survival rates for patients to only 37%, indicating the severity of advanced disease, but there remains much to be understood about the metastatic process. Emerging evidence suggests the tumor microenvironment contributes to HNSCC progression and this proposal aims to clarify the role of one microenvironment cell type, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). HNSCC has a high propensity for metastasis to the lymph nodes, and correlative studies have indicated high expression of the transmembrane glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN) is indicative of poor patient prognosis. It has been suggested that CAFs may be expressing PDPN in the lymph nodes, though this has yet to be determined. In addition, PDPN+ CAFs in other cancer types have been shown to have varying roles in either promoting or inhibiting cancer progression though little data exists for HNSCC. This project will expand upon my preliminary data indicating CAFs from both the primary tumor and tumor-associated lymph nodes are, indeed, PDPN+ and accelerate HNSCC migration in vitro. The overarching objectives are to identify the mechanism of PDPN+ CAFs in facilitating HNSCC invasive and migratory potential, as metrics of metastatic potential, as well as assess the ability of the PDPN+ CAFs to enhance lymphangiogenesis and to seed a pre-metastatic, immunosuppressed, tumor-supportive niche in the lymph nodes. In vitro analyses will investigate the PDPN-dependent secreted factors that may influence HNSCC progression as well as downstream signaling of PDPN within the CAFs that may result in increased cell contractility and immunosuppressive abilities. All in vitro data will be complemented by mouse studies in the presence and absence of PDPN expression with outcomes analyzing lymphatic vasculature density, lymph node immune infiltration, and overall metastatic tumor burden. Study findings are expected to identify PDPN and/or its effectors as (a) potential target(s) for the treatment of metastatic HNSCC in an effort to reduce mortality rates caused by the devastation of metastatic occurrence."
"9174851","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of death in the US. CVD currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the U.S., accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. The total cost of CVD in the U.S., including hospitalizations and lost productivity, is approximately $300 billion annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of deaths and the majority of these costs. While the efforts aimed at treating this disease in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. Over the last decade, the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased exponentially. Between 1996 and 2007, the number of PCIs performed in the U.S. increased more than 4-fold, from approximately 300,000 to more than 1.3 million yearly. During this time, PCI has accounted for 10% of the overall increase in Medicare expenditures. In light of the extraordinary increase in the use of this technology in recent years, questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. Despite the fact that PCI is expensive, repeat PCI is common and there is no evidence for improved survival, alternative therapies are rarely considered. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in PCI candidates is exercise training. In the PCI vs. Exercise Training (Leipzig) study, PCI candidates randomized to one year of exercise training had improved coronary anatomy, higher exercise capacity, an improvement in quality of life and event-free survival, as well as lower health care costs when compared to the PCI group. However, the Leipzig study employed invasive angiographic methods which do not provide information on dynamic coronary flow or atherosclerosis specifically, and do not provide insight into the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression or regression. In addition, economic analyses were limited to cost per change in Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class; the Leipzig study did not assess cost effectiveness. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise and risk reduction in PCI candidates, the current proposal is termed PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is apply newer imaging technologies to determine whether patients randomized to an exercise program have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Both groups will receive optimal medical management. We will also compare health care costs, symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes between the two groups. At baseline and one year after randomization, patients will undergo an assessment of physical activity patterns and fitness using standardized questionnaires and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). Patients will also undergo a detailed evaluation of coronary function and anatomy with positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). PET will be used to measure myocardial perfusion and endothelial function. CTA will be used to evaluate anatomical progression of atherosclerotic disease based on a qualitative scoring system and quantitative measurement of calcified and noncalcified plaque burden. The combination of PET/CTA provides information that previously could only be obtained invasively using coronary flow wires and invasive x-ray angiography. This will permit a noninvasive way to evaluate both functional and anatomical adaptations to exercise. Our overall objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI for coronary lesions."
"9277034","The overarching goal of this NRSA application is to provide a high quality mentored training experience for promising clinical and translational researchers in the rapidly growing area of genomic and precision medicine to gain the knowledge and skills to enable them to successfully establish independent clinical research programs. Future genomic medicine investigators will require a strong foundation of specialized training to continue making new discoveries and to develop the translational research programs that enable implementation of new genomic discoveries into clinical care. We propose a 2-year postdoctoral training program, offering trainees a range of research opportunities in applied clinical and translational genomic medicine research (wet or dry lab), bioinformatics and computational biology, engineering, and statistics to eligible applicants with an MD or PhD. We are requesting 2 training slots in Year 1, and 4 slots thereafter. At least three existing or proposed T32 programs at Duke will donate a slot to this T32 leveraging the NIH investment in this program. Duke?s commitment to interdisciplinary research in genomic medicine will attract promising and diverse post-doctoral fellows across the life sciences. We have assembled 27 senior investigators as mentors and 24 junior investigators as co-mentors for this program. The mentored research experience will require trainees to establish, with the assistance of the program directors (PDs), an interdisciplinary mentoring team consisting of 2 or 3 mentors to guide their research program and career development. The research training experience will be designed to provide specialized training and will also consider broader issues impacted by their research including ethical, legal, and social implications. Supporting their research will be laboratory rotations for select research techniques, a suite of coursework and informal learning opportunities. A minimal core set of courses in genomics, clinical research, statistics and ethics must be completed by each trainee; additional elective courses may be taken to support the trainee?s research focus. Trainees will be required to meet with the PDs quarterly. Regular meetings of the trainee and his/her mentorship team will provide ongoing assessment of progress that will be reported and evaluated by the PDs and the program?s Executive Committee. Trainees will be required to present their research at Duke conferences and at national meetings and submit manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications. The mentorship team and the Executive Committee will assist each trainee to apply for grant opportunities and obtain a post- fellowship faculty position in academia or relevant sector that will allow continuation of his/her research. Trainees must spend at least 75% effort while they are supported; the trainees? clinical experience will be highly focused on the practice of genomic medicine in genomic medicine practice environments at Duke. Trainees in this program will benefit from the rich and highly interdisciplinary resources available at Duke for clinical and translational genomic medicine research and build upon its strong history and experience in post- doctoral training."
"9503832","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive cocaine use. Significant effort has been dedicated to reveal neurobehavioral factors responsible for promoting craving and drug seeking. Despite such effort, effective interventions to prevent cocaine relapse have yet to be established. An alternative research strategy may thus prove beneficial. For this premise, an omission cue-induced suppression (OCIS) paradigm was developed to investigate the relapse-suppressing potential of cues that signal cocaine omission (unavailability) in rats with a history of compulsiv cocaine intake. Preliminary results indicate a novel finding that, despite the history of compulsive cocaine intake, omission cues suppress cocaine seeking triggered by all major modes of relapse-promotion (drug cues, stress and cocaine priming) as well as cocaine intake. Additional results indicate that omission cues induce Fos (a marker of neural activation) in a discrete subpopulation of neurons localized within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) - a region implicated in cognitive control of cocaine craving. Importantly, selective disruption of omission cue-activated neurons in mPFC blocked the subsequent expression of OCIS. Thus, 1) omission cue-induced neural activation in mPFC mediates OCIS. Because neural activation is a product of local excitatory neurotransmission, OCIS is likely controlled by 2) omission cue-activated excitatory neurotransmission in mPFC, as well as 3) omission cue- activated excitatory afferent innervations to mPFC - brain substrates known to provide the drive to induce neural activation in mPFC. Considering the above, this project will test the overarching hypothesis that OCIS of cocaine seeking is controlled by omission cue-activated excitatory neurotransmission and afferents driving distinct neural activation in mPFC. Three Aims are proposed to establish the medial prefrontal cortical 1) neural phenotypes, 2) neurochemical signals and 3) neurocircuitry responsible for relapse-suppression by cocaine omission cues. Collectively, the expected results will establish brain mechanisms that actively suppress - rather than promote - cocaine relapse, and therefore present new insights for blocking relapse."
"9321850","Project Summary  An NIA funded K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide valuable training in the fields of aging and Alzheimer?s disease to facilitate my career as an independent research investigator. This grant mechanism will not only allow for critical scientific training, but also valuable career development under the mentorship of Dr. David Holtzman.  During this award period, I propose to investigate the association between cognitive function and circadian rhythms during the aging process and Alzheimer?s disease (AD) progression. Cognitive decline is associated with aging and is the defining feature of AD. Circadian rhythms, which are 24-hour oscillations in behavior and physiological functions decline with age and are severely blunted with AD progression. In fact, recent studies suggest disruptions to the circadian system may occur prior to the clinical onset of memory deficits in AD. Yet, mechanisms by which the circadian system impacts cognitive processes during aging and AD pathogenesis are relatively unknown. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that the decay in circadian rhythmicity as observed in aging and to a greater extent in AD, causes pathological disturbances in brain regions associated with memory processing. The following aims will test this hypothesis: (1) Examine the circadian oscillation of transcriptional, biochemical, and electrophysiological processes in brain regions which support memory function in mouse models of aging and AD. (2) Examine the effects of altering circadian function on behavioral, physiological, and molecular rhythms, and if this intervention influences AD pathogenesis. The concepts and methods in this proposal are innovative and have the potential for substantially impacting our understanding for the role of circadian function on memory in aging and AD progression. Our long-term goal is to identify possible strategies to ameliorate cognitive impairments and disease progression."
"9275479","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Budesonide versus fluticasone for treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis ABSTRACT Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging immune-mediated disease defined by abnormal infiltration of eosinophils into the esophageal mucosa, leading to dysphagia, progressive esophageal stenosis, and food impaction. Though initially thought to be rare, the incidence and prevalence are rising dramatically, and over the past decade EoE has rapidly become a major cause of upper gastrointestinal morbidity. The treatment of EoE, however, remains rudimentary and data are needed to inform practice. Corticosteroids are currently the mainstay of therapy for EoE, but there are no FDA-approved medications for EoE. Instead, asthma preparations are used, most commonly fluticasone in a multi-dose inhaler (MDI) or aqueous budesonide. These medications are swallowed, rather than inhaled, to coat the esophagus, but it is unknown whether fluticasone or budesonide is the most effective first line agent. It is also unknown how durable the response to these medications are, and whether baseline measurement of tissue biomarkers can predict treatment response. These are crucial and unanswered questions in EoE. We have recently conducted the first and only randomized trial directly comparing two topical formulations for treatment of EoE, and found that swallowing viscous slurry of budesonide was more effective than nebulizing and then swallowing an aqueous budesonide solution. However, viscous budesonide has never been directly compared with fluticasone, and these two medications are most commonly prescribed for EoE. We also have preliminary data showing that levels of major basic protein, eotaxin-3, and mast cell tryptase determined by immunohistochemical staining of esophageal biopsies predict treatment response. The specific aims of this project are 1) to determine whether viscous budesonide is more effective than fluticasone MDI for improving esophageal eosinophil counts and symptoms of dysphagia in patients with EoE after an initial treatment course; 2) to determine whether treatment with viscous budesonide results in less symptomatic and histologic recurrence than fluticasone MDI one year after the initial treatment course; and 3) to determine whether increased baseline staining of esophageal biopsies for major basic protein, eotaxin-3, and mast cell tryptase is associated with histologic response in EoE patients treated with topical corticosteroids. To achieve these aims, we will conduct a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing viscous budesonide to fluticasone MDI. This innovative and hypothesis-driven study is backed by strong preliminary data generated by the PI while he was supported by an NIH career development award. It will be conducted by an established and unique multidisciplinary team with nationally recognized expertise in EoE, clinical trials, epidemiology, pathology, and translational science. The results will have a major clinical impact on the treatment algorithm for EoE by determining which medications doctors should use first and allowing them to predict treatment response. Data from this study will also readily lead to future trials of individualized treatment protocols for patients with EoE."
"9396620","Seasonal circulation of influenza A viruses (IAVs) annually causes substantial morbidity and mortality and has negative economic impacts estimated in the billions of dollars. Influenza pandemics caused by the emergence of novel, zoonotic IAVs pose an even greater threat. For decades, a key idea in influenza epidemiology has been that all humans would lack immunity against a novel influenza subtype that emerged from animals to cause a pandemic. However, our recent study showed that large parts of the human population actually have strong, pre-existing immunity against influenza A/H5N1 and A/H7N9, two avian subtypes of great concern for pandemic emergence in humans. Protection against particular subtypes with pandemic potential is predictably distributed across birth years, and occurs in individuals who were first exposed during childhood to an influenza A virus with hemagglutinin antigens (HA) in the same genetic group as the novel, emerging subtype of interest. The follow-up studies proposed here aim to (1) use reconstructed HA imprinting patterns to forecast age distributions of severe infection in future pandemics and (2) determine whether broadly-protective childhood HA imprinting affects the epidemiology of seasonal influenza subtypes A/H1N1 and A/H3N2.  Aim 1 - pandemic influenza. We aim to determine whether, and by what factor, protective childhood HA imprinting reduces susceptibility to infection with novel IAVs, transmissibility of mild infections that do occur in protected individuals, or both. To estimate the size and significance of each possible effect, we will apply multitype branching processes and statistical inference to data on all known cases of A/H5N1 and A/H7N9. The results of this analysis will improve the accuracy of existing models, which can use information on birth year-specific childhood HA imprinting to forecast age distributions of severe infection in future pandemics. These forecasts can inform pandemic preparedness and response strategies, and can help target limited treatment resources toward high-risk age groups.  Aim 2 ? seasonal influenza. Two IAV subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2, have circulated seasonally in humans since 1977, however H3N2 infections cause the vast majority of influenza-related fatalities in elderly adults. Mismatched childhood imprinting may contribute to increased H3N2 risk in the elderly, but observed differences in H3N2 vs. H1N1 risk could also be explained by higher intrinsic virulence of the H3N2 virus, or by other conventional, age-specific epidemiological factors. To determine whether, and how strongly, mismatched childhood imprinting contributes to increased H3N2 risk in elderly cohorts, I will analyze data on over 18,000 cases of seasonal influenza using a combination of statistical analyses, mathematical models and model comparison. This analysis will inform whether and how H3N2 vs. H1N1 risk in the elderly should be expected to change over time, as birth cohorts with different histories of childhood HA imprinting become older."
"9275432","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritic symptom is the key reason to seek medical assistance, yet there is no effective way to relieve osteoarthritis (OA)-induced pain. Our long term goal is to understand the discrepancy between the degree of cartilage degeneration and the actual experience of joint pain by investigating the neuroanatomical approaches in an experimental OA model followed by validation in human joint tissues. We propose that OA pain sensation can develop independently of progressive cartilage degeneration, and that severity of joint pain is due to cellular and molecular plasticity in the sensory neurons of the innervating dorsal root ganglion and pathological changes in synovium (e.g., synovitis, angiogenesis). We will identify the fundamental factors that facilitate pro- nociception in OA independently of the degree of cartilage degeneration. Our studies will also provide important empirical support for the development of clinical strategies to treat OA symptoms. Our results will provide a novel view of major disease-modified chronic pain mechanisms that accompany degeneration of knee joints in OA. At a broader level, results from this proposal will impact our conceptual perspectives and future research translation by clarifying relationships between musculoskeletal tissue degeneration and debilitating OA symptoms."
"9281862","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and despite current advances in therapies, morbidity and mortality continue to increase. Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department care, hospitalization, and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Although urban children suffer the largest burden from asthma, they are the least likely group to receive adequate preventive care, and poor adherence plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of nonadherence.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of suffering that could be prevented with improvements in care. This application builds on our extensive experience with efficacious school-based programs for urban children and teens with asthma. The overall goal is to broadly disseminate a novel system of asthma care throughout the entire city school district ('School Based Asthma Care for Teens'; SBACT), and test its effectiveness in improving adherence and reducing morbidity among urban teens.  The SB-ACT intervention includes two core components. First, adolescents visit the school nurse daily for 6-8 weeks at the start of the school year to receive a trial of directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications. The goal is for the teen to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience the benefits and value of daily preventive therapy. Four to 6 weeks after the initiation of DOT, the teen will receive a motivational interviewing (MI) counseling program designed to  enhance the teen's motivation to transition to independent, sustained preventive medication use. We will train community-based nurses affiliated with the local American Lung Association to deliver the MI component. The MI nurse will conduct three counseling sessions with the teen at school, which are designed to capitalize on the teen's experience with DOT and the potential benefits they experienced. Given the complex nature of  asthma care in this population, we plan to evaluate this intervention using a 3-group design in which 430 teens  will be randomly assigned to either; 1) the SB-ACT program (trial of DOT for 6-8 weeks + 3 MI counseling  sessions); 2) DOT-only (DOT only for 6-8 weeks); or 3) an asthma education (AE) comparison group (in-school  asthma education delivered by a trained asthma educator). We include the DOT-only group to evaluate whether this component alone is sufficient to promote sustained adherence without counseling. The AE group is designed to enhance asthma care and control for the attention received in MI counseling. We will assess the effectiveness of the SB-ACT intervention in reducing asthma morbidity, perform an economic sustainability analysis, and evaluate each component of program implementation with a focus on sustainability and dissemination. At the completion of the study, the effectiveness of this system of school-based asthma care will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care for adolescents and reduce health disparities."
"9403725","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Intractable cocaine craving precipitated by exposure to a cocaine-associated environmental context is a major factor contributing to drug relapse. This phenomenon depends on available long-term memories of context- response-drug associations. Recent findings indicate that associative memories become labile upon retrieval and need to undergo protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation into long-term memory stores in order to be retained over time. Cocaine-induced pathology in memory reconsolidation may result in unusually salient or intrusive cocaine memories that manifest as increased cue reactivity and propensity for drug relapse in a drug- associated environment. Thus, the long-term goal of this research program is to enhance our understanding of the functional neuroanatomy and cellular mechanisms of cocaine memory reconsolidation. During the previous funding period, we have shown that protein synthesis-dependent memory reconsolidation occurs in the basolateral amygdala. Remarkably, this process is functionally dependent on neural activity in the dorsal hippocampus, even though the two brain regions do not share monosynaptic connections. Logically extending this line of research in this competitive renewal application, Specific Aim 1 will identify novel memory reconsolidation circuits. Based on our new preliminary findings, we will test the hypothesis that the locus coeruleus serves as a relay between the dorsal hippocampus and basolateral amygdala to permit cocaine memory reconsolidation. In addition, we will evaluate how the inhibition of specific pathways within this putative circuitry alters electrophysiological activity at the targeted terminal region of each pathway. During the previous funding period, we also identified cellular mechanisms that are necessary for cocaine memory reconsolidation. Systematically extending this line of research, Specific Aim 2 will identify novel cellular mechanisms of cocaine memory reconsolidation in the basolateral amygdala. Based on our preliminary findings, Aim 2 will focus on the endocannabinoids (eCB), anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the basolateral amygdala. We will evaluate the extent to which memory reconsolidation is sufficient to produce changes in eCB levels, eCB degradation, and pyramidal cell excitability within the basolateral amygdala. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that AEA inhibits - whereas 2-AG facilitates ? the reconsolidation of labile cocaine memories and the activation of a requisite cellular mediator of memory reconsolidation within the basolateral amygdala. To accomplish these Aims, we will utilize sophisticated behavioral, novel optogenetic functional disconnection, and electrophysiological recording protocols, as well as immunohistochemistry, quantitative Western blotting, and eCB biochemical assays. Overall, renewal of this productive research program has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the neural basis of cocaine memory reconsolidation and to provide an essential conceptual framework for future research and addiction treatment development efforts."

"9352768","Abstract The scientific community has grown increasingly aware of problems with the reliability and reproducibility of research in the health and social sciences. In part, these problems arise from a lack of transparency?including selective presentation of results and the failure to publicly share research data, materials, and code. Together with intentional scientific misconduct, these practices have contributed to the perception that research findings lack credibility and integrity calls to action by leaders of the scientific community, including the National Institutes of Health. Addressing deficiencies in researcher practices and workflows will require a multi-pronged approach The Research Transparency and Reproducibility Training (RT2) project aims to create the infrastructure and resources needed to promote transparent, reproducible workflows in universities and institutes throughout the U.S. RT2 will assemble an interdisciplinary group of thought leaders to prioritize challenges in current research practice and identify promising solutions. This will inform an annual conference and curricula that increases awareness of the value of open science, and facilitates the adoption of practices and tools designed to make research more reproducible. Annual conferences will be used not only to promote the diffusion of new tools and ideas, but also to identify the most effective channels for changing researcher behavior. The RT2 team will longitudinally track changes in the practices of RT2 faculty and learners through periodic surveys, qualitative feedback, and web analytics (including publication records, use of trial registries and data repositories, and activity on open science platforms). curriculum will be redefined each year, producing a continuously refreshed body of tools and methods informed by evolving evidence.

"9271949","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Metabolomics is emerging as an important approach to study biological systems. Measurement of many metabolites at one time has led to important discoveries of disease biomarkers, drug effects, and mechanism of cellular function. Despite the success of metabolomics, current analytical methods are limited in their ability to measure a large fraction of the metabolome. As a result, many changes in the metabolome are not detected by current techniques. High pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) is a prominent method for metabolomics. In this work, we seek to develop new approaches to HPLC that will vastly improve the resolving power for complex mixtures and apply these methods to metabolomics. The resolving power of HPLC increases with column length and with decreasing diameter of stationary phase particles. Changing these dimensions of the HPLC column also increases the pressure required to pump mobile phase through the column. HPLC has traditionally been limited to about 8,000 psi (lbs/in2), but advanced commercial systems can generate up to 19,000 psi. Application of these ultra high pressure LC (UHPLC) systems has yielded significant improvement in the ability to detect metabolites in complex mixtures; however, these systems still fall far short of the goal of resolving all metabolites in common biological samples. We will develop UHPLC systems with capability of 100,000 psi and compatible LC columns. We will investigate use of both reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography at these extreme pressures to measure metabolites across a broad polarity range. We hypothesize that the new technology will allow measurement of thousands of more metabolites in a given sample than currently possible. The new method should also enhance sensitivity and reproducibility of metabolite detection in complex samples. The new methods will be used to identify metabolic pathways involved in models of adipogenesis, adaptation to high exercise capacity, and diabetic complications. Further, newly developed instrumentation and methods will be incorporated into a national center for metabolomics to ensure widespread impact of the new technology."

"9352351","Routine high-sensitivity multiplexed detection of disease biomarkers in blood will have an impact on early diagnosis and therapy selection. A novel and highly effective approach for detection of broad categories of disease is multiplexed detection of antibodies using protein microarrays. As a greater number of antibody biomarkers are being identified and clinically validated for viral infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disease, there is a strong need to detect them with greater sensitivity and greater signal-to-noise ratio, while at the same time being able to perform automated biomarker analysis with low cost per test. In the proposed project, the investigators integrate photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence (PCEF) technology with a novel size-exclusion blood filtration technology to develop a multiplexed microspot fluorescent sandwich assay platform for the clinical laboratory environment. Our approach integrates several innovations into an inexpensive plastic-based sensor cartridge and desktop detection instrument: 1. A silicon-based nanostructured resonant optical photonic crystal chip with an integrated Fabry-Perot optical cavity will be used to deliver ~50x greater signal enhancement than current-generation PCEF devices, which already routinely provide <1 pg/ml limits of detection in complex media, using only 10 ?l sample volumes. 2. A laser-machined blood filter will separate plasma from a droplet of heparinized whole blood in 60 seconds, enabling the entire assay protocol to be performed automatically in <60 minutes without user intervention. 3. An innovative laser scanning approach is used to couple light from a small semiconductor laser directed to the PC surface in the optimal ?on-resonance? condition, resulting in a rugged, compact instrument with a cost of <$10K. 4. A statistical bioinformatics tool indicating the presence or absence of the biomarkers in the test sample. As an example application of the system, we will focus our effort on detection of a panel of 3 serum antibodies for human papillomavirus (HPV) as a means for identifying patients with greater susceptibility to oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC), although the same technology can be extended to detection of broad classes of antibody biomarkers. The new instrument will be first tested upon biomarkers spiked into whole blood, with results compared against single-antibody ELISA in microplates and the Luminex bead-based system. Further validation and comparison will be performed upon clinical blood samples from patients with known HPV exposure. Our long-term goal is to demonstrate a prototype system that can be applied broadly for multiplexed serum antibody biomarker analysis."
"9292344","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research program is to develop an optical magnetometer array for use in fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) and fetal magneto-encephalography (fMEG) systems. The proposed magnetometer, based on recent advances in magnetometer technology, represents the first viable alternative to SQUID magnetometers; thus, the potential impact of the research on the field of biomagnetism is enormous. Utilization of fMCG and fMEG has been limited by the high cost of acquisition and maintenance associated with SQUID technology. The atomic magnetometer can mitigate these disadvantages while maintaining or even surpassing the magnetic field sensitivity of SQUID magnetometers. A novel, four-channel atomic biomagnetometer array was recently demonstrated for adult and fetal MCG studies. The next steps are to refine it for use in conventional magnetically shielded rooms and to extend its capabilities to inexpensive shielding geometries. The specific aims of this project are: 1. to demonstrate a 9-channel atomic magnetometer array for direct comparison to commercial SQUIDs for detection of signals from 20 week gestation period fetuses. 2. To extend the bandwidth and dynamic range of the atomic magnetometer for use in inexpensive shielding environments. 3. To make pre-clinical studies of at-risk fetuses with the magnetometer array. To achieve these aims, the researchers will investigate new modes of operation of the magnetometer that improve its bandwidth and dynamic range. New data processing methodologies will be considered, and the developments will be tested with human subjects."
"9353277","ABSTRACT The deterioration of neural circuits in the brain is a contributing factor to the perceptual deficits associated with aging. The long-term goals of our research are to understand the molecular and neural alterations that underlie age-related perceptual impairments. The primary objective of this R03 pilot proposal is to characterize the molecular neuropharmacological alterations to Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which enable glutamatergic inhibition at forebrain synapses. The central hypothesis is that the expression of these Group II mGluRs is altered with age in the neocortex. This is rationalized to result in changes to the balance of excitation and inhibition in the neocortex and contribute to the emergence of age-related sensory perceptual deficits. Several neuroanatomical and neurophysiological features of these receptors have been identified, which forms the basis for the proposed investigation. The specific aims of this project are to characterize the alterations to Group II mGluRs in the neocortex with age by examining: 1) changes in the neuroanatomical expression patterns of these receptors and 2) alterations to forebrain neurophysiological responses mediated by pharmacological activation of these receptors. The proposed experiments are expected to identify the age- related changes to Group II mGluRs in the neocortex and guide our future investigations aimed at directly linking these receptor alterations with the perceptual deficits experienced during aging and ultimately restoring normal behavior in this model system. These experiments will have a positive impact by illuminating the potentially important role of Group II mGluRs in age-related perceptual deficits and as a prospective therapeutic target for these conditions."
"9379300","Abstract:  Electronic cigarettes are rapidly becoming popular as a substitute for cigarette smoking and as an adjunct for smoking cessation. Unfortunately, little is known about use of these new tobacco products in pregnant women. Although the best option would be for pregnant women to stop using tobacco products entirely, a central question for women who do not quit smoking is ?Are electronic cigarettes a net benefit or harm in terms of toxicant exposure and birth outcomes?? Because electronic cigarettes do not burn tobacco, they may reduce carbon monoxide (CO) exposure (a toxin that may contribute to low birth weight and neurotoxicity) and carcinogen exposure, which has been linked to low birth weight and childhood cancer. However, a concern exists that electronic cigarettes may present risks in pregnancy that match or exceed those of cigarette smoking such as increased nicotine exposure (particularly in dual users), and an increase formaldehyde exposure, which has been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes in nonsmokers.  We will recruit 125 pregnant smokers and 250 pregnant electronic cigarette users (125 women who use e- cigs exclusively during pregnancy, and 125 dual users). We will advise women to stop all tobacco use, and provide written materials and quitline referrals. Maternal toxicant exposure levels of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), formaldehyde, and cotinine (major metabolite of nicotine) will be obtained throughout pregnancy and infant levels of NNAL and cotinine will be obtained at the time of delivery. We will also obtain data on birth weight, gestational age, and other reproductive outcomes.  Our primary objective is to compare toxicant exposure in pregnant women who use electronic cigarettes compared to women who smoke conventional cigarettes. We hypothesize that women who smoke conventional cigarettes exclusively will have higher NNAL and cotinine concentrations throughout pregnancy and at delivery than electronic cigarette users. We will also explore differences in urine formaldehyde levels. Another primary objective is to examine the impact of conventional cigarettes compared to electronic cigarettes on birth weight. We hypothesize that infants born to exclusive conventional cigarette smokers will have lower birth weights than those of electronic cigarette users. We will also examine mechanisms by which conventional and electronic cigarettes could impact birth weight and other reproductive outcomes using toxicant biomarkers as well as biomarkers of inflammation.  Results from this project can be used to better inform clinicians who may be in a position to counsel pregnant women about the potential effects of electronic cigarette use during pregnancy."
"9287932","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this collaborative project among investigators led by Drs. Michael Boehnke at the University of Michigan, Steven McCarroll of Harvard University and the Broad Institute, and Carlos Pato at the University of Southern California, is to use high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways that contribute to the risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and to construct a data resource for future genetic studies of these and other psychiatric disorders. This proposal builds on active collaborations among our groups on these important disorders and more generally on our experience in building genome variation resources, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, that are used throughout human genetics. Our research team combines strengths in high-throughput genetics and genomics, development and application of innovative computational and statistical analyses that maximize the benefits of new technologies, and leadership of large scientific consortia. In four Specific Aims, we propose whole genome sequencing (at ~30x coverage) and statistical analysis of 10,000 well-phenotyped and re-contactable individuals from the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC), equally divided among schizophrenia cases, bipolar cases, and psychiatrically normal controls, and comprised of equal numbers of European-Ancestry (EA), African-Ancestry (AA), and Latino individuals. We will carry out association analysis comparing schizophrenia cases to controls, bipolar cases to controls, and the combined cases to controls in the resulting sequence data, and by collaboration and meta-analysis with other investigators with relevant sequence data that become available. We will also use these sequence data as part of a reference panel to impute into tens of thousands of other genomes in the broader Psychiatric GWAS Consortium (PGC) data to allow association analysis based on substantially larger numbers of individuals. Finally, we will share data and methods to support similar studies of other psychiatric phenotypes and more broadly across the scientific community. The successful completion of these aims will provide new insights into molecular etiology that could catalyze breakthroughs in the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."
"9403062","Abstract Infections are commonly reported onboard spacecraft, but the mechanisms responsible are not well understood. Both tissue-specific and systemic (bone marrow) responses have been implicated. Systems to model and prevent or treat infections in microgravity are important components of mission planning. Our underlying hypothesis is that Immunosuppression in microgravity is due to loss of both local and systemic responses to bacteria that can be modeled and are susceptible to therapy. Based on extensive preliminary data we propose 2 new models to address potential mechanisms of compromised immunity on the ISS. In the UG3 Phase we will develop and refine: 1.An airway-on-a-chip that incorporates a 3-layer topology with both airway and vascular access is used to probe intrinsic susceptibility to airway infections from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in microgravity 2. A bone marrow-on-a-chip that will be used to test mobilization of neutrophils from the marrow in response to physiologic modifiers that induce neutrophil release from marrow. Once validated, these devices will be packaged in remotely- controllable modules that will be sent to the ISS for deployment in microgravity, while control devices subject to unit gravity will be mimicked in a terrestrial facility. Our implementation partners, STaARS ans Space Pharma will be intimately involved in the development and hardening of the tissues on chips in a space-ready fashion, and in establishment of remote control and real-time data recovery from ISS. After successful data gathering and post-flight analysis from the UH3 phase, we will design and implement an integrated device in the UH3 Phase. We propose to interconnect the devices these devices so as to test the interaction between these tissues that controls innate immunity. Similarly, once validated and shown to reflect the physiological principles that control recruitment of innate immune cells to infected organs, the devices will be packaged and deployed to the ISS for a second analysis in microgravity. The goals of the project are to test feasibility of microfluidic devices to reflect physiological principles while being delivered to orbit; and to provide access to modular components that can be interconnected to understand the integrated behavior of complex human responses."
"9398810","This proposal addresses one of the most urgent needs in the clinical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the development of targeted and less toxic therapies. Recent studies have shown that 50-60% of HNSCC tumors harbor mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene with other studies demonstrating that disruptive mutations in TP53 are associated with worse prognosis and survival. Additional studies have linked HPV infection as a second pathway to p53 inactivation in HNSCC. Despite overwhelming evidence implicating p53 functional derangement in the biology and clinical outcome of HNSCC, there are no targeted therapies that capitalize on this knowledge. Towards this goal, we hypothesized that the driver oncogenic/tumor suppressor mutations (i.e., TP53 loss) that confer dominant malignant phenotypes in cancer cells also engender unique, exploitable vulnerabilities. Since p53 mutant HNSCCs are aggressive tumors incapable of G1 arrest and with higher levels of genomic instability, these tumors rely on a functional G2/M cell cycle checkpoint to repair the DNA damage that might occur as a result of this instability or through genotoxic therapy. In support of this hypothesis, we identified p53 synthetic lethal interactions with several G2/M checkpoint regulators using high throughput arrayed siRNA gene silencing against human kinases in p53-mutated HNSCC. Moreover, treatment with AZD1775, a specific WEE1 inhibitor, blocked tumor growth as a single agent and caused tumor regression when used in combination with cisplatin in p53 mutant HNSCC xenografts. To translate these findings to the clinic, we opened a phase I clinical trial with AZD1775 in combination with neoadjuvant weekly cisplatin and docetaxel in previously untreated, metastatic HNSCC patients. Building on these successes, this proposal will provide needed mechanistic understanding on the biology of p53 alterations and G2/M reliance in HNSCC, while providing translational data to advance WEE1 inhibition with AZD1775 as a novel therapy for HNSCC. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will determine the mechanism(s) of growth arrest upon WEE1 inhibition in HNSCC and determine how p53 inactivation affects this response. In Aim 2 we will identify novel sensitizers to the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 to unveil novel synergistic and less toxic partners for combinatorial therapy. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will leverage our ongoing phase I clinical trial to functionally evaluate the effects of AZD1775 on tumor biopsies and relevant preclinical models established from patient biopsies before and after treatment to correlate markers of WEE1 inhibition to p53 status and clinical efficacy for the first time in HNSCC. This new knowledge will help inform which HNSCC might benefit most from this line of therapy and help advance AZD1775 into phase II clinical trials."
"9335999","Abstract:  Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is gaining increased attention as a noninvasive tool for a number of therapies, e.g. essential tremor, neuromodulation, tumor ablation, etc. In addition, recent results demonstrating the feasibility tFUS-mediated blood brain barrier opening promise to extend the therapeutic applications of tFUS to a myriad of conditions and diseases of the brain. The majority of the published work employ MRI for monitoring and, in some applications, control of tFUS exposure or its bioeffects. While this imaging modality has proved to be essential to advancing tFUS applications so far, the precise delivery of localized tFUS still faces major challenges due to the uncertainties of wave propagation through the skull. This could present a major barrier towards the widespread safe and ef?cacious use of FUS in transcranial therapies. The long-term objective is to develop a real-time system for monitoring and delivering transcranial FUS therapies in patients using dual-mode ultrasound (DMUA) systems. DMUAs are capable of operating in both therapy and imaging modes in real-time allowing for immediate feedback on tFUS-tissue interactions at the target as well as the intervening and surrounding tissues, including the scalp and skull. We propose to develop real-time refocusing algorithms to improve the safety and ef?cacy of tFUS therapy of targeted structures within the brain. We present preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of refocusing and propose to extend our results to wideband tFUS application. This approach maximizes the bandwidth of the imaging/therapy pulses to improve the localization and heating ef?ciency at the target while minimizing exposure to the skull. The DMUA approach is uniquely capable of providing this kind of feedback due to the inherent registration between the imaging and therapeutic coordinate systems. In addition to the multiband adaptive refocusing method, we propose to develop imaging methods to characterize the quality of tFUS in vivo and ex vivo at the target and critical points on the skull. This includes the development of a quantitative method to estimate the heating rate. This quantitative measurement will provide speci?c feedback for assessing the improvement due to adaptive refocusing. Finally, we propose to test and validate the refocusing and heating rate estimation method in vivo rat model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy."
"9394426","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways present in 8% of the US population. It is associated with billions of dollars in health car costs and poorly controlled asthma is the leading medical cause of school absenteeism. Although research has made great strides in elucidating the underlying mechanisms involved in asthma, there have been no new classes of therapeutics for many decades resulting in up to 40% of asthmatics having incompletely controlled symptoms. Components of the most widely used asthma medications, long acting inhaled beta agonists, are associated with an increased death rate from asthma and are currently under FDA-mandated review for long term safety. Our laboratory discovered the expression of GABAA receptors on airway smooth muscle and demonstrated that activation of these classic neuronal receptors could relax airway smooth muscle. We then demonstrated that a complete GABAergic system existed in multiple lung cells including ionotropic GABAA receptors, metabotropic GABAB receptors, the enzymes that synthesize GABA (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and GABA transporters. The GABAA receptors that relax airway smooth muscle contain either an ?4 or ?5 subunit. Remarkably we have now discovered that key inflammatory cells that mediate allergic lung inflammation also express ?4 subunit-containing GABAA channels. In the current proposal we continue our collaboration with a leading GABAA ligand medicinal chemist to identify novel ligands that activate ?4 or ?5 subunit-containing GABAA channels that will both relax airway smooth muscle and inhibit lung inflammation-the two key pathologic components of asthma. We seek to synthesize derivatives of novel ligands that will be delivered to a murine asthma model by inhalation that would not penetrate the CNS to avoid undesired effects. In aim 1 we will deliver aerosols of GABAA ?4 or ?5 ligands to asthmatic mice while challenging their airways with a contractile mediator and measure resulting tissue concentrations in plasma, lung, liver and brain. In aim 2 we will test the ability of these GABAA ligands to relax isolated human airway smooth muscle strips and determine the link between their control of membrane potential and intracellular signaling events that control contraction. In aim 3 we will utilize mice lacking GABAA ?4 subunits to demonstrate the critical role of GABAA ?4 receptors in allergic lung inflammation. We will demonstrate the role of GABAA ?4 receptors in regulating membrane potential and lymphocyte activation and proliferation. These approaches offer a radical new therapy, a translational therapeutic approach and a novel paradigm for targeting two key components of asthma; inflammation and airway smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness."
"9310293","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inherent autofluorescence (AF) of the fundus originates from RPE lipofuscin. While RPE lipofuscin is amassed even in healthy eyes, homozygous mutations in ABCA4 are well known to confer accelerated formation of these fluorophores. Moreover, imaging of fundus AF by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) has shown that the patterns and intensities of AF deviate from normal in several retinal disorders. Thus we aim to demonstrate that a standardized approach to quantifying fundus AF (qAF) can assist in the diagnosis of retinal disease, in the monitoring of disease progression and in the assessment of therapeutic outcomes. To enable this investigation we have gathered normative qAF data from a large number of participants with healthy eye status (aged 6-60) so as to establish ranges of qAF values with respect to age, gender and ethnicity. Going forward we will use these normal values to examine for genotype/phenotype correlations between specific ABCA4 alleles and fundus AF levels (qAF) in patients diagnosed with ABCA4- associated disease (Aim 1.1). In longitudinal studies we will measure changes in qAF values after 1 and 2 year follow-up of ABCA4-affected individuals (Aim 1.2). We will determine whether the carrier state (heterozygous) of ABCA4 is associated with elevated RPE lipofuscin, the latter being measured as qAF and compared to age-matched normals (Aim 1.3). We will also investigate the cellular basis of retinal flecks (Aim 1.4). In Aim 2, we will determine whether the quantification of fundus SW-AF can aid in differentiating between pattern dystrophy (PD) associated with PRPH2/RDS mutations versus similar phenotypes observed with ABCA4 variants (Aim 2.1). We will also compare qAF values in individuals presenting with bull's eye macular dystrophy that is of ABCA4- versus non-ABCA4 origin (Aim 2.2). In patients with RP, we will measure qAF over the autofluorescent rings that are often a feature of this disorder. qAF Intensities inside, within and outside the rings will be compared to levels in our normal controls so as to further the use of fundus AF imaging to monitor disease progression in RP. In Aim 4, we will determine whether elevated fundus AF is a factor influencing the onset and progression of AMD when controlling for specific CFH and ARMS2 alleles. In summary, the studies proposed in this application will examine the contribution that the lipofuscin of retina makes to the onset and progression of several retinal diseases and will demonstrate that quantitation of fundus AF facilitates the diagnosis and monitoring of some retinal disorders."
"9450694","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of human brain is an immensely complex process, which is likely reflected in the complexity of the underlying transcriptional processes. Gene expression and its precise spatio-temporal regulation, particularly by histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, are crucial for normal human brain development and are thought to be altered in major developmental psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Moreover, changes in the developmental brain transcriptome are likely the major contributors to the evolution of the most distinctly human aspects of cognition, some of which are also affected in ASD and other psychiatric disorders However, our understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic processes involved in the development, evolution and dysfunction of the human brain is still elusive. Furthermore, most of our knowledge of transcriptional processes in the human brain is limited to the expression of protein coding genes. Given that the genomes of humans and other mammals have approximately the same protein-coding complexity, there is likely an additional reservoir of transcriptional complexity, especially in organs such as the brain, which has many structurally and functionally distinct regions in humans. This view is corroborated by recent findings of the ENCODE consortium, which found many cis-acting regulatory regions and that 60% of the human genome is transcribed, with a majority of the transcripts belonging to non-coding RNAs. Moreover, these and other studies have also uncovered pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variations in common human diseases and evolution. However, how these findings on non-coding elements in cell lines relate to the complexity of human brain development and dysfunction is still largely unknown. The objective of this proposal is to employ unbiased and genome-wide approaches to (1) discover and characterize developmentally regulated and human-specific non-coding functional genomic elements in multiple regions of the developing human and non-human primate brains, (2) and elucidate their role(s) in the molecular pathophysiology of ASD, by using genomic analyses of post-mortem ASD brains, by screening for de novo mutations in ASD quartets, and by modeling functional consequences of ASD-associated elements in the developing mouse brain."
"9286891","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent discovery of the molecular identity of pore-forming subunit of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (encoded by MCU gene) provides new possibilities for applying genetic approaches to study the mitochondrial Ca2+ (mtCa2+) influx mechanism. T hough the alteration of MCU function and mtCa2+ overload are frequently observed in non- cardiac human diseases, cardiomyocytes (ACMs)  and MCU function contribute to the pathology . Recently, I reported that a post-translational modification (PTM) of MCU (tyrosine it is still not clear how mtCa2+ in adult phosphorylation) is one of the critical regulatory mechanisms for upregulating MCU function in ACMs. PTM of MCU initiates overload, -dependent ROS overproduction and activation of apoptotic signaling under alpha1-adrenoceptor (alpha1-AR) stimulation, suggesting that PTM of MCU plays an important role in the development of cardiac dysfunction under Gq-protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) stimulation, which is one of the major causes of heart failure (HF) in vivo. In addition to the discovery of the PTM of MCU, I identified a form of transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation of MCU, namely the existence of alternative transcript variants (?short- form? MCU, termed MCU-S) in human and mouse in addition to the original MCU (?long form? MCU, renamed MCU-L). Importantly, MCU-S is highly expressed in non-excitable cells including adult cardiac fibroblast (ACFs). Our preliminary data show that introduction of MCU-S enhances the formation of Ca2+-permeable channels at the plasma membrane (PM). In addition, the PM-localized MCU channel (PM-MCU) formed by MCU-S activates glycolysis followed by acceleration of ATP production in the cytoplasm, possibly due to the increase in local [Ca2+]c beneath the PM. These preliminary findings indicate an important role of PM-MCU channels for energy metabolism especially in non-excitable cells (such as ACFs). We also determined that the manipulation of MCU-S/MCU-L ratio mtCa2+ mtCa2+ can secondarily modulate the driving force of MCU-channel trafficking to IMM, which eventually inhibits the mtCa2+ uptake, mtCa2+  -dependent ROS overproduction and activation of apoptotic signaling under alpha1-AR stimulation. Therefore, I hypothesize that the MCU gene encodes two isoforms that form both mitochondrial and non- mitochondrial MCU channels; novel transcript variant MCU-S forms a PM-MCU channels that regulate cell?s metabolism and inhibits the MCU-channel trafficking to IMM. To test the hypothesis, I will investigate whether MCU-S forms Ca2+-permeable MCU channels at PM and is involved in the mechanism for the activation of glycolysis to accelerate ATP production in the cytoplasm in primary ACMs and ACFs (Aim.1). I will next test whether switching the main variant from MCU-L to MCU-S protects the heart from mtCa2+-overload-mediated apoptotic death, energy depletion and cardiac dysfunction under GqPCR stimulation in vivo (Aim.2). The outcome of this project is expected to lead to a novel treatment strategy for cases of HF under GqPCR stimulation that involve mtCa2+ overload, oxidative stress, energy depletion and ACM death. Moreover, elucidation of the role of MCU variants will provide us novel insights into the molecular basis of mtCa2+ handling in the heart."

"9283534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This cooperative agreement (U01) application responds to NIH RFA-DA-15-015, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The University of Hawaii (UH) is #2 of 9 Research Sites of the Prospective Research in Studies of Maturation (PRISM) Consortium. The Consortium's objective is to establish a national, multisite, longitudinal cohort to prospectively examine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance use (SU) from early adolescence through the period of risk for SU and SU disorders. This 10-year longitudinal study of 11,000 children will measure brain development, SU, cognition, emotion, executive function, mental health, physical health, environment, and collect biospecimens for future genetic and epigenetic studies. The Consortium has an optimized research protocol and 4 specific aims: 1) Using advanced multi-modal neuroimaging to evaluate premorbid factors and the impact associated with diverse patterns of SU on structure and function of the developing brain. 2) Disentangle the predictors and consequences of diverse patterns of SU on physical health, psychosocial and cognitive development, academic achievement, motivation and emotional regulation. 3) Examine how the quantity and combination of substances used affect the expression of psychopathology and, conversely, how the emergence of psychopathology influences SU. 4) Assess how each substance used contributes to the use of other substances (gateway interactions). To further evaluate neurochemical and neurophysiological changes in these youth, we will additionally perform 1H MR spectroscopy (MRS), perfusion MRI (using arterial spin labeling or ASL), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), in approximately half of our volunteers, in collaboration with PRISM sites at Penn, UCLA, Utah, Hawaii, JHU, and Baylor. We are proposing a multi-PI leadership approach for our site. The PIs have complementary and inter- disciplinary expertise that encompasses all areas required to manage this comprehensive project. We have expertise in SUD research, clinical assessments, subject sampling and recruitment, and MR methodology. Additional unique qualifications of our site are: 1) we have access to a racially diverse population (including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders) that is disproportionately affected by SUD, 2) we have a strong track record of MR research in SUD and at risk populations, such as adolescents, and 3) we have participated in and led several multi-center research studies that involve complex multi-modal MR outcome measures and subject assessments. Therefore, we have all the necessary resources, experience and expertise to conduct the proposed research, and our effort will complement that of other outstanding research sites to collectively achieve the overall goals of the PRISM Consortium."

"9308279","Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bio?uids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speci?cally, in Aim 1, we develop ef?cient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial ef?ciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speci?c substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random in?ections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker pro?les that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and ef?cient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest bene?t from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity."
"9339502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR extends a Phase I proof of principle study originally submitted in response to RFA-AG-12-009 entitled T1 Translational Research on Aging from the NIA. In Phase I, LaCell has documented pre-clinical safety and efficacy of a novel adipose derived cell therapy for the treatment of pressure ulcers in young and old mice. The injection of murine ASC significantly accelerated and enhanced pressure ulcer repair in female mice of both age groups in a dose dependent manner as evidenced by the rate of wound closure, re-epithelialization, skin tissue architecture, inflammatory cell infiltratin and expression of molecular biomarkers. LaCell's studies pave the way for clinical translation and regulatory approval of ASC therapies. While it is well established that the prevention of pressure ulcers requires labor-intensive nursing care, patients in assisted living centers and nursing homes remain at high risk for developing pressure ulcers. Over 70% of pressure ulcers occur in Americans over the age of 70 and their hospital costs exceed $11 billion annually. Current treatment of pressure ulcers relies primarily on surgical debridement, hyperbaric oxygen, and negative pressure devices. The adipose derived- cell based therapies have the potential to substantially reduce the length of hospitalization and associated health care costs for pressure ulcer patients. LaCell has partnered with a Tissue Genesis, Inc., to use their established ICellator device to obtain clinical grade human SVF cells. This strategic partnership will accelerate the clinical translation of LaCell's cell therapeutic to the marketplace. Specific Aims (SA) will address pharmacotoxicology regulatory concerns in murine models and serve as a definitive protocol to the Food and Drug Administration for an Investigational Device Exemption in the case of SVF cells (SA1) and a Biologics License Application in the case of ASC (SA2). Each SA will evaluate the concentration dependency of human SVF cells and ASC in the treatment of a murine pressure ulcer therapy in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice of both sexes; both young and old immunocompetent mice will be evaluated. Injection of PBS alone or with human dermal fibroblasts will serve as negative controls while topical application of the FDA approved diabetic wound therapeutic, beclapermin (PDGF-BB) will serve as a positive control. Quantitative outcomes will include rate of wound closure, inflammatory cell infiltration, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and immunohistochemical detection of human cells in situ. Since pressure ulcer treatment accounts for 1- 4% of the total health care budget in developed nations, LaCell's developing technologies have considerable market potential."
"9379905","ABSTRACT Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a degenerative disorder of lower motor neurons and skeletal muscle caused by a CAG/glutamine tract expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The polyglutamine AR (polyQ AR) undergoes hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and unfolding, steps that are essential to toxicity and to the development of progressive muscle weakness in men. Although the disease causing mutation was identified over two and a half decades ago, only supportive therapies are currently available to SBMA patients. Model systems that have been used to study disease pathogenesis show hormone and glutamine length-dependent changes in an array of downstream pathways, supporting a role for divergent mechanisms in toxicity. These observations prompted us to focus instead on understanding the proximal mechanisms that regulate degradation of the mutant androgen receptor protein in hopes of harnessing these for the discovery of effective treatments. However, these clearance pathways are incompletely defined, and this lack of knowledge hinders the development of disease-modifying therapies. The objective of this application is to define the role of Hsp70 in the protein quality control decisions that govern degradation of the full-length polyQ AR. The scientific premise of this application is that the Hsp70, acting through the Hsp90/Hsp70-based machinery and the Hsp70/Hsp110 disaggregase machinery, plays a critical role in controlling polyQ AR degradation through the proteasome. This premise provides the foundation for our central hypothesis that Hsp70 targeted strategies will promote ubiquitination and clearance of the mutant protein. This hypothesis springs from our preliminary data showing that association with Hsp90 stabilizes the polyQ AR, while unfolding of the mutant protein leads to ubiquitination by Hsp70-dependent E3 ligases. Moreover, we will build upon our published studies demonstrating that allosteric regulation of Hsp70 to increase binding to misfolded proteins enhances clearance of the polyQ AR in cells and alleviates toxicity in a Drosophila model. The rationale of the proposed work is that establishing the mechanisms that regulate polyQ AR degradation will identify targets that can be exploited for the development of new therapies. Structural, biochemical, genetic and pharmacological approaches will be used to characterize the Hsp70-CHIP complex with the polyQ AR that regulates protein triage (Aim 1), establish the effects of genetic and small molecule allosteric regulators of Hsp70 in SBMA models (Aim 2), and determine effects of polyQ AR expression on ubiquitin-proteasome pathway function (Aim 3). These studies are expected to characterize the structure and function of the cellular machinery that regulates polyQ AR degradation and provide proof-of-concept data supporting a therapeutic approach centered on targeting Hsp70. As this chaperone also regulates quality control decisions governing the turnover of other mutant proteins that cause neurodegeneration, we expect that the approaches defined here will inform therapeutic strategies that will be applicable to other age-dependent neurological diseases."
"9293404","Project Summary/Abstract  Despite the high prevalence of pediatric pain, most commonly seen as musculoskeletal pain, little is known about how the immature CNS processes distinct types of noxious sensory information. In particular, the mechanisms regulating the ascending flow of nociceptive signals from the spinal cord to the brain during early life remain unclear. Since lamina I projection neurons represent an essential output of the spinal nociceptive circuit and are critical for the generation of chronic pain, a better understanding of the ionic conductances which control the intrinsic membrane excitability of these neurons during early life, and how the firing of this population shapes the maturation of synaptic inputs from different classes of sensory afferents, represents an important step towards addressing this issue. The long-term goal is to facilitate the design of evidence-based approaches to treat pediatric pain by advancing the knowledge of the developmental neurobiology of central nociceptive networks. The overall objective of this application is to identify the key factors regulating the firing of ascending projection neurons during early life and to determine the role of this activity in modulating primary afferent synapses onto these cells. The central hypothesis is that classic inward-rectifying K+ (Kir2) and NALCN Na+ leak channels jointly regulate action potential discharge in neonatal projection neurons and thereby influence the postnatal development of functionally distinct synaptic inputs from cutaneous and muscle sensory afferents. The rationale of the proposed research is that understanding the intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that dictate the excitability of immature projection neurons (PNs) is the first step towards controlling the signaling ?gain? of developing spinal nociceptive circuits, which would facilitate the design of novel strategies to alleviate pediatric pain. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested and the overall objective of this application achieved by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Identify the ion channels shaping the intrinsic membrane excitability of ascending spinal PNs during early life; (2) Elucidate the properties of cutaneous and muscle afferent synapses onto developing PNs; and (3) Determine the extent to which the intrinsic membrane excitability of developing PNs influences the maturation of primary afferent synaptic inputs. These aims will be accomplished by using a multidisciplinary experimental approach that includes in vitro electrophysiological, genetic and immunohistochemical techniques. The outcome of these investigations will be the first identification of which voltage-independent (i.e. ?leak?) ion channels shape the intrinsic membrane excitability of neonatal spinal projection neurons, as well as the establishment of a functional relationship between the firing of these cells and the maturation of synaptic inputs from skin and muscle afferents. As a result, the proposed research is significant because it will reveal mechanisms that control ascending nociceptive transmission from the spinal cord to the developing brain, and will also yield new insight into why muscle afferents are more capable of evoking hyperexcitability within central pain circuits."
"9409758","Autoimmune disease (AD) affects up to 50 million Americans, which costs approximately $100 billion on health care annually and accounts for one of the leading causes of death in women. T cells and cytokine function play an important role in autoimmune diseases, such as Type-1 Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The most successful auto-immune therapies already target the factors secreting from or binding to T cells, e.g., TNF-?, IL-6, IL-1, and IL-15. Diagnosis of autoimmune diseases is typically made post presentation of symptoms; enabling earlier diagnosis through detecting the T cells that drive disease progression (pathogenic T cells) could shift paradigms towards earlier and more successful treatment. IsoPlexis is developing a system to target and measure single T cells integral to this early diagnosis. In this Phase I project, we will use SLE as a preliminary disease with which to evaluate the strength of our technology. SLE is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoreactive antibodies, yet a subset of T cells called follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, when dysregulated or pathogenic, promote the induction of B cell autoantibody production. Identifying these rare, disease-causing T cells, also present in circulation, has been proposed as a critical early diagnostic and a pressing need in the clinic. However, there are major challenges that need to be addressed: (1) pathogenic, circulating Tfh cells are present at low frequency in blood, (2) these cells are highly heterogeneous with diverse combinations of effector/cytokine functions, requiring single-cell analysis, and (3) the range of cytokine functional groups that matters numbers ~15+. The IsoPlexis technology addresses these unmet challenges by (1) simultaneously assaying ~1500 cells, (2) analyzing cell functionality at the single-cell level, and (3) co-detecting ~30 effector proteins per cell. This SBIR application aims to develop a suitable solution, and an alpha test prototype device, by incorporating an on-chip, upstream, cell sorting method for capturing low quantities of circulating Tfh cells, followed by a validated, single-cell, cytokine function profiling platform for identifying pathogenic T cells reproducibly. This NIH Phase I SBIR project will focus on developing this assay and device for lupus and autoimmune research. We propose the following specific aims: (1) develop an NACS-based cell capture device for profiling circulating Tfh cells with SCBC technology to eliminate flow sorting, and establish a single-cell, 30-plex, cytokine and chemokine panel specific to profiling Tfh cells; and (2) develop the first components of an integrated automation workflow system for capturing and analyzing single Tfh cells with required reproducibility. With a validated test system, we would, in Phase II, apply this test to a large cohort clinical study and fully validate this for further commercialization in a critical area for SLE patients and physicians. If successful, this will open new opportunities for autoimmune disease diagnosis and monitoring of other T cell cytokine mediated diseases."
"9282727","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of Michigan and University of Florida is in response to RFA-DA-15-015, as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (9/13) to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 975 9-10 year olds with enrichment for high-risk will be recruited as part of this application, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 total sites across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, DNA, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns, behavioral, psychological and social functioning. These comprehensive assessments will repeat at 2-year follow-up intervals, with intermediate assessments of functioning and substance use at 6-month intervals. These Consortium-collected data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. This Research Project focuses on risk and protective factors influencing trajectories of substance use and associated behaviors. Our emphasis is on: externalizing and internalizing phenotypes, both as core nonspecific risk factors for problem substance use and as important co-occurring outcomes of substance use; contextual factors (including sociodemographic, family and social influences) as risk and protective influences on the co-development of brain, substance use and psychopathology; and sex as a moderator of these relationships. We use novel methods for linking these factors to brain maturation. We address three aims: 1) At age 9-10, identify the neurofunctional and contextual factors influencing individual differences in externalizing and internalizing phenotypes prior to substance use; 2) Identify baseline neurofunctional predictors and contextual moderators over time of early (before age 14) substance use initiation; and 3) Characterize the developmental relationship between brain maturation, externalizing/ internalizing symptomatology, context, and substance use. This work will uncover neural correlates of distinct etiological pathways underlying adolescent substance use and identify temporal relationships between brain maturation, substance use and psychopathology."
"9291489","Muscular dystrophies are neuromuscular disorders that cause progressive peripheral skeletal myopathy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a recessive X-linked neuromuscular disorder resulting from mutation in the dystrophin gene. The subsequent loss of dystrophin expression in DMD patients leads to a cycle of muscle degeneration and regeneration, which ultimately leads to the development of progressive skeletal muscle wasting and atrophy and premature death. Unfortunately to date, there is no definitive therapy to reverse or cure DMD. Thus, the associated morbidity and mortality in DMD patients remain very high. Therefore, the use of innovative technologies are critically required if a cure for this devastating genetic disorder is to be discovered. Although synthetic oligonucleotide or drug based exon skipping, cell-based transplantation or gene therapy have all failed to produce meaningful and durable improvements in the strength of dystrophic muscle, a transformative new technology called CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has recently emerged. Using this approach, the Olson Laboratory definitively rescued dystrophin function by correcting the point mutation in the classical mdx mouse, published in a landmark Science paper [Long et al Science 2014 345 (6201): 1184-1188]. Even more importantly, they have demonstrated proof-of-concept for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated permanent exon skipping in mdx-?E23 mice, a novel mouse line serendipitously produced by genome editing in mdx embryos. Translating this new technology, called myoediting, to young men with DMD is the fundamental goal of the UT Southwestern Wellstone MDCRC. Thus, Center?s central hypothesis is that genomic editing can genetically correct mutations within the human dystrophin gene. Therefore, in Project 2 we will focus on identifying patients with potential dystrophin mutations that can be corrected in vitro, while comprehensively assessing the molecular/clinical phenotypes of these patients. Project 2 will pursue the following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Correlate molecular and clinical phenotypes of adult patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Specific Aim 2: Development of a DMD-in-a-dish model for evaluating the efficacy of myoediting and generating a Duchenne muscular dystrophy myoediting map. Specific Aim 3: Extend myoediting studies to carrier females with DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. Synergizing with Project 1 and the shared Myoediting Core, successful completion of these specific aims will produce a new therapy, and possibly even a cure, for DMD, that targets and molecularly rectifies the culprit genetic lesion in iPSCs and ultimately in the musculature of dystrophic patients. Thus, the proposed NIH U54 Grant Application is relevant to and in keeping with the mission of the NIH."

"9372209","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression is a complex, severe debilitating mental disorder that affects about 10% of Americans. While it is well established that environmental factors, such as stress, plays an etiology role, the brain mechanisms, particularly the role of specific neural circuits mediating the pathogenesis of depression, remain to be elucidated. Chronic social defeat stress (cSDS) in mice is a highly relevant, validated model to study brain mechanisms of depression. This behavior paradigm has been shown to induce morphological and functional changes in multiple brain regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is interconnected with other limbic brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and amygdala. It is not clear whether a particular neuronal type in the PFC, defined by its synaptic connectivity, is more relevant to the pathogenesis of depression. Using a recently developed neuronal activity reporter mouse line, termed fosTRAP, the applicant's lab has determined that acute and chronic social defeat stress activate distinct populations of projection neurons in the PFC. This raises the question of whether specific circuit connectivity is pertinent to depression and if future therapeutic strategies could be devised, using a `precision medicine in psychiatry' approach, to target the relevant circuits to combat the core symptoms of depression while alleviating off target effects. In this R21 proposal, the expertise of two junior faculty laboratories (Qiu, neurophysiology and functional circuit mapping; Ferguson, mouse depression behavior and optogenetics), will be merged to test the hypothesis that chronic social defeat-induced, depression-related behaviors are encoded within a specific neural circuit in the PFC. These PIs will employ the fosTRAP:AI14 reporter mouse combined with tamoxifen to gain genetic access to the prefrontal neurons that are activated by cSDS. They will further explore whether disrupted synaptic homeostasis selectively occurs in the proportion of L5 neurons that are activated by the chronic social defeat stress. This will be investigated using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and laser scanning photostimulation for functional circuit mapping studies in NAc-projecting L5 prefrontal neurons in fosTRP:AI14 reporter mice following cSDS (Aim 1). They will also test whether disrupted synaptic homeostasis occurs selectively in the susceptible mice populations. In Aim 2, they will use targeted optogenetic manipulation of neural activity in the L5 PFC projection neurons that are selectively activated by cSDS and also selectively express opsins. These investigators will test the novel hypothesis that optogenetic inhibition of this specific neuron ensemble during the acquisition of depressive-like behavior confers resistance, while repeated activation of these neurons leads to susceptibility. This study could reveal a paradigm-shifting practice in circuit-based therapeutics aimed at restoring prefrontal synaptic homeostasis and could establish a specific corticolimbic circuit as a lead target for preventing the development of depression, which is otherwise not possible by previous studies examining an indiscriminate population of PFC neurons."
"9381325","Structure and Mechanism of a Polymodal TRP Ion Channel Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are crucial for sensory transduction and cellular signaling, and TRP channel dysfunction is associated with a vast array of hereditary and acquired diseases including cancer, chronic pain, hypertension, and neurological disorders. Because of their central roles in physiology and pathophysiology, TRP channels have been intensively studied and are among the most aggressively pursued drug targets. However, advances in our understanding of TRP channel function and therapeutic interventions have been hindered by a lack of three-dimensional high-resolution structural information for most TRP channels. Our long-term goal is to develop structural and biochemical approaches to elucidate molecular mechanisms of TRP channels at the atomic level. By developing new methods to systematically evaluate heterologous expression, purification, and optimization of TRP channel homologs, we have recently crystallized a nearly full-length functional channel and obtained preliminary X-ray diffraction to 4.8 Å resolution. With this technical breakthrough and further optimization, we are now able to combine X-ray crystallography, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), patch-clamp electrophysiology, and site-directed mutagenesis to address fundamental molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we aim to determine high-resolution X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the channel bound with agonists or antagonists, and in complex with membrane lipids that regulate channel activity, and to dissect the underlying mechanisms of disease-associated mutations. Our proposed work will provide X-ray and cryo-EM structures of a TRP channel in multiple functional states and uncover structural and molecular mechanisms. In doing so, we will not only bring fundamental insights into TRP channel function, but also establish a foundation for rational design of new therapeutics for the treatment of many channel-associated diseases."
"9382331","Aire regulates central T cell tolerance by controlling thymic medullary epithelial cell (MEC) expression of a battery of transcripts encoding peripheral-tissue antigens. From early on, Aire was recognized to be a transcriptional regulator, but it soon became apparent that it does not operate like a conventional transcription factor, i.e. binding to promoters and inducing initiation of transcription. Studies completed during the last funding-cycle demonstrated that Aire-induced genes occur as intra- or inter-chromosomal clusters within individual cells, that Aire participates in multiple multi-protein complexes, and that it preferentially localizes to and activates so-called ?super-enhancers.? Super-enhancers (a.k.a ?stretch? or ?serial? enhancers) are extended regions of chromatin that are over-loaded with general and cell-type-specific transcription factors, and are thought to serve as depots for coordinate and efficient delivery of these factors to targeted promoters via chromatin looping. In addition, preliminary data documented herein indicate that Aire associates, directly or indirectly, with cohesin, one of the major orchestrators of long-range chromatin interactions (in collaboration with CTCF and/or mediator). Thus, the overall goal of this proposed project is to determine how Aire integrates into the three-dimensional organization of chromatin. This goal will be addressed via three Specific Aims: ? To determine whether Aire associates with proteins known to orchestrate 3D chromatin interactions: CTCF, cohesin, NIPBL and mediator. Experiments under this Aim will employ primarily biochemical approaches to determine whether Aire associates with the three major 3D-chromatin-organizing elements (and a cohesin-loader, NIPBL). ? To integrate Aire?s distribution along MEC chromatin with those of CTCF, cohesin and mediator; to determine how Aire impacts CTCF/cohesin/mediator placement and, vice versa, how cohesin influences Aire?s placement. This series of experiments will exploit recent improvements in ChIP-seq (and other whole-genome) technologies to map the binding sites of the three chromatin organizers in relation to Aire binding and other landmarks ? in wild-type, Aire-knockout and inducible Smc1-knockdown mice ? To define the relationship between Aire and three-dimensional chromatin organization. This set of experiments will use HiC technology to generate whole-genome interaction maps for MEC chromatin from Aire+/+ and Aire-/- mice.  Successful completion of these studies will bring our understanding of Aire control of T cell tolerance to a new level of molecular understanding, and is likely to resolve several of the outstanding conundrums related to Aire function.

"9298676","Cardiac fibrosis is an integral feature of structural remodeling that occurs in response to a variety of cardiopulmonary diseases and can be a consequence of endothelial injury. It can impair ventricular function, increase the risk for arrhythmias and contribute to heart failure development. Cardiac fibroblasts are important therapeutic targets because they become activated in response to stress and play a key role in fibrosis development. Efforts to develop therapies that specifically target fibroblasts are still at an early stage. Compared to traditional drug targets, microRNAs (miRNAs) offer novel mechanistic possibilities. So far, little is known about their role in cardiac fibroblasts. I have determined the miRNA expression pattern in adult rat ventricular fibroblasts and their dynamic regulation during fibroblast activation in vitro. MiRNA-1, a muscle-enriched miRNA that has so far been extensively studied in myocytes, is shown to be expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and markedly down-regulated upon activation. My preliminary data also show miRNA-ldependent negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation, transformation and protein expression of several predicted miRNA-1 targets that are involved in cell cycle regulation and fibrosis development. The long-term goal of my research is to gain a better understanding of the functional role and mechanisms of action of miRNAs in cardiac fibroblasts under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The Specific Aims are: i) To identify miRNAs that are changed in their expression upon fibroblast activation in vitro and in vivo and to select candidate miRNAs for further investigation based on their expression profile and target predictions; 2) To delineate functional effects and mechanisms of action of miRNA-1 and other miRNAs in adult cardiac fibroblasts using gain- and loss-of-function approaches; 3) To determine the effects of fibroblast-restricted miRNA manipulation on prevention and/or reversal of cardiac fibrosis development in vivo. This project will provide novel and comprehensive insights into miRNAs in cardiac fibroblasts. The findings will provide a platform for future grant applications that will aim to fully delineate the effects of fibroblast-restricted miRNA manipulation in vivo, which may provide new therapeutic strategies."
"9345558","Neuroscience and mental health research increasingly rely on zebrafish, an animal model that ideally combines some of the best attributes of vertebrates and invertebrates. The zebrafish nervous system can be viewed as a much simplified blueprint of our human brain and its genome shares at least 80% of orthologous genes with ours. Its wide behavioral repertoire has allowed unprecedented neuroscience experiments and high throughput chemical compound screens which have yielded unique insights to the molecular and neuronal workings of our central nervous system and the development of new therapeutic strategies for mental illness. However, zebrafish?s small size and transparency have been a challenge for video­based behavior analysis systems, resulting in paucity and rigidity of commercially available tools.  Supporting only basic measures, these tools typically require segregating individual larva in restrictive cells of 96­well plates, limiting their expressible behavior repertoire.   We have designed a novel imaging technology and developed a groundbreaking highly parallel, high throughput behavior observation system t hat eliminates the need to segregate fish and provides measures of much higher statistical power than competitive systems.  Called Zebratrack, this easy­to­use system records and analyzes groups of zebrafish in Petri dish­like containers in separate tank­unit enclosures with dedicated cameras. The system efficiently and precisely extracts individual and population level behavior measures at high time resolution from hours to weeks long recordings, generates very low image data volumes, and stores the data in a web­accessible repository. System operation, browsing of data and past recordings, and on­demand data analysis are all performed via a web browser. We plan to productize this system as a platform available in various configurations assembled from modular tank­units (Aim 1.1) and sharing a common software architecture (Aim 1.2) and data repository (Aim 2).  We plan to commercialize the Zebratrack platform along an Instrument As A Service model and make the data repository available for search and data storage to our subscribers. With configurations starting at $5k, the technology will be accessible to any laboratory.  Zebratrack will bring analytical tools of unparalleled statistical power to behavioral sciences and mental health research and expands the usability of zebrafish in experiments and longitudinal studies never before conceivable. Not only will neuroscientists be able to detect and measure subtle or transient phenotypic variations to investigate the complex gene interactions present in many psychiatric disorders, but they also will be able to leverage, through the repository, the cumulated values of the past experiments of the entire user community.    Unbridling zebrafish behavioral power for genetic and compound screens and introducing unprecedented data sharing capabilities, Zebratrack will enable major strides in neuroscience and mental health research."
"9330648","Summary G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream signaling pathways are important for the regulation of many essential cellular processes and are targets of some of the most commonly prescribed drugs, such as those used to treat pain, heart failure, and high blood pressure (e.g. morphine, ? blockers, and angiotensin inhibitors, respectively). GPCR kinases (GRKs) and arrestins work together to regulate GPCR signaling by reducing the ability of receptors to couple with G proteins and by targeting active GPCRs for endocytosis. Although these desensitization mechanisms are important for returning cells to their physiological resting states, GRKs and arrestins are also thought to play prominent roles in addiction and cardiovascular disease, at least in part by instigating other, non-canonical signaling cascades. This proposal seeks funding for a forum that would bring together world-leading researchers who study different aspects of GRK and arrestin biology and their roles in disease called G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases and Arrestins: From Structure to Disease. Two major highlights of the meeting will be keynote lectures by 2012 Nobel laureates who are experts in GPCR, GRK, and arrestin structure, function, and cell biology. The meeting is expected to not only stimulate the generation of new hypotheses, collaborations, and methodologies that can be used to study and combat drug abuse and cardiovascular disease, but also provide career advancement and speaking opportunities for junior investigators and underrepresented groups of scientists."
"9398316","Depression is a debilitating disease that can dramatically affect a person's health and life. People suffering from depression experience extended periods of sadness, despair, reduced motivation and hopelessness, and they are often unable to enjoy activities once found pleasurable. At present, effective treatments for depression and other dysfunctional emotional states remain elusive. Traditional treatment perspectives have conceptualized depression as a dysfunction of specific monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Recently, more nuanced conceptual frameworks have arisen as a result of efforts to correlate disease symptoms with dysfunction of specific brain networks mediating mood and reward responses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a part of the reward circuit that provides ?negative value? to midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), has emerged as a key brain region for the pathophysiology of depression. LHb neurons projecting to the VTA are hyperactive in an animal model of depression, and reducing synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through deep brain stimulation can ameliorate depression-related behaviors. However, the identities of afferent pathways that drive hyperactivity of these neurons are largely unknown. Here, we propose an innovative experimental strategy that employs a combination of state-of-the-art methods, including novel molecular and genetic tools, electrophysiology, optogenetics and behavioral paradigms to investigate how chronic stress, an important cause for depression in humans, alters synaptic transmission in specific LHb afferent pathways. Our goals are to (1) identify precisely which LHb pathways are altered following chronic stress exposure, (2) describe the underlying synaptic mechanisms and (3) develop circuit-specific strategies to reverse chronic stress-induced behavioral changes. Linking chronic stress-induced synaptic adaptations to relevant LHb pathways will provide important insights into how the brain processes chronic stress in order to generate maladaptive behavioral responses, which may inspire novel treatment strategies that involve reprogramming of specific brain circuits for treating depression."
"9471889","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and ataxia strip away the ability to act on our environment. Each disease causes unwanted movements, makes desired movements more difficult to perform, and also affects how we think and process our emotions. To be effective, research into movement disorders must cross disciplines, and enhance the translation of basic science discoveries to help humans move more effectively. This Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration Training (MDNR) program confronts this problem head on by bringing together an outstanding group of mentors with a rich infrastructure and resources to train predoctoral Trainees focused on movement disorders. This program combines a critical mass of well-trained scientists prepared to conduct research focused on the ABC'S of translational research: an etiology, biomarkers/end phenotypes, and causative and symptom based therapies. To do so, the program will encompass three areas with a central theme of movement disorders: a) molecular biology and animal models; b) translational neuroscience and physiology, and c) human motor and cognitive neuroscience. Specific approaches within these themes can range from genetics to molecular to neuroimaging to neurorestoration to behavioral, but the central focus is movement disorders. Trainees are selected from a pool of outstanding students with diverse backgrounds and are admitted by one of five graduate programs. A key feature is that Trainees experience laboratories that cross areas, and dissertation committee members must come from each of the three scientific areas. The MDNR program capitalizes on existing strengths and strategic investments at the University of Florida (UF) including well-established investigators in ataxia, Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism, and dystonia, outstanding animal research facilities for basic science, world class animal and human imaging facilities, three privately endowed and foundation supported Centers of Excellence for Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and ataxia, and the UF Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration. This patient-centered clinical research facility maintains the largest, comprehensive clinical research database in the world. Upon entering the program, each trainee prepares an individualized career development plan that consists of a structured didactic program, specialized courses, seminars, and laboratory research. The mentor to mentor interaction that crosses levels of analysis sets up a unique learning environment that will prepare Trainees for a strong future as biomedical scientists that can make a difference in movement disorders. This training program in Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration provides an interdisciplinary training environment that is fundamental to the advancement of research in the etiology and treatment of movement disorders."
"9397973","PrEP provides a strong preventative benefit to youth at-risk for HIV infection and there is overwhelming evidence supporting its efficacy. While oral PrEP adherence is highly correlated with its efficacy in clinical trials, adherence rates are variable. In real-world practice settings, PrEP adherence may even be lower, particularly among youth. As such, interventions are needed to improve and sustain adherence to oral PrEP, thereby maximizing its preventative benefits in at-risk populations. P3 (Prepared, Protected, emPowered): Promoting PrEP adherence through a social networking, gamification, and adherence support app is an interactive smartphone app for HIV-uninfected YMSM that utilizes social networking and game-based mechanics as well as a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes ?best practices? in app development to improve PrEP adherence, retention in PrEP clinical care, and PrEP persistence among young MSM ages 16-24. Despite the benefits of app-based interventions, maintaining engagement over time can be particularly challenging. Some have suggested that lack of rapport building contributes to lower retention rates in technology-based interventions. Further, the available literature suggests that some tools, including technology based tools, may be more beneficial to patient adherence when combined with education or counseling. In this 4-year study, 240 YMSM between the ages of 16-24 initiating PrEP will be randomized to P3, P3+ (app intervention plus adherence counseling delivered by a counselor through the app) or standard of care for routine PrEP support as recommended in the CDC guidelines. The primary outcome measure is PrEP adherence measured by TFV-DP levels. The randomized controlled trial to test the intervention will be conducted at six iTech SRV cities (Houston, Philadelphia, Bronx, Chicago, Tampa and New Orleans). Built using the most advanced applications on a successful, evidence-based platform designed and tested by our collaborating technology partner, Ayogo, P3 is flexible and responsive to changes in technology and changes in PrEP practice standards and guidelines recommendations. Empower is Ayogo's health gamification platform for patient engagement that embeds social networking and fundamental game mechanics, such as challenges, points, and social connectivity. Empower blends social features, a condition-specific Knowledge Center, game elements, loss aversion mechanics, biometric device integration, and a daily-habit building interface. The Empower platform also includes a Provide/Counselor Interface that facilitates, secure, two-way communication between a provider/counselor and participant that will be used for, P3+. Developed, piloted and iterated upon over several years, customizations of Empower have now been deployed commercially and have been demonstrated to significantly improve self-efficacy and proven health outcomes. This application supports the overall objectives of the iTech and benefits from the expertise and support provided by Management, Analytic and Technology Cores to achieve our study aims."
"9449986","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of research in the Miller lab is to identify and characterize unique enzyme regulatory mechanisms. In this proposal, we investigate two mechanisms that regulate the activity of human glucokinase (GK), a protein that plays a key role in glucose homeostatic maintenance. Dysfunction in GK regulation causes maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2 and hyperlipidemia. The objective of Aim 1 is to elucidate the molecular origins of kinetic cooperativity in monomeric GK. GK cooperativity is fundamentally different from textbook models; it requires neither multiple ligand binding sites nor protein oligomerization. Instead, GK cooperativity results from hysteresis - it displays a time-dependent change in activity in response to changing glucose concentration that is driven by slow conformational changes. In preliminary studies, we have developed a working model for the hysteretic transitions that facilitate GK cooperativity. In our model, unliganded GK undergoes millisecond timescale conformational exchange between a crystallographically observed ground state (E) and an invisible excited state (E*). We have shown that the rate constant for conformational exchange (kex) is comparable in magnitude to the rate constant for turnover (kcat). The equivalency in these rate constants means that glucose binding does not reach equilibrium during the catalytic cycle, which is required for hysteresis to produce monomeric cooperativity. In Aim 1, we will develop a comprehensive and complete understanding of GK cooperativity by providing a structural description of the E* state and by establishing the mechanism(s) by which cooperativity is abolished in disease variants. The objective of Aim 2 is to use a combination of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, stopped-flow spectrometry, crystallography and computational simulations to elucidate the mechanistic basis for GKRP-mediated regulation of GK. GKRP acts as a competitive inhibitor of glucose binding to GK. GKRP dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular disease and it has recently emerged as a viable diabetes therapeutic target. In Aim 2, we seek to understand how the association of different phosphorylated sugars with GKRP modulates affinity toward GK. We will also elucidate the kinetic mechanism of action of newly described drugs that disrupt the GK-GKRP complex. This proposal is significant to human disease because understanding the structural and dynamic basis of GK cooperativity and GKRP-mediated regulation is essential for the development of therapeutic agents that target both proteins. This work is significant to fundamental biochemistry because the structural and dynamic origins of hysteresis are unknown, despite the fact that regulation by hysteretic behavior is well established in enzymology. This proposal is innovative because it involves a unique combination of biophysical methods cutting-edge labeling methods to elucidate the mechanistic origins of kinetic cooperativity in a monomeric, single-site enzyme and to establish the mechanism of GK regulation by a protein-protein interaction."
"9273516","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing prevalence of obesity and associated diseases, such as type II diabetes is a major health concern, particularly among children. Recent evidence has shown that obesity and related diseases might be a consequence of alterations in the developmental processes of a variety of systems involved in energy balance regulation, including the hypothalamic melanocortin system. This neural system, which includes neurons that produce pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, is a major negative regulator of energy balance. POMC neurons begin to acquire their unique properties during embryonic life. Notably, cell lineage experiments have shown that a subpopulation of embryonic Pomc-expressing precursors subsequently adopts a NPY phenotype (an orexigenic peptide also expressed in ARH neurons) in adult mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and cell fate specification of POMC neurons during development remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as critical regulators of brain development. These non-coding small endogenous RNA molecules have important functions in gene regulation and abnormal miRNA maturation impairs neuronal differentiation, induces cell death, and disrupts axon growth. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that miRNAs are required for the normal development of POMC neurons and that the loss of specific miRNAs during critical fetal periods results in the abnormal maturation of POMC neurons and long-term metabolic dysregulation. Neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, physiological, and molecular approaches will be used to test this hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. We will evaluate the importance of miRNA maturation in cell fate decision in an immature population of POMC neurons. To this aim, we will generate mouse models in which Dicer (an essential enzyme for miRNA maturation) is deleted in POMC neurons. We hypothesize is that Pomc-expressing progenitors might acquire a non-POMC phenotype (for example a NPY phenotype) in the absence of sufficient miRNA maturation. We will also examine the impact of Dicer deletion on the connectivity of POMC and Pomc ? NPY neurons. Specific Aim 2. We will use an in vivo gene silencing approach to characterize the role of miR-103 and miR-107, specifically, in the timely maturation of POMC neurons during embryogenesis. We will also explore the importance of embryonic miR-103 and miR-107 expression in POMC neurons on POMC neuronal activity and connectivity and on lifelong energy balance regulation and glucose homeostasis. Specific Aim 3. Moreover, we will examine the role of miR103/107 in the metabolic and neuroanatomical defects observed in offspring of obese dams. Together, this work will define a critical role for specific miRNAs in the development of neural systems that are involved in lifelong energy balance regulation. These studies might also provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which alterations of the prenatal nutritional environment lead to obesity and diabetes in the offspring, thereby generating new therapeutic opportunities."
"9298672","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The Cell Isolation/Organ Function Core provides a unique skill set and expertise to Rl vascular biologists by providing quality assurance in isolation, characterization, and propagation of vascular derived cells and fibroblasts and cardiopulmonary organ function analyses. The centralization of the cell isolation and organ function measurements will help investigators minimize the variability in sample preparation thus providing uniformity in data acquisition throughout all COBRE Projects and for other Rl vascular biologists. Isolation, characterization, and propagation of the cells is time-consuming and costly; thus the services provided by this Core permit the Project and Pilot Investigators to focus their efforts on aspects of their research endeavors related to experimental design, execution and interpretation. Additionally, the Core provides the expertise for assessing cardiac function, pressure-volume system for simultaneous high-fidelity intracardiac pressure-volume analysis, as well as lung function. As our Project and Pilot Investigators and/or other Rl vascular biologists experiments develop, so will their cell isolation needs; thus the Core will expand to meet these needs by providing expertise in the isolation of primary cultures of cardiac or pulmonary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, as well as vascular smooth muscle cells. Most of the needed equipment, facilities, and personnel are already in place at the Vascuiar Research Laboratory at the Providence VAIVIC, thus the Core will continue to serve as a resource for investigators in Rl after the COBRE funding is complete.  The overall goal of the Core is to facilitate the scientific objectives of the Project and Pilot Investigators by providing essential services in: i) Isolation of pulmonary and cardiac endothelial cell and ventricular fibroblast cells; characterization, propagation, and biochemical analysis; ii) Endothelial progenitor cell and microparticle isolation from patient blood; iii) Measurement of heart and lung function. Secondary goals of this Core are to enhance reproducibility of data and experimental endpoints, and increasing the efficiency and productivity of each project."
"9308715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are one of the most commonly occurring neuro- developmental disorders, affecting 1 in 68 children, frequently resulting in impairments in the functional skills necessary for independent living, and presenting a significant impact on families and society. Up to 90% of individuals with ASD present with difficulties processing and integrating sensory information and these have been shown to be a significant factor impacting functional skills. Intervention for these sensory issues is one of the most highly requested treatments. We have showed that children with ASD and sensory issues who were randomized to a 30-session Sensory Integration Treatment (SIT) made significant gains in functional skills, showed reduced sensory-related maladaptive behaviors, and improved their participation in daily activities compared to controls. Now that we have evidence in support of SIT for improvement of functional skills in this group of children with sensory issues, we seek to compare the effectiveness of SIT to focused behavioral strategies on improvement of functional skills for children with ASD and sensory issues ages 6-8.5 years of age. Importantly, we will interrogate the mechanisms of action and the phenotypic characteristics that predict response to intervention. After a comprehensive phenotypic assessment, eligible participants will be randomized to 30 one-hour sessions of SIT, ABA or No Treatment (NT). Outcome assessment, which includes behavioral and electrophysiological measures, will occur at baseline, post treatment and at 12 weeks following treatment to assess sustainability. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) compare 30 session SIT to the same dosage of ABA to evaluate immediate and sustained changes in functional skills and maladaptive behaviors; 2) to assess whether the treatment regimen has differential effects on sensory processing and multisensory integration functions; and 3) to determine whether autism severity, cognitive level or severity of sensory symptoms moderate intervention outcomes. This study addresses multiple priorities of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Council's Strategic Plan for research including the need for comparative effectiveness RCTs of interventions for ASD, studies to uncover the biological mechanisms of ASD symptoms to aid in the development of customized, targeted interventions, identification of mediators or moderators of interventions, and treatment of core deficits. Findings will inform parents and providers about interventions that may best help improve functional skills based on phenotypic characteristics and symptoms. A team of inter-disciplinary researchers and clinicians with complementary expertise is utilized to address this unmet need."
"9266275","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Business establishments have the potential to shape individual behaviors including dietary intake, physical activity patterns, and management of chronic medical conditions, all with relevance to risk of myocardial infarction and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Policy strategies targeting local businesses may play an important role in CVD prevention, extending years of healthy life, and facilitating independent living. We propose to bring together commercially available big data and detailed population-based cohort data to examine the role of local business environments in CVD and racial disparities in CVD as they emerged across decades. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as a direction for future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to CVD has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Meanwhile, older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. However, careful attention is needed to acute health changes that precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cardiovascular health and health disparities. We will use a census of national businesses, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). NETS data for all 52.4 million US business establishments includes annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2012, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS as well as longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two ongoing cohort studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. CHS is a well-characterized population- based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites, with         oversampling of African Americans, have been followed prospectively for the remainder of their lives, allowing in-depth characterization of neighborhood environments experienced by older adults in their final decades. REGARDS is also a prospective population-based cohort study with oversampling of African Americans, allowing for examination of racial disparities. However, the 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline, 55% female, 42% African American) were enrolled more recently (2003-2007) and from a broader geographic region (48 contiguous US states, oversampling Stroke Belt residents). For these two cohorts with complementary strengths, cardiovascular events have been ascertained and longitudinal address data collected. This project brings together unparalleled data resources, builds on a track record of policy-relevant work with large geographic data resources, and leverages comprehensive cardiovascular cohort data."
"9375877","Abstract Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have so far identified more than 30 common low penetrance variants for ovarian cancer; but it is estimated that thousands more risk variants await discovery. In the post-GWAS era a complex set of challenges for the identification, functional characterization and utility of susceptibility alleles have emerged including: (i) Identifying the causal genetic variants and regulatory targets driving cancer development at risk loci; (ii) Identifying the susceptibility genes associated with risk variants; (iii) Establishing if there are common biological networks that explain the functional mechanisms underlying multiple risk loci. Clinically, identifying the genetic risk component of ovarian cancer will likely lead to improved disease prevention through population screening and disease prevention strategies; and understanding the function of risk loci may lead to the discovery of clinical biomarkers and novel targeted therapies, analogous to the paradigm of PARP therapy for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The current proposal is designed to address many of these challenges for ovarian cancer in the post- GWAS era with respect to genetic risk variants that target splicing mechanisms of target susceptibility genes. Specifically we aim to: (1) Integrate the largest GWAS datasets for ovarian cancer with RNA sequencing data for hundreds of ovarian normal and cancer tissues to identify genetic risk variants associated specifically with differential splicing; (2) Establish the functional mechanisms associated splice associated risk variants for ovarian cancer risk loci using functional assays to analyse the effects of splicing on their target genes on tumor development in novel experimental models of ovarian cancer precursor tissues. These studies will establish a statistical and functional pipeline to evaluate the contribution of risk associated splice variants in other complex traits and disorders"
"9353712","PROJECT SUMMARY Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), a unique synaptic site where spinal motor neurons (MNs) meet myofibers to form a functional motor unit (MU), consist of three major components, MN?s pre-synapse, myofiber?s post- synapse, and terminal Schwann cells (SCs). Increasing attention has recently been paid to the etiology of ?NMJ aging? in relationship to sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging. Here, we propose two complementary aims focusing on unraveling NMJ aging mechanisms in relation to sarcopenia: <SA-1> Identifying the earliest sarcopenia-associated molecular changes and potential biomarkers at aging NMJs in vivo - We will perform, for the first time, RNAseq of micro-dissected NMJs, isolated at different time points from aging mice, using a laser-capture micro-dissection (LCM) technique. A series of established bioinformatics analyses will be then run to extract candidate molecules followed by identification of their cellular origins. To obtain high-quality RNA in the LCM, we will apply our original technique, which requires only a few minutes to visualize the NMJ. We will prioritize the validation of therapeutic target candidates previously associated with neuromuscular diseases and biomarker candidates with known ligands or other potential monitoring strategies. <SA-II> Engineering a novel in vitro co-culture system of mature and aging NMJs - We will employ a double-compartmented system recapitulating the physiological separation of the central (MNs and astrocytes [ASTs]) and peripheral (MN axons, myotubes [MTs] and SCs) nervous systems in vivo. The glial cells (ASTs and SCs) will provide the MU with the biologically required structural and trophic support, minimizing the need for culture media supplementation. This strategy is essential for a faithful subsequent modeling of NMJ aging, which is thought to be associated with functional decline of cells constituting the MUs. In addition, we will protect cells in both compartments with fibrin gel scaffoldings to prevent cell detachment and synaptic disconnection due to frequent MT contraction. Furthermore, intermittent electrical stimulation (IES) will be provided to the MUs to facilitate their maturation. Once maturity is achieved, we will terminate the ?muscle exercise effect? of IES and reduce trophic factors to mimic natural aging in humans. NMJ maturity and aging will be monitored at multiple time points for molecular, morphological, and functional changes. Finally, the co-culture system developed will be utilized for screening and determining the properties of the molecules identified in SA-I. <Study impact> Our novel NMJ-LCM with a cutting-edge bioinformatics analysis should generate invaluable data to reveal the pathology and gain potential therapeutic insights into sarcopenia. In addition, our innovative co-culture system could become the first in vitro model to achieve complete maturation and subsequent aging of NMJs and serve as a powerful tool for mechanistic and translational studies of sarcopenia. This work will also contribute to a broader area of neuromuscular research, ranging from basic studies on MUs/NMJs, to more translational works on various other neuromuscular diseases."
"9380557","ABSTRACT  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and brain cancer. Advances in protein/gene profiling techniques and high throughput drug screening technologies have spawned many new drug candidates. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has impeded the development and clinical realization of this new generation of neurotherapeutics by restricting the brain uptake of most small molecule therapeutics, and prohibiting brain uptake of protein- and gene-based medicines. A promising noninvasive brain delivery strategy takes advantage of endogenous BBB transport mechanisms as a means to shuttle drug cargo from the blood to the brain. Such receptor-mediated transport systems can be targeted using the exquisite specificity of antibodies that are in turn linked to a drug payload that can include small molecules, proteins, or DNA therapeutics. After binding to the receptor on the blood side, the antibody- drug conjugate acts as an artificial substrate for the transporter and is transcytosed from the blood, across the BBB, and into the brain. Current approaches have yielded limited brain uptake because the targeted transporters are ubiquitously expressed, and the antibody targeting reagents have a low BBB permeability.  Therefore, this proposal is focused on the identification and validation of novel delivery vectors and their cognate BBB transporters that can mediate improved transport efficiency. Rather than deploying traditional mammalian antibody technology, we describe a new strategy that employs lamprey antibodies known as Variable Lymphocyte Receptors (VLRs) to target the BBB. Lampreys and humans last shared a common ancestor >500 million years ago, and due to this tremendous evolutionary divergence, even highly conserved mammalian proteins and carbohydrates are immunogenic in lampreys. By leveraging these unique aspects of the lamprey immune system with innovative screening technologies, we anticipate that the proposed research will provide new BBB-targeting VLRs capable of trafficking into the brain.  To achieve these goals, lampreys were immunized with mouse brain microvessel plasma membrane preparations, and staining with the resultant polyclonal antiserum demonstrated that VLRs clearly recognize the in vivo BBB and bind to multiple unique glycan structures. The lymphocyte cDNA of immunized lampreys was then used to create a yeast display library consisting of millions of VLRs that will be screened using an innovative screening approach to select BBB-binding and trafficking monoclonal VLRs. These brain-targeting VLRs will be validated both by pharmacokinetic profiling and their capacity to elicit a pharmacologically- relevant response in a murine stroke model. Finally, the BBB-targeting VLRs will be employed to identify the cognate BBB transporter and any associated glycoforms. Those VLRs exhibiting significant and specific brain uptake would represent new, noninvasive brain drug delivery vectors that could be powerful in the treatment of debilitating neurological disease."

There will be a rigorous and extensive evaluation of the program by trainees and participating faculty, including long-term follow-up. A website will be used to facilitate continued communication among the trainees and mentors. This program will offer a unique opportunity for medical students from across the country to work with some of the best molecular, translational, and clinical scientists working on aging-related research."
"9473566","?    DESCRIPTION:  Tumor-draining lymph nodes (LN) are the first site of metastasis in most types of cancer. The extent of metastasis in the LN is often used in staging cancer progression. Notably, in recent work the investigators described novel nanoscale TRAIL-coated liposomes that when conjugated to human natural killer (NK) cells enhance their endogenous therapeutic potential in killing cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In this project, these liposomes will e targeted to the LN by conjugating them to NK cells, and their ability to prevent the lymphatic spread of colon cancer tumors investigated in mice. It will be shown that targeting NK cells with TRAIL liposomes can enhance liposome retention time within the tumor draining lymph nodes to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The proposed work is organized into three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: To optimize the TRAIL/anti-NK1.1 liposome formulation and investigate their ability to target lymph node metastases. Liposomes will be produced with varying diameters and PEG chain lengths. The ability of super NK cells to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells will be tested in an in vitro mimic of the lymph node, measuring cellular apoptosis as a function of effector cell to target cell ratio. The 9 different liposome formulations (3 liposome diameters X 3 PEG chain lengths) will be injected subcutaneously in the left and right abdominal flanks of C57BL/6 mice. Inguinal lymph node cells will be harvested and analyzed via flow cytometry to assess human TRAIL presentation on the surface of NK cells. Subcutaneous colon carcinoma tumors will be grown in B6Rag1 mice, and treated with repeated subcutaneous injections of liposome solution, to identify the most effective formulations for metastasis elimination. Specific Aim 2: To characterize the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the TRAIL/anti-NK1.1 liposome formulations introduced intraperitoneally. Intraperitoneal route of liposome injection will be examined, to enable efficacy studies in the orthotopic colon cancer model of Aim 3. The relationship between liposome properties, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics following intraperitoneal injection is less well understood than either IV or subcutaneous injection, and will be addressed for different liposome formulations. An examination of liver, lymph node, and systemic toxicity in response to repeated liposome treatment will be conducted. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate TRAIL/anti-NK1.1 liposome efficacy in an orthotopic model of colon cancer metastasis to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Human colorectal cancer cells will be implanted into the cecal wall of the mouse colon, with orthotopic tumor and LN metastasis monitored noninvasively using bioluminescence imaging. Mice will be treated with repeated intraperitoneal injections of TRAIL/anti-NK1.1 liposomes to determine whether this targeted therapy can reduce or eliminate the formation of mesenteric LN metastases. The work proposed here testing this platform in in vitro culture, a 3D engineered platform and animal models is critical to the translation of this novel technology as a treatment for metastasis."
"9339717","Genome sequencing has revolutionized biology by providing unprecedented insight into the molecular basis of life. However, it has also established new research challenges. One critical challenge is the elucidation of the function of uncharacterized protein families, because at least half of the proteins encoded in any genome lack reliably described biochemical functions. We have attempted to develop systematic approaches to tackle this problem by combining the tools of structural biology with those of genomics. Using this approach, we recently elucidated the biochemical function of one of four E. coli proteins belonging to the ?ABC-F? sequence family, which has multiple representatives encoded in all eukaryotic and almost all eubacterial genomes. No other ABC-F protein had previously had its function characterized in detail, even though published studies using genome-scale profiling methods have identified the three human paralogs as contributing to a variety of different diseases. Furthermore, several of the ~30 eubacterial ABC-F paralog groups have been implicated in mediating microbial antibiotic resistance. Our recently published studies of the E. coli YjjK protein, which we renamed EttA (Energy-dependent Translational Throttle A), demonstrated that this ABC-F family member is a regulatory translation factor that mediates hibernation of ribosome initiation complexes dependent on ADP/ATP ratio. We determined a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of EttA trapped in an ATP-bound state bound to a 70S ribosome, which established that its unprecedented translational control activity is mediated by binding to a novel factor-binding site between the exit (E) and peptidyl-tRNA-binding (P) tRNA- binding sites on the ribosome. These studies, together with previous research from the Hunt lab on the mechanochemistry of homologous ATPases in the ABC Transporter superfamily, suggested that EttA uses a novel molecular mechanism to sense ADP/ATP ratio, which is a critical monitor of cellular energy status. The research proposed in this application will harness a wide variety of biochemical, biophysical, and structural methods to critically evaluate our hypothesis explaining this novel activity while also characterizing the range of biochemical functions performed by the four ABC-F paralogs expressed by E. coli. These studies will provide a foundation to understand the biochemical functions of the microbial ABC-F paralogs that confer antibiotic resistance and the three human ABC-F paralogs, which is critical for understanding their roles in disease."
"9263959","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge for mammalian hosts is to maintain symbiotic relationships with the vast bacterial communities that colonize the intestines. The intestinal epithelium is the primary barrier between the intestinal microbiota and internal host tissues, yet little is known about how epithelial cells control bacterial interactions with the mucosal surface and limit microbial penetration of the intestinal barrier. Filling this knowledge gap is crucial, as many gastrointestinal diseases of humans originate with pathogenic invasions of the intestinal epithelium, or involve dysregulated interactions between the commensal microbiota and epithelial cells. In the previous project period, we showed that intestinal epithelil cell autophagy limits tissue invasion by opportunistically invasive commensals and the invasive intestinal pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium. We found that autophagy activation by S. typhimurium requires the innate immune signaling adaptor MyD88, and is regulated by interactions between the anti-autophagy factor BCL2 and the essential autophagy protein Beclin 1. Our initial findings thus identify autophagy as an important epithelial cell-autonomous mechanism of antibacterial defense and indicate that epithelial autophagy activation is tightly regulated. During the next project period, we propose to build upon these findings to gain a deeper understanding of how antibacterial autophagy is regulated in the intestinal epithelium, and to elucidate the physiological significance of epithelial autophagy for maintaining homeostasis with the microbiota. In Aim 1, we will use in vivo mouse models to further delineate the role of BCL2 in regulating antibacterial autophagy in the intestinal epithelium. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo approaches to determine how MyD88 regulates antibacterial autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. In Aim 3, we will use mice harboring epithelial cell-specific autophag defects to test the hypothesis that autophagy promotes the clearance of opportunistically-invasive commensal bacteria. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of how intestinal epithelial cells promote homeostasis with the diverse bacterial community in the intestine. Further, our findings should suggest novel strategies for enhancing intestinal epithelia cell autophagy to protect against intestinal infections and inflammatory diseases."
"9281546","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority of individual susceptibility to sickness and disease in humans is generated by complex interactions between multiple loci and the environment, yet we still have very little understanding of how the map between genotype and phenotype is structured or how this structure influences the response to the environment and long term evolutionary change. In particular, complex genetic networks should generate pleiotropic relationships among traits whose functional coupling can make individual effects difficult to examine using traditional knockout approaches. The stress response network, as best elucidated in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, is an exemplar of this kind of system because environmentally induced modulation of 1000's of genes is regulated by a set of critical pathways that terminate in a small number of transcription factors. This observation has led to two major hypotheses that have become central to the field: (1) that all stress response phenotypes are pleiotropically coupled and (2) that variation in stress resistance drives variation in longevity. Here, we propose to capitalize on the fundamental discoveries regarding stress response pathways that have been made using C. elegans by using comprehensive functional genomic approaches within the closely related species C. remanei, which is much better suited for studies of natural variation. We aim to (1) determine the regulatory network structure of natural variation in stress response and longevity via the comprehensive mapping of stress phenotypes and the molecular function of critical components of the stress response regulatory network, (2) determine patterns of absolute and flexible connectivity among related stress pathways using experimental evolution under factorial combinations of high oxidative and heat stress, and (3) test functional hypotheses regarding specific gene action and general network structure using natural alleles and by abrogating gene function via RNAi and gene knockouts. We will combine features of each of these approaches using a Bayesian analysis to infer the regulatory structure of the stress response network and to then directly test these predictions using genetic and functional manipulations. The pleiotropy hypotheses will be evaluated indirectly via mapping the propagation of genetic variation across the network and directly via the correlated response of one stress phenotype to selection on another. This research uses a natural systems genetics approach that integrates an understanding of natural genetic variation within a strong functional hypothesis-testing framework to understand the function and evolution of a complex regulatory system with critical implications for human health."
"9476525","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report indicates that millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain conditions and that annual health care costs related to chronic pain are estimated at over half a trillion dollars. The prevalence of pain is greatest amongst older adults and is often associated with significant physical and psychosocial disability. Estimates of the prevalence of persistent pain problems among community-dwelling elderly persons range from 30-80%. Increasing evidence suggests an association between chronic pain and alcohol use disorder that is of great concern in older adults. Chronic unhealthy alcohol use has the potential of altering the subjective experience of pain and response to pain medications, which could complicate or compromise the effective clinical management of pain. In particular, unhealthy alcohol use in older adults may exacerbate debilitating side effects from opioid use, such as impaired cognition, diminished coordination and balance, and enhanced risk for falls that can threaten independent living. In addition, unhealthy alcohol use could increase the abuse potential of pain medications. However, the influence of unhealthy alcohol use on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of opioid analgesics has not been studied in the elderly population. Our overall goal is to investigate the impact of aging and alcohol use on response to opioid analgesics in a controlled human laboratory study. We will compare pain relief as well as subjective, cognitive, and reinforcing side effects after an acute oral test doseof oxycodone in the following groups of subjects with mild to moderate recurring pain: 1) older adults (> 65 yrs) with unhealthy levels of alcohol use; 2) older adults with healthy levels of alcohol use; 3) middle-aged adults (35-55 yrs) with unhealthy levels of alcohol use; 4) middle-aged adults with healthy levels of alcohol use. PA-13-058 Pain in Aging calls for studies that examine the mechanisms and processes by which factors impact the experience and treatment of pain in older adults, including the interaction of alcohol use and pain. The proposed controlled laboratory study is innovative in that it may provide the first demonstration in humans of a highly plausible, but heretofore unproven interaction between chronic alcohol use and opioid response in the clinical context of therapeutic use and abuse liability of opioid analgesics. If proven true it would likely lead to in-depth studies on the confounding effects of excessive alcohol consumption on the efficacy, tolerability and safety of long-term opioid therapy in pain patients."
"9321168","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The entry of HIV-1 into the brain during the early and/or late stages of infection leads to the development of a viral reservoir in the vast majority f individuals despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this regard, HIV-1 proviral DNA integration into the chromosomes of brain perivascular macrophages, microglial cells, astrocytes, and perhaps brain endothelial cells leads to the establishment of viral latency/persistence within these important cellular compartments as well as resting memory T cells and cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage in the peripheral circulation and likely other tissues during the course of HIV disease. The extent of viral gene activation and expression in the periphery and following viral brain penetration may be dependent on therapeutic efficacy in a given reservoir, the diversity of the viral quasispecies, host immune activation profiles, and a number of comorbidity factors such as substance abuse, aging, and other chronic infections or cancers. To varying degrees, these factors are integrally involved in modulating the production of full-length and truncated viral RNA, toxic viral proteins (Tat, Nef, Vpr, and gp120), and infectious virus within and outside the brain. Consequently, there is a critical need for new strategies to eliminate all forms of integrated provirus from latently/persistently infected cells thereby preventing infectious production as well as the production of neurotoxic viral proteins that could also be produced from defective genomes not eliminated by currently available therapeutic strategies. To this end, a team experienced investigators has been assembled with complementary expertise in viral diversity and molecular architecture of the HIV-1 genome (B. Wigdahl, Drexel University), viral latency (J. Karn, Case Western Reserve University), and gene excision technology (K. Khalili, Temple University) to examine the Hypothesis that the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform can be tailored to develop precision-guided gene editing strategies to eliminate HIV-1 from the latently infected resting memory CD4+ T-cell reservoir and reservoir cells with the brain. To address this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1 sequence and bioinformatic information from viral genetic studies performed with HIV-1-infected patients will be utilized to design gRNAs to precisely guide the HIV-1 excision process (Drexel University). In Aim 2 we will develop and test in vitro HIV-1- specific gene editing systems (Temple University), combined with expertise in the molecular biology of HIV-1 latency (Case Western Reserve University), which will culminate in ex vivo experimentation in Aim 3 on HIV-1- infected samples. These studies will set the stage for future in vivo animal studies for validating the approach toward clinical application. The overarching goal is to develop a robust experimental procedure which can be employed through various gene delivery platforms, such as nanomolecules, lentivirus, or stem/progenitor cell engineering, to provide a cure for AIDS."
"9382387","ABSTRACT  Serous epithelial ovarian cancer (OvCa) typically presents with wide dissemination of cancer cells within the abdominal cavity and significant tumor burden. OvCa metastases have a high proportion of stroma, which consists primarily of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a mesenchymal cell type known to promote the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. However, it is unclear how normal fibroblasts are reprogrammed into CAFs and how CAFs promote tumor growth. To directly address these open questions, we performed proteomic analyses of the primary and metastatic stroma in OvCa patient samples to identify proteins that were differentially expressed. We detected, specifically in the metastases, a conserved stromal signature associated with metastasis that included high stromal expression of Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to nicotinamide. This depletes cellular SAM stores and leads to global hypomethylation of histones and expression of tumor-promoting genes. In preliminary experiments, we found that NNMT can reprogram normal fibroblasts into CAFs and that NNMT inhibition in CAFs blocks OvCa cancer cell adhesion, proliferation, and in vivo tumor growth. In our system, NNMT expression specifically regulates trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K27. Analysis of NNMT expression in OvCa patients revealed that strong stromal NNMT expression is significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Based on these data, the primary hypothesis underlying this application is that expression of NNMT in normal fibroblasts transforms them to CAFs through metabolically-mediated epigenetic alterations. The proposed experiments will systematically characterize the contribution of NNMT-driven epigenetic and metabolic changes to the transformation of normal fibroblasts to CAFs. In Aim I, we propose to investigate NNMT-driven epigenetic remodeling in the acquisition and maintenance of the CAF phenotype. We will systematically analyze how NNMT regulates the transcriptome and how alteration of epigenetics functionally drives the conversion of normal fibroblasts to CAFs. Since NNMT impinges on multiple metabolic pathways, in Aim II we will systematically assess the NNMT-driven metabolic state and its contribution to CAF differentiation and the promotion of tumor progression. Finally, in Aim III, our group will work with the NIH Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) to discover compounds that inhibit NNMT biochemical activity, using state of the art high-throughput screening with an optimized NNMT biochemical screen of over 300,000 potential inhibitors. Lead compounds will be functionally screened in high- throughput 3D models of the tumor microenvironment at U of C. Successful inhibition of NNMT activity in the tumor stroma could result in a novel and clinically relevant approach to the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer."
"9364111","The cochlea is composed of a variety of cell types including sensory, supporting and neural elements. Taken together, these cells comprise a functionally intricate and cohesive electrical unit that initiates the analysis of acoustic information within our environment. We capitalize on the in vitro approach, including isolated cochlea explants, single cell, and more recently stable cell lines to elucidate cochlear cell function; the strategy is to characterize basic properties prior to integration into a cohesive understanding of the organ. Currently, the overarching aim of this project is focused on determining the biophysical properties of key membrane components of the outer hair cell (OHC), one of the major players in auditory function, using a balance of electrophysiology, molecular biology, modelling and high resolution cryo-EM. Though we have made significant progress on many fronts since our last renewal in 2010, we now focus on three specific research topics that evolve from our most significant accomplishments. In particular, one of the main areas of our investigations has been and will be the influence of anions on the OHC molecular motor?s (prestin, SLC26a5) electro-mechanical activity. This ion is at the root of cochlear amplification (Santos-Sacchi et al., 2006). Indeed, the NIDCD?s 2012-2016 Strategic Plan specifically identifies understanding anion control of hearing as a key goal. The three aims are 1) to evaluate the chloride-dependent kinetic behavior of OHC nonlinear capacitance and electromotility, 2) to characterize intracellular chloride movements in the prestin-transfected HEK cell and OHC with a new prestin-fused YFP chloride sensor we created, and 3) to determine the high resolution structure of prestin (SLC26a5) and its closest mammalian family member SLC26a6 using cryo-EM, with the goal of identifying conformational changes due to chloride and voltage. We hypothesize that understanding these molecular activities will aid in understanding how the OHC enables us to hear so well and in turn how micro-environmental influences may lead to pathologies of the OHC that afflict millions."
"9277508","Over the past two decades, we have arrived at a deeper  scientific understanding of fragile X syndrome (FXS); concurrently, our awareness ofthe intrinsic  complexity of pathogenic mechanisms contributing to brain dysfunction has grown. New discoveries  from fine-grained, developmental analyses of novel animal models and humans with FXS are essential  for achieving needed breakthroughs, so that we can eventually design interventions that produce  significant, long-term benefits for affected individuals. Accordingly, investigators comprising the  Collaborative Fragile X Center at Stanford seek to fundamentally and substantively advance knowledge  ofthe pathophysiology of FXS at multiple levels of scientific inquiry (molecular, gene, synapse, brain  circuits/systems, behavior), in novel animal models and affected humans, and from the perspective of  the developmental dynamics of brain maturation. We further seek to provide vital new information about  how targeted environmental, pharmacologic and behavioral approaches can positively affect function of  the FXS brain. To accomplish these objectives, 4 specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1 (Science): To  engage a highly collaborative, trans-disciplinary team of investigators who will address focused and  challenging questions concerning FXS pathophysiology through three interactive, interdependent and  synergistic projects that emphasize innovative cross-species experiments and comparisons (novel  mouse models and humans with FXS). Collectively, these projects take multi-level, state-of-the-art  scientific approaches, spanning molecules, receptors, synapses, circuits and behavioral phenotypes,  and assessing response to targeted environmental, pharmacological and behavioral probes. This  research will yield information that represents substantive and translation-relevant advances in our  understanding of FXS pathogenesis. Aim 2 (Management): To maintain an efficient administrative  structure and effective scientific oversight through the establishment of an Administrative Core that  promotes coordination, communication and collaboration, provides financial oversight, expert bio  statistical consultation and database management, facilitates recruitment of human research  participants, and interacts with the Center Administrative and Advisory Committees. Aim 3  (Investigators): To directly and substantively involve early-stage investigators and investigators whose  primary field of expertise is outside of FXS in Center scientific activities. Aim 4 (Training and  Education): To establish and manage selected educational and training opportunities including a  summer undergraduate program, monthly FXS journal club and participation in an annual symposium."

"9353215","The Analytic Core (AC) will provide expertise and systems for the conduct of qualitative studies, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and economic studies to support the aims of the iTech and its research and pilot studies, interactions within the ATN, and with NICHD. This work is organized across three aims that follow the research project lifecycle. Throughout the development (Aim 1), execution (Aim 2), analysis, and dissemination (Aim 3) phases of each study activity, the AC will responsibly and strategically manage its resources to foster a collaborative environment, maintain scientific rigor, and ensure timely work completion.It is composed of a Leadership Team, co-directed by Drs. Eli Rosenberg and Kathryn Muessig, and three subteams: the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), Cost Analysis, and Qualitative Teams. The first aim supports the development of iTech studies' qualitative, RCT, and costing activities by consulting on valid study design and establishing best-practice data collection systems and procedures. The Qualitative Team will work with research project PIs to develop valid and consistent (between-study) protocols, secure IRB approval, and design systems for qualitative data collection, storage, and analysis. The RCT Team will implement web-based recruitment screener and computer audio-assisted interview tools, design case report forms and collection system, develop and implement randomization plans and systems, and implement data capture and storage systems for study app usage, laboratory, and retention data. The Cost Analysis Team will work with project PIs to develop cost input parameters and collection tools. The second aim supports protocol implementation through the collection and maintenance of high-quality study data and real-time monitoring of study progress. For all research activities, the AC will provide data to the Management Core to monitor accrual on a weekly basis during active enrollment, to ensure each study is meeting enrollment targets within estimated timeframes. The RCT Team will routinely summarize study data to monitor all key domains of RCT activities, in the form of study progress reports, data quality reports, and research data reports. When recommended by NICHD for a given RCT protocol, the AC will act to assemble a DSMB. The third aim is to ensure that data analyses are conducted to the highest scientific standards and that results are dissemination in a timely way. In addition to supporting the iTech research and pilots studies, the AC will work collaboratively with the Management Core to ensure project and subject recruitment venue (SRV) milestones are met, data standards are upheld and dissemination is timely. Collaboration with the Technology Core will serve to ensure participant Recruitment and Retention and analysis of self-collected testing specimens. The AC will also serve as a resource to other funded U19s providing technical assistance on measurement and analysis of technology-based data systems."
"9281662","CORE C ABSTRACT  The role of the Pharmacokinetics (PK) Core is to assay MK-2048 concentrations in blood, vaginal fluids, and  genital tissues in collaboration with Projects 2-4 and Core B; and to develop a pharmacologic model  encompassing in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo data, all in an effort to support development of MK-2048 as an on -  demand, coitally independent vaginal film. In this program, the PK Core is responsible for ensuring that the  drug concentrations and data modeling approaches are valid and reproducible, so that drug development  decisions are well-founded. Thus, the aims of the PK core are devoted to drug concentration quality and data  modeling. The PK core will define variability arising from sampling procedures for vaginal fluid and  cervical/vaginal tissue and will develop a physiogically-based PK model scaffold that could be generally  applicable to topical drug application in the vagina and cervix. This model can be adapted for other topical drug  administration modes such as gel, ring, or IUD, which would provide the basis for exploration of whether  sufficient drug concentrations are achieved in the vaginal compartment for virtually any drug agent  administered intra-vaginally. These efforts will support the goals of this application and advance the  microbicide field by furthering the advancement of an on-demand product which could provide protection for  seven days after a single application."
"9282324","San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs. In addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health cai^e for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire T1 to 14 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions); Based on our vision of improving the health status of South Texas by accelerating scientific discoveries and public health applications, we will deploy strategic resources that focus on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic population, 2) the special health issues facing active-duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US."
"9281709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches."
"9267817","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related deterioration in bone, muscle and physical performance, manifested as osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and disability, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. It is a priority to understand how musculoskeletal phenotypes and physical activity change with age, the factors that contribute to these changes, and how changes impact clinically important health outcomes. MrOS is a unique prospective study of 5994 older men that has been extremely productive in expanding our understanding of age-related change in musculoskeletal health. Initiated in 2000, it includes extensive longitudinal, objective, state-of-the-art assessments of bone, muscle, physical performance, physical activity and health outcomes, as well as biospecimen and imaging archives. We propose to extend these resources to allow a comprehensive and integrated understanding of the processes and consequences of musculoskeletal aging and decline in physical activity in older men studied over a 15 year period. The overall long term goal of the project is to identity men at risk of adverse health outcomes who may benefit from preventive measures and rehabilitation, discover new targets for treating and preventing declines in musculoskeletal health and activity, and improve our understanding of optimal aging (men who maintain their musculoskeletal health and activity levels over an average overall follow-up of 15 years). Specifically, we will leverage our repeated measurements to define age- related trajectories in phenotypes of musculoskeletal health, physical performance, and physical activity in order to determine factors that predict and contribute to these trajectories. We will test the hypotheses that favorable trajectories in musculoskeletal health are associated with lower risks of incident falls, fractures, disability and mortality and that age-related deterioration in bone, muscle and physical performance can occur concurrently; combined deterioration magnifies the risk of poor functional and health outcomes. Second, we will characterize change and trajectories in activity levels in older men using our repeated state-of-the-art questionnaire and objectively assessed energy expenditure from accelerometry. Third, we will take advantage of a linkage of MrOS with Medicare Claims data to determine the association of trajectories in musculoskeletal phenotypes and activity with inpatient and nursing home related health care utilization. Fourth, we will examine novel characteristics of cortical bone that may cause age-related skeletal fragility by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography to measure cortical porosity. We will relate trajectories of musculoskeletal health and activity to these measures of cortical bone and test whether increased cortical porosity is related to fractures. Finally, we will continue to leverage MrOS as a platform for new science and the training of investigators. Our application is consistent with the mission of the NIA and NIAMS to conduct research related to the aging process and diseases and conditions associated with musculoskeletal aging, and foster the development of new research scientists in this scientific area."
"9465008","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a competitive renewal of the Training Grant Research Training in Diabetes and Endocrinology, which would represent years 42-46 of the first, and longest-running, T-32 grant at the University of Pittsburgh. The longevity is a testament to the success of the program in providing postdoctoral Trainees with the research/career skills necessary for developing independent academic careers. Over that time period, the research landscape has changed dramatically, and this training program has adapted to compliment the changes. One notable and relatively recent change is the increased complexity of medical research, requiring cross-discipline integration of research programs. This change necessitates that researchers operate in an environment that provides a thorough grounding in the translational focus of medical research. Added to this is the need for ever greater competency in the ancillary skills that are required to compliment the core research skills - including project, group, and multi-team collaboration management, grant writing, public presentations, transitioning to independence, and others. Historically, these skills were often learned `on the fly', but now require a more structured approach. Thus, a major goal of this renewal was to further strengthen an outstanding program with an eye to the aforementioned evolutions, so that our Trainees are continuously immersed, through hands-on-mentoring, peer-to-peer interactions, research experiences, didactic classes, education workshops, and presentation opportunities, in a truly integrated translational research training program. At a practical level, this is reflected in (i) outstanding research opportunities that are centered on three research hubs (basic, clinical, and public health); (ii) exceptional training faculty with expertise in basic, clinical and public health research; (iii) access to a range of didactic course, workshops, and education experiences, including masters and certificate programs, that buttress and compliment research opportunities, and in many cases emphasize translational themes; (iv) structured career development courses that will impart skills ranging from managing group projects, to presentation skills, through the K-to-R grant transition; (v) a continuous assessment program for Trainees, reinforced by an Individual Career Development Plan, a 3-person mentoring team, and yearly progress evaluations by the Training Committee that focuses on the individualized professional development of Trainees, and (vi) a program management that will efficiently oversee the ever-increasing complexity of research training in medical research. Our expectation is that we will continue to train 4 postdoctoral fellows per year, with a balanced mix of MDs and PhD's, and will offer two years of support to each Trainee. Of the 11 Trainees that graduated from the Training Program during the current cycle of this grant (6 MD and 5 PhD), 7 applied for or received funding while Trainees, or subsequent to the completion of their training. Moreover, these 7 are currently active in research or research related careers. Also, 2 of the 4 Trainees who did not apply for funding remain active in research careers, which we hope will be reflected in applications for grant funding in the future. Fourteen peer-reviewed first author publications (3 are currently in review) have been produced by these Trainees to date, and 12 first author abstracts have been presented at national meetings. Eight Trainees obtained faculty positions, and 3 are in further training."
"9321777","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of the Career Development Program in Omics of Lung Diseases (K12) entitled Omics of Inflammatory Airway Diseases are to develop and evaluate an interdisciplinary program that will educate young pulmonary investigators in methods of integrative omics technologies including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, computational modeling, and systems biology. Scholars (2/year for years 2 through 5 of this Award) will be clinical or research (postdoctoral) instructors or recently appointed Assistant Professors who are within 5 years of completion of residency or receipt of Ph.D. Scholars are expected to become independent investigators and assume leadership roles in using omics technologies to elucidate pulmonary diseases. The central omics focus of the program exploits the strong commitment of the faculty at Washington University to apply multiple omics-based methods to investigation of the biological basis of inflammatory airway diseases.  To insure expertise in clinical research methods, responsible conduct of research, and the scientific prerequisites for submission of a K Award application, the scholars will take courses in the well-established Clinical Research Training Center (CRTC)(TL1 TR000449-06 and KL2 TR000450-06) sponsored by Washington University's Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences (CTSA: UL1 TR000448-06). Also during the first year, to provide hands on omics research experience, scholars will participate in 3 month, educational immersion rotations with established omics- or pulmonary-based teams of investigators, and attend relevant, ongoing conferences, journal clubs, and lectures. Each scholar's mentored research experience will begin in January of the first year with the selection of a mentor team and scholarship oversight committee that will prepare her/him for submission of a K Award application by February of the second year. The Specific Aims for this career development program will include: Specific Aim (1): We will provide fundamental training in clinical research, omics strategies, and systems biology with emphasis on translational research.

"9383464","This research will develop methods to model active sites in metalloproteins for the purpose of determining fundamental structure-function relationships for how proteins activate dioxygen, a process that strongly impacts human health and aging. Artificial metallproteins will be prepared utilizing biotin-streptavidin technology as a tool to ensure specific and reproducible placement of synthetic metal complexes within protein hosts. This approach is proposed to be an effective method to model key properties of the active sites in native metalloproteins, including site isolation of species, regulation of the primary coordination sphere, and control of the microenvironments around the metal complexes. One glaring weakness of many biomimetic systems is their limited ability to regulate the microenvironments that surround metal centers. No chemical system operates in isolation without interacting with its local environment. There is a growing body of evidence from structural biology that the microenvironment, a space around metal complexes that comprises the secondary coordination sphere, has profound effects on protein function that ranges from modulation of physical properties to delivery of reactants and removal of products. It is our contention that the greater regulation of microenvironments will lead to better understanding of protein function. It is further maintained that the benefits gained from fundamental analyses as proposed in this application extend well beyond improvements in selectivities/efficiencies at the molecular level ? they are transformative for all types of platforms, providing the requisite information that is still missing for the development of highly functional systems. We propose an approach for preparing artificial metalloproteins that allows for the confinement of synthetic complexes within protein hosts to regulate both the primary and secondary coordination spheres about the immobilized metal centers. The ability to regulate these coordination spheres within a protein will produce systematic structure-function relationships that will lead to an improved understanding of chemical processes that are directly linked to human health."

However, how aging impacts cardiovascular disease remains unclear. A highly collaborative environment is required to unravel the complexities of this problem. The goal of this leadership award is to develop a world-class center on aging and cardiovascular diseases at Yale School of Medicine to foster highly productive research collaborations and to educate and train the next generation of leaders in this important field. The proposed Center would be the first of its kind in the nation and will be led by Dr. Goldstein, an established physician-scientist and cardiologist who investigates how aging impacts inflammation. The Center's specific goals will be addressed in the following three aims: (1) to bring together established investigators to broadly examine how increased inflammation with aging enhances cardiovascular diseases employing both pre-clinical models and clinical material; (2) to identify highly promising fellows and junior faculty and mentor them in research areas of Aim 1, in addition to providing them pilot research funds; and (3) to develop educational forums (e.g., a specific course on topics relevant to cardiovascular aging, and an annual symposium) to disseminate key insights that translate basic mechanisms to clinical medicine. Importantly, the Center will leverage infrastructure at the Yale School of Medicine, including the Pepper Center, Center for Clinical Investigation, and Investigative Medicine program. The long-term goals of the Center will be to obtain extramural funding for multi-investigator driven proposals as well as career development faculty grants and an institutional training grant to sustain the training of postdoctoral fellows. In summary, the proposed Center will be a new initiative for Yale and will serve as a beacon of excellence for investigators pursuing research into aging and cardiovascular diseases."
"9355100","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle."
"9376846","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of the Midwest Child Patient Reported Outcomes (M-cPROs) Consortium is to advance the understanding and measurement of cPROs in children with chronic disease using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(r) (PROMIS(r)) to allow for widespread use in both clinical care and research to optimize the well-being and functioning of the child. To achieve this objective, the scientific research projects within the M-cPROs Consortium aim to: 1) improve outcomes that matter to children with chronic disease by: understanding the impact of disease factors, including acute disease exacerbations on patient pain behavior, pain quality, physical activity, physical stress experience, strength impact, family belonging, and family involvement, assessing the relationship between family belonging and family involvement with other cPROs, and evaluating the impact of environmental stressors (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation) on patient pain behavior, pain quality, physical activity, physical stress experience, strength impact, family belonging, and family involvement; 2) validate new PROMIS measures in multiple chronic disease populations to support a common metric for cPROs measurement in children with chronic disease; and 3) determine whether PROMIS measures are responsive to change in health and whether that change is clinically relevant in children with chronic disease. To achieve these overall aims, we will assess cPROs using PROMIS measures in children with sickle cell disease, asthma, and diabetes. Both asthma and diabetes are increasingly prevalent. Furthermore, although sickle cell disease is rare, children with this disease, like those with asthma and diabetes, experience acute disease exacerbations that often result in acute healthcare utilization. These disease exacerbations occur more commonly in those with prior exacerbations and in families who are uninsured, who have public insurance, or who have low family income. Additional environmental stressors that represent socioeconomic deprivation may contribute to patient functioning and to their disease status. Furthermore, the child's perspective of their family, including whether they feel they belong or whether they feel they are involved in their family, are new constructs to explore in relationship to the child's cPROs and to  their disease status. Leveraging the PROMIS common metric, it is possible to now compare across and within cohorts of children with chronic disease to fill some of these gaps in knowledge. The release of new PROMIS measures that focus on additional aspects of pain and physical health, along with new measures that focus on a children's perception of their family, provide an exciting opportunity for investigators in the M-cPROs Consortium to advance the field of cPROs research within cohorts of children with chronic disease."

His current research evaluates a cultural adaptation of an evidence-based parenting intervention for at-risk Hispanic families with young children (ages 4-11), for which there is potential distal NIDA impact such as reduced risk of starting to smoke tobacco or to use other drugs. Complete evidence on distal benefits of early randomized trial interventions of this type cannot be seen unless the scale of research shifts upward, as in multi-site trials, and unless the measurements include bio-assays to confirm self-report drug use, with probes for potential gene- intervention interactions. Based on the proposed K01 career training objectives, the applicant will acquire the necessary skills to develop an interdisciplinary program of prevention research, informed by epidemiological and biomedical science. During 75% protected time for career development toward independent R01 project leadership, core learning objectives will be met (e.g., RCR, FCOI, grants management). In addition to its core, the training plan has 5 tracks: (1) enhanced mastery of small sample parenting intervention research; (2) enhanced mastery of research design and measurements for larger sample multi-site NIDA prevention research on youth developmental trajectories leading toward NIDA outcomes; (3) enhanced mastery of data analysis for interdependent observations from multiple sites; (4) new learning about integration of biological assays in NIDA family intervention and prevention research via collaborations with expert NIH toxicologists and genetics researchers; (5) mastery of electronic technology complements to current 'in person' intervention delivery and program impact assessment. The proposed award is crucial now that the applicant has become K01-eligible via permanent residency. His college has guaranteed protected time for this K01 career acceleration through structured mentoring program led by a NIDA K05 Senior Scientist, backed by a strong local team of federally funded co-mentors, as well as scientific advisors. Through the proposed K01 award, Dr. Parra-Cardona will gain mastery of the theory and research approaches now being refined by quantitative developmental scientists in new lines of NIDA prevention research. The training plan includes guided readings, coursework, among other activities leading to publications. A prevention pilot study will serve as a 'preliminary study' for a NIDA R01 grant proposal planned for Year 4 of the proposed award. This application is responsive to NIH and NIDA's strategic plans highlighting the need to implement interdisciplinary programs of research aimed at preventing young people from ever using drugs, as well as ensuring that at-risk and underserved minority populations benefit from these scientific efforts."
"9269188","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our recent discovery of MTNR1B, encoding for the high-affinity melatonin receptor MT2, as a novel genetic risk variant for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and glycemic traits in genome wide association studies (GWAS) has sparked great interest in the role of melatonin in glycemic control. However, the exact mechanism is not yet understood. A major limitation in all previous GWAS is that the clinical assessment of T2D and of the glycemic traits are based on daytime assessments, when circulating concentrations of the ligand of the MT2 receptor, i.e., melatonin, are near-undetectable. The observed phenotypes of the MTNR1B risk variant may thus be the proverbial tip of the ice berg compared to its potential impact during the night when endogenous melatonin concentrations are approximately 20-fold higher or following exogenous melatonin administration. Indeed, while in GWAS we find the magnitude of effect of the MTNR1B risk variant on 2-h glucose concentrations following OGTT to be approximately 0.07 mmol/L, in our preliminary data, following exogenous melatonin administration in the morning elevating circulating levels to or beyond nighttime concentrations, this impact was approximately 15-fold larger (1.00 mmol/L). In this proposal, we overcome a number of limitations in prior work, and we aim to test the hypotheses that: (1) exogenous melatonin administration at a time that melatonin levels are normally low worsens glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity; (2) this effect is stronger in the carriers of the common MTNR1B risk SNP compared to non-carriers; (3) the interaction of melatonin administration and genetic variance on glucose tolerance depends on time of day; (4) suppression of nighttime melatonin concentrations by light exposure during simulated night work improves glucose tolerance; and (5) this beneficial effect is stronger in the carriers of the common MTNR1B risk SNP compared to non-carriers. The hypotheses will be tested under highly controlled in-laboratory studies. To further investigate underlying mechanisms, we will perform parallel studies using ex vivo human pancreatic islets. This research will provide mechanistic insights into the effects of elevated melatonin concentrations concurrent with food intake as occurs in the 10% of the work force engaged in night shift work, in the millions of people who consume food after dinner when endogenous melatonin levels are elevated, and in people using exogenous melatonin against sleep disturbances, jet lag, and delayed sleep phase syndrome. In addition this research may help in the development of evidence-based countermeasures such as light exposure in the fight against T2D in shift workers and night eaters."
"9314709","Project Summary The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the relationship between prenatal androgens and adult cardiometabolic outcomes in a human cohort taking a life-course perspective. Growing evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to androgens may play a role in the programming of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Evidence from prenatally androgenized animal models exposed to testosterone in early and late gestation demonstrate several cardiometabolic impairments including hypertension, insulin resistance and adiposity in adult life. Pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have higher testosterone levels during pregnancy and delivery compared to healthy mothers and their offspring tend to develop worse metabolic parameters. Despite evidence from animal studies and patient-specific populations (ie. PCOS), data linking prenatal androgens to adult health outcomes in the general human population has not been well studied. The issue of developmental androgenization is of clinical relevance for investigation because of increasing human exposure to endocrine-disrupting environmental factors that interact with androgen receptor signaling. We propose a study in which: 1) we will relate maternal prenatal androgen levels to offspring early childhood indicators of growth (from birth to age 7), and 2) test their impact on predicting cardiometabolic risk in adulthood 45 years later. The proposed study, in addition to advancing our understanding of early programming effects of androgens on cardiovascular markers, can help identify biomarkers for human disease, potential therapeutic targets and early periods for intervention."
"9317642","PROJECT SUMMARY  Hepatitis C (HCV) viral infection is common among chronic dialysis patients in the United States (US) and associated with elevated risks of death and morbidity. Infection rates vary widely across dialysis units, with estimates ranging from 2 ? 14%. HCV infection increases the death rate among dialysis patients by 1.6 ? 2.4 fold. Kidney transplantation offers substantial improvements in survival and quality of life compared to dialysis, even in high risk subgroups such as the elderly and patients with diabetes. Unfortunately, the US transplant registry does not record HCV serostatus among wait-listed patients. Studies of kidney transplant outcomes for HCV+ patients have therefore been limited by single center populations, short follow-up, exclusive focus on post-transplant outcomes, and concerns about generalizability to the wider HCV+ population. It is unknown if there is a survival benefit of kidney transplant over dialysis for HCV+ patients, and if receipt of an HCV+ donor kidney affects this benefit. The landscape of HCV in dialysis and kidney transplantation has been greatly altered by the approval of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs); however the ideal timing of DAA-based HCV therapy and its effects on transplant outcomes have not been determined.  The optimal transplant strategy for HCV+ kidney transplant candidates remains unknown. Compared to uninfected kidney transplant candidates, HCV+ candidates have additional risk factors for removal from the waiting list, including progression of their liver disease, and a higher burden of comorbidities, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which can affect access to kidney transplant and mortality. Transplantation may reduce CVD risk, but may worsen other health conditions such as glycemic control. Also, HCV+ candidates have the unique option of accepting kidneys from HCV+ donors, a practice that carries risks of viral complications such as liver injury. The benefits of accepting a HCV+ organ, versus waiting for a HCV- negative kidney, may only be realized by individuals with deteriorating health or anticipated long waiting times. While treatment with DAAs pre-transplant may decrease the risk of delisting due to medical comorbidities, it may inadvertently increase waiting times and risk of death due to inability to use HCV+ donors.  Using a unique dataset with information collected by a national dialysis provider as well as transplant outcomes and Medicare claims, we will determine whether kidney transplant is associated with a survival benefit compared to chronic dialysis in a diverse, national sample of wait-listed HCV+ patients. We will examine whether acceptance of HCV+ kidneys offers benefit versus waiting for a kidney transplant from an HCV-negative donor. Finally, we will compare time to transplant among wait-listed HCV+ patients who are treated versus untreated with DAAs. Given our ongoing access to dialysis provider data and the largest cohort of US HCV+ kidney transplant candidates ever assembled, the findings will motivate future research proposals and additional data linkages aimed at optimizing the care of HCV+ patients with end-stage renal disease."
"9281664","PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of the FAME application is to develop a film formulation of the integrase inhibitor MK-  2048 that achieves measurable drug levels in the cervical and vaginal tissues over one week following a single  application. The broad, long term goal of Project 2 is to provide pharmacodynamic assessments in the  nonhuman primate (Core B) and clinical studies (Project 3) in a manner that will establish MK-2048 is being  delivered in a sustained manner to prevent HIV infection in the genital tissues ex vivo, a key determinant of  product efficacy. A second broad term goal is to characterize the expression and activity of the transporter and  metabolizing enzymes in the genital tissues which could impact the levels of MK-2048 available in the tissues.  This work will be utilized by Core C to develop well defined PD/PK models to estimate the amount of drug that  needs to be delivered and retained in the tissue for protection against HIV. Defining PD/PK linkages is a  fundamental component of drug product development. Our laboratory has pioneered the use of mucosal tissue  for evaluating drug formulation for safety and efficacy and the development of the ex-vivo challenge assay  (taking mucosal tissue from trial participants after product use and challenging with HIV in the lab) for cervical  and vaginal mucosal tissue to define PD/PK correlates. We have also worked to optimize sample collection  and testing. Leveraging our experience, we will evaluate drug activity in explant mucosal assays, luminal fluid,  and ex vivo tissue to provide pharmacodynamic assessments across humans and nonhuman primates. Our  specific aims are 1) Characterize pharmacodynamic / pharmacokinetic relationships in ex vivo explant cultures,  2) Determine the role of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes on MK-2048 activity in in vitro and ex  vivo models, and 3) Define multi-compartment pharmacodynamic activity. Addressing these aims will allow us  to accurately estimate the amount of MK-2048 required to prevent HIV (SHIV) infection and if luminal and  tissue levels of drug coinside with this protection. The culmination of this work will be to provide a new  sustained dosage form."
"9330701","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of the project is to provide training workshops for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty interested in acquiring formal demography skills. Formal demography consists of a set of analytic tools that allow for a kind of analysis not possible with standard statistical models and are therefore criticl in addressing the kinds of complex population processes occurring in the 21st century. In this program we will build upon the successful training workshops started at Stanford University, by moving that program's research format to UC Berkeley and adding new components of core training, special emphasis themes and mentored research projects. The program consists of annual week-long meetings, composed of 3 days of core training with proven instructors, followed by a two-day conference with invited presenters. In the academic year following the week-long meeting, trainees will engage in a mentored research project emerging from these workshops. The three days of core training will include instruction on population dynamics and hands-on training in modern demographic computing (in the R statistical modeling language). A third day will include training and methods specific to that year's special emphasis. These workshops not only serve as training grounds, but also provide ample opportunities for networking and building relationships and community. The topics covered in the workshops will be macroeconomic demography, bio demography and genetic demography, demographic research with Big Data, and Aggregate approaches to demographic change using the Human Mortality and Human Fertility Databases. In the final year the program will repeat a theme based on the experience of previous years, modified to reflect new developments in that field. These elements - training, research presentations, mentored research, networking - work to create a long-lasting community of scholars that can engage in interdisciplinary research for years to come. In this way we expect that the topics of these studies will serve to inform demographic research and have positive impacts in particular on US health policy."
"9262935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Whole body glucose metabolism is governed by both peripheral and central (brain) mechanisms. The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) in the brain plays an important role in glucose sensing and hypoglycemia-related adaptations of the autonomic nervous system. However, how intracellular signaling modalities within VMH neurons bring about physiological and pathological responses to the changing glucose environment remains elusive. Our preliminary data revealed a temporal relationship between VMH neuronal mitochondrial dynamics and phenotypic characteristics of glucose fluctuation-induced responses in mice. Our preliminary results suggest that mitochondrial proteins, including uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and Dynamin- related peptide 1 (DRP1) are involved in cellular adaptions of VMH neurons to glucose level alterations, and, that interference with these proteins in a VMH-specific manner affect whole body glucose metabolism. Because both of these proteins promoted mitochondrial fission in VMH neurons, we hypothesize that mitochondrial dynamics, with particular emphasis on mitochondrial fission, are crucial cellular biological processes in the VMH to control of whole body glucose metabolism. In this proposal, we aim to decipher mechanistic aspects of VMH mitochondrial dynamics in glucose control. Specifically, we hypothesize that UCP2 and DRP1 are important components in the central regulation of glucose metabolism. Their interaction is crucial to properly adjust VMH neuronal responses to shifts in glucose levels. We also predict that impaired glucose metabolism in diabetic mice is the consequence of increased fusion in VMH neurons. To test these hypotheses, we propose 3 Aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that UCP2 is sufficient and necessary in the VMH to regulate glucose metabolism. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that glucose-induced increased UCP2 induces mitochondrial fission mediated by DRP1 and this mechanism is critical in the central regulation of glucose metabolism. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that impaired glucose metabolism in diabetic mice is the consequence of increased mitochondrial fusion in VMH neurons and that interference with this mitochondrial mechanism in VMH neurons will improve whole body glucose metabolism in diabetic mice. The execution of these studies will deliver novel insights into central regulation of whole body glucose metabolism and offer novel avenues to combat diabetes by targeting brain mitochondrial dynamics."
"9306860","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conformational dynamics plays a fundamental role in the regulation of molecular recognition and statistical mechanics provides the framework to derive a comprehensive theory for the binding free energy of a ligand to a protein. Our goal is to develop models of sufficient accuracy to be predictive for thermodynamic and kinetic properties, but also as important, to generate qualitative insights about the molecular mechanisms for binding and allosteric conformational transitions. We have three specific aims: (1) to develop new methods based on principles of statistical mechanics and molecular simulations for mapping the complex landscapes for protein conformational transitions and ligand binding. Working with our collaborators we will use these methods to (2) determine the structural basis for kinase family selectivity and regulation by small molecules, and (3) to determine the allosteric basis for inhibition of HIV-1 proteins and mechanisms of drug resistance. 1. Mapping Complex Landscapes for Protein Conformational Transitions and Ligand Binding We have established our novel physics based binding free energy model (BEDAM) as the top one for predicting binding on a scale of many dozens to a few hundred ligands to a receptor. We describe new adaptive sampling schemes based on replica exchange and Markov State Models, in order to organize, quantify and visualize the free energy landscapes and pathways on these landscapes for the projects which are the focus of specific aims two and three. Our effective potential development work is based on the AGBNP2 implicit solvent model. We will continue to work with both implicit and explicit solvent representations through the development of a new thermodynamic cycle which uses the best of both representations. 2. The Structural Basis for Kinase Selectivity and Regulation by Small Molecules The human kinome encodes about 518 kinases (PKs) which constitute one of the largest class of genes. Progress in kinase structural biology offers a conceptual framework for understanding many aspects of kinase biology. With our collaborators at the Fox Chase Cancer Center we are working on biophysical simulation and evolutionary sequence based approaches to rationalize biochemical profiling studies of kinases and to devise a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms of selectivity of kinase inhibitors to their targets. We will address this problem from both a ligand centric and kinase centric perspective. 3. Allosteric Basis for Inhibition of HIV-1 Proteins and Mechanisms of Drug Resistance With our collaborators at the Scripps Research Institute and Ohio State University we are working on structure based inhibitor design and the acquisition of resistance to inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase and protease. We will use binding free energy and other simulation methods to analyze the basis for inhibition of allosteric integrase inhibitors which bind at the integrase core domain (CCD) dimer interface and occupy the binding pocket of the LEDGF cofactor binding site. We will work with a new class of protease inhibitors discovered by our Scripps collaborators that bind at the so called protease exo-site. We will work with our collaborators to develop effective potentials that can incorporate the effects of solvation and waters bound at the receptors in ways that are well motivated physically, fast to compute, and accurate in the sense of discriminating the correct from incorrect binding pose."
"9364253","SUMMARY Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of bone marrow plasma cells preceded by a series of premalignant and transitional stages. Cells at all stages exhibit significant genomic aberrations, the sources of which are not well understood. This has left a major gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive MM initiation and progression, a gap that this proposal is designed to fill. Recent evidence suggests that cytidine deaminases?enzymes that convert cytosine to uracil in DNA?are important culprits in genomic instability in MM. One important example is the activation induced deaminase, AID, which initiates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination but which also mutates many regions of the B cell genome and causes translocations similar to those found in MM. The related APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases can also mutate DNA, and numerous findings link AID and APOBEC3 enzymes to genome instability and mutations in MM. Our preliminary data demonstrate that MM cells express APOBEC3B, C, D, F and G, with APOBEC3B being expressed particularly strongly. Interestingly, APOBEC3B has recently been implicated in genome instability in breast cancer. We further find that expression of AID and certain APOBEC3 enzymes increases levels of DNA strand breaks in MM cells. Based on this, we hypothesize that AID and APOBEC3 family enzymes are a major cause of genomic aberrations and disease progression in MM. Recent findings provide a strong link between lipid disregulation, immune activation, and MM, with as much as a third of the clonal gammopathies found in MM patients reacting to lipids. Hence, an important overall guiding hypothesis of our work is that chronic B cell activation arising from elevated levels of inflammatory lipids contributes to increased activity of AID/APOBEC3 and MM disease progression. We systematically test these hypotheses in three Aims. In Aim 1, we determine the extent to which AID/APOBEC3 enzymes, alone and in concert, contribute to biochemical and molecular measures of nuclear deaminase activity and genomic damage. In Aim 2, we determine how these deaminases are regulated, revealing those regions of the MM genome that are susceptible to mutation, DNA breaks, and translocations due to their action. Finally, in Aim 3 we use established and novel mouse model systems and MM and its premalignant stage propagated in humanized mice to assess the in vivo effects of inflammatory lipids on the expression/activity of AID/APOBEC3 factors, DNA damage and mutation of the MM genome, and clonal evolution of MM. Together, the proposed experiments will provide a comprehensive picture of the activity, targeting, and outcome of cytidine deaminase action in MM, with broad implications for disease pathogenesis."
"9370492","Abstract MRI has potential to significantly improve breast cancer screening, particularly for women with dense breasts and women who are at higher than average risk for breast cancer. However, improvements in diagnostic accuracy are needed before MRI can be used to screen large numbers of women. The abbreviated MRI scan (AB-MRI) designed by Kuhl and colleagues is a very promising approach to MRI- screening, but relies on a single T1-weighted scan post contrast injection to evaluate enhancement. The lack of information regarding contrast media uptake kinetics may reduce diagnostic accuracy. The research proposed here will test the hypothesis that addition of ultrafast MRI to AB-MRI improves diagnostic accuracy. We propose that AB-MRI combined with ultrafast DCE-MRI can provide effective screening with at a reasonable cost, and with minimal inconvenience for patients. This would result in reliable detection of clinically significant breast cancer years earlier than current screening methods, and thus significantly reduce morbidity and mortality due to breast cancer. A national ECOG-ACRIN clinical trial of AB-MRI screening will begin in late 2016. The basic protocol for this trial is a 10 minute scan with a single post-contrast T1-weighted scan. However, based on results from this lab, the leaders of the ECOG ACRIN trial strongly support inclusion of quantitative ultrafast DCE-MRI in AB-MRI at UChicago (please see the letter of support from the Chair). We propose to: 1. Optimize ultrafast DCE-MRI integrated into AB-MRI with total duration of less than 10 minutes. The ultrafast DCE-MRI scan will have time resolution of less than 3 seconds per image. 2. Develop quantitative analysis of ultrafast data to measure time of initial enhancement (TIE), quantitative Ktrans measurements based on a simplified computational approach, lesion transfer function (LTF) and lesion transit Time(LTT). In addition, we will measure the initial kinetics of lesion enhancement texture. 3. Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pharmacokinetic parameters from DCE-MRI. Data will be analyzed in two stages. First, we will use data that is currently being acquired at UChicago to identify the most promising parameters from ultrafast DCE-MRI for further evaluation. Second, we will evaluate the most promising parameters in a ?testing group?. ROC analysis will be used to determine whether parameters from ultrafast imaging can increase the diagnostic accuracy of MRI screening. 4. Compare the diagnostic accuracy of AB-MRI with and without ultrafast DCE-MRI, using both a Reader study and quantitative analysis. New ultrafast DCE-MRI, integrated into AB-MRI scans will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality due to breast cancer, while significantly reducing costs and increasing efficiency."
"9276714","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a framework for understanding the way in which membrane proteins expressed on pathogen cell membranes mediate the interactions of pathogens with their human host. We focus on Ail (attachment invasion locus), a protein expressed in the outer cell membrane of the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is the causative agent of plague. The Y. pestis bacterium is highly pathogenic, spreads rapidly and causes extremely high human mortality. Although it is sensitive to a restricted panel of antibiotics, the potential weaponization of aerolized bacteria with bio-engineered antibiotic resistance and the lack of an effective vaccine or therapy are major concerns, contributing to its classification as a Tier 1 Biothreat Agent. Ail is a key bacterial virulence factor and a prime candidate for therapeutic development due to its functions in mediating bacterial adhesion to host cells, and promoting bacterial resistance to human immunity. This project focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of these key functions of Ail by determining its three-dimensional structure and structurally characterizing the interactions of Ail with its human ligands. These studies will focus on samples of Ail and its complexes incorporated in detergent-free lipid bilayer membranes because the biological activity of Ail is dramatically altered in the presence of micellar detergents. Furthermore, these studies will utilize NMR spectroscopy, a method adept at characterizing both structure and dynamics, because the extracellular loops of Ail that mediate the interactions with host are highly dynamic. Finally, these studies will complement the experimental data generated for Ail in lipid bilayer membranes, by developing computational methods tailored specifically for NMR structural analysis of integral membrane proteins within their functional environment of the phospholipid bilayer membrane. The methods will be designed to facilitate structure determination and increase structural quality, and they will be integrated with widely used programs for programs for NMR structure calculations so as to broaden the impact of our work."

"9277245","PROJECT III - HORMONAL AND INTRARENAL MECHANISMS OF POSTMENOPAUSAL HYPERTENSION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Women who had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hyperandrogenemia during their reproductive years have hypertension as they transition through menopause. Hyperandrogenemia in postmenopausal women (PMW), who have had PCOS when young, is also characterized by increased central adiposity and insulin resistance. While hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor (1,2), the humoral and intra-renal mechanisms whereby hyperandrogenemia in PMW leads to hypertension has not been elucidated (3,4). We recently characterized a novel model, the postmenopausal hyperandrogenemic female (PMHAF) rat, by treating rats with dihydrotestosterone from weaning to 13-14 mos of age. PMHAF exhibit hypertension, increased adiposity, and metabolic abnormalities, that are similar to hyperandrogenemic PMW. Our overall goal is to use this novel model to investigate potential integrative neuro humoral and renal mechanisms whereby chronic hyperandrogenemia reduces renal excretory function and increases blood pressure (BP) in PMW. We have preliminary data that PMHAF exhibit activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin- angiotensin system and increased renal microvascular 20-HETE synthesis (5,6).  Based on strong preliminary data, in the proposed studies, we will test the following hypotheses: hypertension in PMHAF occurs via: 1) activation of the renal sympathetic nervous system, mediated via increased adiposity and melanocortin-4-receptor activity in the brain; 2) increased vascular 20-HETE, a vasoconstrictor, due to androgen-induced CYP4A2 omega-hydroxylase activity; and 3) increased renin- angiotensin system activity. Renin-angiotensin activation and increased 20-HETE together would cause increases in renal vascular resistance which in turn shifts renal pressure natriuresis to the right causing hypertension. The combination of renin-angiotensin system activation and renal sympathetic nervous activation would also cause reductions in pressure-natriuresis leading to hypertension.  We will test these integrative hypotheses, using a combination of unique animal models (our PMHAF), novel transgenic rats (MC4R null and CYP4A2 null), and state-of-the art physiological, pharmacological, and molecular approaches in the following specific aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that hypertension in PMHAF is due in part to MC3/4R-mediated activation of the renal sympathetic nervous system; 2) To test the hypothesis that hypertension in PMHAF is due to increased 20-HETE via androgen-mediated increases in CYP4A2 omega-hydroxylase; 3) To test the hypothesis that hypertension in PMHAF is due to activation of the renin- angiotensin system, via androgen-mediated increases in angiotensinogen, renin substrate, and/or renal sympathetically-mediated increases in renin activity. Completion of these studies will provide novel information for improved therapeutic options for hyperandrogenemic postmenopausal women, a population that is undertreated and understudied."
"9266204","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to study the relation between exposure to metals-in both early life and adult life-and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether those exposures are associated with changes in levels of amyloid-? species (A?) in blood and brain. We will conduct a case-control study with an estimated 183 cases and 270 controls recruited from the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Bedford VA Medical Center (Bedford VA). Furthermore, we propose to additionally examine whether early and later life metal exposures are associated with worse cognitive function among the controls. The Bedford VA provides a uniquely suited setting in which to conduct this research as the facility serves AD patients and has a dental clinic on-site from which we can recruit appropriate controls with availability of tooth samples. The source population for both cases and controls are veterans in the Bedford, MA area. In addition, essentially all clinical AD cases go to autopsy, thus case status can be confirmed neuropathologically and brain tissue can be collected for analyses. Early life exposure to metals will be assessed by measuring metals in adult tooth enamel (using laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). Controls will be recruited from the Bedford VA dental clinic when they are having a tooth extracted for other reasons, and teeth will be collected from cases if they are having a tooth extracted for other reasons while alive, or at autopsy. Adult exposure to lead (Pb) will also be measured with the non-invasive K-shell X-ray Fluorescence (KXRF) technique with which we have extensive past experience. A? species will be measured in blood samples collected at study visits and temporal cortex brain tissue collected at autopsy. Cognitive function will be tested among the controls at their study visit. This study will be the first to examine the association between adult exposure to metals and AD using biomarkers of exposure, and the first of any kind to explore the association between early life metal exposures and AD in humans-a hypothesis suggested for Pb exposure from animal research, but essentially untestable in humans without the biomarker of such early exposure that teeth can provide."
"9304242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to further develop the method of femtosecond nanocrystallography for the structure determination of membrane proteins. 30% of the human proteome consist of membrane proteins, which control and mediate the interaction between cells, regulate transport in and out of the cells and are also the major players in bioenergy conversion. Their importance for human health is overwhelming, with 60% of all current drugs being targeted to membrane proteins. Femtosecond crystallography is a new method for X-ray structure analysis of biological macromolecules, where hundreds of thousands of X-ray diffraction snapshots are collected from a stream of fully hydrated nano/microcrystals of proteins, using femtosecond X-ray pulses from a Free Electron Laser. The peak flux of an X-ray FEL is 109 times higher than the flux from a 3rd generation Synchrotron. While the X-ray pulses are so strong that they destroy any solid material, X-ray diffraction occurs before the biomolecules are destroyed. New developments in nanocrystal growth and characterization, together with development of new injector technology and data evaluation methods have progressed the new method of SFX at a very fast pace based on results from this project which has led to 16 publications, 9 of them in Nature of Science journals and one patent (pending). The proposal is focused on four major aims which include the development of new methods for nanocrystal growth and characterization (aim 1), innovations on new crystal sorting and Injector technology (aim 2), further development of data analysis methods including de novo phasing of SFX data (aim 3) and determination of membrane protein structures with SFX and new avenues for time-resolved SFX (aim 4). The goal is to open a new era in Structural Biology, where SFX is developed and used to solve challenging membrane protein structures. The development of time resolved SFX will provide new milestones towards the final goal to determine molecular movies of membrane proteins in action."
"9448665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Affective anxiety is characterized by behavioral inhibition accompanied by autonomic arousal and vigilance, reflecting a future-oriented emotional state that is generated by perceived threat. Identification of neural circuits that underlie anxiety in animal models is essential for understanding neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to normative and pathological anxiety in humans. Basic and clinical research has emphasized the importance of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) and the anterolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (alBST) in regulating the affective and physiological components of anxiety. The CEA and alBST are heavily interconnected via GABAergic and corticotropin releasing-factor expressing neurons, and share many common sources of input, including input from interoceptive (i.e., visceral sensory) brainstem nuclei. Interoceptive feedback from body to brain strongly modulates emotional state, and can elicit anxiety in the absence of environmental threat. The proposed research will test new hypotheses regarding the anxiogenic role of a neurochemically discrete interoceptive pathway that targets the CEA-alBST, arising from hindbrain neurons that express glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1). GLP1 neurons occupy the most caudal (visceral) portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract (cNST) and medullary reticular formation, where they receive direct and relayed input from visceral sensory afferents. GLP1 axon terminals target CEA-alBST subregions that express CRF and GLP1-receptor(R). GLP1 administered centrally or directly into the CEA increases anxiety-like behavior in rats, whereas anxiety is attenuated after central GLP1-R antagonism. Our pilot data demonstrate that GLP1 neurons are robustly activated in rats after ethologically relevant anxiogenic threats that also activate CRF-rich regions of the lateral (la)CEA and fusiform nucleus of the alBST (BSTfu), where GLP1 fibers are present. Further, manipulation of interoceptive state by fasting rats overnight blocks the ability of anxiogenic threat to recruit GLP1 neurons, and also significantly attenuates anxiety-like behavior. Based on these and other data, we posit that GLP1 signaling facilitates CEA-mediated inhibition of GABAergic tone within the oval nucleus of the alBST (BSTov), thereby contributing to the disinhibition of BST outflow posited to model many aspects of generalized anxiety disorder.  The proposed work will define and manipulate GLP1 inputs to the CEA-alBST in adult male Sprague- Dawley rats to test our hypothesis that anxiety-like behavior is increased by endogenous GLP1 signaling from the cNST to the CEA-alBST. To challenge this central hypothesis and to explore underlying mechanisms, proposed experiments are organized into two Specific Aims. The first Aim will characterize the synaptic arrangement of GLP1 axonal inputs to anatomically-defined targets within the CEA and alBST, in order to test the hypothesis that GLP1 neurons are synaptically linked to CRF-positive laCEA neurons that innervate the BSTov. We also will test the hypothesis that GLP1 axon terminals form excitatory synaptic inputs to the dendrites/soma and axon terminals of laCEA neurons that innervate CRF neurons in the BSTov, and to the dendrites/soma of CRF neurons within BSTfu. Anatomical data will be supplemented by ex vivo acute slice physiology experiments that will record from laCEA, BSTov, and BSTfu neurons with known axonal projections to investigate their responses to a GLP1 analogue. The second Aim will probe the anxiogenic importance of endogenous GLP1 signaling to the CEA-alBST, to test the hypothesis that chronic knockdown of GLP1 expression by cNST neurons will attenuate anxiety-like behavior and alter CEA-alBST neural responses to anxiogenic threat. We also will test the hypothesis that anxiety-like behavior will be attenuated in rats after chronic knockdown of GLP1-R expression by CEA neurons and/or BSTfu neurons."
"9265095","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling evidence that glaucomatous damage to the macula occurs even in early stages of the disease. The macula comprises about 30% of all retinal ganglion cells and its information corresponds to over 50% of the visual cortex. However, glaucomatous damage to the macula is often missed in clinical practice. Some of the reasons are: 1) traditional glaucoma knowledge supports that glaucoma is fundamentally a peripheral disease; 2) inherent limitations of conventional clinical tests to detect damage to the macula; and 3) the paucity of large, prospective studies that describe the nature of glaucomatous damage to the macula. Our group has published numerous papers in the past two years showing that macular damage is prevalent among patients with early glaucoma if one employs the appropriate tools to assess it, namely 10-2 visual fields and high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT). This information comes from a unique prospective cross- sectional database and techniques we developed to produce objective metrics of structure and function. Now that we understand the cross-sectional nature of macular damage, this proposal aims to: 1) develop a longitudinal database including patients with early glaucoma and healthy controls, 2) to test models that explain progression of macular damage, and 3) to apply new statistical methods combining structural and functional tests which could improve the accuracy to detect progression and shorten the length of clinical trials. Our main hypothesis is that incorporating 10-2 visual field testing and high-resolution OCT scans of the macula to the conventional repertoire of technologies used in clinical practice, in addition to translating recently described statistical methods into softwares that can be used in daily practice, enhances the performance and confidence to detect glaucoma progression. In Aim 1 we plan to follow healthy subjects and glaucoma patients at regular intervals with 10-2, 24-2 visual fields, and swept source (ss) OCT tests and define metrics of short- and long-term test variability that are needed to differentiate true progression from 'noise'. To date, there is no such database combining these technologies. In Aim 2 we plan to combine metrics of structure and function from this longitudinal database using two methods: a spatial approach, which will ultimately produce a joint structure-function index using 10-2 and ssOCT data; and a temporal approach, which will employ Bayesian statistics to measure rates of progression using trend analysis. By the end of the study, our contributions to the field should be: 1) to make available a unique and pristine longitudinal database that could be used for other hypotheses testing, 2) to translate techniques recently described in the literature into objective tools to be readily useful in clinicl practice, and 3) to mitigate the burdens of progressive loss of central vision in glaucoma."
"9313262","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that affects 3-4% of the adult population and progresses to cirrhosis in 15-20% of affected subjects. There is currently no approved therapy for NASH and the only accurate method to diagnose this condition is a liver biopsy which is invasive, painful and occasionally associated with mortality. The lack of a point-of-care diagnostic tool to diagnose NASH, to assess disease progression versus regression and response to various therapeutics is considered by many to be the most important barrier towards large scale identification of affected individuals and for drug-development against NASH. This proposal represents a multi-PI effort to develop a lipidomics-based biomarker panel to fill these gaps in knowledge. Dr. Sanyal (PI) from the NIDDK NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) will lead this effort and Dr. Dennis (Co-PI) who previously led the NIGMS LIPID_MAPS consortium will lead the lipid analysis. The NASH CRN data coordinating center (DCC) will continue to serve as the DCC for this proposal. The studies will draw from the NASH CRN biorepository which contains plasma drawn at the time of a liver biopsy from over 2000 highly phenotyped subjects with NAFLD. Three specific aims will test the hypothesis that changes in lipid metabolism in NAFLD allow identification of a circulating lipid signature diagnostic of NASH, disease progression and response to specific therapies. Aim 1 will define and validate a circulating lipid profile diagnostic of underlying NASH and its severity. A model building cohort and two validation cohorts will be studied. The model building cohort will include subjects with and without NAFLD. The validation cohort will include: (1) a group of subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD and age, gender, race and weight-matched controls without NAFLD, and (2) a prospective group of subjects in a real-world setting who are going to receive a clinically-indicated liver biopsy for suspected NASH. Aim 2 will define changes in circulating lipids diagnostic of disease progression in NASH. This will be accomplished by performing lipidomic analyses on plasma drawn at the time of baseline liver biopsies in a cohort of subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD who have undergone two or more liver biopsies. Aim 3 will define the circulating lipid signature associated with treatment-induced improvement of NASH. This will utilize unique sample-sets obtained during protocol-driven biopsies from subjects enrolled in clinical trials by the NASH CRN. The studies will further innovate by applying the state-of-the-art analytic platforms developed by LIPID_MAPS for diagnostics development for NASH. Preliminary data support the feasibility of the proposed studies and aims. These studies will meet all of the quality metrics for accuracy assessment of diagnostics (QUADAS) and will have a strong positive impact on the field by allowing development of a diagnostic platform that will permit point of care evaluation of NASH. This will enhance access to care and eventually improve the health of the people thereby aligning with the mission of the NIH."
"9277250","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-site systems intervention for unemployed persons with social anxiety The goal of the proposed research is to conduct a multi-site trial of a cognitive-behavioral intervention for enhancing employment success among unemployed persons whose job attainment efforts have been undermined by social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder is a very common and impairing condition, with negative impacts on occupational functioning. Work-related impairments include turning down job offers and promotions, reduced productivity and job performance, lowered educational attainment, increased unemployment, financial dependence, and reduced income. We have shown that social anxiety disorder was the strongest psychiatric predictor of sustained reliance on welfare for support. In response to these documented employment-related impairments, we produced an eight-session work-related group cognitive behavioral therapy (WCBT) that, when coupled with standard vocational rehabilitation services, significantly improved social anxiety, depression, job search behaviors and job search self-confidence compared to a control group of socially anxious jobs seekers who received only vocational services as usual (VAU).  Participants in this pilot R34 study were all homeless, primarily African American, urban-based job-seekers with high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and limited education and employment histories. WCBT is designed in a context and style that overcomes accessibility and stigma-related obstacles with special focus on employment-related targets. The current collaborative RO1 will involve two academic, investigative teams and the staff of two community-based employment service agencies to further evaluate WCBT compared to VAU.  This two-region study will address whether WCBT enhances job placement and retention assessed over a one-year interval. In addition, this trial will test the implementation of WCBT in a new vocational service agency that was not involved in the development of WCBT, and whether the effects of WCBT generalize to a new population of urban-based, racially diverse job-seekers with educational and educational histories that differ from the original WCBT study site. We will also investigate the system effects of WCBT in the new site that will be informative for broad implementation of WCBT nationwide. Finally, as an innovative extension from the R34, this project will incorporate implementation tools of technology-assisted provider training and delivery of WCBT."
"9346766","Project Summary Abstract Sudden cardiac death is a major cause of death around the world, with nearly 450,000 sudden deaths per year in the United States. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most frequent direct cause. The most common strategy for terminating VF is with a single, large, biphasic high-energy (HE) electric shock by an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Despite their effectiveness, there have been increasing concerns with current ICD high- energy therapy, due to cardiac tissue damage likely a result of high voltage shocks and pain caused by inappropriate shocks. Redesign and optimization of shock waveforms is critical for developing a low-energy defibrillator that will be more acceptable to patients and clinicians. We aim to develop implantable low-energy defibrillators to address unmet needs for treating cardiac rhythm disorders. The ?virtual electrode polarization? (VEP) concept has been proposed as a mechanism responsible for termination of atrial fibrillation (AF) and demonstrated in experimental optical mapping studies in vitro and in vivo. Recent canine studies and human results have revealed that Unpinning Termination (UPT) therapy for atrial fibrillation significantly lowers the energy required for atrial defibrillation. Mechanistically it is explained as: (1) unpinning of reentrant wave fronts that maintain AF, (2) preventing re-pinning of wave fronts to tissue heterogeneities, such as scars, and (3) annihilating remaining wave fronts not self extinguished. The unpinning stage uses multiple pulses to unpin the reentry from the stabilizing resistive heterogeneity. The applied electric field creates stronger VEP at tissue heterogeneities, which causes excitation and then unpinning of the reentry. More recent animal findings from Cardialen?s Phase I STTR project indicate that UPT therapy is also highly effective as ventricular tachycardia (VT) therapy. To deliver and test this novel method clinically, an efficient cardioverter system is proposed in this Phase II SBIR project. Following development of this system, this Phase II SBIR project aims to confirm that UPT therapy can terminate ATP-refractory VT and VF with low energy in humans. It is anticipated that the proposed new study in humans will confirm fundamentally important insights into the hypothesis that multiple phased low-energy shocks can safely terminate ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. We expect the study will be a big step forward from the ?VEP and unpinning? theory to ventricular defibrillator clinical development. If the enhanced research UPT therapy system is proven effective and safe for terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias, it should advance commercial product development of low-energy multiple pulse implantable defibrillator devices and will also encourage a higher percentage of eligible patients to consider this life-saving treatment."

"9302570","Project Summary/Abstract Humans and other animals learn and store sophisticated models of the causal relationships that govern their interactions with the world. Such internal models are likely critical for transforming ambiguous and delayed sensory data into stable perceptions and coordinated movements. For example, distinguishing external sensory input from those that are self-generated could be accomplished via an internal model that predicts the sensory consequences of an animal?s own motor commands. Despite their potential importance for both normal brain function and neurological disorders, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models are actually implemented in neural circuits. This renewal proposal applies a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches to a model system?the weakly electric fish?with unique advantages for addressing this question. Our previous studies of electric fish were successful in developing a detailed mechanistic model of how neurons at the first stage of processing in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) predict and cancel out the effects of the fish?s own electric organ discharge (EOD). However, these studies considered a highly simplified version of the true problem facing the electrosensory system. Under natural conditions, electrosensory inputs vary moment-to-moment depending both on the movements of the fish (i.e. the position of the electric organ in the tail versus electroreceptors on the skin) and the temporal pattern of EOD motor commands emitted by the fish. Solving this problem requires a more complex internal model, akin to those believed to be generated in the mammalian brain. In addition, past models ignored key features of ELL circuitry, such as plasticity of inhibitory synapses, which likely play key functional roles (both in ELL and in other vertebrate brain circuits). By addressing these issues the proposed research will provide general insights into how neural circuits contribute to distinguishing self-generated from external stimuli. The proposed studies will also provide direct links between neural representations, well-defined circuitry, synaptic plasticity, and a behaviorally relevant systems level function. Though forging such links is a primary goal of neuroscience, there are still relatively few cases in which they can actually be made."
"9378307","Long term synaptic plasticity is an experience-dependent increase or decrease in the strength of synaptic transmission that can last for at least an hour, if not days or longer. The mechanisms underlying long term potentiation and depression of synaptic strength depend on the particular region of the CNS and the type of synapse within the region. Both potentiation and depression are thought to provide information storage in the CNS, i.e., underlie learning and memory. At many types of synapses, the glutamate-gated ion channel NMDA receptor is involved in the induction process, if not the expression mechanism. While the location of these NMDA receptors at the best studied model synapse, that between Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, is almost certainly the postsynaptic membrane, there are other synapses in which it appears that the important NMDA receptors are in the presynaptic membrane. This is particular evident for the induction of long term depression in the somatosensory cortex at the synapse between the layer 4 spiny stellate neuron, the neuron that receives the largest direct input from the thalamus, and the layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron. We have found, however, that this may not be the case but rather that the required NMDA receptors are postsynaptic, in the layer 2/3 dendrites. The objective of this proposal is to reassess the mechanism(s) of expression of long term depression, i.e., is the decrease in synaptic strength the result of a decrease in presynaptic release of glutamate or a decrease in the postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate, for example, a decrease in receptor number. We will use whole cell recording in conjunction with 2 photon laser scanning microscopy and 2 photon glutamate uncaging in acute slices of mouse somatosensory cortex to address this issue."
"9282414","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that cause denervation of aged neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and how exercise ameliorates NMJ denervation in aging. In the elderly, progressive denervation of NMJs decreases neuromuscular function, decreases quality of life from frailty, and increases the risk of falling and fractures. However, there are knowledge gaps about the molecular mechanisms that underlie NMJ denervation in aging and how exercise ameliorates this condition. Our long-term goal is to elucidate these mechanisms and to identify new intervention strategies to improve neuromuscular function in the elderly. Here, we hypothesize that an age-related loss of synaptic vesicle release sites - active zones - causes NMJ denervation, and that exercise ameliorates this denervation by restoring active zones at the aged NMJs. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our published and preliminary data that strongly suggest that age-related loss of active zone organizer laminin ?2 causes active zone depletion and NMJ denervation, and that exercise restores active zones and NMJ innervations by increasing laminin ?2 protein expression. Furthermore, these data are firmly supported by our published studies showing the molecular mechanism that organizes NMJ active zones involves interactions between laminin ?2, a specific receptor for laminin ?2 (presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, VDCC), and the active zone protein Bassoon. The specific aims for testing the hypothesis are as follows: (1) Elucidate molecular defects that cause denervation of aged NMJs and how exercise ameliorates the defects. Aged and exercised aged rodents will be analyzed using confocal + super resolution microscopy; (2) Test the hypothesis that exercise maintains aged NMJs by increasing laminin ?2 expression level using transgenic mice; and (3) Evaluate systemic effects of a novel calcium channel agonist on neuromuscular function of aged mice using electrophysiology, electromyography, and behavior tests. This project is innovative because it is based on a novel, untested concept, namely the causality of active zone integrity in NMJ denervation. It is thus distinct from current aging research approaches. Another innovation is the testing of a novel calcium channel agonist specific for the P/Q-type VDCC that was invented by the Co-PI. The significance of this project is that it will yield: (i) the molecular mechanisms of NMJ denervation in aging, (ii) the exercise activated mechanism that ameliorates NMJ denervation in aging, and (iii) a VDCC agonist that may function as an intervention for age-related neuromuscular dysfunction and potentially as an exercise mimetic. Cross-disciplinary investigators from developmental and aging neurobiology, electrophysiology, gerontology, imaging, nephrology, and physiology fields have been assembled for this project."
"9160613","The average age for a woman to have her first child has been increasing for the last three decades in the United States, making our understanding of ovarian aging and its negative effect on the ovarian reserve?a measure of the capacity of the ovary to produce eggs capable of fertilization?increasingly important. Yet, we know very little about other factors in reproductive-age women that might affect the ovarian reserve, beyond aging itself. This proposal, titled Study of Ovarian Aging and Reserve in Young Women (SOAR), seeks to address the significant gap in our knowledge of factors?particularly modifiable factors?that affect ovarian reserve and might accelerate its decrease in young women. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the ongoing NIEHS Study of Environment, Lifestyle and Fibroids (SELF), which is following a cohort of 1,696 African- American women between the ages of 23-34 years over a five-year period. In this group of young women, we will assess changes in the ovarian reserve by tracking three different measures of the ovarian reserve: anti- Müllerian hormone (AMH), early follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and antral follicle count (AFC). In addition to collecting survey data, we will also perform oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements to more precisely determine the roles of glucose metabolism and obesity on the ovarian reserve. The results of our study will be clinically significant as we currently have limited longitudinal data for counseling women on risk factors for decreased ovarian reserve. Our study design is innovative in that we will use overlapping measures of the ovarian reserve and group-based trajectory modeling to determine correlates associated with decreased ovarian reserve. Specifically, we will determine the demographic, health-behavior, reproductive, and environmental factors associated with decreased AMH (as a measure of the ovarian reserve) over time (Aim 1), determine the association between various measures of obesity and decreased ovarian reserve (Aim 2), and determine the association between glucose dysregulation and decreased ovarian reserve (Aim 3). The proposed prospective longitudinal cohort study will determine the natural history of and factors associated with the change in ovarian reserve over time. Further, it will add to the extremely limited data by generating the largest set of longitudinal data on AMH and ovarian reserve in the United States to date, which will benefit all women."
"9329077","PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiometabolic diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major causes of death and morbidity in all societies. These and other metabolic diseases have common etiological insults, including dyslipidemia, the pathological elevation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and treating these risk factors has been shown to reduce disease burden and progression. While statins effectively lower LDL-C, many people are intolerant to their adverse effects and these drugs may not address the residual vascular risk conferred by other proatherogenic lipoproteins such as TRLs, including very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). VLDLs are precursors to LDL that are synthesized and secreted from the liver to provide triglycerides to peripheral tissues, and thus one underexplored potential avenue for reducing TRL-mediated dyslipidemia is to curb hepatic VLDL secretion. The regulation of VLDL secretion is complex and incompletely understood. Apolipoprotein B (apoB), the key protein component of VLDL, is synthesized in the hepatocyte under tight post-transcriptional control by multiple regulatory pathways, and secreted from the hepatocyte into the circulation to provide nutrition in the form of triglycerides to peripheral tissues. The precise coordination of the pathways governing the fate of apoB as matures into secreted VLDL particles, especially in post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments, is poorly known. A novel gene arising from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for plasma lipid traits is the SORT1 gene, encoding sortilin, a ubiquitously expressed multi-ligand sorting receptor. Our laboratory previously established SORT1 as the causal gene at the genomic locus associated with plasma cholesterol and CAD and demonstrated that sortilin negatively regulates VLDL-apoB secretion. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying sortilin?s regulation of apoB metabolism and VLDL secretion remain unknown. The precise understanding of how sortilin regulates lipoprotein metabolism and cardiometabolic risk may have important therapeutic implications. The goal of this fellowship proposal is thus to fully elucidate the mechanisms and coordination of VLDL-apoB metabolism by sortilin in the liver and the heart. Specifically, Dr. Conlon will investigate the hypothesis that hepatic sortilin regulates the post-ER fate of apoB for degradation and export to combat lipid overload and secretory stress and that sortilin functions to coordinate intracellular apoB metabolism in response to the number and quality of apoB particles that reach the Golgi and the level of post-ER pre-secretory proteolysis (PERPP) activity. To test this hypothesis, Sort1 liver specific knockout mice and in vitro hepatocyte models will be utilized in the presence of various stressors. Additionally, she will explore how apoB secretion might protect cardiomyocytes from lipotoxicity and the role of sortilin in regulating cardiac apoB secretion. This proposal also aims train Dr. Conlon in new techniques and provide mentoring to allow her to transition into an independent investigator with a career in academics."
"9248323","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I and VII are lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficient activity of alpha- L-iduronidase and beta-glucuronidase, respectively, which are enzymes required for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Current enzyme replacement therapy in patients with MPS disorders does not effectively treat the brain. It is also expensive ($300,000 a year for life) and inconvenient (weekly intravenous injections). In ongoing studies, our laboratories have investigated therapeutic regimens that can ameliorate disease in the canine models of MPS I and VII, which are naturally occurring diseases that faithfully recapitulate the human disorders. Dogs and children have central nervous system (CNS) disease, as well as corneal clouding, cardiac valve disease, aortic dilatation, and progressive gait abnormalities due to skeletal dysostosis. Although our current neonatal intravenous gamma retroviral gene therapy strategy provided constant, very high levels (to 65-fold normal) of circulating enzyme and somewhat reduced lysosomal storage in the brain at 1 year after transduction, there are concerns for insertional mutagenesis limiting clinical trials.  The central feature of this grant proposal, which merges R01-funded studies in MPS VII dogs (DK54481) with those in MPS I dogs (DK66448), is to administer four viral vectors (AAV9, AAVrh10, and two lentiviral vectors) into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and determine if these can reduce evidence of lysosomal storage disease in MPS dogs. These vectors have produced significant transduction in the CNS in mice, but none have been tested therapeutically via injection into the CSF in a large animal model for any of the more than 50 lysosomal storage diseases known in children. This hypothesis will be tested in dogs because such experiments will determine the scale-up feasibility and be able to evaluate the persistence of the therapeutic effect and long-term safety in a long-lived species prior to translation to human patients. The ability to target the CNS without injecting vector directly into the brain parenchyma would be a significant and important advancement for treating the 60% of lysosomal storage diseases that are neurotropic.  Finally, this proposal will test the hypothesis that a combination of a neonatal intravenous and intra-CSF injection of the best of these 4 vectors will provide an effective therapy for the CNS and somatic tissue lesions. Importantly, these treatments can serve as a paradigm for the other MPS syndromes and the entire class of lysosomal storage diseases. The development of effective and safe therapy will have a dramatic and positive impact on the lives of patients and the families that care for them."
"9270084","PROJECT SUMMARY Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that manifests in midlife with motor, cognitive, and psychiatric deficits inexorably progressing to death within 15-20 years of onset. The abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene is the cause of the disease. Currently, no cure is available. The mechanism of mutant huntingtin (Htt) induced toxicity is still largely unclear. However, the subtle onset of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms long before motor impairment suggests that dysfunction of brain connections controlling emotional and behavioral response may characterize the early phases of the disease, giving a possible explanation to early symptoms and potential early intervention to defeat this devastating condition. White matter is composed of bundles of myelinated axons, which connect various grey matter areas of the brain to each other, and carry nerve impulses between neurons. Interestingly, white matter abnormality has been revealed as an early indicator in HD brain by neuroimaging. The key question is whether white matter abnormality is necessary for, or consequent to, the neurodegenerative process in HD. NG2 cells are a type of oligodendrocytes precursor cells (OPCs) which are abundant in mammalian brain and differentiated into oligodendrocytes, major component of white matter. Interestingly, NG2 cells also express ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, and form synapses with neurons, suggesting that these cells have profound functions that we realized so far. Whether mutant Htt alters NG2 cell property and whether NG2 cells expressing mutant Htt contribute to neurodegeneration remain elusive. We will take advantage of accessible PDGF?R-CreER;Z/EG mice from our collaborator, these mice inducibly express GFP in NG2 cells, we will determine the fate of NG2 cells in HD condition. Moreover, we will determine whether elimination of mutant Htt expression in NG2 cells or mature oligodendrocytes will attenuates neuropathology in HD mice. Our Specific Aims are: In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of mutant Htt on the oligodendrocyte lineage, we will examine proliferation, differentiation, survival of OPCs through in vivo genetic fate tracing. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that elimination of mutant Htt in NG2 cells will attenuate neurodegeneration and improve motor function in HD mice. By completion these two independent and complementary aims, a new role of NG2 cells and oligodendrocytes in HD condition will be revealed and the results will potentially lead to a new target for therapeutic development for HD."
"9281639","Approximately 500,000 individuals in the United States require kidney replacement therapy for end-stage  renal disease (ESRD), and over $40 billion are annually spent in hemodialysis (HD) and kidney transplant  treatments for these patients. Despite improvements in the HD technology, the mortality rate of HD patients  is still exceptionally high, with a 5-year survival rate of only 35%. Patients succumb to conditions that result  from the chronic inflammation caused by contact of the blood with the HD filters. This blood-filter interaction  can activate the complement system, which is a strong mediator of inflammatory processes. Although kidney  transplantation provides improved quality of life and survival rates over dialysis, the organ shortage and  compatibility issues limit the number of transplants performed worldwide. Also, the period of cold ischemia  observed during organ collection induces the activation of complement and inflammation, contributing to  graft rejection and loss in approximately 4% of the transplanted patients. Thus, inflammatory immune  responses are involved in several aspects of HD- and transplantation-related complications. Notably, recent  reports indicate promising effects of therapeutic inhibition of complement by modulating inflammatory  responses during HD and transplantation. This proposal therefore presents a comprehensive study to  investigate complement-mediated inflammatory mechanisms induced during HD and kidney transplantation  and evaluates a panel of complement inhibitors for their ability to attenuate such inflammatory processes.  Aim 1 will use an established extracorporeal circulation model in combination with biochemical, proteomic,  and cellular assays to dissect the complement pathways and effectors involved in the HD procedure and the  inflammatory networks triggered. The evaluation of blood from ESRD patients and the establishment of an in  vivo HD model in non-human primates will enhance the applicability of the results from this aim to clinical  situations. In Aim 2, similar biochemical and cellular assays will be used to dissect the complement pathways  and effectors involved during kidney ischemia and reperfusion, and the clinical potential of the complement  inhibitor compstatin to prevent organ rejection will be evaluated in an established non-human primate model  of ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. The results obtained are expected to: 1) provide a broad insight  into the impact of individual complement pathways and associated effector networks on the detrimental  processes that contribute to morbidity and mortality in HD and transplant patients, and 2) arrive at potent and  cost-effective treatment options for chronic inflammatory conditions in HD and kidney transplant patients  through the inhibition of complement."
"9291429","Project Summary/Abstract  Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is caused by pathogenic autoreactive T cells that recognize and destroy the islet tissue.  However, the presence of T cells reactive to self-antigens is not sufficient for disease to occur as autoreactive  T cells can be found in healthy control subjects; thus various means are available that control unwanted  responses. One of the most important mechanisms is the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which arise both  in thymus and in the peripheral immune system as a consequence of exposure to antigens. Defects in Treg  numbers, phenotype, and/or function have been described in T1D and other autoimmune diseases. Because  immunosuppression by Tregs specific for a limited number of Ags is dominant and can efficiently thwart a  polyclonal autoreactive response, Tregs are an attractive target for antigen-specific tolerogenic therapies.  However, the specificity and repertoire of Tregs recognizing self-Ags in humans and mice and whether  they are different in individuals with autoimmunity is unknown.  Recent studies have uncovered unique aspects of self-peptides presentation to autoreactive T cells by MHC  class II alleles predisposing to autoimmunity. These peculiarities potentially circumvent negative selection of  autoreactive T cells in the thymus and lead to autoreactivity in the target tissue. Given the well-known skewing  of the tTreg repertoire towards self-reactivity, biochemical complexities may affect the development and  repertoire of Tregs and their ability to recognize self-Ags in the targeted tissues ? suggesting that the Ag  specificity of local Tregs will be instrumental in controlling autoimmunity in the tissue. Thus, identifying the Ag  specificity of Tregs, especially at the site of inflammation, is critical to improve our understanding of Treg  deficiencies in T1D. In this project, we will address this question by examining the overall hypothesis that the  biochemical intricacies that promote effector immunity may paradoxically alter Treg efficacy and  contribute to the overall failure of Tregs to control autoreactive Tconv cells in autoimmune diseases  such as T1D. We propose the following Specific Aims to address this question: 1: Characterization of Treg  specificity against known I-Ag7-restricted autoantigens 2: Antigen focused approach to define the  specificity of Tregs in T1D patients. 3: Identification of novel ligands for Tregs in NOD mice and T1D  patients.  It is recognized that altered Treg immunoregulation is an inherent factor in autoimmunity but defining specific  Treg defects in T1D patients has been challenging. Thus, defining the specificity and repertoire of Tregs and  their reactive TCRs would be an important step towards the discovery of selective Treg defects in T1D and  greatly improve our understanding of the immunopathology of disease. Moreover, it would pave the way for  therapeutic opportunities aimed at restoring proper Treg immunoregulation in pancreatic islets."
"9314648","The purpose of the KL2 Clinical and Translational Science (CTS) Scholars Program is to provide individualized competency-based training by immersing scholars in multidisciplinary research teams that will provide mentoring and intense experiences in the conduct of research from conceptualization to completion. We will also help CTS scholars develop and submit competitive grant applications to transition to independent investigators. To develop and promote the CTS scholars program, we will take advantage of the strong research training environment in the six Schools of the Health Sciences, especially the Institute for Clinical Research Education (ICRE), which has a robust training infrastructure comprised of multiple degree and career- development programs tailored to the needs of young investigators at every early career stage. The ICRE also maintains a mentoring network, which includes 400 senior researchers from across the University willing to serve as mentors to our Scholars. CTSI has an existing KL2 housed within the ICRE, which has been highly successful in developing clinical and translational scientists, 25% of whom are already in leadership positions. This KL2 is a distinct program with unique elements not found in other institutional K awards at Pitt, including a focus on individualized training in core competencies, multidisciplinary team science, diverse disciplines and research experiences, targeted seminars, and an emphasis on the entire spectrum of translational research. Our immediate objectives for the proposed CTS Scholars program are to: recruit outstanding scholars with excellent training in their content areas early in their research careers; train scholars in rigorous research methods to conduct translational research; enhance skills in team science, leadership, stakeholder engagement, and entrepreneurship; guide scholars in implementing research projects to answer them; ensure close mentoring to guide research career development; and help scholars develop authentic relationships with stakeholders in their areas of research. Our long-term objectives will be to ensure that scholars complete their translational research studies on time, help scholars use these studies to propose large-scale projects and obtain independent funding, and facilitate scholars? ability to serve as mentors and leaders in translational science."
"9353218","Studies show substantial benefit to reduce morbidity and excess mortality for people living with HIV (PLWH) who adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and to lower the probability of forward transmission to sexual partners. Despite efforts to maintain engagement of PLWH along the treatment cascade, it is estimated that only 6-16% of youth and young adults living with HIV (Y/YALWH) maintain suppressed viral load (VL). ART adherence interventions that leverage software on PCs or through the internet capitalize on consistency in delivery of content and long-term cost savings; however, to date the peer-to-peer interactivity that has come to symbolize Web 2.0 remains underutilized in technology-based adherence approaches. Peer-to-peer support is a recommended strategy to improve ART adherence, is widely used by PLWH, and has an evidence-base for in-person approaches - particularly in adult populations. Youth in the US are increasingly accustomed to technology-mediated peer-to-peer interactions, suggesting that intervention approaches that specifically leverage high-use channels of interpersonal communication and support are needed. The ?Thrive with Me? (TWM) intervention is a technology-delivered peer-to-peer social support intervention grounded in the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. TWM includes peer-to-peer interaction, ART adherence reminders and self-monitoring, mood and substance use self-monitoring, individually-tailored ART and HIV informational content, and gamification components to optimize ART adherence. A pilot study in adult MSM showed that those randomized to the TWM intervention demonstrated improvements across all ART adherence outcomes compared to control participants, with greatest benefits for recent drug-using MSM. As part of the UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech), we propose to test the efficacy of an adapted version of the TWM intervention, called Y-TWM, for Y/YALWH. In this 4-year study, 350 Y/YALWH between the ages of 15-24 with problematic ART adherence at baseline will be randomized to the Y-TWM or a HIV information-only control intervention for a 5-month period. A target of 50% of Y/YALWH participants with self- reported alcohol and/or illicit drug use will be enrolled. VL and validated self-reported ART adherence measures will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-, and 6-month post-intervention follow up. We hypothesize that participants in the Y-TWM intervention will demonstrate significant improvements in self- reported ART adherence and VL at post-intervention compared to control participants, with greatest improvements among substance-using YLWH. This proposal is innovative for its use of mobile, gaming, and peer interaction components, which can be readily adopted in clinical and community settings with Y/YALWH. The proposal advances HIV continuum of care science for Y/YALWH by providing a rigorous evaluation of a technology-delivered ART adherence intervention for Y/YALWH at elevated risk for therapeutic failure. If the Y- TWM intervention is demonstrated to be effective, it may be quickly scaled up for wide-scale dissemination. !"
"9288208","In the context of preparing for this upcoming Program Project Grant (POl) renewal, over the last five years we have developed novel and cutting edge imaging methodology and established advanced protein analytical methods related to 0x43 analysis, as well as further training an expanding group of project personnel in general Ca2+ imaging and 0x43 protein analysis. We have also developed considerable expertise in dual Ca2+/N0 detection in endothelial cells of intact vessels and all these methods are now increasingly central to the projects of this combined POl. In the current application, continued training of current and new personnel and ongoing technical support of imaging methods application will continue through this new Core B and ongoing instrument technical support will be added for imaging microscopy. In addition, the Core will provide training support for cell protein analysis by Western blot based and Co-IP  procedures as well as new antibody and technical assay development for all four projects. As a coordinating unit, the Core will offer further support to enhance data collection uniformity by relieving project personnel of the burden of preparing frozen stocks of validated pooled endothelial cells for imaging, so ensuring both high qualities of cell preparations providing uniformity of data acquisition between the projects. Where opportunities for reagent purchase can improve cost savings, or at least ensure more abundant reagents are fully used, the Core will coordinate those supplies to secure savings."
"9330511","Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR): Project Summary/Abstract The Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (VDRTC) will continue to support the VDRTC Cell Imaging Core, operated by the Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR), and ensure that VDRTC-affiliated investigators will have full access to state-of-the-art imaging equipment and expert technical support to conduct sophisticated microscopy and analysis of tissue and cellular anatomy and physiology. By utilizing a large, well- established facility, the VDRTC Cell Imaging Core provides high levels of quality control, a dedicated, expert staff and a significant economy of scale for services that would be difficult (if not impossible) for individual investigators to establish and support. This organizational structure fits well with the centralized approach to prevent needless duplication of scientific resources within federally funded research centers, enabling focused development of technology that serves all Vanderbilt research, including VDRTC investigators. The overall goal of the VDRTC Cell Imaging Core is to provide the full range of modern microscopy and digital imaging capabilities and techniques to enable and accelerate diabetes research at Vanderbilt through three objectives: 1) acquire and maintain state-of-the art optical and EM imaging technology; 2) train, assist, and encourage VDRTC-affiliated investigators to incorporate optical, EM, and in vivo imaging technologies into their research; and 3) develop new imaging technologies that will be useful for diabetes research. Without VDRTC support, the breadth and quality of advanced microscopy service would be severely limited. The VDRTC support grant also reduces the net cost of imaging service to VDRTC investigators and has helped provide financial stability essential to sustain historically high levels of service to VDRTC researchers. This stability has been vital to the successful acquisition of new instruments and services that support VDRTC researchers. During the past 5 years, investigators representing 84 separate VDRTC-affiliated laboratories (a 31% increase from the prior cycle) have used all aspects of the CISR. Over the same period, CISR initiatives taken to obtain equipment grants, combined with institutional contributions, have provided $4,766,063 in new capital equipment, managed by the CISR, for the benefit of VDRTC investigators. This includes super-resolution, 2-photon-excited fluorescence, multi-excitation TIRF, and other advanced microscopies. The Vanderbilt shared facilities system provides an efficient billing system, oversight and governance for the Cell Imaging Core. The VDRTC Cell Imaging Core will continue to be a critical component in Vanderbilt's broad range of diabetes research resources and will provide essential services that support the research of VDRTC-affiliated investigators during the next funding cycle."
"9353202","Project Summary/Abstract  Among the 62,400 Youth Living with HIV (YLH) aged 12-24 years old, 36% are linked to health care and only 6% of YLH are virally suppressed.1 It is imperative that YLH achieve viral suppression in order to reduce the probability of infecting others, as well as increasing the length and quality of their own life. Stepped Care is a strategy used in managing other chronic diseases, not yet applied to HIV. Providers implement the least intensive intervention needed to achieve the treatment goal and intensify the intervention until the treatment goal is achieved. Study 2 tests a Stepped Care Model to achieve viral suppression ? by increasing adherence to the HIV Treatment Continuum.  This U19's strategy for retaining the cohort, monitoring outcomes, and linking YLH to care is the Standard Care Condition in Study 2 (labeled Prototype Retention/Prevention Strategy in other cores or studies) and will be combined by an Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention (AMMI) for YLH. The Stepped Care arm will have three levels of intervention: Level 1: Standard Care; Level 2: a Peer Support and AMMI (PS-AMMI) plus the Standard Care; and Level 3: a Coach plus PS-AMMI plus the Standard Care. The PS-AMMI and Coaching will be both in-person contacts, as well as on social media, texting, and probes to monitor behaviors over time. Having a detectable viral load at a 4 month assessment, triggers increasing intensity in the level of intervention provided.  YLH with established HIV infection (N=220) will be identified by screening each youth seeking services at five homeless shelters and gay-identified community based organizations in Los Angeles and New Orleans. The sample is expected to be 79% male Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender YLH (GBTY), 5% heterosexual males, 71% African-American, 15% Latino, and 16% female. The YLH will be randomly assigned during the recruitment process when it is determined that the YLH has an established HIV infection by the interviewer in the Recruitment, Engagement, and Retention Center (RERC).Over 24 months, viral load will be monitored as the primary outcomes with dried blood spots. Secondary outcomes will be sexually transmitted infection (STI), serious substance abuse, and retention in care and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy adherence. The study will examine the mediating effect of reducing substance use and reducing depression on viral suppression, as well document the frequency and type of life challenges and barriers YLH experience to achieve viral suppression and how the quality of the peer support and coaching may impact outcomes. The results of this study will potentially influence CDC's policies on how to diffuse evidence-based practices and provide CDC with good estimates on the costs of repeat testing among GBTY."
"9238864","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The tetraspanins constitute an important family of proteins known to regulate the aggregation of protein complexes at the cell membrane. Tetraspanins are known to bind and recruit other proteins at the cell surface, such as integrins and cell adhesion molecules, thus initiating important cell decisions including migration, adhesion and signaling activation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the tetraspanin CD82 is expressed by muscle satellite cells where it binds to other proteins in a ~250Kd protein complex. One of the protein members is ?7-integrin (?7-ITG). Cultured myoblasts from ?7-ITGnull mice show decreased expression of CD82, suggesting a functional link between these two proteins. Additionally, muscle tissue lysates from dystrophic mdx and ?7-ITGnull mice show a decrease to near absence of the CD82-?7-ITG protein complex compared to wild-type skeletal muscle. Lastly, muscle satellite cells from CD82 knockout mice show a defect in cell proliferation. In the present application we propose to identify the additional members of the CD82-?7-ITG complex, study the post-translational modifications of CD82 in satellite cells and determine the stoichiometry of the complex in normal satellite cells (Aim1). In Aim 2, we will identify the downstream signaling pathways of CD82 that lead to impaired cell proliferation of CD82 knockout satellite cells. We will investigate if these molecules are downstream signaling effectors of ?7-ITG, or are unrelated to ?7-ITG function. Finally, in Aim 3 we will study whether overexpression of CD82 in satellite cells can enhance their in vivo reparative capacity and improve the overall function of dystrophic muscle. These studies will advance our understanding on the role of this specific tetraspanin in satellite cell activity and will provide the groundwork for future therapies aimed at enhancing the expression of the CD82 protein complex in dystrophic muscle."
"9397742","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver related morbidity and mortality; however treatment options are currently limited due to an incomplete understanding of the molecular drivers of ALD pathogenesis. Insulin resistance is one of the few known factors linked with ALD progression and dysregulated lipid synthesis is linked with the development of insulin resistance in experimental models. Our experimental mouse alcohol feeding model reveals hepatic steatosis (the earliest histologic stage of ALD) and insulin resistance develop coordinate with the upregulation of the hepatic lipid droplet protein Perilipin 2 (Plin2) and an increase in liver ceramides, both of which are known to promote steatosis and insulin resistance. Consistent with a functional role for Plin2 in alcoholic steatosi, we found that alcohol-fed Plin2 KO mice were resistant to steatosis, increases in liver ceramides and glucose intolerance. While the regulators of Plin2 in alcoholic steatosis are unknown, our preliminary results show the cellular energy regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is downregulated in alcohol-fed mice prior to Plin2 elevation and pharmacologic AMPK activation reduces Plin2 transcription in ethanol-treated VL-17A human hepatoma cells. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest pharmacological blockade of ceramide synthesis elevates Plin2 levels. Based on these data, we hypothesize that there is positive feedback between hepatic Plin2 and ceramides and that alcohol's inhibition of AMPK regulates this process. We will investigate our hypothesis through three interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Specific Aim 1: To investigate the mechanistic basis of AMPK mediated regulation of Plin2 transcription in vitro using ethanol-treated human hepatoma cells. (2) To investigate the effect of hepatic AMPK activation and inhibition on Plin2, ceramides and lipid metabolism in vivo; and (3) To determine the effect of hepatic ceramide reduction on Plin2 expression and lipid metabolism. To accomplish these Specific Aims, we will use a combination of novel genetic, molecular biology and pharmacological approaches; lipidomics analyses; and metabolic phenotyping to understand the in vivo functional consequences of our models. Successful accomplishment of these Specific Aims will advance our understanding of the contribution of lipids and associated proteins per se to alcohol liver pathology and can provide insight into early targets for therapeutic intervention. Concurrently with performing the experimental aims, I will complete a career development program under the guidance of an advisory committee with nationally and internationally recognized NIH-funded researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson University. This structured program combined with my co-mentors' clinical experience in hepatology and gastroenterology make me uniquely positioned to become a leading investigator capable of NIH-funded independent investigation at a leading academic center with a research focus on alcohol-mediated lipid biology."
"9265831","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is the most serious acute complication in intensively insulin-treated diabetes and it remains the limiting factor in maintaining proper glycemic control. The brain, and especially the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), plays a crucial role in sensing hypoglycemia and in initiating the physiological counterregulatory responses that correct it. However, both reoccurring exposure to hypoglycemia and longstanding diabetes can impair the mechanisms that normally correct hypoglycemia. This research proposal addresses whether diabetes and antecedent hypoglycemia alter brain fuel metabolism in a manner that prevents it from properly sensing falling blood glucose levels. The long-term objectives of this research are to understand how the brain senses changes in blood glucose levels, how it communicates these signals to peripheral organs to initiate counterregulatory responses and why these mechanisms are impaired with antecedent hypoglycemia and in diabetes. It is essential that we achieve a better understanding of how the body detects and activates defense mechanisms against hypoglycemia so that appropriate therapies can be developed to more effectively prevent hypoglycemia outcomes in diabetic patients. If proven successful, these studies could potentially reveal new therapeutic targets for the development of insulin co-therapies."
"9301312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will significantly contribute to the growing body of research on physical attractiveness as a source of social stratification that has wide implications for health, akin to more frequently studied factors like race and gender. Health is an integral component of the approach to this project-as a dimension of physical attractiveness (e.g., weight), as a mechanism by which physical attractiveness has effects on social and academic achievement (e.g., mental health), and because the adult socioeconomic attainment that is expected to reflect histories of physical attractiveness is a fundamental component of lifelong health and health disparities. This project also will provide a practical service to the feld by expanding a public use data set so that it can be used to study the role of attractiveness in a wide variety of outcomes, including health behaviors and health disparities. Specifically, the project will create the most comprehensive longitudinal data ever amassed of physical attractiveness from infancy through adolescence by re-coding videotapes that were already gathered at nearly a dozen time points in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. It will describe trajectories of beauty in this cohort and test important hypotheses derived from an integrative theoretical model put forward in a new book by the investigators. Based on status characteristics and life course theory as well as developmental systems and stigma perspectives, beauty's association with higher achievement is expected to operate through mental health mechanisms, including positive mood, perceived competence, and self esteem. These mental health resources are expected to counteract some of the ways being good looking could distract from schooling (i.e., physical assets might accentuate desires to climb the social ladder as young people move into and through adolescence and its associated peer contexts). Differences in the strength of associations by social location (gender, race/ethnicity, SES), by developmental period (early childhood, elementary, junior, and high school), and by ecological contexts (schools) will also be examined. The results of this project, and the new source of public use data created through the project, will stimulate future developmental, social psychological, and public health research on physical attractiveness as a stratifying force. These results will be written up for academic journal articles and also widely disseminated, which is important given the public, media and policy interest in the topic."

This grant focuses on a tyrosine phosphatase that directly associates with and dephosphorylates the insulin receptor, called the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP). LMPTP is highly expressed in insulin-target tissues. Human genetic studies and in vivo data obtained from mice carrying reduced expression of LMPTP suggest that LMPTP promotes diabetes and insulin resistance in obesity. Our goal is to validate LMPTP as a drug target for obesity-associated diabetes by demonstrating that chemical inhibitors of LMPTP ameliorate diabetes in mouse models of obesity. We screened the NIH chemical library for inhibitors of LMPTP, and identified a reasonably potent and selective compound -ML400- that selectively inhibits LMPTP in vitro and is active in cell-based assays of LMPTP activity. We have preliminary evidence that ML400 is active in vivo and ameliorates glucose tolerance in a model of diet-induced obesity. Importantly, inhibition of LMPTP by ML400 occurs through an uncompetitive mechanism of action, suggesting that ML400 targets a novel allosteric site of the phosphatase. The aims of this proposal are to optimize potency and selectivity of ML400 through chemistry (Aim 1), identify the allosteric site targeted by ML400 on LMPTP (Aim 2) and perform in vivo studies with the lead compounds to demonstrate that inhibition of LMPTP improves insulin resistance in obese mice (Aim 3). The proposed hit-to-lead work will yield a highly potent and selective inhibitor of LMPTP and provide proof-of-principle evidence that inhibition of LMPTP is beneficial to effectively treat one of the most common metabolic complications of obesity. Our lead inhibitor can further proceed through preclinical validation in obesity and also will be useful to further elucidate the biology of LMPTP in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the identification of the allosteic site targeted by the inhibitor will enable further future rational targeting efforts for developmen of inhibitors with therapeutic potential."
"9279015","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the number of older adults in the United States increases over the next 50 years, it is imperative that we understand not only those factors that are associated with limitations in functioning, but also those that are associated with maintained functioning and well-being. Recent research suggests that engagement in cognitively demanding activities is beneficial in terms of preserving cognitive health. For example, there is evidence that older adults who engage in social, leisure, and work-related activities that place demands on cognitive resources are more likely to maintain their intellectual competence over longer periods of time than those who do not engage in such activities. Given this relationship and the potential significance for public health issues, it is important to understand the factors associated with continued participation in cognitively demanding activities later in life. Of interst is the fact that certain characteristics of the individual that might be expected to predict participation and level of performance, such as ability, do not account for substantial variance between individuals in participation. In the present project, we investigate the strong possibility  that age-related changes in motivation play a critical role in determining participation in demanding everyday activities, with perceived benefits and costs of engagement guiding decisions regarding participation. In the proposed research, we hypothesize that normative increases with age in the physical costs associated with cognitive activity-as indexed by cardiovascular responses-affect this benefit/cost analysis, with reductions in participation in later life related to increased costs. We also propose, however, that perceptions of the self- relevance of the task as well as one's beliefs about aging may also influence perceptions of benefits and costs. For example, negative perceptions about the impact of aging on ability may lead an individual to exaggerate the perceived costs of activities, thereby exacerbating the impact of costs on participation. Conversely, if an individual believes an activity is self-relevan (e.g., beneficial to cognitive health), motivation may be affected through adjustments in perceived benefits. Importantly, both self-relevance and beliefs about aging are potentially modifiable, which has implications for the development of effective interventions. Motivational factors have been relatively neglected in the study of cognitive aging. They may, however, play a critical role in determining late-life functioning and well-being. The proposed research will systematically explore (a) how normative age differences in the costs associated with cognitive activity influence motivation and subsequent activity participation, and (b) the factors that moderate this relationship."
"9265069","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is typically diagnosed in childhood and over time can lead to complications affecting the retina, heart, kidneys, peripheral nerves, and more recently appreciated, the brain. During childhood, the brain undergoes significant structural and functional changes and has a high and rapidly changing metabolic demand; these unique properties have led to the suggestion that the developing brain may be especially vulnerable to glycemic extremes. Accordingly, studies find that early age of onset, accumulated exposure to hyperglycemia and repeated severe hypoglycemia during development are associated with lower cognitive performance and altered brain structure in children with T1DM. Intriguing patterns have been identified, yet substantial individual variability in brain outcomes remains unexplained. More recently, our data and others' have suggested that clinical severity at diagnosis, particularly at younger ages, may contribute to cognitive and brain outcomes, even many years later. However, previous studies have not been designed to differentiate the effects of initial clinical presentation from the cumulative effects of subsequent glycemic extremes on the brain. Thus, the goal of this study is to determine how clinical features at the time of T1DM diagnosis shape the developmental trajectory of the brain and its responses to subsequent glycemic control. We propose to test this hypothesis explicitly by performing sensitive neuroimaging, cognitive testing and quantitative clinical measures on children with T1DM and their non- diabetic siblings at diagnosis and at 3 and 21 months post-diagnosis. Findings may highlight the need for programs aimed at early diagnosis of the disease, DKA prevention, and ?-cell preservation, particularly in at- risk youth, in order to minimize long-term negative consequences for brain health and development. Although recent exciting developments raise the possibility of better glycemic control using closed-loop insulin delivery systems or of curing T1DM through ?-cell transplants, the risks associated with clinical presentation of T1DM would still remain and need to be better understood."
"9293539","PROJECT ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in translating preclinical work on complex underlying mechanisms of cerebral edema in traumatic brain injury (TBI) to critically needed biomarkers and targeted/preventive therapies for improving outcomes in humans. This is an important problem because indiscriminate clinical approaches to cerebral edema remain reactionary and morbid - compounding a problem that is a fundamental contributor to death and disability in TBI. The long-term research goal is to better understand the roles and interactions of edema pathways in human TBI. This will focus innovation of successful targeted treatments. The overall objective of this K23 is to develop a comprehensive approach towards understanding a unique, key pathway of cerebral edema in human TBI involving a transmembrane protein: Sulfonylurea Receptor-1 (Sur1). Founded on the central dogma of biology, this proposal evaluates the Sur1-cerebral edema relationship in TBI from multiple angles by investigating Sur1 expression and genetic variability in humans, and complementing this with a clinically relevant, unique, edema-generating mouse-model. The central hypotheses are that 1) Sur1 levels and genetic variability influence cerebral edema and 2) Sur1 expression patterns guide treatment efficacy. The hypotheses have been formulated upon preliminary data generated by the applicant that strongly suggest feasibility. The rationale for the proposal is that complementing Sur1 expression and genetics in human TBI with a relevant animal model, has the potential to directly translate to improving clinical care and outcomes. This is expected to inform patient risk stratification, monitoring, prognosis, and targeting/developing specific therapies. Aim 1 evaluates the relationship between human Sur1 expression (detected in cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), cerebral edema, and TBI outcomes. Aim 2 evaluates the human Sur1 gene (ABCC8) tag-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with cerebral edema in TBI. Aim 3 generates a temporo-spatial map of Sur1 expression (by validated techniques) and quantifies effects of Sur1 inhibition by glyburide in an edema-generating mouse-model of TBI. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it molecularly complements generic intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and responses to cerebral edema by focusing on a key pathway, and uses a multifaceted approach to bridge the gap between animal models and human disease. These aims are expected to establish the utility of Sur1 as a novel biomarker and evaluate it as a preventive therapeutic target against edema. The proposed work is significant because it has potential groundbreaking implications for monitoring and preventing cerebral edema that may reduce morbidity and mortality, not just in TBI, but in many other neurological disorders. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development in translational research methodologies and the science of biomarkers, modern genetics, and statistics. These synergistic tools cultivate skills necessary for transition to independence. It sets the stage for R01-projects evaluating the interplay between Sur1 expression, genetics and inhibition in clinical trials. This work will uniquely position the investigator as a future leader in the development of individualized targets against cerebral edema to improve outcomes in TBI."
"9403496","ABSTRACT Obesity is a worldwide public health problem, and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity associates with increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally in adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic tumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to solid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity- induced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion, oxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases tumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic therapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk between fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1? (IL-1?)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These abnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular and mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers to successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1? will alleviate obesity-induced desmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have successfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly developed approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the effect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while avoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on obesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if TMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how elevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments with the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia and inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients. These novel treatments can be rapidly translated into the clinic based on our track record of successful clinical translation in collaboration with outstanding clinicians."
"9353029","SUMMARY  Aging is a biological process that is the major risk factor for chronic disease and degeneration during the lifespan. However, it is beginning to be appreciated that disease and degeneration impinge on the aging process, in something perhaps akin to a feedback loop. This suggests that a better knowledge of one contributes to an understanding of the other. Furthermore, development of therapeutic interventions still must address the degenerative disorders of aging, while the search for broad interventions that target the biological aging process itself continues. The demographic and social developments associated with an aging population point to a real and deepening need for researchers who will provide the basic knowledge on aging that can be translated into solutions that are broadly applicable. Importantly, these researchers must more and more frequently be able to communicate effectively with practitioners in other disciplines and even to become part of multidisciplinary teams. The proposed Phase II COBRE in Aging and Regenerative Medicine will help fill this national need by mentoring junior investigators in the aging field within an interactive and multidisciplinary environment, while creating a dynamic center in which biomedical science targeting aging is practiced. The focus here is biomedical research with translation firmly in mind. However, this COBRE program is embedded within the multidisciplinary Tulane Center for Aging, and thus it can serve the purposes of addressing the broader challenges of an aging society. Notwithstanding these overarching goals, the individual research projects that are offered in this application have the promise of generating important new insights into a few focused areas of biological aging and regeneration. These projects build on our successes in COBRE Phase I, targeting central nervous system aging, immune system aging, degenerative disorders of the brain and musculoskeletal system, as well as the larger issues surrounding cell senescence and chronic inflammation."
"9383545","Divergence in the metabolic reprogramming is critical to effectively imprint distinct T cell fates. To meet their bioenergetic demands, T effector (TEFF) cells use aerobic glycolysis leading to lactate production (the Warburg effect), whereas T memory cells (TM) switch to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). It remains poorly understood how transition of TEFF to TM cells correlates with simultaneous metabolic reprogramming. It is also unclear whether glycolysis itself regulates such transition events. The lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) enzyme catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the last step of glycolysis, a hallmark of the Warburg effect. LDH-A is upregulated in human cancers and is associated with aggressive tumor outcomes. Conversely, inactivation of LDH-A in tumor cells results in decreased tumorigenesis and regression of established tumors. We generated LDH-Aflox/floxCD4-Cre (LDH-A-/-) and LDH-Aflox/flox (LDH-Acon) mice, in which LDH-A is deleted only in T cells, to study how targeting the hallmark step of the Warburg effect would affect T cell function. Antigen-specific CD8+ LDH-A-/- TEFF rapidly expanded, differentiated to TCM and TSCM and displayed potent response on antigen mediated re-challenge. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ LDH-A-/- T cells retained robust mitochondrial function in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth. Metabolite tracer studies revealed that LDH-A-/- CD8+ T cells had enhanced glucose flux, elevated intermediates of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and glucose-derived acetyl-coA but diminished usage of glutamine for TCA anaplerosis. This altered metabolic preference has been identified in embryonic stem cells (ES) cells, where it promotes histone/DNA demethylation by aKG-dependent demethylases and maintains stemness. Moreover, similarly to ES cells, LDH-A-/- CD8+ T cells had increased histone acetylation mediated via glycolysis-derived acetyl-CoA. These metabolism-driven epigenetic changes might be responsible for the rapid differentiation of LDH-A-/- cells to TCM and TSCM, which have stemness features. Our findings support the novel hypothesis that glycolysis has a key role on memory T cell differentiation by generating pyruvate and that it is the pyruvate-acetyl-CoA step not the pyruvate-lactate step, which contributes to the generation of cellular identity and has a mechanistic role on the transcriptional and epigenetic state of T cells. Understanding and recapitulating this metabolic state might provide a novel method to generate potent antigen-specific TEFF and TM cells for cancer immunotherapy. To investigate this, we will pursue the following specific aim to determine: 1. How LDH-A mediated metabolic changes affect the differentiation program of tumor-specific T cells. 2. How LDH-A targeting impacts the epigenetic regulation of TM cell differentiation. 3. How LDH-A targeting affects the properties and function of tumor-specific T cells."
"9353212","While the epidemic of HIV in the US has leveled off for many age groups, from 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) (13-24 year old) more than doubled. In 2010, YMSM accounted for 72% of new infections among people ages 13 to 24, and 30% of all new infections among MSM. The success of treatment as prevention in reducing the number of new HIV infections among youth, and particularly YMSM, relies on HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment (both for treatment and prevention), adherence and viral suppression among those with HIV. The UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech) aims to impact the HIV epidemic by conducting innovative, interdisciplinary research on technology-based interventions across the HIV prevention and care continuum for adolescents and young adults in the United States (US). The iTech also creates an infrastructure to share and disseminate best practices in technology-delivered HIV interventions to other ATN projects and programs serving adolescents. The iTech overall goals seek to decrease the impact of HIV on the lives of adolescents and young adults in the US, particularly YMSM, by providing: 1) treatment as prevention for those without HIV but at risk; 2) earlier identification and treatment for those infected but undiagnosed; 3) interventions to address structural determinants that decrease access to and uptake of prevention and care services; and 4) treatment interventions to encourage adherence for youth dealing with substance use, mental health related issues, stigmatization and disenfranchisement. The necessary resources and support for HIV/AIDS investigators addressing these goals will be provided by the iTech Cores: 1) Management (Hightow-Weidman); 2) Analytic (Rosenberg/Muessig); and, 3) Technology (Sullivan/Hightow-Weidman). To accomplish our Overall Goals we have developed the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To provide scientific leadership with expertise and experience in technology-based research to address fundamental questions related to the HIV prevention and care continuum, guide our overall research strategy and foster collaboration and synergy both within our iTech and with the broader ATN scientific community. Aim 2: To support the development and assessment of innovative technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for at-risk or infected youth aged 15-24 years. Aim 3: To support the overall ATN scientific agenda by participating on the ATN Executive Committee and collaborating with other U19 awardees stimulating new synergistic and responsive grants applications and research to respond to emerging issues in this field. Aim 4: To develop and nurture partnerships that will ensure community input at all stages of conceptualization, design, implementation, and interpretation of the research. Aim 5. To develop, mentor and train clinicians and researchers to stimulate innovative HIV/AIDS research focused on technological innovation across the care continuum."
"9336761","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to rigorously evaluate the utility of intra-individual variability (IIV) on aging-related changes in cognitive, health and emotional outcomes using a recently developed statistical model. The project covers three years and makes use of existing data sets of adult populations and it includes data-based simulations to examine minimal and optimal data needs for inclusion of intensive measurement designs within long-term longitudinal studies. The project addresses a number of critical issues that surround current and past research results. Up to date, the vast majority of studies that investigate the relation of short-term variability, as expressed in IIV, are based on multistep approaches which separate intra-individual means and trends from the computation of IIV. These approaches assume that means and standard deviations are completely independent and that they can be reliability estimated. These assumptions typically go untested but if they are not met, the results of analyses based on IIV can be severely biased in the sense that IIV explains undue amounts of variance. Mixed-effects location scale models (LSM) overcome these issues as they incorporate all relevant effects simultaneously. A main objective is to replicate existing results on the basis of these novel models and to evaluate new questions about the relation of and its independent predictive value for mortality and change-based outcomes in cognitive, health, and affect. The second goal focuses on optimization of intensive measurement burst designs (IMD), increasingly important for aging-related research, in terms of study design features that optimize statistical power, accuracy, and precision to estimate IIV. Specifically, the project follows three specific aims: 1) To perform multi-study replication of the predictive utility of IIV on subsequent change in cognition, health, and emotions and to evaluate the sensitivity of results to statistical models. 2) Evaluate novel multivariate hypotheses about the dynamics of IIV to level of functioning and to other aging-related outcomes. 3) Investigate optimal design features for maximizing power and reliability of embedded intensive measurements within longitudinal studies of aging. The long-term objective is to contribute to the early and precise detection of cognitive, health and emotional change. This project rigorously tests the predictive power of IIV in different domains and clarifies its utility in agin research."
"9251872","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common, debilitating disorders affecting social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Recent genetic findings have identified mutations in synaptic cell adhesion genes and genes encoding their interacting protein partners at central synapses as genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders. This proposal will characterize novel and innovative autism mouse models that allow for brain development to take place with a genetic mutation. These particular models allow for reversal of the mutation at various times during brain development and ultimately in specific brain regions. The goal is to narrow the developmental critical period during which such mutations lead to altered brain function and atypical behavior. This information will allow scientists to focus specifically on the time periods and brain regions critical for generation of atypical behavior. In addition, these studies will substantiate feasibility of genetic and certain pharmacological approaches to treatment of a genetic form of autism. Progress to date is substantial in that the genetically reversible mutant mouse models related to autism have been established and characterization has begun."
"9387086","Abstract This proposal explores a rarely studied pregnancy exposure, invasive placentation (IP), for which we observed suggestive preliminary associations with cancer in other projects. IP is an obstetric condition involving lack of control of the maternal/fetal interface, resulting in cellular invasion of placental tissue into the surrounding tissues. IP may include only the inner layer of the uterus, but may also include all uterine layers and adjacent organs such as the bladder. Specific pathways by which IP occurs are unclear. Women with cesarean deliveries have increased risk of IP, however, not all women with prior cesarean delivery develop IP, and not all women with IP have had prior cesarean delivery. Cellular invasion and breakdown of normal tissue barriers (features of IP) are also features of cancer development. IP may be a marker for women with underlying characteristics that increase cancer susceptibility. Uterine scarring from prior cesarean delivery may provide an anchor for IP development, but only women prone to abnormal cellular invasion/tissue barriers may experience this complication. By extension, their offspring may also possess characteristics that increase cancer risk. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship of IP with cancer in parous women, and as an in utero exposure or marker of cancer susceptibility in children. IP is rare and unlikely to have been systematically recorded in prior cancer studies involving interviews, thus requiring large studies with focused and uniform exposure assessment. Specifically, we propose to use linked health registry data from 3 existing population-based cancer studies to explore the following hypotheses: 1) A history of IP in a previous pregnancy is more common among parous women with breast cancer  than among comparison women with deliveries in similar years. Data for this aim include >6,000  breast cancer cases and a large group of matched controls. 2) Childhood cancer cases are more likely than children without cancer to have a mother who  experienced IP in their pregnancies. Data for this aim include >5000 childhood cancer cases and a  matched control group of children without cancer. 3) IP is more common in women with cancer during pregnancy than among comparison women with  deliveries in the same years. Cross-sectional analyses will include >14,000 women with deliveries  who have a cancer diagnosis in their hospital discharge record, and a group of women without cancer.  For IP cases, we will also conduct medical chart reviews to assess accuracy of the IP diagnosis in the  hospital discharge records, and the degree of tissue invasion involved. This project will allow us to efficiently explore the possible IP-cancer association with existing data. Results may lead to further studies with detailed characterization and assay of placental tissue."
"9360536","Regular exercise exerts a profound positive impact on health and the quality of aging. Still, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate systemic exercise benefits remains surprisingly incomplete. In particular, details of how work in muscle translates to system-wide maintenance, disease deterrence, and even rejuvenation, are too poorly understood to be harnessed for therapeutic applications. We propose to address this knowledge gap from a new angle that features innovative technology, facile gene manipulation, and integrative in vivo neuronal assays over time. We have developed a C. elegans exercise model that uniquely positions us to address three aims that together will advance understanding of the fundamental biology of exercise benefits outside of the muscle domain, with a focus on neuronal aging. Aim 1 will: a) test C. elegans homologs of genes involved in classical mammalian exercise training pathways for roles in strength adaptation, b) address potential requirements for selected stress/longevity pathway genes in exercise-induced enhancement of muscle strength; c) define animal-wide transcription changes that accompany the trained state. Work will establish a deep mechanistic framework for analysis of exercise benefits and address the degree of conservation of exercise adaptation pathways from nematodes to humans. We will firmly ground a novel genetic model in which whole-animal benefits of exercise can be dissected. In Aims 2 and 3, we shift our emphasis to address impact of exercise on neuronal healthspan. Aim 2 will define the impact of exercise on neuronal healthspan while addressing the overall hypothesis that exercise induces functional, structural, and molecular adaptations in neurons, delaying their age-associated decline. We will conduct a detailed analysis of touch receptor neurons, characterizing how exercise changes neuronal function, morphological restructuring, susceptibility to neurotoxic disease protein toxicity, and mitochondrial status over adult life. We will apply selected assays to evaluate additional neuronal types to document in unprecedented cellular detail how exercise influences in vivo nervous system aging. Aim 3 will exploit unique features of the C. elegans experimental system to dissect the tissue network via which genes needed for exercise adaptation promote muscle and neuronal health benefits. We will: a) address whether selected key genes needed for muscle training act autonomously/nonautonomously to impact neuronal healthspan, and b) test exercise-inducible genes encoding secreted proteins for roles in promoting neuronal adaptations. We will gain initial insights into the tissue-interaction circuits involved in system-wide exercise benefits and we may uncover exercise-induced drivers of neuronal healthspan. Given unequivocal evidence that exercise is the most effective anti-aging, anti-disease, pro-health intervention known in medicine, genetic dissection of exercise's maintenance capacities in native context and over time should yield new insights that guide strategies for improving human health and the quality of aging."

GSU is an ideal institution for an IMSD program as it combines excellence in biomedical and behavioral sciences with a remarkably diverse undergraduate population as well as with GSU's success in training undergraduates from underrepresented minorities. GSU now graduates more African American students than any other non-profit institution of higher learning in the United States. The goal of the proposed IMSD is to combine our existing strengths in biomedical research with the unique success of GSU in educating underrepresented minorities to make it the premier institution in the nation for the education of a highly diverse group of students who will go on to NIH-funded research careers. The objectives of this IMSD program are: (1) to engage high-potential undergraduates from underrepresented groups, recruited from Neuroscience, Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology, in a two-year research immersion and integration program, which includes research during summer as well as academic year activities that will integrate regular coursework with research activities (research semester); (2) to promote survival skills for research careers through an intensive series of professional development workshops and courses in which students will hone their skills in critical thinking, scientific communication, research career planning, and ethics; (3) to create a highly supportive academic and social environment to launch graduate careers in biomedical science by providing instructors with skills to train students from underrepresented groups and help them get entry into PhD programs and by fostering connections with other partner T32 and PREP institutions; and (4) to evaluate progress and identify program, mentor, and trainee dispositions that predict success in biomedical research careers, which we will then use to institutionalize successful program elements beyond the grant period at GSU and, by disseminating and publishing the results of our evaluation, at other institutions."
"9275462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of an R24 grant focused on mitochondrial protein acylation, its regulation by the NAD-dependent mitochondrial protein deacylases, SIRT3 and SIRT5, and their impact on metabolic regulation under normal and pathological conditions. During the first 48 months of this grant, our collaborative group has published 27 papers and has defined the function of SIRT3 and SIRT5 as key mitochondrial NAD-dependent protein deacylases. In the mitochondria, SIRT3 and SIRT5 regulates the acetylation (SIRT3) and succinylation (SIRT5) of many mitochondrial enzymes in key metabolic pathways that include fatty acid oxidation, ketone body synthesis, TCA cycle, OXPHOS and the urea cycle. Loss of SIRT3 is associated with reduced metabolic flexibility and accelerated development of a syndrome that mimics human metabolic syndrome with obesity, type 2 diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and steatohepatitis. Mice lacking SIRT5 also showed significant metabolic abnormalities in the urea cycle, ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. SIRT5 is also an NAD-dependent demalonylase but this modification targets distinct proteins predominantly in the cytoplasm. These findings point to reversible mitochondrial protein acylation as a key regulator of mitochondrial metabolism and SIRT3 and SIRT5 as important factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The overall goal of this proposal is to extend these studies to further define the role of protein acylation and SIRT3 and SIRT5 in mitochondrial function in unique tissues involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome: liver, muscle and pancreatic ß cells. We will take advantage of our highly collaborative and multidisciplinary team harnessing the power of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, metabolomics, molecular biology, extensive physiological testing and unique and novel animal models, including tissue-specific knockouts and tissue specific transgenic overexpressors for SIRT3 and SIRT5, to further increase our understanding of this important process in regulation of mitochondrial function and metabolism."
"9297212","Toxoplasma gondii is a major food borne pathogen in the US, a leading cause of infectious retinitis in children and can be lethal to the fetus and immuno-compromised adults. To date there is no vaccine, and while there are a limited number of existing therapeutics they have undesirable side-effects and do not cure the infection. Therefore the development of new therapies would reduce human suffering associated with this pathogen. In the post-genomic era, the challenge is to identify those gene products that may be successfully targeted for therapeutic intervention. Driven by recent innovations in the analysis of protein complexes through a state-of- the-art co-fractionation proteomics platform developed by the applicants (Havugimana et al., Cell 2012; Wan et al., Nature 2015; 2,3), this project will systematically identify native protein complexes for two key life cycle stages from two strains of T. gondii (AIM 1). Network-based comparisons will reveal how proteins are orchestrated to form complexes required not only for invasion but also for modulating host pathways, processes key for parasite transmission and persistence. Further, comparisons between strains will identify both core- conserved elements, indicating common functionality, as well as lineage-specific innovations with the potential to impact parasite virulence. To validate our findings, we will perform detailed functional characterization of proteins with newly predicted roles in host modulation pathways (AIM 2). From our preliminary data, we have already selected two promising candidates to begin validation. These will be supplemented with additional proteins with predicted effector roles identified through our network analyses. Together this program of research promises to deliver unique biological insights into the organization of the complexes and pathways that drive parasite invasion and persistence, revealing novel parasite virulence mechanisms that will drive new strategies for designing potent anti-parasitics."
"9334048","Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease."

The CATS Scholars Program serves as a mentoring and career development core for scientists who are at the junior faculty level and are committed to a career in translational research. CATS Scholars are appointed for a two or more year program that includes 75% protected time for research activity, a core curriculum, and individualized educational and career development activities. All Scholars are guided through the process of creating an individual career development plan that both sets goals and serves as the framework for their planned activities during the CATS Scholars period. The specific goals of the CATS Scholars Program are: 1) To provide a mentored career development experience that allows Scholars to develop the NIH/CTSA identified core competencies in clinical and translational research, 2) To provide scholars with unique training opportunities that will drive innovation in research, and 3) To systematically evaluate the program and provide for continuous improvement and alignment with NIH/CTSA goals. The specific skills that may be required of clinical and translational scientists, such as involvement in team science, interaction with community partners, and superior science communication (both written and oral), fall well beyond traditional training in how to perform biomedical research. The CATS Scholars program fills this need.   Project Summary/Abstract Page 713 Contact PD/PI: MERMELSTEIN, ROBIN J Inst-Career-Dev-001 (810) REFERENCES CITED Pfund C, House S, Spencer K, Asquith P, Carney P, Masters KS, McGee R, Shanedling J, Vecchiarelli S, Fleming M.

"9282428","Abstract (Microscopy Core) The Microscopy Core of the Indiana Diabetes Research Center (IDRC) will support the needs of center investigators for high-resolution and quantitative optical microscopy, providing training and access to advanced forms of light microscopy and digital image analysis. The comprehensive facilities and the expertise of the Microscopy Core will provide IDRC investigators with the capability to conduct quantitative microscopy studies at the highest level. Core personnel will work closely with IDRC investigators to develop imaging strategies that may include wide-field microscopy, confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy, and digital deconvolution microscopy, depending on the needs of the research study. Fastidious attention to equipment maintenance, user training and data evaluation by this centralized core will provide for consistent quality and reliable interpretation of data. A major focus of the Microscopy Core will be to implement cutting- edge techniques in optical microscopy, allowing them to be used effectively by IDRC researchers who might have limited experience with microscopy. Specifically, the Core will apply and adapt methods of intravital microscopy that the ICBM has developed over the past 12 years to studies of the pathophysiology of diabetes and will develop and implement novel assays of protein and cell function based upon fluorescent protein biosensors, applying a combined approach of spectral and time-resolved fluorescence quantification. The aims of the core include: (1) Conduct microscopy studies for laboratories lacking microscopy expertise; adapt, optimize and validate existing protocols. (2) Develop protocols and provide training in challenging forms of microscopy, including live-cell imaging, quantitative digital image analysis and 3D/4D microscopy for laboratories experienced with microscopy (3) Work with IDRC investigators to develop and validate protocols and reagents for quantitative microscopy of fluorescent protein biosensors. (4) Work with IDRC investigators to develop and validate procedures for intravital microscopy of the pancreas, and of islets transplanted to the kidney capsule or anterior chamber of the eye. (5) Provide ongoing consultation and guidance on the design and analysis of new microscopy studies. The Microscopy Core will constitute an invaluable resource for the IDRC, providing investigators with the equipment and support necessary to conduct microscopy at the highest level, combined with a program of methods development that will provide them with effective access to unique and powerful research capabilities that are currently limited to the relatively few laboratories that specialize in microscopy."
"9269245","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 omics layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and fuzzy soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease."
"9317485","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by hepatic steatosis (lipid accumulation), is a common disease that affects up to 29 million adults in the U.S., and will become the number one cause of liver disease worldwide by 2020. There are few effective ways to prevent or treat this disease. A better understanding of its etiology is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment. We previously found that NAFLD is heritable (genetically influenced) and identified common (minor allele frequency (MAF) >5%) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 5 loci that associate with hepatic steatosis first in ~7,000 individuals of European ancestry and then across ancestries. Variants at the 5 loci together explain ~20% of heritability suggesting that other influential variants remain to be discovered. We and others have now found that genes harboring functional coding (affecting protein sequence) common variants of small effect often can also harbor rare variants with large effects. At three of the five associated loci we have now identified putative functional coding variants across ancestries. Recent whole genome and exome sequencing studies identified many new coding variants but many are low frequency (MAF 1-5%) or rare (MAF < 1%) and neutral as opposed to damaging. These low frequency and rare variants have been underexplored in genome-wide association studies due to the limitations of imputation and small sample sizes. These variants can now be affordably assayed in large numbers of samples using the new Illumina Human Exome BeadChip. Further, we can test whether particular genes and variants affect hepatic lipid accumulation in a new cell based model of hepatic steatosis we have created. We hypothesize that low frequency (MAF 1-5%) and rare (MAF <1%) coding variants with effects on hepatic steatosis exist and if expressed in liver, affect liver lipid accumulation. To identify and characterize low and rare frequency variants for effects on NAFLD, we have now assembled the largest, most ancestrally diverse population based collection of individuals (>16,000 from 8 cohorts) with measures of hepatic steatosis and genotyped them with the Exome BeadChip. We will harmonize the hepatic steatosis phenotype and genotypes in our cohorts and carry out single variant, gene based, and conditional meta analyses across groups to identify putative causal variants. We will follow up top associating variants and genes from hepatic steatosis analyses in >4,000 histologically confirmed NAFLD cases and ~3,000 controls to replicate our findings. Using our cellular model of hepatic steatosis, we will overexpress and knockdown liver expressed genes harboring coding variants in human liver cell lines and characterize their genetic and lipidomic mechanisms of action. We will start with the three genes we have already identified that harbor coding variants that associate with NAFLD and then proceed to new genes identified and replicated from the proposed exome analyses. This work will begin to define the genetic and metabolic mechanisms which cause NAFLD to inform development of new biomarkers as well as potential therapeutics for this condition."
"9364050","PROJECT SUMMARY Nexilin or NEXN (encoded by NEXN) is a recently discovered Z-disc protein. NEXN is highly abundant in cardiac muscle. Multiple mutations in NEXN have been associated with cardiomyopathies, highlighting its importance for cardiac function. A single amino acid substitution of arginine 279 to cysteine (R279C) in NEXN was identified as causing familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and a 3-base pair (bp) deletion (1948? 1950del) leading to loss of glycine at position 650 (G650del) was found to be highly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Loss of NEXN in zebrafish results in perturbed Z-disk stability and heart failure. Interestingly, myocardial biopsies showed that NEXN mutation carriers exhibit the same cardiac Z-disk pathology as observed in NEXN deficient and mutant zebrafish. Furthermore, global loss of NEXN in mice has been reported to cause rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dilation, wall thinning, and decreased cardiac function, resulting in lethality shortly after birth. Premature lethality of these mice has prevented study of the role of NEXN in adult heart function. In addition, little is known as to the specific role of NEXN in cardiomyocytes, or mechanisms by which global loss of NEXN in mice results in rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, mechanisms by which the NEXN R279C and G650del mutations lead to the progression of cardiomyopathy remain to be addressed. To address these questions, we have successfully generated a floxed NEXN mouse line and will use it to generate NEXN cardiac-specific knockout (KO) mice both during developmental and at adult stages. In addition, we have generated novel R274C (equivalent to human R279C) and G645del (equivalent to human G650del) knock-in mouse models to characterize the role of the human NEXN R279C and G650del mutations in cardiomyopathy. Our preliminary characterization of global NEXN KO mice also suggests that NEXN plays an important role in regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity. The foregoing scientific premise leads us to the hypothesis that NEXN plays an essential role in regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the Z-line during the stress of muscle contraction, and that R279C and G650del mutations in NEXN impair specific aspects of NEXN function to lead to HCM and DCM, respectively. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To characterize the role of NEXN in the developing and adult myocardium by analyzing NEXN global and cardiomyocyte-specific knockout mice both during development and at adult stages for cardiac function, cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity, sarcomere integrity, and the progression of cardiomyopathy; and 2. To elucidate mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy consequent to R279C and G650del mutations of NEXN by analysis of R274C or G645del mutant mice and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes containing NEXN R279C or G650del mutations."
"9301528","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to identify clinical and genetic features of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) development, and to analyze their relationships. Although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. Our overall hypotheses are that genetic factors are involved in the initiation and modulation of ROP, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, and genetic findings in ROP using bioinformatics approaches will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Recruit, phenotype, and collect genetic material from ~600 additional premature infants at-risk for ROP from 8 centers. This renewal will continue work from the original project, to obtain a total cohort size of >1600 infants for genetic analysis. Demographic and clinical features from serial ophthalmic examinations will be ascertained fully, retinal images will be captured, rigorous reference standards will be established, and blood samples will be collected. (2) Perform imaging and informatics analysis of this cohort. This will: (a) Create quantitative indices for computer- based diagnosis of severe ROP. Features from automated image analysis that best correlate with severe ROP and plus disease will be identified, and quantitative indices will be defined and validated for clinical use. (b) Combine this into disease prediction models incorporating the effects of quantitative image traits, clinical features, and environmental risk factors on ROP susceptibility. (3) Perform genetic and bioinformatics analysis of this cohort. This will: (a) analyze exome sequence data (previously obtained) from 100 phenotypically extreme subjects that were also preferentially enriched as being dizygotic twin pairs, to identify rare variants; (b) perform and analyze genome-wide genotyping to test against clinical and imaging findings, testing specific candidate genes related to vascular pathology in the eye and the vasculature at large, followed by performing a pathway-based analysis; and (c) perform bioinformatics analysis to combine findings from (3a) and (3b) in relation to the clinical findings. Ultimately, these studies should improve understanding of neovascularization in ROP and related ocular diseases, and of normal vascular development in infants. In addition, this work should demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of collaborative investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics."
"9374465","ABSTRACT: Immunochemotherapy that combines a chemotherapeutic agent with an immune checkpoint blocker represents one of the most promising strategies for the treatment of various types of cancers including breast cancer. However, its success is limited by a number of issues including: a) the poor water solubility of the drug(s); and b) the challenge in simultaneous delivery of the two therapeutics to the tumors. We have developed a dual-functional, immunostimulatory nanomicellar carrier that was based on a prodrug conjugate of PEG with NLG919, an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor currently used for reversing tumor immune suppression. We showed that PEG-NLG alone was effective in enhancing T cell immune responses and exhibited significant antitumor activity in vivo. More importantly, systemic delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) using the PEG-NLG nanocarrier led to a significantly improved antitumor response in murine models of breast cancer. This application is focused on further improving this delivery system to facilitate drug release at tumor site. The potential of the improved nanocarrier in synergistic delivery of anticancer agents will then be investigated. Three specific aims will be pursued in this proposal. Aim 1 will develop an improved PEG-NLG-based delivery system with facilitated drug release following delivery to tumors. Aim 2 will examine the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the improved delivery system in murine breast cancer models. We will first define the stability of the improved delivery system in blood circulation. The efficiency of the system in delivery of PTX is then examined. Aim 3 will define the in vivo therapeutic effect of PTX formulated in the improved delivery system in murine models of breast cancer. The underlying mechanism for the synergistic antitumor activity will also be studied. Successful completion of this study will lead to the development of a novel strategy for improved breast cancer immunochemotherapy."

Because of the VDRTC and the environment it creates, VDRTC-affiliated investigators have made important scientific contributions related to diabetes, obesity, and metabolism."
"9281666","PROJECT 4 ABSTRACT  The Film Antiretroviral Microbicide Evaluation (FAME) Program addresses the critical need to develop a highly  effective, safe, and acceptable microbicide vaginal film with an extended window of protection from HIV  infection that allows less frequent product dosing. The Program builds upon previous data showing vaginal  films to be a safe and acceptable dosage form for delivery of antiviral drugs to the vagina. Specifically, a film  formulation of the integrase inhibitor MK-2048 will be developed that achieves measurable drug levels  consistent with HIV prevention in the cervical and vaginal tissues over one week following a single application.  Such a product could be used consistently on a weekly basis to provide continuous protect or could be used to  provide greater versatility for women planning for protection around a period of increased risk of infection. MK-  2048 is a potent 2nd generation integrase inhibitor for which an extensive amount of preclinical data including  safety have already been established. The IND developed within Project 4 will cross reference drug  substance data contained within previously approved INDs for the MK-2048 oral and intravaginal ring products.  The overall goal of the IND Enabling Critical Path Project (Project 4) is to ensure that GMP MK-2048 is  available for use in the planned studies within the program. Project 4 will coordinate and oversee manufacture  of GMP compliant drug product. Formulations developed within Project 1 will be the basis for GMP  manufacture. Project 4 will also manage preclinical safety studies including rabbit vaginal irritation and toxicity  studies and lactobacillus compatiblity studies. These studies will be combined with existing data from  previous IND submissions, in vitro and ex vivo safety and efficacy data from Project 2, and safety data from  Core B to generate a safety package supportive of conducting the planned human clinical trials within Project  3. Project 4 will develop and integrate regulatory documents for submission of an IND application to support  first-in-humans investigative clinical trials in the US (FAME-101, FAME-102, and FAME-103; Project 3).  Finally, Project 4 will also generate the required Investigator Brochure. The activities within Project 4 are  essential to generation of required data and appropriate regulatory documentation for initiation of human  clinical trials of the novel non-coitally dependent (1 week) film dosage form that will be designed within this  program."
"9330509","Hormone Assay & Analytical Services Core (HAASC): Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of the Hormone Assay & Analytical Services Core (HAASC) is to provide to investigators assays to measure hormones, cytokines, amino acids (Specific Activity & concentrations), lipids/lipoproteins, nucleotides and markers of oxidant stress in biologic fluids and tissue samples, and more recently glucose (enrichment and isotopomer distribution) in plasma and tissue samples. The services provided by the HAASC and its two subcores (Oxidative Stress Subcore and Lipid Subcore) require unique instrumentation and involve rigorous standardization of procedures. It is neither practical nor economically reasonable to establish these assays in individual laboratories. The consolidation of services into one Core laboratory provides investigators with efficient, high quality, low cost analyses. All services are tailored to meet the needs of the specific investigator in that the exact protocol followed may differ depending on the analysis desired by the investigator and the sample volume to be analyzed. Through training and education, investigators become more aware of the various services offered and how these services might address specific areas of interest. Finally, an important function of the Core is method development, which not only enhances the spectrum of services offered but ultimately also increases efficiency by providing researchers with the opportunity to expand their research programs. The core provides space, equipment, and personnel for sample analysis. Investigators pay a fee-for-service that covers the cost of reagents, supplies, pro-rated service contracts for equipment, and a percentage of personnel salary. The Core also serves as a valuable resource for all investigators without ready access to wet-lab research space and personnel. Core services utilize modern instrumentation run by experienced research assistants in a consistent, quality-controlled environment. This Core works closely with another VDRTC Core, the Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource, to develop standard operating procedures to facilitate translation of this technology to VDRTC investigators performing in vivo and in vitro studies. Those investigators rely on the Core and Subcore directors and their staff for advice on how to collect and process samples collected during in vivo studies. The Hormone Assay and Analytical Services Core provides essential services to VDRTC investigators that allow them to perform important and innovative research. The HAASC has demonstrated its ability to develop and modify assays to meet the evolving needs of VDRTC investigators."
"9259915","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) exhibits an aggressive clinical history, with development of recurrence, distant metastasis, shorter survival, and usually occurs in young women. BLBC intrinsically possesses many epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like features, suggesting that activation of EMT program generates high-grade invasive cells with CSC-like traits in BLBC. Our long-term goal is to discover the intrinsic factors within tumor cells and the extrinsic signals from tumor microenvironments that regulate EMT, and to identify molecules that may serve as druggable targets for treating this deadly disease. In the last several years, we have systematically studied the role of Snail and the molecular mechanism by which Snail represses E-cadherin expression in BLBC. Our study clearly indicates that Snail is one of the key intrinsic factors within tumor cells responsible for EMT; our study also implies that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment provides an extrinsic signal for EMT. However, how the extrinsic tumor milieu of BLBC is initiated and built up, despite its paramount importance, remains unaddressed. Recently, we found that expression of the X-box binding protein (XBP1) was significantly reduced in BLBC from human breast tumor samples and mouse breast cancer tissues. Snail suppressed XBP1 expression and resulted in a significant upregulation of CCL2, a major chemokine for tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and lymphocytes. XBP1 is a key molecule in the most conserved unfolded-protein response (UPR) signaling pathway that cells use to cope with environmental and cellular stresses in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of XBP1 results in unresolved ER stress, which signals endogenous cellular injury, triggering leukocyte infiltration, and a significant boost of inflammatory responses in target tissues. We hypothesize that the loss of XBP1 by Snail-mediated repression ignites an inside out signal for recruiting TAMs and lymphocytes, which establish an inflammatory/wound stroma to further boost EMT and cultivate CSC-like traits in BLBC by providing additional cytokines and growth factors. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the repression of XBP1 by Snail and explore therapeutic interventions that will disrupt this vicious cycle and thereby restore ER homeostasis using a newly developed specific Snail inhibitor. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for Snail-mediated XBP1 repression in BLBC; (2) to delineate why loss of XBP1 enhances inflammation in BLBC; and (3) to elucidate the functional roles of XBP1 in vivo. Our proposal is innovative and significant, because it will not only open a new paradigm that significantly affects our views on the co- evolvement of tumor cells and their microenvironments in breast cancer progression and metastasis but will also lay groundwork for developing new therapeutic strategies against this disease."
"9331880","We propose to organize two further Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) conferences, in 2017 and 2018. The CAGI experiments and conferences are providing the primary independent assessment of the state of the art of variation interpretation. In the CAGI experiments participants are provided genetic variants and make blinded predictions of resulting molecular, cellular, organismal, or clinical phenotypes. The new experiments will build on extensive and informative results obtained in the first four rounds. Datasets will include rare disease, common diseases, and germline and somatic cancer variation, from both research and clinical sources. Data types will include complete genomes and exomes, as well as single base changes affecting coding sequence, gene expression, and RNA splicing. Independent assessors will evaluate the predictions against experimentally characterized phenotypes. A CAGI Conference is held at the end of each experiment. The specific goals of the conferences are: (1) to assess the quality of current computational methods for interpreting genomic data, and highlight innovations and progress; (2) to guide future research efforts in computational genome interpretation and build a strong community for collaboration and interaction; and (3) to disseminate results both amongst key members of the variant-phenotype prediction community at the meeting and to a broader audience via publication of results in peer-reviewed journals. The new CAGI experiments will continue the process already established over four rounds, starting in 2010 and with the latest meeting in March 2016. The 2016 experiment yielded 174 submissions on 11 challenges, by 37 groups from 13 countries. 57 people attended the meeting, and we are disseminating results via open access publications and conference presentations. Once again, the participating community was overwhelmingly of the opinion that this experiment is necessary and should be organized again on an ongoing basis. The organizers will continue to encourage the participation of women and underrepresented minorities, and broad participation of trainees and senior scientists at the CAGI conferences. Funding is requested for awarding 17 trainee fellowships for students and postdoctoral researchers to cover registration and approximately 2/3 of their other participation costs. In addition, we seek funding to subsidize registration and approximately half of meeting costs of the independent assessors, some data providers, and the organizers of the CAGI experiments."
"9294054","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Barrett's esophagus, the metaplastic change of the distal esophageal epithelium from squamous to columnar, significantly increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, the prevalent form of esophageal cancer in this country. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying esophageal epithelial columnar metaplasia is critical to designing molecularly targeted chemopreventative or therapeutic strategies for both Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. We propose that reactivation of latent developmental signaling a pathway within the esophagus is a fundamental requirement for Barrett's metaplasia. This project will expand on our previous work that identified Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation in Barrett's esophagus and demonstrated that forced Hh expression and subsequent downstream Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 signaling induces columnar changes in esophageal epithelium. We previously identified SOX9, a transcription factor expressed in the embryonic esophagus, as a Hh-BMP4 target gene that is upregulated in Barrett's esophagus and induces expression of columnar genes. We have now identified a second Hh-BMP4 target gene and embryonic esophageal transcription factor, FOXA2, to be expressed in Barrett's esophagus but not in normal adult esophageal epithelium. Our hypothesis is that expression of these two embryonic transcription factors, activated by Hh and BMP4 signaling induced by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is required for the development of columnar metaplasia. We will attempt to further define the role of Hh and BMP4 signaling in Barrett's esophagus through three specific aims: Aim 1) To delineate how BMP4 upregulates SOX9 and FOXA2 expression in human esophageal epithelial cells; Aim 2) To determine if sequential and combinatorial stable expression of SOX9, FOXA2, and CDX2 in esophageal squamous epithelial cells results in phenotypic features of Barrett's metaplasia; and Aim 3) To determine in vivo expression levels of Hh and BMP4 pathway proteins and their downstream targets (SOX9, FOXA2) and CDX2 in biopsy samples of esophageal squamous epithelium from GERD patients with and without Barrett's esophagus. Through these studies, we expect to define the role Hh-BMP4 signaling plays in establishing columnar metaplasia and determine if there are differences in Hh-BMP4 signaling between GERD patients with and without Barrett's esophagus. These findings would contribute towards our objectives of 1) identifying specific molecular markers that can be used to predict which GERD patients would benefit from aggressive anti-reflux therapies to prevent Barrett's esophagus; 2) designing a molecularly targeted chemopreventative or therapeutic strategy for Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma; and 3) validating our innovative approach of applying developmental biology to the understanding of Barrett's metaplasia."
"9282792","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the level and function of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (PI) that is mainly produced in the liver but also in alveolar macrophages (AM) and pulmonary epithelial cells. Neutrophil elastase (NE), the primary target of AAT, degrades elastin in the pulmonary alveoli leading to parenchymal destruction and subsequent emphysema1. Instinctively, replacement therapy (augmentation therapy) with exogenous AAT to restore the level of AAT to above the protective threshold level, should solve the problem but there is controversy whether augmentation therapy is sufficiently efficacious. The goal of this study, an ancillary proposal to the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Anti-trypsin Disease and Sarcoidosis (GRADS), is to define the changes in epigenetic alterations (histone modifications) in alveolar macrophages before and after augmentation therapy and their potential association with disease phenotype through comparison with healthy control samples. Our proposal is unique and complementary to the parent study as we are focusing on specific changes in epigenetic histone modifications in alveolar macrophages before and after augmentation therapy, whereas the parent grant will be assessing whole cell mRNA and miRNA expression. Our proposal is also time-sensitive as histone analysis requires freshly isolated cells and not stored DNA samples. We propose three aims to address our hypothesis that the environmentally influenced, variable pattern of histone modifications that can modulate AM mediated inflammation and can contribute to a variable clinical course of AATD, may also be influenced by or influence the molecular activity of AAT augmentation therapy. Using a novel approach that has not been undertaken in AATD but proven in other inflammatory pulmonary and non-pulmonary disorders, in Aim 1 we will compare the epigenomic signature of specific inflammation-associated histone post-translational modifications in AATD alveolar macrophages (AM) from PiZZ subjects before and after 6 months of AAT augmentation therapy via Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). In Aim 2 we will elucidate the AATD alveolar macrophage (AM) epigenetically regulated transcription profile via computational integration of AM RNA-seq gene expression data sets with ChIP-seq and in Aim 3, we will analyze the effects of histone modifying enzyme ex vivo treatment, such as HDACi treatment, on AATD associated AM gene expression and cell function. In all three aims, we incorporate healthy control samples to elucidate AATD- specific epigenetic and transcriptional signature. This project will elucidate the effect of augmentation therapy on the epigenetic signature of AM in AATD patients, enhancing our understanding of the immunomodulatory mechanisms regulating AATD and providing an epigenetic map for potentially targeted treatment."
"9371339","Alphaviruses are an important group of human and animal pathogens that are widely distributed on all continents. Until recently, the importance of the Old World alphaviruses in global human health was strongly underestimated. However, recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in India, Italy, East Africa's coastal islands and most recently on the Caribbean islands, South and Central America, Oceania have highlighted the risk posed by this virus. Our previous studies have unambiguously demonstrated that the Old World alphaviruses employ their nonstructural protein nsP2 to re-direct the cellular transcription coupled repair pathway for degradation of the catalytic subunit of the DNA- dependent RNA polymerase II, RPB1, and thus, to completely inhibit cellular transcription. Within a few hours post infection, virus-induced transcriptional shutoff makes the cells incapable of initiating an antiviral response and leads to development of cytopathic effect. Thus, the Old World alphavirus nsP2 is the major determinant of pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels. We have also demonstrated that the transcription inhibitory functions of nsP2 are determined not by its proteolytic activity, but by the ability of this protein to function as a helicase, and by its S-adenosyl-L- methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase-like (SAM-like) domain. Two specific aims of the proposed research plan are focused on i) mechanistic understanding of the nsP2 helicase domain function in stalling cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II and ii) on identification of cellular proteins that interact with the SAM-like domain of nsP2. We will also define the mechanistic role of the interactions of the latter domain in transcription inhibition. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a set of CHIKV variants with mutated nsP2, which are incapable of interfering with development of the innate immune response to CHIKV replication. These irreversible mutations had no detectable effect on the rates of CHIKV replication in cells defective in type I IFN signaling, but are cleared from IFN-competent cells without development of cytopathic effect. Therefore, in the third specific aim, we intend to assess the potential of these nsP2 mutants to improve the safety of the currently available experimental vaccine CHIKV 181/25."
"9285820","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Golgi complex is a central membrane organelle for intracellular trafficking, glycosylation and sorting of membrane and secretory proteins. The basic structure of the Golgi is a stack of flattened cisternae, but how this structure is assembled and inherited during cell division is poorly understood. In the last few years, we have developed a unique multidisciplinary approach employing biochemistry, cell biology, electron microscopy, and more recently proteomics and glycomics, combined with a novel in vitro reconstitution assay, to provide a mechanistic explanation for Golgi structure formation and function. We found that GRASP55 and GRASP65 play complementary and essential roles in Golgi structure formation by forming mitotically regulated trans- oligomers that hold the Golgi membranes into stacks. Using GRASP55/65 as tools to manipulate Golgi stack formation, we provided the first evidence that Golgi stacking impedes protein trafficking to ensure accurate post-translational modifications. We hypothesize that the GRASP proteins play essential roles in Golgi structure formation through oligomerization and interaction with other proteins, which subsequently regulates protein trafficking and glycosylation. This proposal is a logical continuation of our previous studies to assess how the Golgi structure is assembled and why it is important for protein trafficking, glycosylation and sorting. The specific aims are: 1) Identify and characterize novel GRASP65 interacting proteins that regulate Golgi structure formation. Our preliminary data showed that there are proteins in the interphase cell cytosol that enhance GRASP65 oligomerization. We have identified 20 proteins that interact with GRASP65 and we will characterize their roles in Golgi structure formation. This will also help us understand how GRASPs perform multiple functions as previously reported. 2) Determine the structure- function relationship of the Golgi in protein trafficking, glycosylation, and sorting. We will manipulate th Golgi structure by knocking out GRASP55/65, using the recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and by expressing GRASP55/65 mutants in cells to determine the consequences of Golgi destruction and restoration on protein trafficking, modifications and secretion. Significantly, alterations in Golgi structure and function have been associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disease, viral infections, and Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Golgi defects may affect the trafficking, sorting and modification of a large number of proteins and cause global effects inside the cell and on the cell surface that compromise a variety of cellular functions. A better understanding of Golgi structure formation and the relationship to its vital cellular function is required before its role in human disease ca be understood. Our proposed study will determine the consequence of Golgi destruction on protein trafficking and processing, and thus provide fundamental information on the role of the Golgi under normal conditions and the relationship between Golgi defects and disease pathogenesis."
"9281036","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC-CMs) can serve as an abundant and ethical source of cardiomyocytes (CM) for developmental and pharmacological studies, and can also be used for patient-specific therapeutics. Unfortunately, newly differentiated hiPSC-CMs differ from adult CMs on both a structural and functional level. In order to achieve the full potential of hiPSC-CMs, these cells need to be matured into a phenotypic state that more closely resembles the adult one. Long-term culture of hiPSC-CMs    has been shown to significantly increase their structural and functional traits, but we need to fin alternative methods that accelerate their maturation rates. Previous studies on neonatal rat ventricular CMs and embryonic stem cell derived CMs have shown that mechanical cues, such as substrate stiffness and stretch, hasten CM maturation. Physiologically, substrate stiffness can be related to the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins in the myocardium that stiffen the tissue. Likewise, substrate stretch can be related to the creep strain that individual CMs experience during hypertrophic growth and from the cyclic strain they experience during the cardiac cycle. The observed maturation of CMs to substrate stiffness and stretch implies the importance of mechanotransduction, i.e. the process of a cell sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli. Integrins act as an initial sensing structure in this mechanotransductory pathway. Integrins are transmembrane proteins that attach selectively to the extracellular matrix (ECM), based on a specific combination of ? and ? subunits. It is widely regarded that integrins are responsible for translating external mechanical stimuli across the cell membrane, after which downstream intracellular signaling, leading to CM maturation, can ensue. It has been observed, for example, that the ?1 subunit plays a key role in heart development; however such studies have not been performed on the cellular level for hiPSC-CMs. In this fellowship, I will study the mechanisms that lead to the maturation of hiPSC-CMs by mechanical stimuli. The overall hypothesis is that mechanotransduction pathways initiated at integrins lead to the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. Specifically, I will focus on the role of several key integrins - the ?1 subunit, ?1?1, ?6?1, ?5?1, ?v?3, and ?v?5 - in this mechanotransductory response. The lon-term impact of this effort will be to understand and therefore control the maturation of hiPSC-CMs for cardiology studies and therapeutics."
"9306879","Bioinformatics Core (Aim #1 and 2)  The specific goals of the MS-INBRE Bioinformatics Core are: 1) build on existing interdisciplinary collaborations; 2) create new collaborative efforts between the PUIs and the research intensive universities; 3) train PUI students in bioinformatics; and 4) help address the serious cyberinfrastructure needs in Mississippi. To reach these goals the bioinformatics core will focus on improving bioinformatics awareness and literacy in Mississippi.    The Bioinformatics Core will assist the PUI investigators with their scientific needs (Aim #1).  Based on past experience (see Progress Report section for example), we envision that the following services will meet the scientific needs of PUI investigators:  1) Design and implementation of bioinformatics methods needed for projects.  Bioinformatics solutions to research questions often require the integration of multiple bioinformatics methods in a computational pipeline. Increasingly, the use on spreadsheets by research investigators and students to manage and analyze results is also not optimal for comprehensive discovery of biological implications from data. The lack of expertise for these types of bioinformatics solutions could limit the research questions pursued and reduce the overall impact of the research project. Likely common small-scale bioinformatics analysis will include sequence and structure and phylogenetic analysis. Extracting information from literature databases is also a need for research projects that the Core can provide expertise. More complex analysis could include gene, protein and metabolite expression. As an example. Dr. Heda, a PUI investigator at MUW, utilized proteomics to study the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This project will generate large amounts of mass-spectrometry datasets in form of ion spectra that must be assigned to peptide sequences as  well as inferences on protein abundances. The core will provide training for Dr. Heda and his students on understanding of the data exchange formats associated with mass spectrometry experiments such as mzML, TraML, mzldentML, mzQuantML and PSI-MI XML.  2) Advise on hardware and software needs for data storage, data sharing and data  analysis. Types of data input or outputs associated with MS-INBRE projects include images from  microscopes, tables of data, graphs, genomic and protein sequences, molecular pathway diagrams,  videos of experiments and audio files. The data storage, sharing and analysis needs of MS-INBRE  research projects vary depending on the data type. Thus the solution for each project will be  customized. A critical need to facilitate research collaboration among MS-INBRE researchers is the  implementation of a cyberinfrastructure for seamless and secure storage of data. In some cases, it is  desired to have data storage, analysis and sharing to be accessible off-line and via a website. Visual  analytics tools are making it possible for these data processes to be done together with minimal  computer programming.  3) Contribute to grant proposals. The Bioinformatics Core will help provide preliminary data  appropriate for inclusion in grant proposals. This data generation will be done in consultation with the  collaborative research investigator. Standard or customized text for inclusion in the grant proposals will  also be provided to investigators. The aim of this effort is to strengthen the research projects by adding  the appropriate bioinformatics components. This is particulariy critical for PUI investigators.  4) Other technical services. The Core will provide assistance with the following bioinformatics  topics: (1) Genome analysis; (2) Sequence analysis; (3) Phylogenetics; (4) Structural bioinformatics; (5)  Gene expression; (6) Genetic and population analysis; (7) Systems biology; (8) Data and text mining;  (9) Databases and ontologies and (10) Bioimage Informatics.  Bioinformatics Literacy Project (Aim #2). Biomedical research involves the management and  analysis of large and complex datasets requiring an understanding of a variety of bioinformatics  software and databases. An urgent need identified by the MS-INBRE Bioinformatics Core is the need to  build up the expertise of investigators and students at the PUIs in bioinformatics. The Bioinformatics Core has developed several tools that target PUIs. This is a critical need because PUIs do not have significant access or exposure to bioinformatics as an area of study. These tools will contribute to the development ofthe student pipeline into biomedical research. We have developed a Bioinformatics Literacy Project that will begin to address this issue. We believe that full implementation of this project  at the PUIs will lead to the training of a large cohort of students in bioinformatics. The training  components of this project are:  1) Bioinformatics Test Bank System. In this training infrastructure component, cohorts of  trained graduate students at the core director's institution (JSU) read peer-reviewed bioinformatics  articles and construct questions along with multiple-choice answers in the bioinformatics research  areas. Questions are scored resulting in consensus questions. The Bioinformatics Test Bank system when fully developed will provide a resource for self-directed bioinformatics training, continuing education as well as competency testing. These questions will also be used in the bioinformatics traveling workshops at the PUIs. Ultimately however, the goal ofthe core is to infuse these modules into the science education curricula at the PUIs.  2) Bioinformatics Text Annotation. With a similar goal as above, experienced graduate  students will help develop the bioinformatics curriculum by developing tools that facilitate learning. The abstract of a journal article on bioinformatics topics provides concise information about the article. The Sentence Annotation training infrastructure component was implemented to characterize sentences in abstracts by Focus - type of the information conveyed by the statement. Focus dimensions can be classified into three various types: Scientific (S) discussing findings and discovery; Generic (G) stating general knowledge, clarifying the structure ofthe paper, etc.; Methodology (M)?describing a procedure or a method. A database of categorized sentences can be a learning resource for understanding bioinformatics facts. We have developed sentence segmentation algorithm, which splits titte and abstracts for sets of citations indexed in PubMed into sentences. Further, a web resource to retrieve the sentences is available based on keyword and PubMed Identifier  (http://genomics.jsums.edu/sentence/bioinformj_pubmed/).    3) Short Bioinformatics Research Projects. Short-term (1-6 months) bioinformatics research  projects can help students develop specialized bioinformatics skills. The bioinformatics core is coordinating efforts to develop short-term project ts that students (PUI and others) can engage in remotely from their institution with guidance from the core director. A collection of projects will be used for mentored senior year projects as well as objectives for graduate student theses or dissertation.  Short-term projects are envisioned to have a mentoring component that may require an initial visit to JSU for training, however student-initiated projects will also be encouraged. We believe that this activity, once fully developed, will become an important resource for students at the PUIs or other institutions who lack faculty with bioinformatics expertise.  4) Bioinformatics Training Workshops. We have designed a training workshop series to  provide research-driven level-defined introductory and advanced training workshops for students and faculty in Mississippi. The following workshops have been developed:  a. Introductory Bioinformatics I (Introduction, Sequence Analysis, Databases and Ontologies)  b. Introductory Bioinformatics II (Genome Analysis, Phylogenetics, and Structural Bioinformatics)  c. Advanced Bioinformatics I (Gene Expression, Genetic and Population Analysis)  d. Advanced Bioinformatics II (Systems Biology, Data and Text Mining)  These traveling workshops will be conducted at the PUIs so that they reach students who otherwise would not be exposed to bioinformatics as a field of study. They will also be used as a tool to advertise the bioinformatics core services to investigators at the PUIs. We also plan to use these traveling workshops to cultivate interdisciplinary collaborations between the PUIs and research-intensive universities."
"9272301","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The world population is rapidly growing older, and population aging will be one of the most important social and health problems in the coming half-century. Life span is a typical quantitative trait, with natural variation attributable to segregating variants at multiple interacting loci, the effects of which are sensitive to the environment to which the individuals are exposed. However, only a handful of candidate genes associated with variation in life span in human populations have been identified. In this application we propose to identify evolutionarily conserved genetic networks causally associated with life span by using the powerful Drosophila model system, which enables us to accurately measure life span while precisely controlling both genetic background and environmental conditions. We propose an integrated systems genetics analysis of life span using the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Population (DGRP), which consists of wild-derived inbred lines with sequenced genomes. The lines are genetically variable for all phenotypes measured to date, including life span. The Specific Aims of this application are: (1) To map causal alleles associated with variation in life span with high resolution using a combination of genome wide association and linkage mapping; (2) To derive causal transcriptional co-expression networks affecting life span, placing novel loci identified by genetic mapping in appropriate biological context, and to use allele specific expression to test the systems level predictions; and (3) To use mutations and RNAi to functionally test effects on life span of genes implicated by the statistical analyses of natural variation and architecture of transcriptional networks, and use the recently developed system for integrating transgenes in the same genomic location to perform tests for causal effects of natural alleles. Results from these studies are likely to uncover novel genes and evolutionarily conserved cellular pathways associated with variation in life span. Because many genes in Drosophila have human orthologues, general insights derived from our proposed studies will have translational implications for human genetic studies on life span; moreover, we argue that insights derived from systems genetic studies of life span will have a broad impact on our general understanding of quantitative traits."
"9335971","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Non-invasive imaging is a powerful clinical tool for the early diagnosis, and monitoring of various disease processes. Next generation molecular imaging promises unparalleled opportunities for visualizing pulmonary infection and inflammation since molecular and cellular alterations occur earlier in a pathologic process, than structural changes. This rapidly developing technology has become an essential tool in the field of oncology, with similar potential for pulmonary infectious and inflammatory conditions.  During phase 1 funding, we developed and validated three novel molecular imaging tracers for evaluating pulmonary diseases with positron emission tomography (PET): 1) 124I-iodo-DPA-713, a synthetic ligand for the translocator protein (TSPO), as a specific imaging biomarker for macrophage-associated pulmonary inflammation, predictive of treatment efficacy and relapse in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis murine infection model; 2) 18F-fluorodeoxysorbitol (18F-FDS), an analog of sorbitol, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sugar free sweetener, metabolized selectively by Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae), but not mammalian cells, for rapid, specific detection of Gram-negative nosocomial pneumonias and; 3) 11C- Rifampin, a FDA approved first-line TB drug, for rapid, noninvasive multi-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments. All imaging tracers proposed in this application have been fully validated in preclinical models and have several promising features: a) basis in mechanism with specific cellular targets; b) low molecular weight with suitable PK for lung imaging and; c) high target-to-non-target tissue ratios at convenient times after intravenous injection. Our centra hypothesis is that mechanism-based targeting of pathologic processes by specific PET imaging tracers would provide real-time, early and specific information about pulmonary infections and inflammatory diseases in patients.  We propose a multi-disciplinary collaboration, specifically responsive to this RFA (phase 2) to perform initial safety and efficacy testing in human subjects using the FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) or RDRC mechanisms. Our ultimate goal is the bench-to-bedside translation of novel imaging tracers for rapid and noninvasive assessment of pulmonary disease processes and as drug development tools. Imaging tracers developed through this proposal could become valuable clinical tools for pulmonary medicine, and will also be broadly applicable to infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions.

"9269187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are exposed to the risk of experiencing severe episodes of hypoglycemia (HG) as they undergo insulin treatment to maintain the glucose control that is necessary to prevent diabetes complications. Recurrent HG can lead to development of the hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and to the syndrome of HG unawareness, where patients lose the ability to recognize symptoms of HG until they become unable to treat themselves. Strict avoidance of HG partially restores awareness of HG, however it is very difficult to achieve. Drugs and therapies that directly target the brain mechanisms responsible for HG unawareness have promise as better ways to prevent and/or reverse HAAF, thus crucially advancing care for patients with diabetes. In order to effectively design and monitor such treatments, it is necessary however to first characterize the physiological and pathological brain responses to HG, a research topic that has been only partly covered by current literature and that is at the center of the current proposal. I this project we will utilize state-of-the-art MRI methods to monitor non-invasively the brain responses during controlled experimental HG in a subject population which includes HG-unaware and HG-aware T1DM subjects, and healthy controls with and without a treatment that induces HAAF. Hypoglycemia-induced brain activations will be identified during different phases of HG by changes in cerebral blood flow. Multiple brain functionally- connected networks will also be monitored by using resting-state functional MRI, with an imaging protocol recently developed within the Human Connectome Project. Our central hypothesis is that altered brain responses to HG in HG-unaware T1DM subjects, as indentified by measures of brain activation patterns and functionally-connected brain networks, are a result of antecedent HG episodes, not diabetes. Therefore we expect that the activation patterns and the brain networks of HG-unaware T1DM subjects will be different from healthy and HG-aware T1DM subjects, but will resemble those of healthy controls who undergo HAAF induction. Our research team is uniquely positioned to conduct this research, as it has gained extensive expertise in mastering high magnetic field MR applications, and holds a long track record of MR research in diabetes. Ultimately, the study design of this proposal will allow identifying with unprecedented sensitivity the altered brain responses to HG in those T1DM patients who are unable to recognize the symptoms of HG, thus filling a critical gap of knowledge which will have significant impact in defining strategies that will reduce the complications of management of diabetes. Our study has been designed to be conducted on a clinical 3 Tesla scanner, thus making a transition to future multi-center studies feasible and seamless."
"9271194","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Homonymous hemianopia (HH) is vision loss in one half of the visual field due to stroke, head trauma or tumor.  Strabismus, misalignment of the eyes, is present with HH 10 times more often than expected.  Strabismus may compensate for HH if the deviant eye points into the blind hemi- field and if harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence (HARC) has also developed, however there is no data showing whether the compensation gives any advantage to the child who develops both visual impairments.  We will conduct a retrospective study of a large population of children who have both strabismus and hemianopia.  Previous publications have only examined, at most, four cases, and have not measured any effect of the condition on mobility.  We have identified 119 patients who have both impairments at Boston Children's Hospital.  Thus, this will be the largest study of its kind and have a positive impact on pediatric healthcare, regardless of outcome.  Moreover, it suggests that this combination of visual impairments is not as rare as assumed.  Worldwide there may be one hundred thousand children with both visual impairments.  We will measure visual functioning in these patients (retinal correspondence and suppression in central and peripheral visual field, binocular vision, diplopia, and visual field extent) and mobility with regards to hazard detection in driving and obstacle avoidance in walking.  This will allow us to determine whether strabismus indeed offers any advantage in children with HH.  We will also use prism correction to measure the potential effect of strabismus surgery in these participants.  To understand the long term effects of strabismus surgery, we will examine the subset of 24 patients in this population who have had strabismus surgery.  These participants will be tested to discover whether prism glasses can restore HARC while permitting the benefits of surgery.  Such a treatment would allow children to enjoy the benefits of surgery as well as any mobility improvements we observed.  It may also allow such patients to pass driving license requirements, which is important in many countries throughout the world."
"9281655","?     DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): The willingness of a woman to use a microbicide product has been linked to reduction of dosing frequency and product convenience and appeal. Vaginal films have been identified to possess a number of attributes which women find desirable. Combining the discreet and compact nature of this platform with other advantages such as perceived ease of use, reduced leakage, enhanced drug release, and decreased disturbance of innate immune barriers, films offer a dosage form which may lead to enhanced patient acceptability and product efficacy. The feasibility of on-demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents to the vagina in a safe and acceptable manner using a film has been illustrated in two separate clinical trials evaluating a dapivirine film and a tenofovir film. Huma studies of the dapivirine film showed that the vaginal delivery profile was consistent with gel and  ring dosage forms. Further, drug tissue levels for film matched those achieved with intravaginal ring use which were shown to be associated with protection in an ex vivo challenge assay. Although the feasibility of utility of this platform for on-demand applications has been demonstrated, its ability to be modified for use as an extended release product has yet to be explored. The Project 1 goal is to design a non-coitally dependent vaginal film for the integrase inhibitor MK-2048 that achieves cervicovaginal tissue drug levels that are effective against the sexual acquisition of HIV for one week following a single application. In preliminary studies in the nonhuman primate model, a prototype MK-2048 film was shown to have the ability to retain significant levels of MK-2048 in the target tissue up to 96 hours post film administration followin two separate acts of coitus. Within Project 1, three strategies will be explored to develop a weekly administered MK-2048 film. The primary strategy involves modification of film geometry and excipient composition to extend the release of MK-2048. Within this strategy iterative evaluation of product retention and release in the NHP model (Core B) will be used to optimize the delivery profile and achievement of protective levels of MK-2048 in the vagina (Project 2, Core C). The ability to maintain protective levels even in the context of sex will also be confirmed in this model. The developed film will be scaled up (Project 4) and evaluated in human clinical trials (Project 3). Additionally within Project 1 alternative nanotechnology based strategies for extending the window of protection with the film will be explored. Our group has previously used nanoparticles combined with the film platform to overcome vaginal drug delivery challenges. Nanoparticles containing MK-2048 will be developed and incorporated into the film platform to provide enhanced tissue retention and targeting. Finally, a highly novel and innovative approach to increase film retention will be developed. This strategy is based on the combination of micro/nanopatterns with the film platform to achieve enhanced vaginal product retention. Successful design of an MK-2048 film which provides an extended window of protection would offer a convenient option for protection against HIV infection in women."
"9271268","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the project is to understand the importance of neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilins are transmembrane proteins localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Missense mutations in presenilins account for 40% of familial AD (FAD) cases. Many FAD mutations in presenilins have been also linked to abnormal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) signaling. The main aim of the current proposal is to understand the connection between mutations in presenilins, dysregulation of neuronal ER Ca2+ signaling and synaptic loss and dysfunction in AD. Specifically, we will focus on testing the novel hypothesis that defects in ER Ca2+ signaling may lead to destabilization of mushroom spines widely considered to be physical units for memory storage by attacking these aims:. 1. To investigate the importance of postsynaptic store-operated calcium (SOC) entry pathway downregulation in loss of mature synaptic spines in AD. Our preliminary data suggest that the increase in neuronal ER Ca2+ levels leads to a compensatory downregulation of neuronal store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (nSOC). We discovered that the downregulation of nSOC occurs due to reduced expression of STIM2 protein, a master regulator of nSOC. We propose that reduction in synaptic nSOC causes destabilization and eventual elimination of mushroom spines, leading to loss of memories in FAD and aging brains. This hypothesis will be tested in experiments with PS1-FAD mouse model and STIM2 conditional knockout mouse model. 2. To investigate the connection between dysregulation of neuronal activity and destabilization of LTP- induced mature synaptic spines in AD. Our preliminary data indicate that appropriate pattern of neuronal activity is criticl for maintenance of mature mushroom spines. We further discovered that abnormal ER Ca2+ signaling causes disruption of this pattern in PS1-FAD neurons. We will perform a series of experiments aimed at dissecting the connection between ER Ca2+ homeostasis, neuronal activity pattern and stability of mushroom spines in AD neurons. We will evaluate a crucial role of intracellular Ca2+ stores and SK family of Ca2+-activated potassium channels in this process. 3. To analyze the cross-talk of amyloid and calcium pathways for AD pathogenesis. Abeta42 oligomers influence neuronal Ca2+ signaling and neuronal activity via variety of pathways. In this aim we will investigate if some of the Ca2+-related targets and pathways explored in SA1 and SA2 may also apply to models of amyloid synaptotoxicity. These experiments will be performed with in vitro model of Abeta42 synaptotoxicity and with recently generated APP-KI mouse model of AD."

"9322870","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A widely-held vision arising from the Human Genome Project is use of newly available genetic information to guide preventive and therapeutic decision making in individual patients. One therapeutic area that seems particularly ripe to test this concept is pharmacogenomics, the idea that variability in therapeutic response includes a genomic component. Common variation in both germline and somatic tumor genes is an increasingly well-recognized contributor to variability in drug response, and as a result, recommendations for genotype-guided therapy are being promulgated. Through leadership in multiple genomic networks, Vanderbilt has been at the forefront of pharmacogenomic discovery and translation of this knowledge into clinical practice locally. However, few institutions or practitioners have the procedures and tools in place to incorporate genetic data into routine drug prescribing. In this proposal, we move toward this practice by establishing a program for integrating genomic medicine in diverse healthcare settings. The purpose of the Integrated, Individualized, and Intelligent Prescribing (I3P) project is to perform a multi-site demonstration that integrating genetic data within electronic health records (EHRs) can improve healthcare. We will establish the processes and infrastructure necessary to disseminate clinical genetic testing, results reporting, and decision support into diverse hospital and EHR environments. This application focuses on pharmacogenomics, given the role of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as major causes of morbidity and mortality, the increasing number of recognized variants included in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels as mediators of both efficacy and toxicity, and the relative lack of stigma attached to carriers of variants in pharmacogenes. The project will build on two ongoing, clinical genotyping efforts at Vanderbilt: 1) the Pharmacogenomic Resource for Enhanced Decisions In Care and Treatment (PREDICT) program, which prospectively tests patients for 184 high-value germline pharmacogenomic variants including those associated with clopidogrel, warfarin and simvastatin; and 2) the Personal Cancer Medicine Initiative (PCMI), which routinely performs multiplex tumor gene mutation testing in lung cancer and melanoma to direct therapy. I3P will leverage the existing expertise, informatics, and laboratory infrastructure and resources at Vanderbilt to implement genomic medicine in three diverse healthcare systems at early adopter sites. These healthcare systems include underserved, minority populations (Nashville General Hospital at Meharry Medical College), military populations (Nashville Veterans Affairs Medical Center), and a community health system (Aurora Health Care)."

Yet, available literature and our preliminary data suggest that only a subset of children diagnosed as having acute sinusitis based on current clinical criteria are likely to have bacterial disease. This finding, which is not entirely surprising, reflects the large overlap between symptoms and signs of an uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and acute bacterial sinusitis. Accordingly, in a population of children diagnosed as having acute sinusitis, response to antimicrobials is likely to be heterogeneous; those with true bacterial disease are likely to benefit substantially from antimicrobial therapy whereas those without bacterial disease would derive no benefit. The aim of this study is to identify subgroups of children who meet current diagnostic criteria for acute sinusitis, but in whom antimicrobial therapy provides no benefit. This objective will be achieved by conducting a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in children 2 to 12 years of age with persistent or worsening presentations of acute sinusitis. Children will be randomized to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or placebo. Based on preliminary data we have gathered, we hypothesize that the subgroup of children who harbor no respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis) in their nasopharynx, and the subgroup of children whose nasal discharge is grossly clear, are unlikely to have bacterial disease and therefore will not benefit from antimicrobial therapy. Innovations that will differentiate this study from previous studies include: 1) an experienced multidisciplinay research team working in a multicenter setting; 2) use of a well-validated measure of outcome; 3) use of electronic diaries to minimize the amount of missing data; and 4) a priori identification of subgroups likely to respond differently to antimicrobial therapy. Should the proposed hypotheses be borne out, clinicians would be provided a basis for restricting antimicrobial use to specific subgroups of children who are most likely to benefit from it. Reduction of unnecessary antimicrobial use constitutes an important contribution to both individual and public health and is in accord with our long-term goal and that of NIAID. Absent a study of this nature, it seems likely that many children with uncomplicated viral URI will continue to be treated inappropriately with antimicrobials. This trial will offer a departure from an all-or-none approach to decision-making regarding antimicrobials for acute sinusitis, and permit a more nuanced, evidence-based approach."
"9281638","The goal of this project is to generate pathway-specific therapeutic inhibitors for the study and treatment of  complement-related diseases. Complement has been shown to play a role in various disorders ranging from  inflammatory (e.g., periodontitis), immune, and degenerative, diseases to sepsis. Also, complement-related  complications can be detrimental in biomaterial applications (e.g., hemodialysis) and transplant rejection.  While the potential of inhibiting complement has long been recognized, therapeutic options are still limited,  costly, do not include specific inhibitors of initiation and amplification steps, and are not readily available for  research. Hence, extension and diversification of the inhibitory arsenal is desired both for therapy and as  tools to dissect disease mechanisms. Starting from a panel of potent inhibitors discovered by our group or  publicly disclosed, this project aims at generating a complement inhibitor toolbox with broad use in the  studies of this P01. The C3 inhibitor compstatin, which blocks initiation, amplification, and effector pathways,  has shown clinical promise in many disease models, including transplantation, hemodialysis, and periodontitis,  yet its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and limited administration options render the use of this compound  challenging in certain applications. We will therefore optimize the PK parameters of compstatin and evaluate  its oral and subcutaneous administration in non-human primates. While inhibition of C3 has advantages, we  will also develop inhibitors that specifically block the classical and alternative pathways. For the former, we  will focus on a potent CIs-binding protein from leeches, which appears to bind both the catalytic and a potential  exosite on CIs. By characterizing the activity of this protein and derived peptides, we will generate  and optimize novel inhibitors for CIs. Based on factor H (FH) as a major host regulator of the alternative  pathway, we rationally engineered a streamlined inhibitor with unique targeting properties toward diseased  host cells and a potency that surpasses the parent protein FH. Terminal pathway inhibition will focus on anti-  C5 antibodies and peptidomimetics available to this group, and the toolbox will be completed by inhibitors  Of the lectin pathway, the clinically used regulator C1-INH, and anaphylatoxin receptor antagonists. Finally,  we explore novel strategies to direct complement inhibitors to foreign or diseased surfaces, where complement  activation mainly occurs. For this purpose, we will modify compstatin and a newly discovered FHbinding  peptide with anchors that allow attachment to cell membranes, self-cell surfaces, or biomaterials. All  inhibitors and targeting options will be characterized for efficacy and specificity, and selected compounds will  be subjected to production in Core B and evaluation in Projects 2 & 3. Our integrated inhibitor development  based on modular synthesis, potent lead structures and established techniques has high potential to pave  the way to new clinical complement inhibitors and will be of great use for the study of complement diseases."
"9323453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many basic cell functions that involve changes of cell shape and cell motion, such as during organism development or cancer cell metastasis, rely crucially on the properties of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin filaments in cells undergo constant assembly by polymerization and disassembly by severing and depolymerization. Large-scale actin filament network and bundle structures can have lifetimes much longer than those of individual filaments within them, as in lamellipodial protrusions where one third of all newly-formed actin filaments disassemble within 10 seconds, turning over before retrograde flow carries them through the lamellipodium. The short severed and depolymerizing actin filaments may diffuse and rebind to nearby filaments, a process that may determine the local network structure. In this project mathematical and computational models will be used together with experiments to study distributed actin turnover. Single Molecule Speckle (SiMS) microscopy allows dilute labeling of single proteins: when the fluorescent protein binds to the actin network t appears on an image as a speckle; when it is diffusing in the cytoplasm or on the membrane, it appears as a diffuse cloud. Thus SiMS provides a detailed view of reaction and diffusion in cells, which can be used in quantitative mathematical models to estimate concentration profiles, flows and actin network structure. Mathematical and computational models and SiMS will be combined to study kinetics of local remodeling in the lamellipodia and other cellular compartments such as adherens junctions. To study the molecular mechanisms that drive exploratory These remodeling dynamics are distributed in space. fluctuations of the actin cytoskeleton, lamellipodial protrusion and retraction will be used as a model system maintained in a steady state characterized by fluctuations in actin polymerization. Models will be developed to study the molecular mechanisms of positive feedbacks that amplify small fluctuations or perturbations as well the restorative mechanisms that maintain homeostasis and the role of slowly diffusible actin complexes in local regulation. To study the effect of local turnover on actn filament network structure, 3D models of remodeling networks will be tested against electron microscope tomography experiments. Finally, SiMS will be used together with mechanical perturbations of cells adhered to deformable substrates to model force transmission through dynamic actin networks as well as the effect of internal and external forces on actin turnover and network structure."

"9284454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in the US and many other countries. APAP produces liver cell death by a sequence of events that requires the early formation of a reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a subsequent phase where adducts of cellular and mitochondrial proteins are formed, and a final phase where these adducts trigger mitochondrial dysfunction and necrotic cell death. Administration of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) at the early phase can efficiently increase intracellular glutathione levels and scavenge NAPQI and protect against liver injury. However, patients frequently present only after this phase is over and there are no treatments available to prevent liver injury in the subsequent phases of pathogenesis. Our recent work has shown that cell survival in the later injury phases is dependent on the autophagy pathway, presumably because of the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria. Our preliminary data show that p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter referred to as p62) is recruited both to APAP-AD and damaged mitochondria and it induces their selective removal by autophagy. Our published data also show that liver-specific Atg5 knockout mice are resistant to APAP-induced liver injury even though they have defective autophagy. In this case, resistance results from the accumulation of p62 which results in persistent activation of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2. These data suggest that both autophagic and non-autophagic roles of p62 are involved in protecting against APAP-induced liver injury. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that selective p62-mediated autophagic removal of APAP-AD and damaged mitochondria and non-autophagic activation of Nrf2 are crucial to protect against the later phase of APAP-induced liver injury. To examine our hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: 1) determine the central role of p62 in autophagic removal of APAP-AD and damaged mitochondria in vivo and in primary mouse and human hepatocytes, 2) determine the autophagic and non-autophagic role of p62 in protection against APAP-induced liver injury, and 3) determine the induction of p62-mediated autophagy and non- autophagic activation of Nrf2 can promote the recovery from APAP-induced liver injury in a post-APAP treatment mouse model. Results from this study will lead to the in-depth understanding of p62-mediated autophagy and non-autophagic mechanisms in protecting against cell injury in the late phase of APAP-induced pathogenesis, which no treatment is available and NAC treatment is no longer effective. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of identifying novel therapeutic approaches for treating the late phase of APAP- induced liver injury and liver failure."
"9271229","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN), one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors, affects more than 78 million Americans. Compared to other races/ethnicities, African Americans are more likely to develop HTN and have lower rates of blood pressure (BP) control, increasing risk of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. African Americans are also more likely to utilize the emergency department (ED) for ambulatory care, a factor strongly linked with adverse cardiovascular events among patients with HTN. This high ED utilization may reflect poor access to primary care, and suggests the challenge people face regarding self-management. Because BP is routinely measured in the ED, it is an ideal setting to both identify patients with uncontrolled HTN and intercede, particularly in African American communities where regular interaction with the health care system may be lacking. Recommendations to improve HTN-related outcomes have been consistent for decades: maintain a healthy weight, reduce daily sodium intake, increase physical activity, and comply with antihypertensive therapy as prescribed. Despite tremendous evidence supporting these recommendations, facilitating the necessary behavior changes in patients with HTN remains a challenge, especially in African Americans who reside in urban, under-resourced settings. Daily intensive self-monitoring is efficacious and is often the cornerstone of many behavior change interventions; however, long-term sustainment can be difficult to achieve, especially in minority populations residing in urban, under-resourced communities. Mobile health (mHealth) has demonstrated success with behavior change, and may increase long-term self- monitoring. Given high cell phone adoption rates in minority communities, and higher rates of reliance on mobile Internet access, mHealth strategies are particularly well suited to urban African American populations. Currently, there exists traction among physicians and patients for mHealth HTN interventions, but such an approach to improve BP in hypertensive patients has not been tested. This study seeks to improve HTN-related outcomes in a cohort of African Americans with uncontrolled HTN between the ages of 25 and 55, and is guided by three specific aims. Aim 1: We will determine the efficacy of MI-BP, a comprehensive, multiple health behavior change mobile intervention, on BP control at one year in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention compared to paper-based self- monitoring and usual care controls. Aim 2: We will determine the effect of MI-BP on secondary outcomes (physical activity, sodium intake, medication adherence) compared to paper-based self- monitoring and usual care controls, in a one year RCT. Aim 3: We will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MI-BP compared to paper-based self-monitoring and usual care controls."
"9306148","?           DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mosquitoes are vectors of a number of human diseases representing a serious problem for public health worldwide. Half of the world's population is exposed to malaria while dengue fever is a permanent threat in over 100 countries with 50-100 million individuals infected each year. To control mosquito-transmitted diseases, mosquito populations have been traditionally controlled by use of chemical insecticides. However, this approach is threatened by new mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. The lack of vaccines or drugs to prevent or cure mosquito transmitted diseases underscores the need to develop alternative strategies to control mosquito population. A detailed understanding of mosquito biology is a prerequisite for the development of new vector control strategies. In this context, we propose to study the mechanisms of storage and mobilization of fat stores in the vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti. The importance of energy reserves for reproduction is obvious in mosquitoes, such as the adult female A. aegypti. These females store low levels of nutrients, and they need a blood meal to acquire additional nutrients to complete the reproductive cycle. Following a blood meal, protein and lipid reserves are synthesized in the fat body and transported to the ovaries via hemolymph. Lipid reserves are transported by lipophorin (Lp). A salient feature of A. aegypti is that Lp carries TG. This feature separates mosquitoes from most insects in which Lp carries diacylglycerol (DG). In this project we propose to investigate key aspects of lipid mobilization in A. aegypti. The transference of TG to the ovaries is a complex process that starts with the hydrolysis of TG (lipolysis) stored in the fat body by the action of lipases. No lipase has been associated to this process in mosquito so far. This step is followed by re-synthesis of TG and loading to Lp by uncharacterized mechanisms. Our preliminary studies in A. aegypti identified a set of lipases, two acyl-transferases, and the Lipid Transfer Protein (LTP) as components of the mechanisms by which TG stored in lipid droplets are mobilized. Further, TG storage in the fat body of larval mosquito involves Lipid Droplet Storage protein 1 (Lsd1). In contrast, Lsd2 is more prominent in the fat body of vitellogenic A. aegypti females. As part of our continuing studies to understand the process of mobilization of TG stores in insects, we propose the following three aims: 1- To identify the main fat body lipases involved in the mobilization of fat body TG in A. aegypti; 2-To define the roles of lipid droplet-associated proteins AaLsd1 and AaLsd2 in the accumulation and mobilization of TG; 3- To investigate the role of acyl-transferases and LTP in the mechanism of synthesis and the secretion of TG in A. aegypti. Knowledge on the metabolism of lipids in this vector mosquito could be applied to improve our understanding of several physiological aspects, such as the regulation of oogenesis, mosquito fitness and survival. These are relevant aspects to the development of innovative strategies to control vector mosquito population."
"9345988","PROJECT SUMMARY Eye Determinants of Cognition (EyeDOC) Study Rationale: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose enormous health and societal costs in our aging US population. While cerebral neural loss is known to contribute to Alzheimer's dementia, vascular diseases may contribute substantially to the total burden of dementia and its precursor, MCI. Small-vessel cerebrovascular changes, which are most strongly associated with cognitive impairments, are difficult to detect with brain imaging. However, recent technological advances in ocular coherence tomography (OCT) provide refined measures of the microvascular pathology and neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells which may provide sensitive biomarkers reflecting underlying cerebral processes. Design: The EyeDOC study will be nested in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), recruiting 1,000 participants (50% African-American) from two ARIC-NCS field sites (Jackson MS and Washington County, MD) to take part in a comprehensive vision assessment with photographic and OCT imaging of the retina. The EyeDOC visit will occur within 3 months of the ARIC NCS visit 6, and prior to ARIC NCS visit 7, capitalizing on the study's extensive neurocognitive testing and longitudinal design. Exposures: EyeDOC will contribute novel ocular measures to the rich ARIC NCS data including:  A. Degree of neurodegeneration marked by loss/thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex [GCC]  and the retinal nerve fiber layer [NFL] just outside the optic nerve head  B. Degree of microvascular pathology marked by a lower macular vessel density, enlarged area of  macular non-perfusion and lower average macular blood flow [flow index]. Outcomes: The late life cognitive outcomes available from ARIC-NCS include:  A. Decline in global cognitive ability, executive function/processing speed, memory, and language ?  assessed using neurocognitive testing in V5, V6 and V7.  B. Incidence of MCI, which was diagnosed in approximately 20% of the cohort in V5 and is expected to  affect a larger percentage at V6 and V7 due to advancing age of the cohort. Aims: We will assess the relationships of 1) retinal neurodegenerative measures with incident MCI and a pattern of cognitive decline consistent with Alzheimer's disease and 2) retinal microvascular abnormalities with incident MCI and a pattern of cognitive decline consistent with cerebral small vessel disease. Thus, the primary focus will be the impact of NFL thinning on a decline in memory and the impact of reduced capillary blood flow and non-perfusion area on a decline in executive function/processing speed. Summary: The EyeDOC study will demonstrate the potential of retinal biomarkers to inform the etiology of observed cognitive changes and provide a proof of concept for OCT to be used as an effective screening tool for determining the underlying cause(s) of cognitive aging."
"9282394","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to determine how cognitive deficits in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are related to differences in functional connectivity and white matter integrity in the brain.  AMD affects nearly 30% of Americans over age 75 and is associated with a two-fold increased risk of dementia. This team's previous NIH-funded work identified a strikingly prevalent cognitive deficit, even in non- demented AMD patients: poor verbal fluency. Yet there is a fundamental knowledge gap regarding the etiology of the link between AMD and cognitive deficits, and this gap impedes the development of strategies to reduce cognitive impairment in AMD. Our central hypothesis is that brain connectivity plays a critical role in understanding the link between AMD and cognitive deficits (e.g., verbal fluency). Specifically, the link may arise via two mechanisms: #1) vision changes from macular disease could have a negative effect on cognitive performance, or #2) a shared risk factor could promote damage in the brain and eye concurrently. These two mechanisms, which may both be at play, should be distinguished by different patterns of brain connectivity associated with AMD-related cognitive deficits. This will be the first study to combine longitudinal neurocognitive testing and brain imaging to better understand the extent and locus of brain changes in AMD.  The study will include 120 people with AMD plus 120 age-, gender-, and education-matched adults without AMD. All participants will receive baseline and 2-year neurocognitive tests and a subset will provide structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance images (MRIs) at each time point. Aim 1 uses a neurocognitive battery developed and piloted by the applicants to define AMD-related differences in cognition without using tasks that require vision. Aims 2 & 3 use measures of functional brain connectivity and region- specific white matter integrity derived from functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Aim 1. Characterize cognitive processes that contribute to verbal fluency deficit in AMD. We will construct regression models to test the extent to which verbal fluency performance in AMD reflects underlying cognitive deficits in semantic organization, processing speed, attention-switching, and memory. Aim 2. Identify differences in brain connectivity associated with verbal fluency, or its cognitive contributors. We will relate measures of cognitive ability to measures of intrinsic functional and structural connectivity in the brain. We will examie whether brain signatures associated with cognitive deficits differ among older adults with and without AMD. Aim 3. Identify cognitive profiles and brain signatures associated with cognitive decline in AMD patients. We will determine whether certain cognitive patterns or differences in specific neural networks, or both, predict AMD-related cognitive decline. Our working hypothesis is based on results of our pilot imaging study and favors mechanism #1: Verbal fluency deficit in AMD reflects problems in semantic organization and is related to differences in white matter tracts (primarily ventral) that support language, semantics, and vision."
"9352748","Epidemiological evidence suggests that education and lifelong literacy have strong benefits for cognition and health in later adulthood. There is also increased understanding of reading as engendering a highly active mental state that is underpinned by a cascade of neural activity. Finally, studies contrasting illiterates and literates within carefully matched populations also suggest that literacy plays an important role in shaping mind and brain. Yet, behavioral research on the benefits of leisure reading have been largely restricted to younger populations and to effects in the domain of language processing. Relatively little is known about the more acute effects of habitual reading in adulthood or the causal mechanisms through which literacy engagement might impact cognitive health in late life ? or the dispositional mechanisms through which such engagement is sustained. We request funding to initiate a research program on literacy-based interventions to enhance cognition and traits theorized to promote habitual engagement in intellectual challenge. In this exploratory (R21) project, we will examine whether a sustained period of reading engagement has measurable effects on cognition in later adulthood. Reading represents a readily accessible form of mental stimulation, and yet has received very little systematic study as a pathway to cognitive health. In this project, we will develop an electronic tablet app to present extended text materials and control activities (e.g., puzzles), as well as to record selections and time allocation. This technology will enable us (1) to use an experimental design to contrast the effects of a program of reading engagement against a non-reading active control on behavioral targets among adults with relatively underdeveloped literacy practices, where (2) these targets are (a) core language processes (e.g., fluency, efficiency of word recognition, improved semantic processing), (b) domain- general processes (e.g., working memory, episodic memory, executive control), and (c) selected dispositions (in particular, openness to experience). We will also explore (3) the extent to which the effects of acute literacy experience vary with pretest levels of literacy skills, literacy experience, and dispositional traits. This project will pave the way for a more systematic study of the long-term effects of literacy on cognitive health and its underlying mechanisms."

Moreover, individuals with co-occurring opioid dependence and anxiety disorders often experience poorer drug use, anxiety, and functional outcomes following treatment. Despite the links between opioid dependence and anxiety disorders and the risk associated with their co-occurrence, very little is known about this common dual diagnosis, and efficacious treatment options have yet to be established. Dr. Rebecca Kathryn McHugh's career goal is to conduct patient-oriented research focused on the co-occurrence of substance dependence and anxiety disorders. The integrated training and research plans proposed in this application will provide Dr. McHugh with advanced training in several critical areas needed to enhance her program of research toward this career goal. Under the mentorship of internationally renowned leaders in the field of substance dependence, training is targeted to the following domains: (1) clinical research in co- occurring disorders (Dr. Roger Weiss), (2) the nature and treatment of opioid dependence (Dr. Weiss), (3) behavioral treatment development and testing (Dr. Shelly Greenfield), (4) the role of stress in substance dependence (Dr. Rajita Sinha), and (5) longitudinal data analytic techniques (Dr. Garrett Fitzmaurice). These training objectives will be achieved through a combination of didactic and applied activities and through the application of these skills in a Stage 1 behavioral treatment development trial involving the development and pilot testing of a novel integrated cognitive behavioral treatment for co-occurring opioid dependence and anxiety (I-CBT). Target areas for learning in each training domain are directly linked to the specific aims of this researc study, which include (1) the development of an integrated cognitive behavioral treatment manual for opioid dependence and anxiety disorders (I-CBT), (2) pilot testing the efficacy of I-CBT for reducing opioid use and anxiety symptoms compared to standard CBT for opioid dependence, (3a) the examination of the association between pre-treatment reactivity to stress and opioid use outcomes following treatment, and (3b) the examination of changes in stress reactivity following treatment. McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School provide an ideal environment for the attainment of these training and research objectives, including clinical units supportive o patient-oriented research, seminars and courses in designating training areas, and a highly active Clinical and Translational Science Center with a wide array of resources for career development and training. This K23 Award would provide Dr. McHugh with a repertoire of advanced skills designed to complement her prior training and to provide an essential bridge between her prior experience and her career goal to conduct an active program of patient-oriented research as an independent scientist, toward the ultimate goal of reducing the public health burden of substance dependence and anxiety disorders."

"9329484","Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signi?cantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ?rst propose to fully develop our uni?ed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identi?ed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised renewal application requests 5 years of support for the Research Institute on Addictions Postdoctoral Training Program on Alcohol Etiology and Treatment. This interdisciplinary training program was established in 2000 and designed to provide six trainees with both general and individualized research training on the etiology and treatment of alcohol problems. The Core Faculty and Associated Faculty for the program include representation of such diverse yet complementary fields such as psychology (social, cognitive, educational, developmental, clinical), sociology, epidemiology, and the psychobiological sciences (clinical neuroscience, applied biopsychology, behavioral neuroscience). With this diverse faculty, we are able to provide trainees with a broad, yet deep, foundation of knowledge regarding the biological, psychological, and social aspects of alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. The program also provides training in ethical issues in research generally, as well as ethical issues specific to alcohol research. Critical aspects of grant writin, career development, and professional issues are also an important aspect of the training. The core of the program, which comprises approximately 80% of the trainees' time, is the individualized training in alcohol research in collaboration with a primary mentor, secondary mentor, and other faculty in the training program. This individualized training plan is developed by the trainee in collaboration with his/her mentor, and is based on the specific skills, interests and needs of the trainee. For all trainees, it includes development of manuscripts based on data collected in graduate school or other data available from their mentor or others at RIA. All individualized training plans also include grant development work, both for pilot grants as well as NIH submissions. Finally, it may also involve specialized statistical or methodological training, which may involve other faculty on the training grant, courses offered through the University at Buffalo, or through workshops or seminars offered at conferences or other universities. Over the 15 years of the training grant, the training program has become firmly established and the quality of the graduates has steadily grown. In the past ten years, 10 of the 20 trainees who have completed the program have assumed academic positions with colleges/universities, two have continued their research careers at RIA, and one is the Director of Research for an addiction center. Four of these trainees are currently at RIA, but will be assuming academic positions with universities this summer. Eight have received a career development or research grant award from NIH. During the period of their training, the group has published a median of six peer reviewed articles with the most recent graduates (last 5 years) having a median of eight."
"9380700","Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic postconditioning is defined as a protective series of brief episodes of ischemia-reperfusion subsequent to a prolonged ischemic insult. Thus far, the majority of experimental studies have focused on the acute mechanisms of ischemic postconditioning, mostly at 24 hours. However, effects and mechanisms of postconditioning in the brain for longer periods post-stroke remain to be fully elucidated. Our hypothesis states that ischemic postconditioning promotes neurovascular unit recovery after stroke, in part by augmenting the production of BDNF and MMP9 in astrocytes, thus promoting neurogenesis and angiogenesis. These factors may allow postconditioning to amplify neurogenesis and angiogenesis, hence improving stroke recovery. Our preliminary data showed that postconditioning is neuroprotective at 3 days and 2 weeks, increases neurogenesis and angiogenesis and elevates Akt, MMP9 and BDNF protein expression levels especially in reactive astrocytes within the peri-infarct cortex. We will build on these pilot data by pursuing 2 aims. Aim 1: Investigate effects of postconditoning on the ability of astrocytes to protect neurons in vitro. We will use primary cell cultures and media transfer experiments to test the hypothesis that postconditioning amplifies the ability of astrocytes to produce BDNF and MMP9, which then protects neurons and promotes their neuroplastic recovery after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Aim 2: Investigate the effects of postconditoning on astrocytic production of BDNF and MMP9 during stroke recovery in vivo. We will use rat models of focal cerebral ischemia to verify in vivo, the hypothesis that postconditioning increases astrocytic production of BDNF and MMP9 during stroke recovery. We will assess causality by blocking MMP9 and/or BDNF and tracking the subsequent effects on neurologic recovery. To test the hypothesis that postconditioning augments neurogenesis and angiogenesis via astrocyte-derived BDNF and MMP9, we will suppress astrocytic production of BDNF and MMP9, and then document the subsequent effects on neurogenesis, angiogenesis and correlate this with neurologic outcomes over time. We will also use astrocyte specific BDNF deficient mice to confirm our hypothesis, as suggested by previous reviewers. We expect that in KO mice the neuroprotective effect of ischemic postconditioning is in part prevented. Understanding the mechanisms of postconditioning in long-term stroke recovery is fundamentally required. This R03 allows a new PI to begin this line of investigation to further contribute to the development and translation of postconditioning as a therapeutic approach for stroke."
"9284453","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Newborns with high or low body fat at birth have an increased susceptibility to poor metabolic and/or cardiovascular health in childhood and adulthood. Unlike adult adiposity which is present in essentially all mammals, significant fat mass at birth is unique to humans among primates and mammals more generally, suggesting a recently evolved genetic component.  Fat accretion during development is modulated by maternal metabolic factors (e.g., glucose and triglycerides), but we have now determined that genetic factors also contribute to newborn human adiposity at birth. In a genome wide association study performed in a multi-ethnic cohort of newborns whose mothers underwent glucose testing during gestation we identified a locus on chromosome 3, 3q25.31, which exhibits association in multiple race groups with measures of newborn adiposity. The associated region is intergenic, and we are proposing to identify genetic variation within the locus to address the hypothesis that genetic variants within 3q25.31 affect the expression of long noncoding RNAs present in the locus. We will address this hypothesis by performing the following specific aims using DNA and phenotype data collected as part of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) Study. Aim 1:  To use targeted genomic capture and next generation sequencing to identify additional  common, low frequency and rare variants within 3q25.31 in a total of 800 newborns of Northern European,  Afro-Caribbean, Mexican-American and Thai ancestry in the upper and lower 10th percentiles for sum of  skinfolds, a measure newborn adiposity. Aim 2: To use high throughput approaches to define the impact of variants on gene expression and expression of lncRNAs within the chromosome 3 locus. Aim 3: To use comparative genomic approaches to define the underlying genetic architecture and function of the chromosome 3 locus in humans compared to other non-human primates. Aim 4: To demonstrate that variants which have a functional impact are associated with measures of newborn adiposity by genotyping the identified SNPs in up to 10,900 additional HAPO newborns from the four race groups. Accomplishing these aims will provide fundamental new insight into genetic factors regulating newborn anthropometric traits.  This will have important implications for fetal outcomes, long-term health of the newborn, and evolution of unique human traits important for the support of neonatal brain growth."
"9309015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The placenta is of paramount importance for reproductive success and placental defects present a major reproductive health challenge. The overall objective of the proposed work is to decode the regulatory circuitry of trophoblast differentiation that ensures proper placental development in humans and mice, a crucial but poorly understood area. BCOR encodes a component of a PRC1 Polycomb group repression complex that is essential for placental development in the mouse and it provides a powerful tool to identify new key developmental regulators of the circuitry underlying this process. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the BCOR-containing PRC1 complex is differentially deployed in trophoblast stem/progenitor cells and their progeny to silence key lineage-determining genes of alternate cell fates. This cell type-specific targeting of BCOR ensures that the trophoblastic cell types are established and maintain their differentiated fates and are present in appropriate numbers. This proposal will be able to get to the heart of early BCOR complex function from both developmental and mechanistic standpoints in both mouse and human due to the availability of many key in vivo and in vitro systems and reagents, including a Bcor conditional mouse allele and stem cell lines allowing conditional deletion of Bcor. The studies proposed here will tackle three key questions in three aims whose answers will fill major knowledge gaps about the circuitry of trophoblast differentiation 1) How does Bcor regulate the allocation of progenitor and differentiated cell fates in vivo? This aim will determine the fundamental in vivo role of Bcor in placental development and cell fate specification with a focus on progenitor cell compartments and cell type allocation. 2) Which networks of lineage-specific BCOR targets underlie the trophoblast differentiation circuitry and explain the Bcor mutant placental phenotype? This aim will define the BCOR functional targets in mouse cultured TS cells, primary human trophoblasts and BMP4-treated hESCs, and their differentiated progeny. Bioinformatic analysis of these data will identify key regulators of trophoblast differentiation an help define the regulatory architecture underlying placental lineage specification and how BCOR controls it. 3) What are the lineage-specific transcription factors (TF) that direct cell type-specfic targeting of the BCOR complex? This aim will identify BCOR complex-associated transcription factors in mouse and human trophoblast cell types and then test whether they contribute to cell type-specific recruitment to target genes. Success in these aims will generate fundamental knowledge about the circuitry underlying trophoblast differentiation and lineage-specific recruitment mechanisms of PcG complexes. This basic information will lead not only to a deeper understanding of early placental development, a process vital for health and reproduction, but also promises to inform the design of approaches to control the differentiation of stem cells."
"9266495","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The motor dysfunction of Parkinson's disease is usually described as the result of changes in the activity of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. However, recent research has shown that the heterogeneous family of thalamostriatal projections may also be strongly affected by the disease, and that these changes may contribute to the development of parkinsonian signs and symptoms. The most substantial thalamostriatal projection comes from the caudal intralaminar nuclei in the thalamus (the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei [CM/Pf]). The CM/Pf-striatal projection gives rise to clusters of axon terminals that target preferentially dendritic shafts of striatal projection neuros, as well as cholinergic interneurons. This projection may be prominently involved in the processing of reward information and in the regulation of vigilance and attention. Another major source of thalamostriatal fibers are the 'basal ganglia receiving' ventral anterior (VA) and ventrolateral (VL) nuclei. Neurons in these nuclei send long un-branched axons to the striatum, with many en passant-type varicosities. The impact of the VL-striatal projections on striatal function is unknown. Postmortem analysis of brain tissue from parkinsonian patients has demonstrated that the source nuclei of the thalamostriatal projection and the organization of their synapses in the striatum are strongly affected by the neurodegenerative process. Neurons in the CM/Pf are particularly affected, with degeneration of more than 50% of neurons early in the course of the disease. We have demonstrated that these aspects of neuron loss are faithfully replicated in MPTP-treated (parkinsonian) monkeys, along with a corresponding decrease in thalamostriatal terminals. In addition, there are extensive changes in the morphology and density of dendritic spines in the striatum, which are the primary recipients of VL input. The functional impact of these changes on striatal activity is not known, but is likely t be substantial, and, given the anatomical and pathological differences, may differ between the two projection systems. We propose to test this hypothesis with a combination of functional and anatomical studies in monkeys. The functional studies (aim 1) will make use of an optogenetic approach that will allow us to selectively activate terminals of the CM-striatal or VL-striatal projections, and to examine the resulting effects on the activity of striatal projection neurons an cholinergic interneurons in awake primates. These studies will first be done in the normal state, and then again after the animals have been rendered parkinsonian by treatment with MPTP. The functional studies will be complemented with quantitative electron microscopic analyses in the same animals, in which opsin expression will be used as an anatomic marker to identify parkinsonism-related changes in the postsynaptic targets of CM- or VL-striatal terminals (aim 2). The proposed studies will help us to gain a more complete understanding of the circuit pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and set the stage for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat Parkinson's disease through influencing specific thalamostriatal interactions."
"9274259","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines an integrative five-year training program for the candidate, Arnold Han, M.D., Ph.D., in his development as an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Han is clinically trained as a gastroenterologist and has a Ph.D. in immunology. He is doing postdoctoral research under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Davis, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University and Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In his proposal entitled The intraepithelial T cell response in celiac disease, Dr. Han aims to better understand celiac disease (CD), an incurable autoimmune disease that affects millions of Americans, and many more worldwide. The research further investigates the observation that intraepithelial T lymphocytes (T-IEL) in CD are deliberately recruited to the intestine in response to gluten. T-IELs are the cells held responsibl for the detrimental consequences of CD, including intestinal damage and lymphoma development. As a follow up, the proposal aims to better understand mechanisms through with T-IEL are activated and recruited to the intestine in CD. The research explores the hypothesis that gluten-specific CD4+ T cell responses enable T-IEL responses directed against antigens other than gluten. The proposed research investigates the nature and mechanisms of T-IEL responses in CD through the following aims: 1) Examine the mechanisms through which gluten enables ?? T cell activation in celiac disease through the study of ?? T cell function in peripheral blood and tissue. 2) Examine the mechanisms through which gluten enables tissue damage by CD8+ T cells in CD. 3) Analyze mechanisms through which T-IELs are activated and recruited to the intestinal epithelium through the study of antigen-specific T-IEL responses in humanized mouse models. These aims leverage Dr. Han's clinical training in gastroenterology, his post-doctoral research training in the study of human mucosal T cells, and the expertise of the Mark Davis laboratory and collaborators. Successful completion of these aims may ultimately enable the development of novel approaches in the prevention and treatment of CD and other autoimmune diseases. Concurrently, Dr. Han will complete a structured career development-training program, overseen by mentors within the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and other faculty at the Stanford University School of Medicine. This plan will include didactic, clinical, and managerial experience necessary to achieve Dr. Han's ultimate goal of becoming a successful, independent physician-scientist."
"9402766","Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency that afflicts 120-160,000 Americans each year, which can cause brain damage and contribute to mortality. Approximately one third of patients in SE are refractory to current therapies. We will investigate the role of AMPA receptor plasticity in benzodiazepine resistant SE using genetically modified mice, advanced imaging and electrophysiology; and we will test a novel therapy. In Aim 1, we propose to test whether a single seizure and SE enhance AMPAR mediated synaptic transmission in activated CA1 pyramidal neurons and the entorhinal cortex using patch clamp electrophysiology and biochemical techniques. The experiments in Aim 2 test the role of GluA1 plasticity in seizure spread and duration using global and conditional knockout mice. In Aim 3, we test the efficacy of IEM 1460, a drug that targets modified AMPA receptors, in terminating SE. This project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of SE initiation by repeated seizures. It will define the role of GluA1 subunit plasticity in seizure spread during benzodiazepine refractory SE; and provide the neurobiological basis for the development and use of drugs targeting calcium permeable AMPA receptors for terminating SE."
"9301022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a common event that is associated with poor patient outcomes. Yet, some hospitals have been consistently more successful in preventing and treating IHCA than others. While this is thought to be explained by the adoption of key strategies that improve care processes for IHCA, how these strategies are actually utilized in routine practice and the underlying factors contributing to their successful implementation remain largely unknown. Further, an integrative approach that examines strategies used during IHCA and those employed before and after these events has not been previously undertaken. This study will build on extensive prior work by our investigative team using the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)- Resuscitation registry and leverage our team's expertise in IHCA and qualitative research. The proposed HEROICA study will lay the foundation for future quality improvement efforts in IHCA by defining 'best practices' adopted by top-performing hospitals to address these events as well as potential barriers to their implementation. We will use a sequential mixed-methods approach to accomplish this goal, integrating quantitative and qualitative analyses. Its 3 Aims will: (1) identfy top- performing hospitals in preventing and treating IHCA within the GWTG-Resuscitation registry; (2) identify 'best practices' at the top-performing sites through semi-structured qualitative interviews; and (3) validate the practices associated with low IHCA incidence and high IHCA survival at top-performing sites. Findings from the study will be used to construct a toolkit of 'best practices' - the Code Blue Bundle. Upon successful completion of this research, we will partner closely with the American Heart Association (AHA) and the GWTG-Resuscitation registry to develop a national quality improvement program that will implement the Code Blue Bundle. Thus, the HEROICA study will increase the capacity of the NHLBI to improve outcomes for patients who suffer an IHCA by providing hospitals with practical and actionable strategies that can be implemented broadly to reduce the incidence and improve the survival of IHCA."
"9335998","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cerebrovascular Pathologies (CVP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies (ADP) (amyloid and tau) are the two principal processes that drive cognitive impairment in the elderly. Even though CVP features have been available for decades, there is no scheme that integrates the multiplicity of CVD features into a metric that has predictive power comparable to the AD biomarkers and correlates with cognitive functioning. The primary objective of this grant is to develop and validate an imaging based metric for quantifying CVP which we call the ?CVD scale? [CVD - Cerebrovascular Disease]. We will use a stepwise approach to develop several CVD scales based on incremental information going from simple to more complex MRI metrics - FLAIR (white matter hyperintensities (WMH), size and location of infarctions), T2* GRE (subcortical microbleeds), and DTI (Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity underlying WMH and surrounding WMH to measure white matter integrity). The models will be developed by weighting each of these imaging features according to their contribution to cognitive performance and the final CVD scale will be analytically selected based on its ability to predict cognition. We will use additional independent datasets to ensure the generalizability of our models and improve them if necessary. Since autopsy based scales for cerebrovascular lesions have not found to be predictive of cognition and/or difficult to evaluate antemortem, pathology outcomes will not be used for the development of the scale, but instead for confirmation. The secondary objective of the grant is to apply the CVD scale to understand a) the impact of sex, APOE4, and resilience measures (intellectual and physical activity lifestyle) on the evolution of CVP after accounting for traditional risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, smoking), and b) investigate interactions between CVP and ADP. We will capitalize on the existing population-based and prospective Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) cohort and acquire new imaging data (PIB PET, Tau PET, MRI) for the development of the CVD scale. The population- based nature of the MCSA sample is ideally suited for the development and generalizability of the scale because it captures the range of CVP. One of the strengths of the proposal is the planned dissemination of the CVD scale to the scientific community."
"9185974","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial arteriovenous lesions (AVLs) - i.e. dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) - are an important, treatable cause of long-term neurological disability and death. They are characterized by direct passage of blood from arteries to veins (shunting). dAVFs (Fig. A) are acquired arteriovenous shunts within the wall of a dural venous sinus, supplied by dural arteries, whereas AVMs (Fig. B) are congenital lesions, characterized by a nidus (latin: 'nest') of malformed vessels in which arteries are connected directly to veins, without an intervening capillary bed. Once an AVL is diagnosed, characterization is necessary for treatment planning and risk stratification; delineation of venous drainage in particular is important for prognostication. Due to the inaccuracy and lack of spatio-temporal resolution of non-invasive methods, the current standardof- care test for the diagnosis and characterization of AVLs is catheter-based digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Due to the non-specific clinical presentation of AVLs, which includes intracranial hemorrhage (ICH - the most dreaded complication), seizures and objective pulsatile tinnitus, many patients without an AVL end up undergoing DSA. This invasive procedure, which is usually performed as a stand-alone diagnostic procedure prior to any endovascular therapy, is costly (approx. $75,000), requires highly specialized physicians and infrastructure, and carries a risk to the patient of complications. A non-invasive method that can sensitively detect AVLs would allow DSA to be avoided in the large number of patients with a suspicious clinical presentation in whom the diagnosis can be confidently excluded. Accurate noninvasive delineation of venous drainage would also allow treatment planning to be performed without the need for a preliminary, diagnostic DSA. In addition to avoiding the risks of an invasive procedure and ionizing radiation, an MR-based method would also be more accessible, decrease demand on neuro-interventional services, and translate to cost reduction as it is much cheaper (approx. $5,000) than a DSA. Preliminary results indicate that arterial spin label (ASL) MRI demonstrates AVLs with high conspicuity, due to passage of labeled blood into the draining veins in the setting of arteriovenous shunting. However, current ASL methods do not allow dynamic imaging of the passage of labeled blood through the cerebral vasculature, which is necessary for AVL characterization. The goal of this project is therefore: to develop robust time-resolved pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL)-based angiography and perfusion MR methods; and validate the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of these methods, when added to a routine MR protocol, for the detection and venous drainage characterization of AVLs. In Aim 1 we will develop a new pCASL-based MR angio sequence with a segmented cine readout using 3D cones trajectories and compressed sensing; the sequence will be expanded to also perform perfusion imaging. Aim 2 is to assess the improvement in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AVLs when pCASL is added to standard MR protocols. Aim 3 is to assess the accuracy of pCASL methods for delineation of the venous drainage pattern. The study end-point is a new MR protocol augmented by pCASL methods together with scan parameter recommendations based on comparative assessment of the diagnostic yield of pCASL methods. In summary, we aim to create a new, clinically feasible, time-resolved pCASL MR angiographic and perfusion imaging method with high spatio-temporal resolution. We seek to establish whether this technique is comparable to DSA in terms of: sensitivity for the detection, and reliability for the delineation of venous drainage. If so, this would obviate the need for purely diagnostic DSA prior to treatment, a radical and disruptive change in the workup of AVL patients, with high impact on cost savings, dose reduction and quicker access to diagnosis and (if needed) intervention/surgery."
"9257208","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY There is a growing recognition that acute hospitalization contributes to long-term disability for hospitalized older adults-who are 60 times more likely to develop disability than those who are not hospitalized. Older Veterans are particularly vulnerable to functional decline after hospitalization, as this population has lower function and more comorbidities than age-matched peers. Home Health (HH) physical therapy may be the ideal venue for addressing these mobility deficits. However, as currently structured, these services do not appear to adequately address deconditioning often resulting from acute hospitalization as evidenced by poor functional recovery, and poor community and home mobility, up to 2 years after acute hospitalization. A more intensive approach to HH physical therapy delivered within the immediate post-hospitalization period in older Veterans has great potential to maximize physical function, home and community mobility, and quality of life. Therefore, we have developed a short duration, progressive high intensity therapy (PHIT) intervention that directly addresses the functional deficits seen after acute hospitalization. We propose to conduct a two-arm, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 150 older adults with hospital-associated deconditioning, discharged from acute care and referred to HH physical therapy. Participants will receive either 1) an intensive, PHIT intervention using resistance exercise and evidenced- based motor control training to improve mobility or 2) usual care (UC) physical therapy. The primary goal of this investigation is to determine if PHIT intervention, initiated upon hospital discharge, improves functional mobility more than UC physical therapy. Secondary goals include evaluation of quality of life, life-space mobility, ADL performance, and caregiver burden. Treatment will occur at home during the first 30 days following hospital discharge with testing at: baseline (after hospita discharge), 30 days, 60 days (primary endpoint), 90 days, and 180 days after hospitalization. If successful in improving patient function, PHIT intervention holds potential for future health care cost savings by reductions in the need for formal caregiving services and institutionalization in the older Veteran population."

"9347295","Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing."
"9298675","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Ischemic heart disease (IHD) or myocardial ischemia, is a disease characterized by tissue hypoxia due to reduced blood supply to the heart muscle, usually caused by coronary artery disease. IHD is the leading cause of death and morbidity in the USA. Increase in coronary vessel diameter by vasodilatation (acute response), and increase in vessel density (delayed response) are two major defenses of myocardium from ischemic insults. While coronary vasodilatation is primarily dependent on endothelium-generated nitric oxide (NO), the increase in capillary density initially requires proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often observed in many cardiovascular diseases, including IHD, giving rise to the notion that ROS cause endothelial dysfunction. However, recent major interventional clinical trials using antioxidants (e.g. HOPE, ATBC), have largely produced negative results in reducing primary endpoints of cardiovascular death and morbidity. Reports from our lab demonstrated that reduced ROS levels inhibited signal transduction events that are essential for NO generation in the vascular endothelium and for coronary vasodilatation. Preliminary Results also showed that c-Src responds to changes in endothelial redox levels and promotes downstream Pl3K-Akt signaling, which in turn activates eNOS and inhibits the growth inhibitory transcription factor, FOXOi, in coronary vascular ECs. This application will test a novel HYPOTHESIS that conditional increase in endothelium-specific-ROS will activate c-Src-Pl3K-Akt-eN0S pathway and inhibit FOXO1, and thus, will result in coronary vasodilatation and increased vessel density in a myocardial ischemia model in vivo. Utilizing a newly developed binary transgenic mice that can induce conditional expression of Nox2 and 2-fold increase in ROS in vascular endothelium, we will determine whether EC-ROS activate c-Src-Pl3K-Akt signaling, proliferation and migration of mouse heart ECs in vitro (Aim 1); whether EC-ROS induce Pl3K-Akt-eNOS activation, NO synthesis and coronary vasodilatation (Aim 2); and whether EC-ROS increase vessel density in ischemic myocardium in an LAD ligation model in vivo (Aim 3)."
"9276069","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions): Towards advancing Center and Institute investigations (and continued Center development), our Progenitor Cell Analysis Core provides expert services, training, instrumentation and resources in three related areas: i) analytical flow cytometry, together with FACS and MACS cell isolation services; ii) high through-put colony/cell imaging, fluorimetry, and luminometry; iii) services/resources for stem & progenitor cell culture, including unique cell populations, plus ES cells and approved cell lines. Several core supported services (eg, flow cytometry and FACS) are indispensable, unique components, and are used widely by Center and Institute investigators. Combined instrumentation as a BD FacsCalibur flow cytometer plus FACSAria-2 cell sorter (near-UV laser) enable complex four color multi-parameter analyses. This includes cell surface markers, as well as (co-) analyses of cell cycle parameters, apoptosis, phosphoprotein signaling, ROS, calcium flux and a number of additional informative cell properties. Our expert staff are also skilled in the enrichment and isolation of rare cell sub-populations (eg, using combined MACS plus FACS approaches). In addition, this core supports basic analyses (and manipulations of) progenitor cell populations (Vicell system, injectable multi-well luminometer, fluorimeter, electroporation/transfection units). Recently, we also have launched several innovative cell-based analyses, with cell and colony scanning via STEMvision as one example. With regards to services and resources for the culture and manipulation of stem and progenitor cells, these benefit further from a dedicated tissue culture facility (Zeiss and Evos fluorescent microscopy systems, cell culture hoods and incubators, hypoxia chambers, clinical centrifuges, specialty reagents). Our Progenitor Cell Analysis Core also interacts directly with Center and Institute cores in Histopathology, Molecular Phenotyping, Confocal Microscopy and Viral Vectors; facilitates productive multi-unit interactions; provides vital roles in new Center and Institute faculty recruitment; and continues to advance our biomedical research investigations (together with nationally competitive grant applications)."
"9276068","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):   The Molecular Phenotyping core provides instrumentation, training, and services for in vitro cell phenotyping. Specifically, we provide facilities and training for automated nucleic acids purification, microarray analysis, quantitative PCR, and automated immunofluorescence cell marker analysis and screening. In addition to maintaining facilities essential for the many NIH-funded investigators working at MMCRI, planned developments such as resources for analysis of next generation sequencing data and laboratory automation for high density microplate formats will ensure that the core keeps in step with investigators' needs. An efficient workflow for the analysis of gene expression from RNA preparation through transcriptome analysis, and validation of candidate genes has been established. The core facility provides equipment, training, and supplies for all steps in the process with the exception of microarray processing, which is provided by Vermont Genetics Network in a regional collaborative agreement. Both manual and automated epifluorescence microscopy is also provided by the facility. Currently we provide live cell time-lapse microscopy, and microscopy based screening in 6- to 96-well formats, and additional applications such as cell cycle analysis are in development. The core provides image analysis workstations running Metamorph and Image J, and training in specific applications of these software packages. Quantitative image analysis of tissue immunostaining is being provided in collaboration with the Histopathology Core (Lindner). Future developments of our transcriptome analysis capabilities will be in the following areas: i) Transition from 96- to 384-well format. Essential equipment including 384 well real-time PCR instrument and liquid handling station is available in the facility, and users are currently piloting the new platform, ii) Providing an analysis platform for Next Generation Sequencing data. In the cellular analysis area we will be focusing on increasing the number of analyses we can provide users of our automated microscopy platform. Furthermore, we will be transitioning to a 384 well format for microscopy-based screening applications. Longer term core development will be based on feedback from the user base, and input from the internal and external advisory committees of the COBRE."
"9273508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rectoanal incontinence (RI) is one of the most debilitating gastrointestinal motility disorders affecting the elderly. A decrease in tone or stiffess of the smooth muscle of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) occurs with age and contributes to RI. Studies to date from our lab have provided insight into the regulatory control of IAS. In this competitive renewal application we propose to delineate novel control mechanisms of IAS muscle tone that can be targeted therapeutically. We will test the central hypothesis that miRNA regulation of RhoA/ROCK and SM22 is mechanistically linked to the age-dependent decrease in IAS tone and to RI, and that therapeutic targeting of miRNAs can increase IAS tone in vivo. We will establish differences in the signaling and contractile properties among multiple smooth muscle types of the lower GI tract; and in IAS as a function of age. Using both human and rat IAS, we propose studies to (Aim: 1) identify those intracellular signaling molecules that regulate IAS tone, and (Aim 2) identify miRNAs that regulate these intracellular signaling molecules, and develop strategies to reverse the miRNA-regulated decrease in IAS tone with age. We will establish multiple layers of control, focusing on the role of miRNAs as critical regulators of RhoA, RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK) and SM22. Preliminary biochemical and functional data support our hypothesis asserting the roles of RhoA, ROCK, and SM22 in determining SM tone among different SM types and age groups, while miRNA microarray analyses identify miR-139-5p and miR-1 as important regulators of ROCK and SM22 expression, respectively. Our robust approach includes cell, tissue, and in vivo models, enabling coordinated analysis of the miRNA-dependent proteome and signaling changes with functional effects. Beyond the unquestionable significance of the theme, the strengths of this proposal include: 1) exploration of novel mechanisms that explain the decrease in the IAS tone with age; 2) a comprehensive and coordinated omic, signaling and functional analysis that spans the reductionist- integrative spectrum; and 3) the development of a feasible therapeutic strategy for a disease that is currently untreatable."
"9294113","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemoglobinopathies including sickle cell disease (SCD) and ?-thalassemia are the most common genetic disorders in the United States. SCD patients benefit from fetal hemoglobin (HbF; ?2?2) induction to ameliorate clinical symptoms, decrease mortality and prolonged survival and quality of life. Treatment options for SCD are insufficient because therapeutic approaches to correct nitric oxide depletion and endothelium dysfunction attempted and failed at reversing the downstream negative effects of SCD. The FDA approved Hydroxyurea therapy was HbF inducing along with anti-inflammatory properties; unfortunately, Hydroxyurea is effective in only half of SCD patients. A critical barrier to progres in developing new and additional effective treatment options for SCD are gaps in knowledge and understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in ?-globin gene regulation. Our goal is to design novel molecular treatment strategies for SCD by beginning to address the gap in knowledge and understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in ?-globin gene regulation. Our central hypothesis is that alteration in stage-specific DNA-binding protein motifs mediated by heritable genetic mutations, produced chromatin modifications conducive to persistent HbF expression after birth. Our approach to the problem is built upon knowledge gleaned from naturally occurring mutations producing hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) expression phenotypes. Our objectives are to 1) determine the genomic interplay among known enhancers and a newly identified fetal chromatin domain and novel DNA- binding proteins in ?-globin regulation during human hemoglobin switching; and 2) discover plasma protein biomarkers and inherited genetic modifiers associated with HPFH in SCD. Our expected outcomes include: 1) development of molecular strategies for HbF induction for the treatment of SCD; 2) generation of experimental data to fill knowledge gaps about ?-globin regulation; 3) discovering novel plasma protein biomarkers and inherited genetic modifiers associated with HPFH in SCD that can act as an in vitro predictive surrogate of response to HbF inducing agents. Our impact on SCD medicine will include 1) creation of a new paradigm of molecular mechanisms involved in globin gene regulation during development; 2) characterization of a novel fetal chromatin domain and its interaction with other known regulatory regions and 3) discovery of transcription factors that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis there exist a fetal chromatin domain involved in ?-globin regulation during erythropoiesis. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that plasma proteins associated with HPFH are expressed at different levels in SCD and that transcription factors mediating HPFH have altered expression to modulate HbF production. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that KLF1 activates negative transcriptional regulators of ?-globin expression during fetal erythropoiesis."
"9282382","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to determine the resilient and vulnerable components in the aging- or disease-induced functional decline of neuromuscular transmission, using the powerful Drosophila genetic model system. An integrated approach at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels can reveal the roles of key genes that exert critical influences on the aging process, including Sod, whose homologue in humans is implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gherig's disease). We found a striking, robust life-span extension and improved motor ability through social interaction in Sod mutants upon co-housing with younger, active flies. These plastic phenotypes, readily quantified and manipulated, provide a sensitized system to unravel the major interacting genetic networks underlying the aging process and to identify potential neuroprotection mechanisms against the functional decline in neuromuscular transmission. To facilitate the study of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in aging adults, we recently developed a dissected preparation of adult abdominal NMJs that is accessible to paradigms and manipulations previously established for larval NMJs that have elucidated much of the genetic, molecular and cellular bases. A multidisciplinary approach with the tools and protocols developed in our labs will facilitate correlation of data at different levels, using transgenic flies for targeted expression or disruptin in pre- and post-synaptic neurons, muscle, and glia. Our Aims are: (1) Systematic studies on the aging-susceptible and aging-resilient physiological parameters to uncover the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of age-related functional decline in the new adult abdominal NMJ preparation. We will correlate electrophysiological and optical imaging measurements to reveal major modifications in presynaptic motor axon terminals, synaptic contacts, and postsynaptic muscle during aging. (2) Impacts of hyperexcitability mutations on age-related decline of NMJ function using mutants that have been well studied in larval NMJ and adult escape and flight circuits. Neuronal hyperexcitability has been implicated along with ROS stress in aging neurons. We will analyze pre- and post-synaptic elements using several hyperexcitability mutants of K+ channels implicated in ROS stress sensitivity or redox regulation, including the redox-senstive Sh IA and slo BK channels. (3) Centering on Sod, we will ask: i) how Sod and related mutations in redox regulation modify the progression of NMJ functional decline; and ii) how interacting genes of Sod act in a genetic network. We will investigate how modifications in NMJ properties reflect the striking plasticity of Sod phenotypes through social interaction. Integration of result from molecular investigations, neuronal and circuit physiology, and automated behavioral analysis will facilitate the discovery of key Sod interacting genes and may reveal promising targets for neuroprotective manipulations."
"9282384","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation and maintenance of neuromuscular synapses requires a mutual exchange of signals between motor neurons and muscle fibers, which is essential for the assembly and stability of a highly specialized postsynaptic membrane and a highly differentiated nerve terminal, critical for fast, robust and reliable synaptic transmission. Agrin, Lrp4, MuSK and Dok-7 are required both to form and to maintain neuromuscular synapses. As such, a reduction in their expression or activity may be responsible for the simplification and loss of nerve terminals and disassembly of the postsynaptic membrane during aging. One attractive hypothesis suggests that proteolytic cleavage of Agrin, releasing the C-terminal Lrp4-binding region of Agrin from the synaptic cleft, contributes to synaptic disassembly during aging. We will directly test this idea in the first aim.In the second aim, we will determine whether the expression of other key signaling components, Lrp4, MuSK and Dok-7, as well as the level of MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, decreases during aging. In the third aim, we will determine whether boosting synaptic signaling with an agonist antibody to MuSK, which stimulates MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation independent of Agrin and Lrp4, slows or halts the deterioration of neuromuscular synapses during aging. The experiments described here should provide new insights into the mechanisms that control synaptic disassembly during aging and have the potential to identify a novel therapeutic strategy for preserving the structure and function of neuromuscular synapses and reducing sarcopenia."
"9280929","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incidences of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have reached epidemic proportions, with ~8.3% of the US population diagnosed and 79 million more exhibiting pre-diabetes - a reminder of the urgent need for solutions. Halting pre-diabetes development and progression to T2D requires a multi-pronged approach, since the pathophysiology involves both peripheral insulin resistance and pancreatic ? cell dysfunction. Each of these processes is rate-limited by the abundance of exocytosis t-SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) proteins. Relatedly, a recent human islet study suggests that increasing expression of exocytosis proteins, such as the t-SNARE protein Syntaxin 4 (Syn4), may lead to improved regenerative approaches to treat diabetes. Loss of Syn4 abundance and/or its activity is associated with diabetes in human and rodent islets and skeletal muscle, tissues which regulate insulin release and insulin sensitivity, respectively. Thus, the long-term goal is to understand how Syn4 can be manipulated for treatment and prevention of prediabetes and T2D. Discovery of ways to target Syn4 abundance/activation to control glycemic dysregulation and prediabetes offers a tantalizing opportunity for disease intervention. The objective of this application is to determine how Syn4 enrichment/activation functions to enhance ?-cell insulin secretion and skeletal muscle insulin action both in vivo and at the molecular level, and how Syn4 abundance in these tissues is regulated. Preliminary data show that Syn4 protein is limiting for human islet insulin secretion; islets enriched with Syn4 more effectively reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Moreover, T2D human islets are ~40% deficient in Syn4 protein, as are islet and muscle cells of diabetic mice. Notably, restoration of Syn4 to human T2D islets can fully rescue insulin secretion. Syn4-enriched mice also resist age-and high-fat-diet induced insulin resistance. The central hypothesis is that diabetogenic stimuli underlie Syn4 deficiency to impair key regulated exocytosis events in ? cells and skeletal muscle cells, and that Syn4 upregulation can boost these processes to rescue/resist stress associated with prediabetes and T2D. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known how Syn4 enrichment promotes and/or protects functional ? cell mass and peripheral insulin sensitivity, and how Syn4 abundance is regulated, that Syn4 can be manipulated to avert disease in the face of diabetogenic stimuli. Three Specific Aims are developed to test this: 1) Evaluate Syn4 upregulation in prevention/reversal of diabetogenic-induced ?-cell dysfunction, 2) Delineate how Syn4 enrichment/activation in skeletal muscle promotes insulin sensitivity, and 3) Determine the mechanistic basis for attenuated Syn4 expression in pre/diabetic tissues. Aims will be accomplished using innovative inducible ?-cell- and skeletal muscle-specific Syn4 transgenic mice challenged with diabetogenic stimuli, peptide activators of endogenous Syn4, and live-cell imaging biosensors paired with biochemical assays using human tissues. Results will positively impact efforts to ameliorate disease as the identified mechanisms are highly likely to provide new therapeutic targets."
"9282385","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As humans age, we experience inevitable physiological changes in many areas, including motor activity. In fact, age-dependent progressive decline in motor activity represents one of the most prominent physiological changes in aging animals and humans. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are the functional units that connect motor neurons and muscles. Deficits at NMJs are believed to underlie age-dependent decline in motor function. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms by which NMJs undergo functional decline during normal aging are not well understood. It also remains a challenge as to whether and how intervening functional decline at NMJs can improve motor function in the elderly and ultimately extend lifespan. The nematode C. elegans has recently emerged as a good model system for aging studies because of its short lifespan and amenability to genetic manipulation. During aging, C. elegans also exhibits many aging phenotypes that resemble those found in higher organisms, including the age-related decline in motor activity. However, the same question arises as to what mechanisms may underlie the progressive decline in motor activity observed in aging worms. Recently, we have performed the first functional analysis of the aging motor neurons and muscles throughout the lifespan of C. elegans. Our results suggested that the progressive decline in the synaptic vesicle fusion followed by that in quantal size and vesicle docking/priming of motor neurons significantly contribute to the age-related functional decline of NMJs. Therefore, in this proposal, we aim to further address the following unanswered questions (Aim 1): What are the mechanisms underlying the observed functional decline in synaptic vesicle fusion in motor neurons in early life? Do muscles contribute to the observed functional decline in motor neurons? A long-term goal of our research is to ultimately develop new therapeutic strategies that could prevent or delay the age-related declines in mobility and increases in fatigability that often occur in the elderly population. Thus, in the second part of this proposal, we will focus on investigating whether applying genetic (Aim 2) and pharmacological (Aim 3) interventions specifically targeting the motor neuron synaptic transmission to aged worms can ameliorate NMJ functional decline and ultimately extend lifespan."
"9265842","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food hubs are an emerging and increasingly popular approach to reduce obesity trends by improving diet through increased access to nutritious foods. Food hubs offer a wide variety of healthy foods for purchase by both consumers and other food retailers (e.g., corner stores), and typically operate on a value-based business model that prioritizes both economic development and community benefit. Food hubs may be particularly impactful in food desert communities that have limited or no access to traditional food retailers, are low income, and have high rates of obesity. However, there is currently no evidence of the influence of a food hub on dietary behaviors related to preventing and reducing obesity. This study will provide programmatic and policy-relevant evidence to close this gap by taking advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity to evaluate a newly forming food hub that will be established through two independent grants awarded to the community (not the research team) in late 2014. The new food hub will open in October 2015, and this rapid response study will provide a chance to collect baseline data prior to opening. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that the food hub will improve both physical and social access to nutritious foods, which will improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable consumption, and caloric intake among people living near the new food hub. Using a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures, changes in diet will be compared between primary food shoppers living in the intervention community receiving the new food hub to those in a matched control community. Dietary changes will be measured at three time points (baseline and 12 and 24 months post food hub) using the Nutrition Data System for Research, the gold standard for assessing 24-hour dietary recalls to examine individual-level changes. At each time point, three dietary recalls will be collected to provide more accurate estimates. The study will examine changes in the three diet outcomes (e.g., diet quality, FV consumption, caloric intake) between residents in the two communities, will assess the extent that psychosocial factors explain these changes, and, among residents in the intervention community, will examine the dose-response relationship between food hub use and changes in diet using objective measures of food hub shopping. Additionally, this research will contribute to the science of food environment interventions to prevent or reduce obesity by assessing the impact of the new food hub on the broader food retail environment. Finally, the study will contribute to the science and practice of implementing food hub interventions by examining how the specific intervention components (such as healthy food incentives, healthy food community organizers, cooking clubs, etc.) are implemented and received by the community as well as intended and unintended consequences. Findings will provide evidence about the extent to which food hub interventions contribute to changes in diet among people living in low-income, urban communities, and will offer guidance for reducing obesity trends and inequities."
"9282777","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to better understand how the adult colonic stem cell population responds to Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-active toxicants in terms of stem cell-related phenotypes, energy metabolism, and the initiation and progression of colon cancer following exposure to AhR ligands in vivo. Adult somatic stem cells of the colon are of particular interest because they sustain self-renewal and are target cell for cancer initiating mutations. Perturbations in colon stem cell differentiation/plasticity, stem ell location/proliferation, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are generally believed to represent the earliest step towards colon tumorigenesis. Since the AhR and its ligands are known to affect hematopoietic stem cells and gastrointestinal biology, we propose to investigate the role of signaling through the AhR on colon stem cell dynamics and function. We will specifically focus on AhR-active toxicants, prototypical dietary AhR ligands and metabolites generated from dietary tryptophan by the microbiota (exogenous and endogenous ligands for the AhR, respectively). Since a majority of the AhR ligands are agonists and/or antagonists for the AhR in a tissue- and concentration- specific manner, we hypothesize that the combined agonist and antagonistic role of AhR ligands are important determinants in colon stem cell dynamics and responses. This is supported by our preliminary studies, which demonstrate for the first time that AhR ligands significantly influence colonic stem cell homeostasis and gene expression. The proposed experiments are novel and relevant because the impact of exposures to exogenous AhR ligands and their interactions with AhR-active intestinal endogenous AhR ligands on adult intestinal stem cell biology has not been determined. The following specific aims will be addressed: (1) Determine the agonist and/or antagonist activity of AhR-active toxicants and dietary AhR ligands on intestinal stem cell responses using colon cancer cell lines and an ex vivo organoid culture system; (2) Investigate the effect of microbiota-derived AhR ligands and their interactions with environmental toxicants and dietary ligands on intestinal stem cell responses in vivo and ex vivo; and (3) Quantify the number and spatio-temporal location of stem cells, DNA damage and targeted deletion in the colonic crypt at the initiation and progression stages of colon carcinogenesis following exposure to AhR ligands in vivo. Utilization of both in vivo and ex vivo models will allow us to dissect the effects of AhR ligands in the presence or absence of the AhR."

"9274964","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has been studied extensively but. Disease mechanisms involve cross-talk amongst pathogens and various host cell types (luminal epithelial cells, enteric nerve cells, resident immune cells, fibroblasts, microvascular endothelia cells and circulating leukocytes, inter alia). Amongst these, intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (IMEC) may play a central role in the progression of the disease by modulating infiltration of circulating immune cells and providing nutrients for inflammation resolution and tissue repair. Activated IMEC secrete various pro- inflammatory mediators and express cell-cell adhesion molecules that facilitate leukocyte infiltration. In addition, increased microvessel formation (angiogenesis) during colitis could promote inflammation and impact tissue regeneration/healing. Vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) has been shown to play important roles in experimental colitis. In our initial efforts to profile VEGF/VPF-induced genes in cultured human endothelial cells HUVEC, we found that the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 was highly induced in these cells. Nur77 has been shown to play important roles in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The goal of this application isto test the hypothesis that Nur77 modulates colitis by regulating the functions of intestinal microvascular endothelium: such as microvessel permeability, angiogenesis and leukocyte transendothelial migration. To this end, we have shown that Nur77 is highly induced in acute trisnitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) experimental colitis. Further, high levels of Nur77 are present in the colons of patients with IBD, when compared to non-inflamed colonic tissues. The present application will investigate how Nur77 specifically regulates endothelial functions and impacts progression of colitis. We propose that Nur77 expression in IMEC and infiltrating immune cells might play an important role in regulating acute intestinal inflammation. Aim 1 will examine several models of colitis in mice express Nur77 exclusively in endothelial cells. Aim 2 will determine the role of VE-cadherin-based adherens junction in colitis. Aim 3 will dissect out regulatory mechanisms of VE-cadherin expression by Nur77. Several genetic approaches include generation of inducible endothelial specific transgenic mice to express wild-type Nur77 and dominant negative Nur77 on both wild-type and Nur77-null backgrounds. Our studies have high impact by linking Nur77 to IBD pathogenesis and indicate vascular components of inflammation that could serve as therapeutic targets."
"9275298","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to improve the Medicare eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services in prescription drug (Part D) benefits has been highlighted recently when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released their proposed 2015 rules for Part D plans. In this document, CMS credited our team's series of findings on disparity implications of the current MTM eligibility criteria among the main reasons to change MTM eligibility. Combining medication review and treatment planning, MTM services were implemented by CMS in 2006 as a part of Part D based on the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) and have been shown to significantly improve pharmacotherapy outcomes. MTM services are long overdue because drug-related morbidity/mortality is an age-old and costly public health problem, particularly among the elderly. However, as we have shown, Medicare MTM eligibility criteria are an institutionalized cause for disparities: the drug use/cost basis of MTM eligibility means that racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to qualif because, given the same health status, Blacks and Hispanics tend to use fewer drugs/incur lower drug costs than Whites. The recently proposed 2015 MTM eligibility criteria merely lower the drug use/cost thresholds within MMA statutory framework, and, thus, are unlikely to address these disparities. Moreover, MMA MTM eligibility criteria recently were found ineffective in capturing suboptimal-therapy problems such as drug nonadherence.  The goal of this project is to address these issues by finding equitable and effective MTM eligibility criteria. Effectiveness is essential for realizing MTM's potential, and equality of access is the most widely- used definition of equity in policy documents. Specific Aim 1: To test whether using Star Ratings criteria, which we propose based on the medication safety/adherence measures in the CMS Part D Star Ratings system, can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in MTM eligibility. Specific Aim 2: To compare the effectiveness of the MTM eligibility criteria under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and MMA in identifying patients with medication utilization issues. We will compare them on sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive/negative), and the receiver operating characteristic curves. ACA MTM eligibility criteria are important to analyze, as recognized by CMS, because these criteria incorporate medication utilization issues within the MMA MTM eligibility framework. Specific Aim 3: To examine the comparative effectiveness of the MTM eligibility criteria under ACA and MMA in identifying medication utilization issues across racial and ethnic groups. We will also examine predictors for disparities and conduct disease-specific analyses. We will use 2013 Medicare Part D data linked to Parts A and B claims, the Master Beneficiary Summary File, and the Area Health Resource File. This project's success is highly likely because our pilot data suggest that minorities may be as likely as Whites to meet the Star Ratings Criteria. The National Institute on Aging identifies disparities/medication utilization issues among Medicare beneficiaries as a funding priority."
"9372383","Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus endemic to the eastern United States. Due to its extreme virulence (up to 70% mortality in humans) and potential as a bioweapon, EEEV is characterized as a NIH Category B Priority Pathogen and a Select Agent. However, there are no currently licensed vaccines or antiviral therapeutics. There is very little knowledge on the role of the adaptive immune response during EEEV infection. An initial high white blood count in the cerebrospinal fluid and a shorter prodrome (e.g. fever and malaise) are indicative of a poor outcome in humans. Our lab has identified two virulence factors that contribute to the virulence of EEEV in mice and likely in humans: 1) a myeloid cell-specific microRNA, miR-142-3p, binds to the EEEV genome preventing virus replication in all myeloid cells, and 2) EEEV binds to a proteoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS), limiting viral access to peripheral lymphoid tissues. Both of these virulence factors contribute to suppression of virus replication in lymphoid tissues and suppression of the innate immune response. Mutation of the miR- 142-3p binding sites and HS binding domain resulted in myeloid cell replication in lymph nodes, production of type I interferon, and attenuation in mice. Myeloid cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues are known coordinators of the adaptive immune response through antigen presentation, costimulation, and production of signal 3 cytokines, IL-12 and IFN-?. In lymph nodes, the inability of EEEV to replicate in myeloid cells prevents the production of IL-12 and IFN-? suggesting that without the proper inflammatory milieu, the adaptive immune response may not properly develop during an EEEV infection potentially contributing to the severity of EEEV disease. The experiments in this proposal will investigate the role of virus replication in myeloid cells and lymphoid tissues on the generation of an epitope- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response during an EEEV infection. Also, we will also examine whether IL-12 or IFN-? is required for signal 3 cytokine stimulation and the generation of effector CD8+ T cells in EEEV-infected mice. Understanding how the immune system develops during an EEEV infection will provide valuable information to further develop potential therapeutic interventions or novel vaccines."
"9306120","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ribosomes are the complex, cellular machinery responsible for the production of all proteins in every living organism. This 2.5 million Dalton enzyme contains three large RNAs and more than 50 proteins that form two asymmetric subunits and promote mRNA-directed translation of the genetic code. Accurate translation requires the precise synchronization of regulatory factors, messenger RNAs and transfer RNAs to produce a mature protein. Errors associated with translation are detrimental to gene expression and hence cellular function. Furthermore, consistent with the critical importance of error- free protein synthesis for proper cellular function, there are numerous examples where human disease is linked to alterations in this macromolecular machinery that monitors the accuracy of these events. The major question that underlies translational regulation is how the ribosome is able to distinguish errors from non-canonical three-base decoding and tRNA misreading from normal function. Our long-term goal is to understand how this large macromolecular machine on a molecular level identifies such errors and how this process impacts human disease. This long-term goal will be addressed here by testing the hypothesis that mRNA and tRNA interactions with the ribosome cause conformational changes that prevent errors either through suppression of the mRNA mutation or via a new and novel proofreading mechanism for quality control purposes. Three independent but complementary aims are proposed. Experiments in Aim 1 will test if the +1 shift into the new frame is promoted by interactions with elongation factor G in the A site or by ribosomal components that structurally obstruct the tRNA path between the A and P site. In Aim 2 we will structurally characterize how fs tRNASufA6 interacts with the ribosomal P site and biochemically test whether mutations of important tRNA nts affect fs tRNAs affinity for the A site and/or how it is recognized by EF-G and moved from the A to the P site. These experiments build upon our new model for +1 frameshifting we established in the prior funding period. In Aim 3 we will investigate a second, possibly linked phenomenon: how mismatched P-site mRNA-tRNA interactions on the ribosome arising from tRNA selection errors lead to premature termination of protein synthesis. These aims will be accomplished through a combination of structural biology of large, functional ribosomal complexes using both X-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (in collaboration with Dr. Skiniotis) approaches and complementary biochemical methods."
"9303437","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current proposed research will focus on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its complications among adults with diabetes in Northern Mexico. One major component of the study will assess the effectiveness of an adapted evidence-based community health worker intervention, Meta Salud Diabetes, at reducing behavioral and clinical risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with diabetes in Sonora, Mexico. We will conduct a cluster-randomized trial among adult patients with diabetes sampled from 20 Secretaria de Salud (Secretary of Health)-operated health centers in Sonora. Existing community health workers at each of ten health centers randomized to the intervention condition will be trained in the adapted CVD prevention curriculum. The community health workers will then enroll 20 participants with diabetes at each site into the 12-week intervention. Psychosocial (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs) and behavioral (e.g., smoking, healthy eating) risk factors for cardiovascular disease will be assessed via self-administered surveys during the first of the 12 weekly educational sessions. Clinical risk factors (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, lipids, blood sugar) will be abstracted from existing patient records at the health centers. We will then assess changes that occur at three months (immediately after the 12-week intervention) and 12 months. Changes in the intervention clinic will be compared to changes over the same time period among adult patients with diabetes in each of ten health centers randomized to the control condition (i.e., the usual standard of care). We define the intervention effect as changes over time that occur among intervention participants net of changes over time among diabetic patients at control health centers. We further propose a second component of the study that will consist of systematic engagement of local, state and national decision makers essential to scale up and sustain the intervention into the standard package of services offered by government-run health centers in Sonora and other Mexican states. These government-run health centers, like those where our cluster randomized trials are executed, represent an ideal system for scale-up of Meta Salud Diabetes and other evidenced-based community health worker interventions, since most Mexicans are eligible and receive care at these health centers and because Mexico's centralized health care system will greatly facilitate system wide integration. Extensive qualitative and descriptive data will be collected on the facilitators and barriers to adopt and integrate community health worker chronic disease interventions throughout Sonoran health centers and other health care systems serving high risk populations in Mexico."
"9336340","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Project Summary / Abstract Six miR-34/449 miRNAs derived from three genomic loci constitute the most abundant miRNAs expressed in airway multiciliated cells (MCCs), indicating a functional redundancy of this miRNA family in these cells. Removal of the redundancy by deletion of all three miRNA genes in mice leads to defective motile ciliogenesis. In mir-34/449 triple knockout (TKO) mice, faulty cilia compromise airway mucociliary clearance, giving rise to the congestion of mucus and infection in the upper respiratory tract. Notably, severe respiratory distress causes early postnatal mortality in around half of TKO mice. Respiratory distress and infertility phenotypes displayed in survived adult TKO mice resemble the key symptoms of human Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Knockdown of Cp110, a major miR-34/449 target, can largely rescue motile ciliogenesis in mir-34/449 deficient MCCs. Overall, miR-34/449 miRNAs represent the very first non-coding RNAs whose deficiency in mice causes PCD. This proposal builds on these previous findings to further study miR-34/449 miRNAs in airway MCCs. During the K99 phase of the award, I will learn three cutting-edge technologies in life science: super- resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging, next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and related bioinformatics analysis, and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Coursework and collaboration with leading scientists in these fields will help me master these techniques, which will facilitate not only completion of this proposed project but also my long term scientific career. Aim 1 will explore the cellular defects of TKO MCCs. 3D SIM live imaging will be used to visualize the dynamics of GFP/RFP tagged basal bodies and intraflagellar transport during motile ciliogenesis in cultured control and TKO MCCs. These studies will reveal hidden cellular defects in real time during ciliogenesis in TKO MCCs, which are missed by the endpoint examination of motile cilia in our previous work. Additionally, using straight knockout mice in our previous study may also blind us on the potential functions of miR-34/449 miRNAs in cilia maintenance after MCC maturation. To probe this, conditional deletion of mir-34/449 genes in mice after MCC maturation will be used in Aim 1. The first part of Aim 2 will identify the multiple targets regulated by miR-34/449 miRNAs in MCCs. RNA-seq-initiated unbiased approaches as well as biased candidate approaches will be used to uncover additional miR-34/449 targets in MCCs. These studies are intended to be complete before the R00 phase. The second part of Aim 2 will evaluate miR-34/449 targets in vivo in TKO mice and in primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs). Reinforced miR-34/449 expression and stable knockdown of miR-34/449 targets like Cp110 in airway epithelia of TKO mice will determine whether these procedures can rescue motile cilia in vivo and further relieve respiratory distress in TKO mice. The functional readouts of miR-34/449-mediated target repression in primary HAECs will be studied by CRISPR/Cas9 editing to disrupt the miR-34/449 binding sites in the 3'UTR of target mRNA like CP110. These experiments serve as proof-of-principal studies to test the feasibility of using miR- 34/449 miRNAs and their targets to treat ciliary disease, and will evaluate the extent to which mouse studies can be applied to human biology. Aim 3 will investigate the biology of the unique apical localization of miR- 34/449 miRNAs in MCCs. Sequence mutation assays and a novel Csy4-based RNA-pull method will be used to identify the sequence zip codes inside miRNAs and the protein carriers that direct miR-34/449 apical transport in MCCs. The localization study will be extended to human MCCs as well to fully understand the conservation of miR-34/449 miRNAs in MCCs in terms of sub-cellular location and its underlying mechanisms. Overall, this proposal will generate a comprehensive and detailed picture of miR-34/449 miRNAs in mouse and human airway MCCs, which will have significant implications on both basic biology and potential clinical applications."
"9288205","The maternal-fetal interface is critically important since is at this level that uteroplacental and fetoplacental blood flows are regulated and dysfunctions are seen in diseases of pregnancy, e.g. preeclampsia. Vasodilation is controlled by PGI2 and Nitric Oxide (NO) of endothelial origin and locally shows obligatory requirements for cell-cell communication via Gap junctions, a common theme in this PO-1. Uterine Artery Endothelial Cells in Pregnancy (P-UAEC) and HUVECs undergo Programmed Adaptation to maintain NO production via a Connexin (Cx) 43 mediated mechanisms.    HYPOTHESIS Aim 1: Endothelial Programmed Adaptation is modulated by the Gap junction protein Cx43 that is elevated directly by Shear Stress via cAMP and/or cGMP to maintain vasodilator (PGI2 and NO) production.  Purpose Aim 1: To determine in P-UAECs, HUVECs and HUAECs the effects of: 1) acute vs.  prolonged Laminar Shear Stress on levels of phosphorylated and total Cx43 & eNOS and vasodilator production (PGI2 and NO) relative to cyclic nucleotide (cAMP and cGMP) adaptation; 2) inhibition of PKA, PKG, Adenylate Cyclase and sol Guanylate Cyclase; and 3) Indomethacin and L-NAME on these shear stress responses.    HYPOTHESIS Aim 2: These important shear stress-mediated vasodilator mechanisms are  abrogated by patho-physiologic levels of representative cytokines elevated in preeclampsia [VEGF and Tumor Necrosis Factor] via functional Gap junction disruption. We hypothesize that shear stress elevates cAMP /cGMP which is protective for maintaining vasodilator production via Gap junction assembly.  Purpose Aim 2: To determine in P-UAECs, HUVECs and HUAECs if these cytokines disrupt the shear stress-associated cyclic nucleotide Gap junction-mediated vasodilator mechanisms we will evaluate: 1) effects of treatment with VEGF and TNF on the acute and prolonged laminar shear stress responses; 2) the therapeutic protective effects 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP on VEGF and TNF disruption of shear stress responses; and 3) the therapeutic protective effects cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE)2, cAMP PDES, cAMP PDE4, or cGMP PDE5 inhibitors on VEGF and TNF disruption of shear stress responses. These data provide the first mechanistic framework for understanding the interactions between shear stress-mediated cyclic nucleotides for therapeutic protective actions and Gap junctions to regulate endothelial vasodilator  (PGI2 & NO) production and it's abrogation via cytokine (VEGF & TNF) mediated disruption of cell-cell communication."
"9288203","During pregnancy the previously poor vasodilatory response of uterine artery endothelium (UA Endo) to agonists such as ATP is now enhanced through a greatly prolonged Capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), and this results in enhanced activation of eNOS. Since P-UA Endo's enhanced function now approaches that of other vessels, increases in uterine blood flow also occur. In preeclamptic (PE) subjects who often show elevated VEGF and TNF, this sustained Ca2+ response to ATP is also lost, along with a blunting of NO output. VEGF165 signals through ERK-1/2 to cause transient inhibitory phosphorylation of the Gap junction protein, Cx43 and loss of adapted CCE Ca2+ signaling. U0126 blockade can reverse this 0x43 phosphorylation and  rescue pregnancy adapted Ca2+ burst function on subsequent challenge with ATP. Brief TNF mediated Src activation also directly phosphorylates CX43 on Tyr 265, causing Cx43 inhibition that is reversible by PP2. Long term.Src activation can also promote Tyr phosphorylation of ZO-1 and disassociation from Cx43, so causing Gap junction disassembly and 0x43 movement away from cell contact points and loss of pregnancy adapted CCE function. To that end: Specific Aim 1 investigates the hypothesis that in P-UAEC, HUVEC and HUAEC that VEGF165 or TNF can mediate the dose dependent inhibition of sustained Ca2+ signaling through ERK or Src mediated direct CX43 protein phosphorylation. Specific Aim 2 investigates the further hypothesis that these same VEGF or TNF mediated inhibitory effects in P-UAEC, HUVEC and  HUAEC may also promote ZO-1 protein dissociation from CX43 wherever we see chronic activation of the Src pathway. Specific Aim 3 translates Aims 1 and 2 back to intact vessels (UA Endo - pregnant sheep and HUV Endo or HUA Endo - normal human cords); by testing the hypothesis that the inhibitory actions of VEGF and TNF on endothelial Ca2+ observed in Aims 1 and 2 causes corresponding inhibition of NO production in vivo. Specific Aim 4 tests the hypothesis that together even low doses of VEGF and TNF synergize to inhibit normal endothelial function in all vessels studied through the co-activation of Src and ERK-1/2 inhibitory pathways. A new therapy to treat PE may result from these studies."
"9444676","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major technological and analytical advances in human brain imaging achieved as part of the Human Connectome Projects (HCP) enable examination of structural and functional brain connectivity at unprecedented levels of spatial and temporal resolution. This information is proving crucial to our understanding of normative variation in adult brain connectivity. It is now timely to use the tools and analytical approaches developed by the HCP to understand how structural and functional wiring of the brain develops. Using state-of-the art HCP imaging approaches will allow investigators to push our currently limited understanding of normative brain development to new levels. This knowledge will critically inform prevention and intervention efforts targeting well known public health concerns (e.g., neurological and psychiatric disorders, poverty). The majority of developmental connectivity studies to date have used fairly coarse resolution, have not been multi-modal in nature, and few studies have used comparable methods to assess individuals across a sufficiently wide age range to truly capture developmental processes (e.g., early childhood through adolescence). Here we propose a consortium of five sites (Harvard, Oxford, UCLA, University of Minnesota, Washington University), with extensive complimentary expertise in brain imaging and neural development, including many of the investigators from the adult and pilot lifespan HCP efforts. Our synergistic integration of advances from the HARVARD-MGH and WU-MINN-OXFORD HCPs with cutting edge expertise in child and adolescent brain development will enable major advances in our understanding of the normative development of human brain connectivity. The resultant unique resource will provide rich, multimodal data on several biological and cognitive constructs that are of critical importance to health and well-being across this age range and allow a wide range of investigators in the community to gain new insights about brain development and connectivity. Aim 1 will be to optimize existing HCP Lifespan Pilot project protocols on the widely available Prisma platform to respect practical constraints in studying healthy children and adolescents over a wide age range and will also collect a matched set of data on the original Skyra and proposed Prisma HCP protocols to serve as a linchpin between the past and present efforts. Aim 2 will be to collect 1500 high quality neuroimaging and associated behavioral datasets on healthy children and adolescents in the age range of 5-21, using matched protocols across sites, enabling robust characterization of age-related changes in network properties including connectivity, network integrity, response properties during tasks, and behavior. Aim 3 will be to collect and analyze longitudinal subsamples, task, and phenotypic measures that constitute intensive sub-studies of inflection points of health-relevant behavioral changes within specific developmental phases. Aim 4 will capitalize on our success in sharing data in the HCP, and use established tools, platforms and procedures to make all data publically available through the Connectome Coordinating Facility (CCF)."
"9276785","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks of gestation is the most common cause of abnormal lung development and one with potential lifelong sequelae since preterm delivery can limit the ability of the lung to reach its maximum potential. The survival of extremely premature infants (24-28 wks gestation), who frequently develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), has shifted focus away from moderate and late premature (MLP) infants (> 30 to < 37 wks gestation), who initially require relatively little respiratory support and rarely develop BPD. However, MLP infants are the majority of premature births and develop a high incidence of wheezy respiratory illnesses, hospitalizations, and use of asthma medications compared to infants delivered at term gestation. Therefore, MLP infants contribute to high morbidity, family stress, and health care costs following NICU discharge. Pulmonary function testing of MLP infants show they exhibit reduced expiratory flows compared to age-matched term infants and do not demonstrate catch-up when tested in later life. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which provides mechanical lung distention, is a standard of NICU care for maintaining functional residual capacity (FRC), avoiding intubation and barotrauma, and decreasing respiratory morbidity. While CPAP is currently used to minimize lung injury, it may also promote lung growth and development, since mechanical stretch of the lung is an important stimulus to lung growth. Supporting this, in studies in ferrets, we have demonstrated that 1-week of CPAP increased lung volume and airway size. In addition, we demonstrated that treatment of adult asthmatics with nocturnal CPAP for 1-week suppressed airway hyper-reactivity, an airway characteristic that is often present in subjects born prematurely. Lastly, we have found that among infants born prematurely (mean 32 weeks gestation) and who didn't develop BPD, those treated with CPAP in the NICU had larger lung volumes and greater pulmonary diffusion capacity compared to non-CPAP treated infants. We therefore hypothesize that CPAP stimulates lung growth, improves lung function, and suppresses airway hyper-reactivity in premature infants. We propose to test this hypothesis in a highly-translatable, non-human primate model in which moderately premature (140 days gestation, = 85% of 165 days term gestation) rhesus monkeys will be treated with 10 days CPAP (5 cmH2O) or sham CPAP (0 cmH2O). Pulmonary function and structure will be examined after the 10 days of CPAP and at 6 months of age. In addition we will determine underlying mechanism of CPAP action by examining mechano-sensitive pathways as well as determining if there are epigenetic modifications that may underlie the life-long effects of pre-term birth on lung function. Findings from this proposed study could directly support clinical trials to change the application of CPAP from that of respiratory support in the NICU to that of a therapeutic intervention to prevent altered lung development even in infants delivered as moderate or late preterm without clinical signs of respiratory distress after delivery"
"9275969","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although children who take proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have a six times greater risk of gastroenteritis and a twelve times greater risk of pneumonia than healthy controls, the mechanism driving these risks is unknown. Understanding this mechanism is critical because PPIs are one of the most prescribed classes of medications in children and adults and this understanding will enable clinicians to identify and modify the medical treatment of patients at high risk for pneumonia or gastroenteritis. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that PPIs promote a non-acidic gastric environment in which gastric microflora are altered, and those alterations result in gastrointestinal-wide changes to microflora that increase risk of infection. The rationale for the proposed study is that, despite the widespread belief that PPIs are safe and effective and a more than 400% increase in the frequency of pediatric PPI prescriptions dispensed during the last 7 years, evidence shows that almost 50% of children who take PPIs develop an infectious complication. From a public health perspective, understanding the mechanism behind the high complication rate is critical in order to reduce avoidable infections. Using advanced culturing, 16S deep sequencing, and viral metagenomics, the immediate goals of the proposed study are: (1) to identify the gastric, oropharyngeal, and stool microflora changes in children who take PPIs; (2) to determine the PPI- associated microflora changes that predict pneumonia and gastroenteritis risk; and (3) to identify potential bacterial and viral pathogens associated with PPI use. The long-term goal of the proposed study is to develop a screening tool to identify PPI-associated changes in microflora that enable clinicians to alter acid suppression therapy before infections develop. The specific aims of the proposed study are: (1) to compare the abundance and diversity of gastric, oropharyngeal, and fecal microflora in children with GERD who are taking PPIs with those in untreated children with GERD and healthy control subjects; (2) to determine, within individuals, the longitudinal impact of PPI use on the abundance and diversity of gastric, oropharyngeal, and fecal microflora; and (3) to determine whether specific changes in oropharyngeal and fecal microflora in patients who are taking PPIs are associated with increased risk of pneumonia and gastroenteritis and to identify potential viral and bacterial pathogens associated with PPI use in children. The proposed research is significant because it will advance scientific understanding of the increased infection risk associated with one of the most commonly prescribed classes of medications in a vulnerable pediatric population. Ultimately, this knowledge can be used to develop new therapeutic algorithms for PPI use in children that reduce the risk of infectious complications."
"9293215","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Walking difficulty is common and costly in older adults. While traditional exercise has been shown to promote physical and mental health and may prevent walking difficulty, such exercise has focused on strength and endurance, and has overlooked a critical component of walking ability; the timing and coordination of movement. Aging and disease alter timing and coordination as reflected by slowed neuromotor performance, increased gait variability and reduced smoothness of movement. Task specific timing and coordination exercise that includes practice of smooth coordinated aspects of gait over multiple walking conditions has the potential to improve walking ability greater than a standard program. Our preliminary data suggest that interventions on timing and coordination of gait impact mobility greater than the standard strength and endurance program. The next key step and the objective of this proposal is to combine the two interventions to determine if potential gains in mobility, activity and participation obtained from a standard plus timing and coordination program, are larger than the gains obtained from the standard program alone. Therefore, the primary aim of the proposed project is to evaluate the impact of adding timing and coordination training to standard strength and endurance training on mobility. Secondary aims include examining 1) additional outcomes representing the components of the intervention and measures of activity and participation, 2) the delayed and sustained effects of the intervention, and 3) the effects of the intervention within various other subgroups of interest. This randomized clinical trial in older adults who walk slowly (i.e. < 1.20 m/s) will compare a 372 community-dwelling non-intervention attention control and a standard 12 week strength, endurance and flexibility program to a 12 week standard- plus program of strength, endurance, flexibility plus task specific timing and coordination training. The primary outcome is gait speed at 12 weeks. We will also examine secondary and tertiary outcomes representing components of the intervention and measures of activity and participation and the delayed and sustained effects at 24 and 36 weeks. The findings from this efficacy trial will provide evidence for the added value of task specific timing and coordination training for promoting walking ability in older adults and will form the basis for future effectiveness trials. Future work includes translation to nonprofessional exercise leaders with the long-term goal to incorporate neurological training into standard exercise programs for health promotion for older adults."
"9275957","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To survive an infection, the body must endure damage from both the pathogen and the immune response to it, a phenomenon called damage tolerance1,2. However, the concept of damage tolerance is not restricted to infections, and can be applied to other diseases as well. The severity of autoimmune disease, for example, depends not only on the magnitude of immune response, but also on the susceptibility of target tissues to the damage caused by that response. The commensal microbiota are becoming increasingly recognized as a determinant of disease severity; therefore, the question arises as to whether the microbiota can determine how much damage we can tolerate. Our central hypothesis is that the microbiota communicate with pathogens, with the immune system and with cellular tolerance and repair mechanisms by means of soluble secreted small molecules, which orchestrate disease susceptibility and severity. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a biosensor, we identified indole and several metabolic derivatives as factors secreted by many bacteria, including the commensal microbiota, which may serve this function. We found that brief exposure to indoles activates a signaling pathway in C. elegans that is associated with innate immunity and longevity. Once activated, the animals enter a dauer-like state in which they become resistant to a variety of stressors, a process we term conditioning3. Interestingly, conditioning is evident in mammals as well: exposure to low levels of LPS or even radiation induces a stress response that protects animals from a subsequent exposure to high doses of the stressor that would otherwise prove lethal4. In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that the microbiota acting via indoles, can induce a protective state in organisms as diverse as C. elegans and mammals, using conserved signaling pathways. Conditioning pathways activated by indoles appear to protect the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier, and have conserved homologues in Drosophila and mammals. Preliminary data suggest that indoles act via similar pathways to regulate the sensitivity of fly and mammalian intestinal epithelia to damage induced by pathogens, by radiation, or by autoimmune responses (Graft vs. host disease (GvHD)). In Aim 1, we use mutants and RNAi in C. elegans to determine how conditioning can induce protective responses that ensure epithelial barrier integrity, with the goal of identifying conserved pathways in invertebrate and vertebrate systems. In Aim 2, we use knockout mice to test the hypothesis that pathways identified in C. elegans mediate the capacity of indoles to induce tolerance to damage in response to pathogens, environmental stressors (e.g. radiation), or deleterious autoimmune responses. These experiments also have practical medical relevance; we are now developing clinical trials to determine whether administration of indoles, first identified in the bacteria-C. elegans model, can limit susceptibility to GvHD."

"9020937","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate  Dr. Jason Herschkowitz began his research career as a graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. Charles Perou at UNC Chapel Hill. His research focus was on a large-scale genomic comparison of human breast cancer subtypes and genetically engineered mouse mammary tumor models. This study showed that although no single mouse model recapitulated all the expression features of a given human subtype, many of the defining characteristics of the human subtypes were conserved among the mouse models providing insight for their preclinical applications. Jason then moved to the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) as a postdoctoral fellowship in Dr. Jeffrey Rosen's laboratory. There he has concentrated on studying the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer initially identified in his graduate work. Using a unique mouse model, he has determined that claudin-low tumors are enriched for functional cancer stem cells (CSCs) compared to tumors of other subtypes arising in this model. Jason's graduate training has provided him with an expertise in cancer genomics and mouse models. His postdoctoral work has given him the knowledge and skills involved in stem cell research, mammary gland development, and tumorigenesis. Jason's short-term career goals are to now take what he has learned and apply it to the field of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In order to receive training in this new area, Jason has identified two additional outstanding co-mentors in Dr. Howard Chang and Dr. George Calin. The goal of the next two years is for Jason to receive the additional research training necessary to tackle this new research area as well as valuable career mentorship to prepare him for a successful career as an independent investigator at a highly ranked academic institution. Environment  Jason is a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Rosen in the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, part of the Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center and the Breast Research Program of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center. BCM is an outstanding environment for trainees to develop the necessary skills to become successful independent researchers. The college has exceptional faculty, centers, and state of the art core facilities. BCM is located in the heart of the Texas Medical Center and is walking distance to several outstanding research and clinical institutions including M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, UT Houston Medical School, Rice University, and the Methodist Hospital Research Institute. These institutions serve as additional scientific resources, sources of collaboration, and seminars. Research  Gene expression profiling has been used to classify human breast tumors into distinct, clinically- relevant subgroups, including a rare molecular subtype referred to as claudin-low. Compared to tumors of other subtypes, claudin-low tumors have lower expression of tight and adherens junction genes, including claudin 3 and E-cadherin, and higher expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated genes. We recently found that claudin-low tumors are enriched for functional CSCs. It has been determined that inducing EMT in human mammary epithelial cells endows them with stem cell-like properties. Together these lines of evidence suggest important molecular and biological links between EMT and the CSC-enriched claudin-low tumors.  Recent studies suggest that the majority of the genome is transcribed even though less than 2% of the mammalian genome is occupied by coding regions. These transcripts are called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) because they have no protein coding capacity. There has been a great deal of focus on the role of a class of small ncRNAs, called miRNAs, in development and cancer. In contrast, much less is known about the vast majority of transcripts represented by lncRNAs. One recent theme is that many lncRNAs function through interactions with chromatin modifying complexes and control chromatin architecture. While a variety of functional roles for lncRNAs have been implicated in many biological processes, only in relatively few cases have these been well defined. The precise mechanistic details of lncRNA function remain a mystery that needs exploration. As might be expected from the roles of lncRNAs in transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modifications, and development, there is increasing evidence of the misregulation of lncRNAs in cancer.  Several groups, including ours, have shown that breast CSCs are more resistant to radiation and chemotherapy compared to non-CSCs. We hypothesize lncRNAs play a critical role in an EMT gene expression program governed in part by RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation leading to resistance to conventional therapies in breast cancer. An improved understanding of the molecular networks responsible for the EMT/CSC phenotype is critical for defining targets for combating the therapeutic resistance of CSCs, which may be especially pertinent to claudin-low tumors. The goal of this project, using several model systems and a strategy for large-scale functional screening, is to first identify and then investigate the mechanisms of action of lncRNAs that regulate the EMT/CSC phenotype of claudin-low breast tumors."
"9347312","Abstract Koronis Biomedical Technologies and its collaborators propose to develop and fully test a low-cost, portable respiratory assessment device using the forced oscillation technique (FOT) leveraging the development of a new flexible thin-film airflow sensor technology. The proposed FOT device requires zero skill for the subject and operator making it ideal for occupational health screening, physician office use, and home monitoring. The current gold standard for accurate and repeatable measurement of lung function is spirometry. Spirometry is a pulmonary function test that measures the volume and rate of air flow a patient can maximally exhale into a tube attached to a precise air-flow meter. The role of spirometers has been limited due to their reliance on technique adherence. Unlike many medical diagnostic tests where the patient is essentially a passive participant, spirometry requires active patient participation. The procedure requires the patient to take the deepest breath possible, and then exhale as hard as possible, for as long as possible. The test is normally repeated to ensure reproducibility. Spirometry results are highly dependent on patient cooperation and effort. Patients often face a significant learning curve. Some patients cannot, or will not, produce interpretable results. FOT measures pulmonary airway resistance and reactance. In contrast to traditional spirometry, the key clinical advantage of FOT is that the technique is passive and does not require the patient to breathe forcefully on command. In Phase I, the team will refine a thin-film sensor design and construct a prototype FOT device. A human study will be conducted, comparing the performance of the prototype to a commercial clinic-based oscillometry device. In Phase II, all components of the pre-production system will be finalized and evaluated for usability and performance in human evaluations."
"9278188","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gene regulatory mechanisms that program cell differentiation from proliferating precursor cells are fundamentally important for development, tissue homeostasis and cancer. Using the dramatic cellular differentiation program of spermatogenesis as a model stem cell lineage, we seek to understand the unique, cell-type specific transcription program initiated in the spermatocyte stage that sets cells up for terminal differentiation. Here we will investigate how cell-type specific transcriptional activators and repressors we have discovered in Drosophila, and the chromatin modifying complexes and transcription machinery they recruit, together specify the transcription program required for male gamete differentiation. We will investigate how both somatic specific and spermatid differentiation transcripts are kept silent in proliferating precursor cells and probe how testis-specific TAFs (homologs of components of the general Pol II transcription machinery), and a testis specific form of the normally repressive MuvB/dREAM complex work with the transcriptional co-activator Mediator to activate expression of meiotic cell cycle and spermatid differentiation genes. We will investigate how a testis-specific Rest-like Zn Finger protein expressed at the onset of spermatocyte differentiation acts in this context to block inappropriate spermatogonial and somatic differentiation programs in spermatocytes. Defects in either of these latter two gene regulatory mechanisms results in arrest of spermatogenesis at the G2/M transition of meiosis I and failure to initiate spermatid differentiation. Our work on the mechanism of action of cell-type specific transcription activating complexes and master transcriptional repressors in the Drosophila male germ line will provide paradigms for understanding how development programs terminal differentiation of specialized cell types. In addition, understanding the mode of action of the meiotic arrest gene circuitry of Drosophila may illuminate mechanisms underlying meiosis I maturation arrest infertility in man."
"9285853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine-coding CAG expansion within exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. Although the genetic mutation associated with the disease has been identified, the molecular and cellular basis of HD is not yet understood and successful treatment for this disease remains elusive. Basic research and clinical studies indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HD. Mitochondria are organized in a highly dynamic tubular network that is continuously reshaped by opposing processes of fusion and fission. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a large GTPase and a key protein governing mitochondrial fission. Recent studies have highlighted the causal role of Drp1-mediated excessive mitochondrial fission in neuronal death in HD cell culture models. However, how Drp1 hyperactivation mediates mitochondrial damage and neurodegeneration in HD and whether pharmacological inhibition of Drp1 activation is sufficient to reduce mutant Htt (mtHtt)-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration are not known. Our recent work showed that Drp1 is translocated to the mitochondria and hyper-activated in both HD cell cultures and in vivo in the HD R6/2 transgenic mouse brain. Importantly, using a novel and selective peptide inhibitor of Drp1, P110, recently developed in our group, we found that inhibition of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial impairment corrected mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death in HD cell cultures, and reduced behavioral deficits and loss of striatal neurons in HD R6/2 transgenic mice. Moreover, treatment with P110 corrected mitochondrial morphology and reduced neurite loss and cell death in GABAergic striatal neurons derived from HD patient- induced pluripotent stem cells (HD-iPS cells). Further, using unbiased proteomic analysis, we recently profiled the interactome of Drp1 in neuronal cultures derived from HD patient-iPS cells. Our preliminary studies identified two mechanistically distinct candidate proteins (ATADA3, a member of mitochondrial AAA-ATPase family, and MAPK1, a serine/threonine kinase) that are involved in Drp1-mediated neuronal damage. These lines of evidence indicate that Drp1 hyperactivation is a predominant cause of neurodegeneration in HD. Thus, we hypothesize that inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial damage is a novel approach for reducing neuropathology in HD models in vitro and in vivo. Using biochemical, imaging, bio-energetic, proteomic and pharmacological approaches ranging from animals to patient neurons, our goal in this application is to unravel the complexity of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration in both mechanistic and therapeutic detail. The proposed study will produce novel information on the role of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in the pathogenesis of HD and provide a useful model system in which to study mitochondrial pathology in striatal neurons. We will also generate pharmacological tools to inhibit HD pathogenesis as a first step towards the development of novel therapeutics for HD."
"9480933","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes constitutes a driving mechanism in oncogenesis. In normal cells, tumor suppressors act as central hubs coordinating cell cycle, cell death, and cell fate via regulation of gene expression. The loss of tumor suppressor activities disrupts these processes, permitting aberrant cell growth. Recent work has shown that ~20% of human cancers carry mutations in at least one subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. While genetic, animal and cell culture studies have established that several SWI/SNF subunits function as tumor suppressors, few studies have comprehensively established the mechanisms by which they act. We recently identified inactivating mutations in the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit, SMARCA4, in the majority of small cell carcinoma of the ovary of hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), a poorly- differentiated and aggressive tumor, with concomitant protein loss in nearly 90% of primary tumors. We also found loss of expression of the alternative SWI/SNF ATPase subunit, SMARCA2, in all tumors lacking SMARCA4. In contrast to most adult cancers, SCCOHT genomes remain predominantly diploid with rare secondary mutations in other cancer genes. Therefore, we hypothesize that 1) SMARCA4 mutations drive tumor development through disruption of normal differentiation; and 2) that these mutations will define a global therapeutic vulnerability in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose to 1) Investigate the epigenetic consequences of SMARCA4/A2 re-expression; 2) Model the histogenesis of SCCOHT; and 3) Identify and validate targets for tumor treatment. To carry out the proposed studies, we take advantage of the cutting-edge technologies available at the University of British Columbia (UBC), the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) and the University of North Carolina (UNC) and the complementary expertise of the 3 multiple principal investigators including ovarian cancer pathology and biology (UBC), systems biology and translational applications (TGen) and chromatin biology and cancer epigenetics (UNC). We will also generate novel cell culture and animal models to parse the mechanisms by which inactivation of SMARCA4 and/or SMARCA2 drive SCCOHT development and to identify and validate new reagents for treatment of this deadly disease. In addition, the predominance of SMARCA4 mutations along with the scarcity of secondary mutations in other cancer genes yields a unique model for understanding the specific contributions of SWI/SNF complex mutations to human cancer development. Thus, the results of these studies will significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment of SCCOHT by providing seminal insights into the mechanisms that drive its development, including the disruption of SWI/SNF complex function. Furthermore, the ubiquitous nature of SWI/SNF complex mutations in human malignancies broadens the scope of our findings to other deadly human cancers including lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and brain tumors."

However, there are many issues to overcome before these therapies can be clinically trialled: The current methods to differentiate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into retinal fates yield modest numbers of RGCs, and previous reports have suggested that only a small fraction of RGCs can integrate with a host retina upon transplantation. The main goals of the present proposal are: (1) to improve the current protocols to efficiently differentiate ESCs into RGC fates at the optimal age for transplantation, and (2) to identify possible barriers to cell engraftment. 1) To generate high yields of ESC-derived RGCs: Our lab and others have implemented methods to differentiate embryonic stem cells into bona-fide retinal progenitors. We will develop the current protocols to increase the production of RGCs by systematically testing an array signaling cues and miRNA regulators known to be involved in RGC differentiation during normal development. By using a variety of approaches including RNA-sequencing and electrophysiology, we will characterize the ESC-derived RGCs. We will label, purify and transplant RGCs from an array of different ages to pinpoint the optimal developmental stage to become donor cells for transplantation. 2) To analyze integration potential of ESC-derived RGCs following transplantation: We will use state- of-the-art imaging technologies to follow individual ESC-derived RGCs after transplantation in living rodents to accurately measure survival, migration and integration with the host. We will employ murine models of RGC degeneration to assay the role of the environment in RGC engraftment potential."
"9294130","Summary: Impaired wound healing following injury in diabetics represents a major clinical problem, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations and significant healthcare costs. Two-thirds of all non-traumatic amputations are preceded by a diabetic wound. The development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy increases the susceptibility of diabetic skin to injury. We have shown that diabetic skin in mice and humans also has impaired skin integrity at baseline which further predisposes diabetic skin to injury. Diabetic wounds are deficient in stromal derived factor-1??(SDF-1?), a potent chemokine involved in progenitor cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and granulation tissue formation, mediated through binding to the CXCR4 receptor and the establishment of a chemotactic gradient. We have shown overexpression of SDF-1? corrects the diabetic wound healing impairment, and in exciting preliminary studies, can restore the integrity of diabetic skin. Given this important clinical problem, the objective of this proposal is to develop a small molecule therapeutic to target the SDF-1? receptor CXCR4 to improve diabetic skin integrity to prevent injury, and to improve wound healing should injury occur. We have developed and optimized an innovative screening approach to identify new classes of selective CXCR4 receptor agonists that can be applied topically and penetrate the skin to improve skin integrity and wound healing. We propose to screen the NIH SMR library and carry out hit-to-lead studies to identify novel CXCR4 receptor agonists that can be developed for these complications of diabetes. Aim 1. We will screen the NIH compound collection to identify molecules that can agonize the cAMP signaling pathway via the CXCR4 receptor. We have developed and optimized the primary assay to screen for first in class CXCR4 small molecule agonists and expanded our pilot screen to include 6400 compounds from our internal collection to justify screening the entire NIH SMR library using our robust testing funnel. Aim 2. We will implement dose response studies, validate all ?Hits? using a counter-screen and secondary chemotaxis/migration assays, confirm direct receptor binding, and optimize our most promising molecules using SAR by catalog and medicinal chemistry approaches. Hits from Aim 1 will be counter-screened for selectivity against the related CXCR5, CCR6, CXCR6 receptors and unrelated APJ receptors. Functional assays using human cells will assess chemotaxis and migration. Cell-based binding studies will confirm direct binding to receptor, binding parameters, and optimize promising candidates by SAR. Aim 3. We will examine the ability of validated target molecules from Aim 2 to correct the abnormal expression of microRNAs that regulate inflammation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis in human diabetic fibroblasts, and whose expression is corrected by SDF-1?. Target molecules from Aim 2 will be screened for their ability to correct expression of microRNA-146a, 15b, and 29a, which are dysregulated in diabetes, and corrected with SDF-1? treatment."
"9353198","ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish a Coordinating Center (CC) for the next phase of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) sponsored by the NIH. The objective of ATN is to increase awareness among at-risk youth of their HIV status and, for those with HIV, achieve linkage, engagement and retention in the care continuum. Many challenges are faced by adolescents during their transition to young adulthood, resulting from developmental changes, peer influences, identity, and self-esteem formation. Risky behaviors among adolescents, which include engaging in unprotected sexual encounters or sharing nonsterile injecting drug paraphernalia, increase their likelihood of acquiring HIV infection. In the 2013 US Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBSS), 34% of US high school students reported sexual intercourse during the prior 3 months, of which only 59% indicated condom use during last sexual intercourse. The YRBSS also found that only 13% of students had ever been tested for HIV infection. Given the global burden of new HIV infections among young people, greater involvement of adolescents in biomedical and behavioral HIV research is essential. However, significant individual, operational, and community-level barriers have been recognized to engaging adolescents in clinical prevention trials, which include insufficient understanding of research, need for parental consent, lack of access, mistrust and stigma associated with research participation. The new ATN is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating U19 investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for ATN projects. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies, comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include ATN information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to ATN by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the ATN. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for collaboration and extraordinary research productivity from protocol development through research data sharing."
"9216773","PROJECT SUMMARY Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by a range of morphological and structural abnormalities of the cerebral cortex reflecting errors in embryonic brain development. MCD are associated with medically refractory epilepsy and may require the surgical removal of the affected brain tissue. Some MCD result from somatic mutations occurring in neuroglial progenitor cells that result in abnormal cortical development in a restricted area of the brain known as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). In particular, somatic mutations affecting genes in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway are highly associated with FCD. Recently, mutations in the mTOR regulatory genes encoding the GATOR1 complex e.g., DEPDC5, NPRL2, NPLR3, have been associated with FCD. While GATOR1 is known to modulate mTOR signaling in response to cellular amino acid levels in non-neuronal systems, to date, no studies have investigated the functional role for these genes in neurons or during brain development. Thus, in Aim 1, we will define the effects of GATOR1 subunit knockdown (KD) on cell size and cell migration and assess whether these effects are mTOR dependent. In Aim 2, we investigate the functional roles of GATOR1 in protein synthesis, subcellular localization, and neuronal excitability. In Aim 3, we assess how GATOR1 KD alters cerebral cortical lamination and generate a new mouse model of FCD. We will show that FCD in this model can be prevented with mTOR inhibitors. These studies will help to understand the role of GATOR1 during in cortical development and provide pre-clinical assessment of mTOR inhibitors for possible future use in GATOR1-associated epilepsies."
"9281718","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the Twin Hub of the ABCD-USA Consortium is in response to RFA-DA-15-015; the proposal includes the University of Minnesota (hub leader), Virginia Commonwealth University, Washington University, and the University of Colorado to prospectively determine neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 800 twin pairs, ages 9-10 years, from four sites whose researchers are leaders in twin research, SU and abuse, and neuroimaging of cognitive and emotional functioning will be tested, together with 700 singletons, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD-USA Consortium. Participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) bidirectional relationships between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) gateway interactions between use of different substances. The Twin Hub proposes to use classic and co-twin control designs to study genetic vs. environmental contributions to adolescent brain/behavioral development and how these contributions predict SU propensity. Using sophisticated growth trajectory modeling techniques, we will also identify the genetic and environmentally- determined consequences of substance use on brain and behavioral development, including the assessment of gene-by-environment interactions. In addition, we will develop biospecimen resources for future studies of genomic, epigenomic, metabolomics and microbiome changes that may influence substance use and its broad health consequences. Specific to this Twin-Hub, we will obtain baseline and follow-up serum, saliva, and in some cases gut microbiota from biological samples. This work enriches the full ABCD-USA Consortium given that disentangling G and E contributions to individual risk for addiction and sensitivity to SU's neurocognitive effects has highly significant public policy and prevention-based implications."
"9230421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The Indiana Regional Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Center (IRCCTC) will extend the work of the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network, particularly in the area of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Critical limb ischemia (CLI) results in at least 50,000 amputations annually, with a cost estimated at $4.3 billion/year. In a recent Phase l/ll trial we have demonstrated safety and feasibility of intra-muscular injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (ABMNC) in patients with CLI, and provided initial evidence that this treatment improves amputation-free survival at one year. Although these results are promising, there is an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of cell therapy for CLI by identifying more potent sources of progenitor cells and by evaluating functional characteristics of transplanted cells. While many cardiovascular cell-based trials have focused on ABMNC, adipose stromal cells (ASCs) have demonstrated qualities particularly suitable for promoting limb salvage in CLI. In addition, cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMNC) have been shown to include vasculogenic endothelial progenitor cells, to augment perfusion in ischemic limbs, and to be tolerated by an immunocompetent host. CLI presents an excellent opportunity to examine these two readily accessible cell populations with regard to suitability for cardiovascular cell therapy, in that there exist no other options fo salvage of the index limb, potential adverse events are not immediately life-threatening, and tissue can be obtained for analysis in the event of amputation. Also, mechanisms promoting limb salvage in CLI have relevance to myocardial ischemic syndromes. In this application for a new Regional Center, we propose two protocols, respectively evaluating allogeneic cord blood mononuclear cells and adipose stromal cells as potential therapies for CLI. Aim 1 will evaluate whether CBMNC are superior to placebo in promoting amputation-free survival at 1 year in subjects with critical limb ischemia of Rutherford Category 4, and no /high-risk options for standard revascularization. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are safe and may increase time to amputation in subjects with critical limb ischemia and ulcers / tissue loss (Rutherford Category 5-6)."
"9463051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Great progress has been made in mapping functional units of the genome as well as the epigenome through the efforts of the ENCODE project, such work has mainly been carried out in cell lines and peripheral tissues. The goal of our PsychENCODE project is to construct detailed maps for multiple important chromatin modifications in a tissue of specific relevance to schizophrenia (SCZ), human neurons and glia, and subsequently assess the relationship of several of these marks to known genetic risk factors for SCZ. We will first broadly survey a series of important chromatin marks in two brain regions, the pre-frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, in limited number of samples to provide brain and neuronal specific maps of the chromatin marks. We will then focus deeply on a single region, the pre-frontal cortex, and on an important promoter and enhancer mark, in a large sample of post-mortem human brain samples. Specifically, we will first, map cell-type specific transcriptome and epigenome components in cortical tissue homogenates and in neuronal and non-neuronal chromatin in nuclei from normal human adult brain (n=20) using fluorescence- activated cell sorting followed by ChIP-Seq. Second, we will map promoter (H3K4me3) and enhancer (H3K27ac) marks in neuronal chromatin of the prefrontal cortex of 328 cases with SCZ, and 315 controls. We will integrate genome-wide SNP, CNV and brain mRNA expression with the neuronal ChIP-seq promoter and enhancer marks to identify novel SCZ genes using a variety of analytic strategies including constructing weighted interaction and causal probabilistic SCZ networks to identify key drivers and subnetworks underlying SCZ. Finally, we will map distal enhancer elements using chromosome conformation capture and investigate the role of medication confounds on mapping results. Our PsychENCODE project will apply innovative techniques and analytic strategies including cell-type specific epigenome mapping, chromosome conformation capture, deconvolution mapping and construction of causal probabilistic network analyses. All data will be made available to the research community through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse Platform. There is a deep need to understand the epigenetic landscape in the human brain, and in particular in neurons and glia and to integrate this information with human SCZ genetics. We have assembled the critical key personnel, sample resources, technological know-how, and analytic strategies to be able to provide both useful maps for the field, as well as begin to unravel SCZ biology."

"9315869","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stanford Career Development Program in Omics of Lung Diseases (K12). We propose a Career Development Program (CDP) in Omics of lung diseases with a major focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This is a logical extension of our current K12 CDP on the Genetics and Genomics of Lung Diseases that focuses on PAH. The new CDP proposal allows us to equip the next cadre of MD and PhD scientists with interdisciplinary and bioinformatic skills to integrate new high throughput genomic, proteomic and metabolomic platforms to gain a better understanding of disease pathophysiology. This proposed CDP in Omics will fuel the major cross-departmental collaborations we have built through NIH- NHLBI Interdisciplinary grants focusing on PAH. One of our NIH sponsored projects applies novel cutting-edge high-throughput proteomic methodologies to investigate inflammatory cells in autoimmune and idiopathic PAH. Another utilizes genomics and bioinformatics and induced pluripotent stem cell methodology to relate gene variants, methylation changes and RNA expression differences across the genome, to the functional behavior of native and iPSC-derived endothelial cells from PAH patients. Our role in the Pulmonary Hypertension Breakthrough Initiative Network permits access to these valuable samples, and our major clinical programs in Adult and Pediatric PAH assure that we are well-positioned to train a new generation of young scientists in this important area of research. Our Scholars will have MD or PhD backgrounds and our CDP offers extensive didactic cross training in the omics (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) and in computational biology, particularly for the MD with little background preparation in these areas. As well, we offer training in lung vascular anatomy, physiology and pathology for the PhD Scholar with little exposure to medicine. Each Scholar will undertake a mentored research project beginning in the first year of training, with a primary Mentor who has expertise in PAH, in the Omics fields, or in Bioinformatics, and two Co-Mentors with the complementary skills. Mentors and Co-Mentors will help the Scholar attain those skills that facilitate interpreting the large data sets resulting fro high throughput research to uncover the biological and clinical relevance of the findings. Our CDP focuses on one disease but, at the same time, provides the Scholar with the necessary tools to take on the challenges of future high throughput scientific discovery, to improve diagnosis and treatment of many other lung diseases."
"9315865","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the 1.7 million wheelchair users in the United States (US), 90 percent, or 1.5 million persons use manual wheelchairs (MWCs). People with traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) make up approximately 20% of the MWC users, and 12,000 new traumatic SCIs occur every year. While MWCs are immediately available and enable independence, 63% of MWC users will have one or multiple rotator cuff tears after decades of WC use as compared to 15% of age-matched able-bodied adults. A crucial gap in knowledge exists in understanding how the shoulder of MWC users functions from an almost permanent seated position as an agent for mobility, weight bearing, and hand grasping; and how this altered function translates to longitudinal shoulder health decline. The objective of this application is to define the longitudinal components of the early phase (before chronic symptom onset) of shoulder health decline specific to new MWC users by characterizing the exposure to altered shoulder function and the associated MRI signs of early onset of shoulder pathology. We propose to: (Aim 1) quantify shoulder joint motion and loading in the real world over 3 years in 60 new MWC users and a matched able-bodied cohort; (Aim 2) define early, preclinical changes on shoulder MRI specific to the MWC users, over 3 years, in comparison to the matched cohort; and (Aim 3) identify specific exposure measures as risk factors for early changes on MRI in the MWC users. Three central and novel aspects of this proposal will pave the way for targeting primary prevention: (1) characterizing the altered shoulder function in new MWC users in the real world with hardware and instrumentation suitable for multiple, day long collections, (2) defining the early, preclinical pattern of disease in users compared to a matched able-bodied cohort, and (3)investigating the combined effect of shoulder motion and loading and its relationship to the incidence of shoulder pathology. Successful completion of this project will define how the shoulder responds to MWC use (Aim 1), identify the MWC-specific pattern of shoulder disease on MRI (Aim 2), and determine how altered shoulder function has contributed to shoulder health decline (Aim 3). This work provides the foundation for understanding the relative impact of shoulder elevation and loading in shoulder health decline. Additionally, this work provides the first building block in defining the complete natural history of shoulder disease in MWC users. We expect the overall impact to be a powerful influence on environmental and assistive technology redesign, post-SCI rehabilitation practices, insurance reimbursement for shoulder health- preserving equipment, and understanding shoulder pathology in the general population."
"9403001","PROJECT SUMMARY Aging is associated with dysregulation of the immune response, which is also termed ?immunosenescence.? Each part of the immune system is influenced to some extent by the aging process. However, adaptive immunity seems more extensively affected, and it is especially the T cells that are altered. In fact, the number and proportion of late-differentiated T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, is higher in the elderly than in the young and their accumulation may contribute to the enhanced systemic pro-inflammatory milieu commonly seen in elderly individuals. Interestingly, the proportion of CD8+ effector memory RA (TEMRA) cells increases significantly with age, which is not seen for CD4+ cells. We do not know exactly what causes these observed changes, but an understanding of the possible causes is now beginning to emerge. Spaceflight causes a suite of negative health effects that may be comparable to immunosenescence, which seems to be a key regulator of the regenerative capacity of tissue- and organ-specific stem cells. Organ-specific stem and progenitor cells may allow the design of strategies for organ regeneration. The overarching objective of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the influence of immunosenescence on the regenerative capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Specifically, studies examining the effects of bone healing (by mesenchymal stromal cells) and vascular regeneration (by endothelial progenitor cells) are planned using tissue mimics on chip to represent ?semi-3D? architectures. Ultimately, we will use microgravity as an aging model, and we will translate those findings to improve human health on Earth by using tissue chips on the ISS for up to a month. Notably, the proposed studies investigate post-flight recovery of tissue chips using histological analysis combined with functional and genomic analysis. In collaboration with Space Technology and Advanced Research Systems, Inc. - STaARS, well-versed in maintenance of cell culture experiments in spaceflight, we are establishing an in vitro tissue-on-chip platform that mimics human physiology to study the effect of immunosenescence on tissue-specific stem cells. This system will be designed for use in the UH3 phase in the extreme environment of space. In the UG3 phase, we will examine the effect of simulated microgravity and normal (1xg) conditions on in vitro cultures of CD8+ T cells and on their co-culture with stem cells (UG3 Aim 1). In UG3 Aim 2 we will investigate the effect of microgravity at the International Space Station ? National Lab (ISS-NL) on in vitro co-cultures of CD8+ T cells and stem cells. In the UH3 phase, we will determine the effect of microgravity on immunosenescence (differentiation of CD8+ T cells into TEMRA cells) and tissue-specific stem cells in space as model for aging using microarrays (UH3 Aim 1). Finally, in UH3 Aim 2, we will investigate post-flight recovery of tissue chips (from Aim 1, UH3 phase) using functional analysis of stem cells. This proposal will contribute materially to our understanding of the impact of an aged immune system on tissue healing and regeneration."
"9276119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes is a major virulence determinant that enables parasites to sequester from blood circulation by binding to the endothelial lining of blood vessels and avoid spleen-dependent killing mechanisms. Whereas infected erythrocytes sequester in a variety of microvascular beds, cerebral malaria is a life-threatening disease complication that is associated with massive sequestration in brain microvessels. Cerebral malaria is accompanied by endothelial activation, blood-brain barrier disruption and fibrin thrombi at sites of infected erythrocyte sequestration. While progress has been made in understanding the binding properties of infected erythrocytes, critical questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms of cerebral malaria pathogenesis. Binding of P. falciparum- infected erythrocytes is mediated by the large and diverse P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. We recently showed that severe malaria is associated with a distinct subset of PfEMP1 variants that binds to endothelial protein C receptor, an important regulator of blood clotting and endothelial activation. Our preliminary findings suggest that parasites may impair EPCR function and lead to cerebral malaria complications. However, a significant barrier to investigating disease mechanisms in human cerebral malaria is the inaccessibility of the brain. This project will exploit new advances in microvascular engineering technology in the study of human cerebral malaria. By building a human brain microvascular model, we will: 1. Characterize the molecular mechanisms by which P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes adhere to human brain endothelial cells and other microvascular beds using in vitro 3D human microvascular systems. 2. Determine the consequent changes on the barrier and thrombogenic properties of the vessel wall. 3. Determine host signaling pathways engaged by the infected erythrocyte-endothelial activation that are associated with endothelial dysfunction or protection. The success of the project will shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms associated with cerebral malaria and may guide potential therapeutic development."
"9319258","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) results from impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and increased hepatic glucose production with deficits in insulin secretion likely the key determinant of whether T2DM develops. However, we do not understand the cause of reduced ß cell mass and/or a/ß cell dysfunction in human T2DM. This is because models and hypotheses about T2DM ß or a cells generally arise from studies of rodent models or have not been confirmed in human samples. Furthermore, most studies on the T2DM human pancreas do not adequately incorporate the clinical phenotype of the patient or the disease stage and, consequently, combine profiles from different stages. In addition, previously studied T2DM pancreatic specimens have been collected in ways that do not completely allow newly available molecular analyses. To overcome these deficits in our knowledge, we have established a new infrastructure for procuring human T2DM pancreatic specimens for analysis by new technologies and isolating islets from the same pancreas. In addition, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists with human islet biology expertise and investigators who bring new technologies for tissue and cell profiling from the neuroscience and cancer arenas. Using this new infrastructure and technologies, we propose to: 1) Identify unique protein and RNA signatures in the pancreatic islets and isolated a and ß cells from clinically phenotyped T2DM donors of short (i.e. <5 years)- and long (i.e. >10 years)-duration with technologies such as RNA-sequencing, tissue-clearing, and single cell phenotyping. 2) Using tissue imaging mass spectrometry, identify differentially expressed lipids, proteins, and metabolites in T2DM islets. 3) Integrate molecular signatures with functional T2DM islet profiles and test the impact of candidate molecules from the lipid, metabolite, and/or mRNA/protein datasets on a and ß cell activity and viability. In keeping with the goals of the R24 mechanism, our discovery-based approaches will generate new resources and datasets, create new paradigms for a/ß cell dysfunction in human T2DM, and foster fundamental discoveries that will not only improve our understanding of how ß cell dysfunction/loss occurs, but potentially lead to therapeutic interventions."

"9395338","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mitotic fidelity describes a cell's ability to accurately and reliably replicate its genome during cell division. Disrupted mitotic fidelity is a hallmark of cancer, and may significantly impact disease course by selecting for tumor promoting mutations. Thus, the ability to target the mitotic fidelity of cancer cells could be an important therapeutic approach to reducing cancer-associated morbidity and mortality. In order to target mitotic fidelity therapeutically, a clearer understanding of its underlying cellular mechanisms is required. The mechanical characteristics of the centromere, a specialized region of the chromosome that interacts with the mitotic spindle, are likely to be intimately connected to mitotic fidelity. However, centromere biomechanics during mitotic progression have not been quantitatively characterized in unperturbed, living human cells, and so their effect on disease states such as cancer is largely unknown. The central goal of this training proposal is to quantitatively characterize the mechanical characteristics of the centromere in human cells during mitosis and in the context of cancer. I hypothesize that when mitotic fidelity is maintained, there is a signature mechanical maturation of the centromere, and that aneuploidy impairs this process. My preliminary data demonstrates that I have the methods in hand to pursue my goal, and strong support for my central hypothesis. For this fellowship, I propose to test my central hypothesis through two specific aims, each examining a different mechanistic aspect of centromere mechanical maturation and its relationship with aneuploidy. Importantly, both of these aims will provide foundational training experiences in asking mechanistic basic science questions and addressing them through quantitative research methods. The findings obtained from this research will provide the groundwork for a mechanistic model of centromere mechanical maturation and its relationship with aneuploidy in the context of cancer. This model will central in future studies aimed at determining how physical forces during mitosis shape clinical outcomes. Moreover, the proposal provides unique learning opportunities in applying quantitative methodologies to biomedical questions with significant clinical relevance, the core goal of my training as a quantitative physician scientist."
"9319262","PROJECT SUMMARY Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a genetically controlled disease. While many disease-related genes have been identified in mice and humans, the mechanisms of how these genes produce T1D lags behind their identification. CD137, a T cell co-stimulatory molecule, is the protein product of Tnfrsf9, the prime Idd9.3 (Insulin dependent diabetes) T1D candidate gene. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice congenic for the B10 Idd9.3 haplotype (NOD.Idd9.3) are less susceptible to T1D; NOD CD137 is hypofunctional compared to B10 CD137. Our laboratories have published a series of papers on the immunological role of CD137 in T1D. On the one hand, we showed that CD137 deficient NOD mice have decreased T1D incidence, and that splenic T cells lacking CD137 are less diabetogenic. On the other hand, we found that CD137 is constitutively expressed on a subset of Tregs, and that NOD.Idd9.3 mice have increased accumulation of these CD137+ Tregs. CD137+ Tregs are more suppressive than the CD137- subset, partly due to their ability to produce an alternatively spliced CD137 variant, soluble CD137 (sCD137). NOD mice have decreased serum levels of sCD137 compared to NOD.Idd9.3 mice. We made recombinant sCD137 and showed that it prevented T1D in NOD mice. More importantly in a therapeutic context, we show here that recombinant sCD137 can halt acute T1D. We demonstrate that sCD137 directly suppresses CD4 and CD8 T cells in a CD137 Ligand (CD137L) dependent fashion. CD137L mediates ?reverse? signaling, i.e., it not only functions to activate CD137+ cells, but also signals into the CD137L expressing cell. Therefore both CD137 and CD137L actively mediate cell signaling. Active signaling by both receptor and ligand raises critical questions about the mechanism of CD137 in T1D. Hypofunctional NOD CD137 may reduce T effector action, but conversely decrease Treg function and production of immunosuppressive sCD137, thereby reducing CD137L dependent immune regulations. Thus understanding CD137 function in T1D requires defining effects in both CD137+ cells (primarily T and Treg cells) and CD137L+ cells (including APCs and T cells). In this application, we will combine the expertise of our labs to address these issues in the following specific aims. (1) Mechanisms of profound protection from T1D due to CD137 deficiency in CD8 T cells, and functional roles of CD137L expression in immunopathogenesis of T1D. (2) Mechanisms of sCD137-mediated cellular suppression and reversal of NOD new onset T1D. (3) Immunosuppressive function of human sCD137 in human immunity and T1D."
"9262212","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains a leading cause of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) in the US, presenting an urgent need to develop more sensitive biomarkers and new targets of therapy to halt the progression of DN. Using a microarray profile of a murine model of progressive CKD, we found that the renal expression of Rtn1a positively correlated with the severity of renal injury in animal models, including a model of DN. In addition, expression of RTN1A negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in DN patients. Our preliminary data demonstrates that the increased expression of RTN1A, an ER-associated protein, induces ER stress and apoptosis of renal cells and that its reduced expression conversely attenuates tunicamycin-, hyperglycemia-, and albumin-induced ER-stress and apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, a global knockdown of Rtn1a attenuated proteinuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and mesangial expansion in STZ- induced diabetic mice, as well as renal fibrosis in an experimental model of ureteral obstruction. Based on these findings, we posit that RTN1 is a potential novel risk gene for kidney disease and that it promotes the progression of DN through ER stress. In this application we put forward the aims to determine the renal cell- specific role of RTN1A in different stages of DN and the molecular mechanism by which RTN1A induces ER stress and apoptosis under diabetic conditions. The proposed studies herein will confirm whether RTN1A may be developed as a potential drug target to treat DN."
"9327033","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Cassie C. Kennedy is an optimal candidate for this award, possessing a commitment to patient-oriented research, a focused goal for her future research career, a background and attributes that assure success, and a compelling rationale for further training. Dr. Kennedy is a pulmonologist specializing in the care of transplant patients, with a background of outstanding clinical training in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care, and lung transplant at Mayo Clinic. Her prior research experience includes basic science training in infection and immunology (Dr. Limper), Certificate in Clinical and Translational Science, systematic review/meta-analysis (Drs. Cook and Montori), secondary data analysis (Drs. Gajic and Benzo), and retrospective cohort studies. Dr. Kennedy lacks training and experience in qualitative, quantitative, and behavioral intervention methodologies, all essential skills in clinical research. Dr. Kennedy has demonstrated research productivity with 30 published or in press manuscripts (16 first/senior author; 21 original research manuscripts) and success obtaining 10 internal funding awards. She has completed prior research characterizing the risks of obesity, frailty, and psychosocial factors in endstage lung disease and pre-lung transplant patients. Dr. Kennedy is highly committed to her long-term goal to become a leader in the field of pretransplant risk factor identification and optimization, focusing on behavioral intervention. Her short-term goal is to enhance her knowledge and become proficient in qualitative, quantitative, and behavioral intervention research methods. This knowledge and experience will strengthen her skills and competitiveness for an independent clinical research career. During the award period, she will focus on three objectives of advanced learning 1) the fundamentals of qualitative research, 2) the fundamentals of quantitative research, and 3) the fundamentals of behavioral intervention studies. Dr. Kennedy will complete these learning objectives through formal coursework and workshops, mentored skills training, and practical research experience in leading and conducting the proposed research. Environment: Mayo Clinic has a comprehensive research infrastructure, wealth of opportunity for scholarly exchange, and a proven record of dedication to research and the training of junior investigators. Mayo is highly supportive of Dr. Kennedy's development as an investigator and provides the following: ?75% protected research time; >$75,000 in start-up funds; travel, publication, and tuition resources; and adequate protected time for her mentors. Her sponsor, Dr. Roberto Benzo, is a recognized expert in self-management of chronic disease and behavioral intervention research. Dr. Benzo's research is perfectly aligned with the proposed research and career development plan of the candidate. The mentor and co-mentors are well-funded, expert investigators with proven mentoring success. All co-mentors have pre-established mentoring or collaborative relationships with the candidate. An Advisory Committee of mentors and other key multidisciplinary experts will oversee the candidate's progress, meeting on a quarterly basis for the duration of the award. Research: The candidate's proposed research is novel and fulfills a critical need. Currently, transplant providers predict potential transplant candidates' future ability to adhere to complex medical regimens by subjective assessment. These subjective opinions carry substantial weight in practice guidelines as a criterion for both heart and lung transplant. We propose measuring self-management ability as an alternative to subjective assessment, as self-management is known to predict medical adherence. Not only can self- management ability be measured, it can be improved through health coaching intervention. Through our preliminary data and review of the literature we identified patient factors (such as resilience, coping with uncertainty of illness, positive versus negative affect, and lack of frailty) associated with improved self- management. If our hypothesis is correct, these factors are attractive targets for health coaching intervention to improve self-management and thereby adherence. To test these hypotheses we will conduct three lines of research investigation: qualitative assessment of self-management in Aim 1 to identify patient factors that promote self-management in pre-transplant patients from the key stakeholders' perspectives; quantitative assessment of self-management in Aim 2 to determine the association of measurable patient factors in pre- transplant candidates with self-management; and a targeted intervention to improve self-management in Aim 3 to test whether transplant candidates who receive pre-transplant health coaching (informed by triangulation of Aims 1 and 2 results) have greater improvement in self-management abilities. Potential Contribution: This work will make several important contributions. It will improve the understanding of self-management in heart and lung transplant patients. It will assess the importance of patient factors such as frailty, resilience, uncertainty of illness, and positive versus negative affect to self-management in thoracic transplant patients. Finally, it will provide a potential avenue to improve self-management in the pre-transplant period. These contributions may improve transplant candidate selection, risk factors, and ultimately outcomes. Support of the NIH Mission: The proposal supports the NIH mission by striving to improve transplant outcomes in heart and lung disease patients while training a junior investigator in essential skills (quantitative, qualitative, and trial methods) necessary for her to transition to research independence."
"9269216","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the SUNY College of Optometry to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence  Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter randomized, placebo  controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence  insufficiency (CI) on measures of reading performance and attention in children.  In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic CI will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-111]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates l\/lacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the CI Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of CI (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry. Symptomatic CI is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of CI treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9363032","Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor, has median patient survival of little more than one year. Surgical resection of all enhancing tumor prolongs survival, yet successful resection is challenging because GBM tumors diffusely infiltrate the brain, which results in >90% local recurrence. Development of a next-generation fluorescent molecular imaging agent to help surgeons differentiate cancerous from normal tissue intraoperatively will help reduce the rate of local recurrence and improve patient survival outcomes. No such agent for guided surgical resection of GBM currently has US FDA approval.  An extracellular fragment of the cell surface adhesion molecule PTPµ is a unique imaging biomarker of the tumor microenvironment. The PTPµ fragment arises from proteolytic cleavage of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPµ), a proteolysis seen in multiple tumor types including GBM. An agent that binds to this PTPµ fragment, SBK2, recognizes human GBM tumors. Systemic delivery of the SBK2 agent results in binding to tumor cells within minutes in orthotopic xenografts in rodents, and can label virtually all the dispersing brain tumor cells several millimeters away from the main tumor mass in mouse brains in vivo.  This proposal aims to translate this highly-selective fluorescent SBK2 agent for pre-surgical systemic delivery to cancerous GBM tissue and render it visible in real-time by current surgical microscopy adapted with standard fluorescent filters. The fluorescent SBK2 molecular imaging agent would enhance the efficacy and efficiency of GBM surgery by allowing real-time decisions regarding tumor borders.  In this Academic-Industrial Partnership, a team with expertise in molecular biology, neurosurgery and molecular imaging regulatory approval, will work together to translate SBK2 from a preclinical to a clinical agent. To achieve this goal, the team will need to perform cGMP synthesis and toxicology studies before obtaining FDA regulatory approval for investigational use. Upon FDA approval, the cGMP SBK2 agents will be tested in a Phase 0 eIND imaging trial during surgical resection of GBM for determination of safety profile and imaging efficacy. We expect that this translational plan for the SBK2 imaging agent will yield a new clinical imaging capability for surgeon end users to reduce tumor burden and prolong patient survival."
"9328433","Racial and ethnic health disparities among elderly patients with chronic conditions is a major challenge affecting our health care system. Many chronically ill minority elderly lack high quality care, have poor health outcomes, and often use emergency departments (EDs) and/or hospitals for routine primary care services. To prevent the unnecessary use of costly health care services and assure minorities achieve best outcomes, attention should be focused on clinics where these patients receive primary care, while taking into account their individual and community characteristics. Nurse practitioners (NPs) disproportionality deliver primary care to minorities and practice in underserved areas. Yet, to date, limited research has focused on the role of NPs and practices employing NPs in reducing health disparities, and little is known about the characteristics of NP practices where minorities receive care and whether the underlying differences in their organizational and structural attributes are barriers to achieving reductions in health disparities. The overarching aim of this study is to understand ways to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes of chronically ill elderly patients receiving care from practices employing NPs. Our study will take a comprehensive integrated approach to account for patient, community, practice, and state factors as a system determining disparities. Using multilevel and geographic information system methods, we will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1. Assess the extent to which racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes of chronically ill elderly patients are explained by differences between or within primary care practices employing NPs. Aim 2. Determine the effect of a) NP clinical role, b) care environments, and c) structural capabilities of primary care practices employing NPs on racial and ethnic disparities in chronic condition outcomes for elderly patients. Aim 3. Assess the extent to which patients' community characteristics (i.e., socioeconomic position and primary care availability) are related to racial and ethnic disparities in patient outcomes. We will survey NPs and practice managers in 6 states with variable scope of practice laws governing NPs to collect data about structural and organizational features of practices employing NPs and link these measures to community data on socioeconomic factors and Medicare claims data on hospitalization and ED visits. Our multilevel modeling approach will untangle the interrelated effects of the NP role, care environments, structural capabilities, and community factors on disparities in outcomes of elderly patients to point interventions to eliminate health disparities and identify practices and communities that can most benefit from them. If differences in organizational and structural attributes of NP practices are found to be associated with disparities, interventions could be targeted to practices serving minorities. Thus our findings will inform administrators and policy makers seeking ways to reduce health disparities among the elderly through comparatively low cost organizational interventions. The study aligns well with National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities' vision of equal opportunity to live healthy lives for all Americans."
"9335097","The overall aim of this study is to hasten drug development for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Recent breakthroughs in FSHD research have identified the primary disease mechanism as the aberrant expression of a normally silenced gene, DUX4, resulting in a toxic gain-of-function. This disease mechanism is particularly amenable to knock-down of DUX4 using epigenetic strategies or RNA therapies, as well as to other interventions targeting the downstream effects of DUX4 expression. There are many drug companies actively working towards disease-targeted therapies, and two clinical trials either under way now, or planned to start in early Fall 2016. However, meetings with industry, advocacy groups, and FSHD researchers have identified several gaps in our clinical trial arsenal, and clinical trial planning as a major goal for the community. Consequently, there is an urgent need to establish the tools necessary for the conduct of currently planned and expected therapeutic trials in FSHD. To this end we propose to develop two novel clinical outcome assessments (COA), a composite functional outcome measure (FSH-COM) and skeletal muscle biomarker, electrical impedance myography (EIM). In addition there is broad consensus a better understanding of the relationship of genetic and demographic features to disease progression will be necessary for enumerating eligibility criteria. The specific aims are to: 1. Determine the multi-site validity of the COAs, 2. Compare the responsiveness of new COAs to other FSHD outcomes and determine the minimal clinically meaningful changes, and 3. establish FSHD cohort characteristics useful for determining clinical trial eligibility criteria. To achieve these aims, a multicenter, prospective, 18 months study of 150 subjects is proposed. FSHD is the second most common form of adult muscular dystrophy with an estimated prevalence of 1:15,000, and there are currently no effective treatments. Hastening drug development will have significant impact on approximately 21,000 affected individuals in the United States. Other than manual muscle testing and quantitative myometry, there are no validated outcome measures used consistently in clinical trials in FSHD. This proposal will develop novel outcome measures for use in both early phase studies (EIM) and in late phase registration studies (FSH-COM), and will determine genetic or demographic predictors of progression important for defining key eligibility criteria. The process of FDA qualification for both COAs has already been initiated. An established FSHD clinical trial research network, supported by the major FSHD advocacy group, with experienced clinicians and clinical evaluators will be utilized to conduct the study. Data and statistical support will leverage existing clinical trial infrastructure through the Muscle Study Group. It is expected that the study will validate both COAs for use in future FSHD clinical trials. Moreover, the study will provide FSHD cohort characteristics that will be valuable for establishing eligibility criteria for future clinical trials. The data from this study will be made available for any investigator or company pursuing treatments for patients with FSHD."
"9311505","Project Summary It is well known that structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus, are necessary for the formation, consolidation and retrieval of new episodic memories. Perhaps the most common neuroscientific approach to understanding the brain systems supporting episodic memory is to examine encoding and retrieval of information presented on single trials. While this approach has yielded significant insights, it overlooks the fact that new experiences often are meaningfully related to prior experiences, and as such, are integrated with existing knowledge so that we may retain and update our internal models of the world. This observation raises the important questions of how we (1) store the details of individual events that are part of a greater whole, (2) extract the structural commonalities across multiple related events that occur over gaps in time, and (3) how knowledge structures new learning. To date, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these critical aspects of episodic memory. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that support the development, representation and use of prior knowledge to bolster new episodic learning. The objectives of the current proposal are (1) to test a model of how prior knowledge in the form of prediction about the structure of experience can increase memory encoding by recruiting processes supported by ventromedial PFC during new learning and (2) to test hypotheses about feature-based integration that leads memories with similar features and contexts to evolve to have overlapping cortical representations through consolidation mechanisms. The central aim of the project is to establish the role of vmPFC and other cortical regions in communication with the hippocampus in mediating the benefits of new learning with prior knowledge. The rationale for the proposed research is that a better understanding of how the memories become stabilized and integrated over time will lead to better cognitive therapies to remediate memory loss. Under Aim 1, a variety of measures/techniques ? including behavior, fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) ? will be used to examine how prior knowledge about the expected structure of an unfolding event influences the neural mechanisms underlying the temporal encoding of event details. Aim 1's experiments will build on this foundational research by modulating the predictability of the sequential structure of a current event to understand how prior knowledge modulates behavior and neural processes associated with event memory. Aim 2 will explore the initial learning of structured knowledge about related events, which involves the integration of related information across distinct episodes. The proposed experiments will extend this work to examine how the representation of commonalities across experiences can emerge with time via memory consolidation."
"9355648","PROJECT SUMMARY Batteries for automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators (AICDs) typically need to be replaced every 5-7 years, whereas the average post-implantation longevity of AICD recipients with congestive heart failure (CHF) has increased to over 15 years. This mismatch poses a significant and ever-growing clinical and economic burden, since replacing the battery requires surgical intervention. Reducing the number of replacement surgeries will both prevent morbidity and lower costs. In the U.S. alone, AICD battery replacement costs billions of dollars each year, and reducing or eliminating these costs is clearly an imperative with health care reform. An innovative solution to increase AICD battery lifetimes is to harness the robust intrinsic energy of the heart and convert it to electrical power. Few successful studies on implantable energy generators have been reported however, and current piezoelectric generators are unsuitable for implantable applications due to low energy density or poor biocompatibility. In our preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that increasing the porosity of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) structures increases their compressibility, resulting in higher piezoelectric efficiency. The hypothesis of this proposal is that flexible and conformable porous PVDF polymer films embedded inside AICD leads, or as stand-alone leads, can convert the mechanical motion of the heart into electrical energy by exploiting the high piezoelectricity efficiency of the PVDF film. In our specific aims, we will first develop flexible micro-power generators made of porous PVDF layers that can be interfaced with current AICD lead technology. Secondly, we will design computational models for porous PVDF structures and cardiac energy harvesting devices to allow for optimal design and power efficiency. In parallel, two types of bistable structures fabricated through strain engineering will be explored as energy harvesting devices, and their performance will be optimized using computer simulations. Thirdly, in vitro quantification and testing of the micro-power generator in an animal model of canine will be carried out to evaluate the clinical potential of our approach. Our research will support the development of a broad class of tunable porous nanomaterial networks capable of high efficient energy conversion, with potentially far-reaching applications in biomedical engineering."
"9382248","While the entry of leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) is fundamental to the pathogenesis of many neuroinflammatory conditions, mechanisms regulating the last and most critical step of this process, transendothelial migration (TEM), remain obscure. But two recent series of findings from separate fields could reveal novel and vital clues to how and where TEM takes place. One, ectopic expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins has been described on circulating leukocytes in patients with relapses of the neuroinflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Elevated expression of TJ proteins by leukocytes in inflammatory conditions, as well as by stem and malignant cells, might endow these cells with heightened ability to cross tissue barriers ? possibly by enabling transient interactions with endothelial TJ proteins via a ?zipper? mechanism. Two, nano- sized extracellular vesicles (EVs), e.g., exosomes and microvesicles, bearing junctional proteins and shed by endothelial cells have been reported. EVs are elevated in blood during inflammation (including MS), shuttle protein and RNA between cells, and interact with various immune cells to alter their adhesion and migration properties. These collective findings could suggest EVs transfer TJ proteins to leukocytes and serve as the missing links functionally connecting TJ proteins on leukocytes, TEM and neuroinflammation. Specifically, by transferring TJ cargo from endothelial cells to leukocytes in a juxtacrine manner, EVs might enable adherent leukocytes to transiently engage corresponding vascular TJ proteins and, thereby, foster TEM across the highly restrictive endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Using state-of-the-art technologies, we will focus on leukocytes displaying claudin 5 (CLN-5) ? a major TJ protein of the BBB ? and test the following hypothesis: Leukocytes exploit CLN-5 and endothelial-derived EVs via novel interactions to extravasate across the BBB during neuroinflammation. Aim 1 will use high-resolution 3D fluorescence imaging and FACS to detect CLN-5+-leukocytes and identify their immunophenotypes and activation states at various times in the blood and different CNS regions of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Aim 2, will use novel endothelial conditional, eGFP-CLN-5 mice or CLN-5 knockdown mice to determine if leukocytes express CLN-5 endogenously or acquire it exogenously from endothelial cells. Aim 3, will use 3D fluorescence imaging/FACS to analyze transfer of CLN-5 cargo (protein and/or mRNA) from endothelial-derived EVs to leukocytes, and a novel CLN-5 peptidomimetic, Pep5, to establish if this action is CLN-5-dependent. Aim 4, will use a recognized in vitro BBB model and Pep5 to examine the functional role(s) of leukocyte CLN-5 and EVs in promoting TEM. These studies will be the first systematical and methodical approach to address the relationship between leukocyte TJ proteins and EVs, and their concerted role in neuroinflammation. As similar processes might generically operate in other instances of cell extravasation, these studies should reveal common pathogenic mechanisms and highlight new, therapeutic approaches that target EVs. !"
"9353773","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatic insulin resistance due to obesity is central to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This research proposal addresses the unanswered question of how molecular mechanisms that normally promote energy conservation contribute to NAFLD in obese individuals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulatory relationships between cellular lipid molecules and metabolism, particularly as they present therapeutic opportunities. The objective of this research is to understand fundamental new mechanisms for the regulation of energy homeostasis and nutrient metabolism. The central hypothesis is that thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1) functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a lipid-regulated fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that controls intracellular fatty acid trafficking and that regulates the expression of thermogenic genes. In the setting of obesity, we postulate that upregulation of Them1 in liver and white adipose tissue promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation due to the overproduction of free fatty acids. The rationale is that the mechanisms of Them1-mediated metabolic regulation should yield new insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Guided by extensive preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the mechanisms whereby Them1 limits energy expenditure in BAT; 2) To demonstrate a primary pathogenic role for Them1 in NAFLD; and 3) To elucidate molecular regulation of Them1 activity by the lipid-binding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain. In Aim 1, recently developed Them1-/- mice and cultured brown adipocytes will be used to test the hypothesis that Them1 in BAT limits access of fatty acids to mitochondria and reduces the expression of thermogenic genes. Aim 2 will leverage newly created transgenic mice, as well as cell culture systems to explore whether Them1 contributes directly to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Mice with liver-specific overexpression will be used to establish the role of Them1 in promoting hepatic ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Mice with adipose-specific overexpression will reveal the contributions of Them1 to inflammation within white adipose tissue and to hepatic steatosis. Aim 3 will determine the lipid ligand(s) of the Them1 START domain by mass spectrometry. X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the structure of Them1 in complex with its ligands, the relationship among functional domains and the influence of lipid binding on enzymatic activity. High throughput screening will identity small molecule inhibitors, which should facilitate structure-function studies and help delineate the biological roles of Them1. Overall, this proposal will elucidate Them1-mediated metabolic regulation, which is significant because mechanisms that conserve energy in health may promote disease under conditions of overnutrition. These studies are expected to identify new therapeutic targets for the management of NAFLD."
"9274965","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will delineate mechanism underlying the effects of chronic obesity on brain functioning and determine if cognitive benefits of bariatric surgery and weight loss contribute to enhanced cerebral metabolic or hemodynamic function assessed using multimodal neuroimaging methods. The contribution of post-surgical improvements in diabetes-associated insulin-glucose disturbances will be tested. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is now a major public health problem, contributing to various comorbid medical conditions, including brain disturbances. There is increasing evidence that chronic obesity may adversely affect the brain, even in the absence of comorbid diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. We have previously shown that elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with reduced cognitive function. Increasingly, bariatric surgery is being used as a treatment for chronic morbid obesity. Besides causing dramatic weight loss in many patients, bariatric surgery alters systemic metabolic and vascular function, including altering insulin and glucose metabolism. Our initial findings from a multicenter longitudinal study of bariatric surgery indicated that people experience improvements in neurocognitive functioning, including memory recall, by 12 weeks post-surgery. These benefits continue over 12 months and are related not only to the amount of weight lost, but also changes in underlying risk factors, such as improved metabolic function, and remission of type-2 diabetes Neuroimaging provides a potentially powerful biomarker of alterations in brain structure and function (e.g., FMRI), as well as cerebral pathophysiology. To date no published studies have examined neuronal, metabolic and vascular brain changes following bariatric surgery as proposed in this study. Our preliminary neuroimaging data indicates enhanced functional brain response on FMRI, increased regional cerebral blood flow on arterial spin labeling (ASL), and changes in cerebral metabolite levels on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We hypothesize that: 1) Cerebral metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances linked to obesity adversely affect brain function (evident from cognitive testing and FMRI); 2) Weight loss and associated metabolic changes post-bariatric surgery improve brain functions; and 3) Enhanced neurocognitive and neuronal function (FMRI) are due to improved cerebral metabolic (MRS) and vascular (ASL) function. Remission of diabetes is expected to be one factor accounting for these effects, though this effect will also be tied to improved cerebral (MRS) and systemic (e.g., serum cytokines) metabolic health and cerebral perfusion (ASL). A prospective longitudinal cohort matched design will be used to assess changes in these neuroimaging indices, pre- and post-surgery and relative non-surgical obese controls. The groups will have equal proportions of diabetics and non-diabetics with obesity, enabling us to test its influence. By examining obesity and weight loss in the context of bariatric surgery, this study capitalizes on a powerful natural experimental manipulation that can provide a unique window into the effects of obesity and weight loss on the brain."

"9291490","UT Southwestern?s U54 grant application, entitled ?Myoediting of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,? is a request to join the Wellstone MDCRC Network and describes myoediting, a revolutionary new approach for treating DMD by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing. The goal is to molecularly edit dystrophin gene mutations in striated muscle cells, permanently eliminating the genetic cause of this devastating muscle disease, and restoring muscle structure and function for the lifetime of the target cell. Myoediting will circumvent many of the technical hurdles plaguing other DMD therapeutic strategies. Based on our extremely promising preliminary results and the rapid pace of this field, we feel this is an opportune time to launch this new approach to permanently correct the muscle abnormalities that cause DMD. As a shared resource, the Wellstone Myoediting Core will bring CRISPR/Cas9 myoediting in DMD-iPSC derived striated muscle cells, an entirely new functionality, to the entire Wellstone MDCRC. This will be a high value and easily accessible service for the entire Consortium. Indeed, in the first year, we intend to invite each of our co-MDCRCs to submit one DMD patient to the Wellstone Myoediting Core. Each patient submitted to the Core will undergo clinical phenotyping, next generation DNA sequencing coupled to analysis of dystrophin sequences in the Duchenne Skipper Database for designing guide RNAs. Coupled to this, the Wellstone Myoediting Core will generate patient-specific iPSCs from erythroblasts for CRISPR/Cas9 and guide RNA mediated exon skipping, followed by evaluation of dystrophin rescue in cardiac and skeletal muscle disease-in-a-dish models and teratomas. Together with our colleagues in the Wellstone Network, we will fulfill our goal of bringing a new CRISPR/Cas9 based myoediting therapy to DMD patients within the 5-year time line of this U54 grant proposal."
"9488694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21/R33 project uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of ondansetron on neural functioning and sensory symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders (TD). Despite extensive research, 30-60% of OCD patients do not respond adequately to first-line treatments, with similarly disappointing rates in TD. OCD and TD present a treatment challenge in part because they are heterogeneous disorders characterized by clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing neural etiologies. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to address this problem by investigating transdiagnostic components of behavior that more closely align with brain circuitry. This application focuses on sensory phenomena (SP) - uncomfortable or aversive sensations preceding compulsions in OCD and tics in TD - as a critical component of both disorders with a discrete neural circuitry centered on sensory regions in the insula and somatosensory cortex. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist acting on sensory pathways, is a promising novel candidate for the modulation of neural circuits related to sensory phenomena. Ondansetron reduces sensory symptoms in non-psychiatric conditions and has been shown to decrease overall symptom severity in both OCD and TD. Our pilot data show that single 16 mg doses decrease activation of the insula and somatosensory cortex, raising the possibility that ondansetron may reduce disorder severity by directly targeting sensory circuits. Building on these promising findings, this application uses a double blind, placebo-controlled, mixed design to investigate the effects of three different doses of ondansetron on the activation of neural targets in the insula and somatosensory cortex. Milestone- driven assessment at the end of the R21 phase will provide clear support for a go/no-go decision regarding the engagement of neural targets by the drug. If target engagement is established, the R33 phase will seek to validate these neural targets in a patient sample and test the relationship between target activation and clinical symptoms. Using a double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we will measure the effects of 4 weeks of optimal dose ondansetron (determined from the R21 phase) on brain functioning and sensory phenomena in a sample of OCD and TD patients. Results from the R33 phase are expected to provide support for a second go/no-go decision regarding further clinical development of the targets and intervention. Regardless of outcomes in either phase, results from this project will increase knowledge about mechanisms of disease as well as the intervention."
"9277244","PROJECT II - ENDOTHELIAL FACTORS, THE KIDNEY AND HYPERTENSION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A central theme of this PPG has been the renal-body fluid feedback control system in which the kidneys play a dominant role in the long-term regulation of body fluid volumes and arterial pressure. A common defect that has been found in all forms of hypertension examined to date is a hypertensive shift in the pressure natriuresis relationship (1-3). The overall objective of Project 2 is to determine pathophysiological mechanisms whereby obesity alters endothelial factors, renal hemodynamcis, pressure natriuresis, and blood pressure regulation in a rat model of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), produced by chronic reductions in uterine perfusion pressure or chronic sFlt-1 excess (3-6). While recent studies have demonstrated adverse effects of obesity on placental function, the effects of obesity and metabolic factors such as leptin on the pathways that link placental ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, and maternal blood pressure are unknown (7-9). Based on our preliminary data and the work of others, we propose to test the central hypothesis that obesity and metabolic factors such as leptin enhance the blood pressure responses to placental ischemia in pregnant rats by enhancing placental and adipose tissue production of sFlt-1. In addition, we propose that obesity and metabolic factors such as leptin exacerbate the blood pressure responses to placental ischemia or chronic sFLt-1 excess by exacerbating TNF? and AT1-AA induced endothelial cell production of ET-1. We also propose that high fat diet induced obesity reduces placental perfusion by attenuating cytotrophoblast proliferation/migration and spiral artery remodeling during pregnancy by suppressing the Notch-2/JAG1 pathway. To test this hypothesis, arterial pressure will be examined in conscious, chronically instrumented rat models of preeclampsia produced by long-term reductions in uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP model) or by chronic sFlt-1 excess. We will examine the effects of obesity utilizing a genetic model of obesity which has a Mc4r mutation (MC4R+/-). In addition to animal models, in vitro placental explant cultures will be used to examine the effect of obesity on hypoxia-induced sFlt-1 production, and endothelial cell culture models to examine the effects of obesity on TNF? and AT1-AA-induced ET-1 production by endothelial cells. Cultured cytotrophoblasts, micro-CT, and Doppler velocimetry will be utilized to assess how obesity affects cytotrophoblast proliferation/migration, spiral artery remodeling and uterine artery resistance index. Thus, a wide range of molecular, biochemical, pharmacological, physiological, and imaging techniques as well as in vitro and in vivo models derived from various Cores will be used to test our central hypothesis."

"9431764","The pervasive use of marijuana (cannabis sativa) worldwide, along with its relatively low lethality, has led many to believe that it is of little harm. As such cannabis use currently exceeds that of tobacco smoking among adolescents in the USA. However, is now acknowledged that the developing brain is particularly sensitive to drugs that can impact behavior in adulthood. This is of particular concern given that cannabis is the most commonly abused illicit drug by teens and pregnant women. Our research continues to focus on the impact of ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis associated with reward and psychiatric vulnerability. We demonstrated that THC exposure in the developing brain has protracted effects long into adulthood on molecular and behavioral outcomes relevant to reward sensitivity, motivated behavior and negative affect. Our established prenatal animal model mimiced molecular changes in mesocorticolimbic structures to that seen in our human fetal specimens with maternal cannabis use. Moreover, a number of molecular changes relevant to epigenetic disturbances and synaptic plasticity are also commonly evident in adults with adolescent THC exposure emphasizing common underlying mechanisms of developmental THC effects. We identified a specific epigenetic molecular target (Mll1; multiple leukemia ) directly linked to abnormal motivated behavior induced by developmental THC and have developed state-of-the-art strategies such as laser capture microdissection (LCM) to dissect transcriptome and epigenetic alterations in discrete neuronal pathways. We now employ such strategies to delineate pathway-specific alterations of epigenetic mechanisms across the genome associated with developmental THC. Our study focuses on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which mediates reward, motivated behavior and emotional regulation linked to addiction vulnerability and related psychopathologies. We propose to (1) characterize changes in the epigenome within discrete adult NAc pathways associated with developmental THC exposure and its relationship to transcription using LCM and deep sequencing of chromatin accessibility and overlap with transcriptome data. (2) Establish causal links between molecular alterations identified in specific NAc output pathways wtih behavioral phenotypes relevant to addiction psychopathology. (3) Investigate patterns of adult in vivo neural activity within specific NAc pathways as a consequence of developmental THC exposure using the innovative technique of fiber photometry calcium imaging in a pathway-specific manner. The databases generated from this in-depth body of work will be valuable resources and the results will provide novel insights about the role of specific NAc neural circuits underlying psychopathological vulnerability."
"9380175","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PA-15-261: The Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations, this project ?Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations? proposes to use an existing nationally representative dataset to assess the relationships among sexual orientation, discrimination, stress, tobacco/nicotine use behaviors, and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder in the U.S. Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death; cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the U.S. Past research has generally found sexual minorities are at heightened risk for cigarette smoking and other tobacco/nicotine use. However, many of these studies are plagued by methodological limitations including small, non-representative samples, lack of heterosexual comparison groups and/or limited sexual orientation measures. To date, no nationally representative studies have examined the DSM-5 tobacco use disorder disparities among sexual minorities and few data exists on severity, comorbidity, disability, help seeking, and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder among sexual minorities. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work and conduct secondary analyses of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative survey of 36,309 U.S. adults 18 years and older in the U.S. The NESARC-III study represents the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic status differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) examine the prevalence of (a) cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and other tobacco/nicotine use, (b) DSM-5 tobacco use disorder severity (includes tobacco and/or nicotine products), and (c) comorbidity of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder and mental health disorders based on major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (e.g., general health, physical functioning, and social functioning), help seeking (e.g., counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medication), and recovery (e.g., early and sustained remission) associated with tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on sexual orientation; and (3) determine the relationships among stressful events, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on the Comprehensive Developmental and Minority Stress Model. This project will take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC-III: the availability of an ethnically / racially diverse sample with large numbers of sexual minorities; the inclusion of multiple measures of sexual orientation based on attraction, behavior and identity; and the wealth of data on cigarette smoking, other tobacco/nicotine use, DSM-5 tobacco use disorder, and DSM-5 mental health disorders. Measures of stressful life events and sexual orientation discrimination will enable assessment of two of the major factors presumed to account for health disparities among sexual minorities."
"9319743","ABSTRACT  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, claiming about 50,000 lives in 2015. Colonoscopy is currently the preferred screening modality for colorectal cancer; in theory colonoscopy should prevent most colorectal cancers. However, recent data suggest that there is a significant miss-rate associated with colonoscopy for the detection of even large polyps and cancers. Indeed, reports from Canada and Germany fail to show any protection of colonoscopy for right-sided and only about 70% protection for left-sided colorectal cancer. Reports from the US show that prevention of colorectal cancer related death is at best 53-68% in carefully controlled longitudinal studies. Furthermore, patients of endoscopists with the highest rate of detection of premalignant polyps had the lowest rate of colorectal cancers in subsequent years.  In 2015, the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Society of Gastroenterology renewed consensus guidelines defining a good quality colonoscopy but adherence to these guidelines varies among endoscopists and there is growing concern that these guidelines do not reflect true quality.  We hypothesize that real-time objective feedback during the withdrawal phase of colonoscopy will improve quality of colonoscopy.  We have created software that in real-time evaluates the technique of the endoscopist, categorizes technique into different degrees of quality (similar to software in airplanes that warns pilots against stalling) within milliseconds and via heads-up display technology can inform the endoscopist about the level of measured quality. In other words, we have created a system that has the potential to improve endoscopic technique during a procedure in a live patient.  Using this system, we propose to address two Specific Aims. First, to determine the optimal method of real-time feedback for four features of colonoscopy related to the amount of stool in the colon and the effort of the endoscopist to inspect as much as possible all mucosa of the colon. And second, to test whether real-time feedback during colonoscopy improves quality of colonoscopy and the adenoma detection rate in three endoscopy centers.  Successful evaluation and implementation of the proposed real-time analysis and feedback system has the potential to improve the quality of care of over 14 million US citizens ? the approximate number of people undergoing colonoscopy ? on an annual basis. In addition, the technology lends itself for rapid adaptation to other endoscopic medical procedures such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, cystoscopy, arthroscopy and bronchoscopy."

"9347581","Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) remains a major cause of acute perinatal brain injury, leading ultimately to neurologic dysfunction manifesting as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Unfortunately, current treatment and prevention strategies in newborns are limited. There are no currently available therapies to prevent/treat and/or attenuate brain damage in premature infants other than supportive care and the only available therapeutic intervention for full term infants is hypothermia, which is only partially protective. Inter- alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIP) are naturally derived glycoproteins that have been shown to play an important role in modulating inflammatory responses by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in several experimental models of newborn and adult systemic inflammation and in models of inflammation-induced premature labor. Our recent investigations strongly demonstrate that IAIP reduced neuroanatomical injury in the brain of neonatal rats and improves long-term behavioral indices of learning and memory tasks. In the Phase I SBIR study, we confirmed the beneficial effects of IAIP in neonatal rats after HI, particularly in male subjects. More recently, we obtained supporting evidence that IAIP also has long-term beneficial effects on behavioral function in female rats, suggesting that IAIP has durable neuroprotective effects in both males and females depending upon test and the duration after the HI insult. These findings suggest unique beneficial effects of IAIP on long-term outcomes in males and females, in spite our histopathological beneficial findings mainly in male neonatal rats. The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to obtain robust preclinical and manufacturing process data of human plasma-derived IAIP to support the development as a novel adjunctive neuroprotective strategy to the current standard of care of hypothermia for the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborns. We hypothesize that treatment with IAIP as an adjunctive therapy to hypothermia further enhances the effectiveness of hypothermia as a neuroprotective strategy and improves long-term outcomes after HI brain injury in neonates. The Specific Aims of the studies are: 1) to develop an efficient scalable bioprocess of plasma-derived IAIP and carry out formulation, viral safety and long-term stability studies of purified IAIP; 2a) to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IAIP in male and female rats under conditions of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) and hypothermia (HT) and to perform dose-response studies; 2b) to assess the neuroprotective effects of IAIP as an adjunctive treatment strategy to HT in moderate or severe HI brain injury in newborn rats and 3) to determine the long-term neuroprotective efficacy of IAIP treatment with combined HT after HI in the newborn rats. The proposed studies have significant translational potential to develop IAIP as a novel agent to prevent/attenuate brain damage in full term as well as in preterm infants at risk for mental retardation."
"9383413","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cisplatin is one of the most effective anti-cancer drugs employed for the treatment of various solid tumors. Nevertheless, patients relapse because of the development of cisplatin resistance leading to therapeutic failure. Many studies have challenged the model of chemoresistance, yet the precise mechanism is still elusive.  To better understand the role of protein kinase signaling in cisplatin resistance, we used a kinome-wide small hairpin RNA library to screen for a kinase, which has synthetic lethality when targeted with cisplatin in human cancers, including head/neck, lung and ovarian cancers. We found that suppression of microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase 1 (MAST1) selectively rescued the cisplatin sensitivity in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, leading to decreased cell proliferation, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest in a kinase-dependent manner. Moreover, MAST1 knockdown and cisplatin treatment achieved synergistic tumor growth inhibition in vivo in xenograft mice. Through a phosphorylation profiling, we identified MEK1 as a novel downstream substrate of MAST1. Mechanistic studies revealed that cisplatin inhibits the MAPK pathway by dissociating cRaf from MEK1, while MAST1 binds and phosphorylates MEK1 to reactivate the MAPK pathway. In addition, through a comprehensive proteomics study and transcription factor profiling, we identified upstream regulators of MAST1. In particular, we identified Hsp90AB1 as a binding partner and a stabilizer of MAST1, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a potential transcription factor of MAST1. Furthermore, our preliminary clinical studies revealed that MAST1 upregulation positively correlates with cisplatin resistance in primary tumor tissues from head/neck cancer patients treated with cisplatin, suggesting MAST1 signaling pathway as a promising prognostic marker and a therapeutic target to treat human cancers in combination with cisplatin. Therefore, we screened and identified a FDA approved small molecule kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib as a potent MAST1 inhibitor and a cisplatin-sensitizing agent.  Our central hypothesis is that MAST1 provides cisplatin-resistant proliferative signals through its potential substrate and effectors in cancer cells. Thus, MAST1 signaling represents a promising anti-cancer target in combination with cisplatin. We will use head and neck cancer as a research platform. Three specific aims are proposed: (1) To decipher the molecular mechanism underlying cisplatin-induced MAST1-MEK1 activation, which confers cisplatin resistance in human cancer; (2) To determine how MAST1 is induced and stabilized by GR and Hsp90AB1, respectively to mediate cisplatin resistance; (3) To validate MAST1 as a therapeutic target in treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer using the newly identified MAST1 inhibitor lestaurtinib."

"9281661","CORE B ABSTRACT  The broad objective of the Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core is to support the development of optimized  formulation(s) for microbicide/biomedical prevention (MBP) delivery that result in reliable administration and  sustained drug presence at specified target sites. Innovative approaches have been created to develop NHP  models that more fully represent human use of any HIV prevention modality. Worldwide, HIV transmission is  through sexual encounters and use of any topical product will need to be assessed in conjunction with sex.  However, few laboratories have addressed this issue. To fill this critical gap, we have developed an NHP coital  model and have already assessed product pharmacokinetics before and after coitus. Despite high seminal viral  load associated with HIV transmission, not every sexual encounter results in infection. The repeat, low-dose  (RLD) challenge NHP model more accurately recapitulates the human transmission kinetics. Moreover, use of  the RLD model will allow for multiple viral exposures following a single dose of MK-2048 film providing a robust  evaluation of efficacy. These NHP models, which more accurately portray the real world, will be utilized to  determine the pharmacokinetics of MK-2048 when delivered in an extended release vaginal film, to establish  the safety profile for film use in the presence and absence of coitus, and to assess the developed product?s  potential efficacy in preventing HIV infection."
"9248324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inborn errors of metabolism comprise a large class of genetic diseases involving disorders of cellular metabolism. Homocysteine is an intermediary metabolite derived from methionine. It can either be recycled back to methionine, or shunted down the transsulfuration pathway by the action of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Individuals with mutations in CBS have clinical CBS deficiency, characterized by extreme elevations in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and phenotypes including increased incidence of thrombosis, osteoporosis, dislocated lenses, and mental retardation. Current treatment strategies involve dietary restriction and vitamin therapy, but these are only partially effective and do not work in all patients. Over 85% of the described mutations in CBS deficient patients are missense mutations in which a single incorrect amino acid is substituted into the CBS polypeptide. These mutations are believed to effect enzymatic activity because the mutant protein fails to assemble into an active conformation. The ability of a protein to achieve an activ conformation is affected by a variety of intracellular protein networks including the chaperone system and the ubiquitin/proteasome system, collectively referred to as the proteostasis network. Proteostasis modulators are drugs that perturb various aspects of these networks. The preliminary data, shows that it is possible to stimulate proper folding of different mutant human CBS alleles expressed in mice by proteostasis modulating drugs. The overall goal of this proposal is to explore the interactions between proteostasis modulators and mutant alleles of CBS in a mouse model of CBS deficiency. There are three specific aims: (1) Generate and characterize new mouse models of CBS deficiency (2) Test four known proteostasis modulators for effectiveness of rescue in vivo and (3) Mechanistic studies of how proteostasis modulators effect the intracellular chaperone environment. If successful, the experiments described here could lead to novel treatments for CBS deficiency and potentially other genetic diseases associated with missense mutations."
"9353201","Project Summary/Abstract Gay/bisexual/transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) in large metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles (LA) and New Orleans (NO), have the highest prevalence of HIV in the U.S. adolescent population. Efforts to engage and retain these at risk youth into the prevention and treatment cascades have generally failed with many not identified as HIV infected or at risk. We propose a multi-disciplinary approach of community outreach, behavioral intervention, and prospective surveillance in LA and NO to identify undiagnosed youth at risk/ infected with HIV & STI. Emerging data of perinatal ?Mississippi baby,? a French adolescent with prolonged HIV remission, and adults with acute HIV treatment with early potent ARV have shown that early and sustained viral suppression is associated with a decrease and accelerated decay of HIV reservoirs (VR), which is likely a predictor of long term HIV control and drug free remission. This contrasts with treatment of already established infection where the ½ life of the HIV CD4 T cell reservoir is stable and more than an average lifetime. We hypothesize that very early ARV treatment of adolescents with acute HIV infection will be associated with decreased VR size, and VR size will be significantly different between adolescents with acute, recent or established HIV infection. Individuals with low VR size may be able to attain extended periods of drug free HIV remission. Through innovative point of care screening of at risk youth N=4,500 and prospective testing of high risk seronegative youth N=1,500, we propose to identify 60 youth with established HIV and 36 with acute infection based on lab assays and Fiebig score. These youth will receive prompt potent cART and be followed for treatment response and serial assays of viral dynamics, decay and persistence of VR [(quantitative assays of HIV RNA, proviral DNA (HIV integrated/unintegrated) digital drop DNAPCR, 2LTR circles, spliced/unspliced RNA), replication competent, HIV antibody, cellular assays (HIV specific CTLs, immune activation markers)] in order to characterize biomarkers predictive of HIV remission (ARV-free undetectable HIV viremia). Viral / immune biomarkers will be compared between groups and over time for rate of VR decay. Treatment of youth who stop/ interrupt treatment will be closely followed for evidence of HIV remission and will be encouraged to restart ARV with viral rebound or clinical symptoms."

"9269611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animal and preliminary human studies of adult stem cell therapy for myocardial repair have shown an overall improvement of cardiac function. However, repair of injured myocardium remains a serious challenge. Emerging evidence from in vitro and preclinical studies suggests that ischemic environment including inflammation and oxidative stress, have adverse effects on stem cell function. MicroRNAs (miRNA; 20-25 nucleotides), are known to regulate several cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, cell metabolism, apoptosis and angiogenesis. The premise of our proposed research is based on preliminary observations that 1) prolonged inflammation impairs tube formation ability of mouse BM-derived EPCs, in vitro 2) miRNA array data from EPCs, in response to inflammatory stimuli, indicates an up-regulation of number of miRNAs related to cell survival/death and angiogenesis with a robust increase in miR-377, 3) myocardial infarction (MI) increased miR-377 expression in the myocardium, circulating EPCs and plasma, 3d post-MI; 4) pre-miR-377 transfection in EPCs inhibits protein expression of STK35 (a novel kinase localized in the nucleus), a potential target gene of miR-377, 5) miR- 377-mimics reduced EPC migration and vascular tube formation 6) Furthermore, STK35-knockdown in EPCs reduced HDAC5 phosphorylation and increased GATA2 acetylation (indicating transcriptional repression) and was associated with reduced expression of cytokines and growth factors, and reduced migration and vascular tube formation. 7) Most interestingly, in mouse MI model, intramyocardial transplantation of ex vivo anti-miR-377- transfected EPCs decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and infarct size, enhanced neovascularization and LV function and therefore efficient myocardial repair. These data provide convincing evidence that anti-miR-377 therapy might enhance the EPC engraftment and function in myocardial ischemia leading to efficient myocardial repair. Our central hypothesis is that ex vivo miR-377 knockdown and intramyocardial transplantation of EPCs augments their function by stimulating STK35-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear export of HDAC5 leading to increased GATA2-mediated transcription of genes (including cytokines and growth factors) that promote neovascularization and cardiomyocyte viability, thus resulting in efficient myocardial repair after injury. The hypotheses will be tested under the following 3 specific aims: 1) Define the role of miR-377 in EPC biology and function, in vitro 2) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which miR-377 regulates STK35-mediated EPC function and 3) Determine the critical role of miR-377 in EPC-mediated myocardial repair, using a mouse model of myocardial infarction."
"9282325","San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs. In addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-wortd effectiveness that improves health care for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire 11 to T4 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions.  Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists.  Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Based on our vision of improving the health status of South Texas by accelerating scientific discoveries and public health applications, we will deploy strategic resources that focus on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic population, 2) the special health issues facing active-duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US."
"9293182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this epidemiologic study is to determine the 10-year incidence of hearing, vision, and olfactory impairments and sensory declines, generational differences in incidence, and the associations of potential risk factors wit declines in sensory and cognitive function in the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (BOSS) cohort. Subjects are participants in the BOSS and were 21-84 years of age at the baseline examination (2005-2008). The proposed examination will use standardized protocols used in the baseline and 5-year follow-up examination and will include a hearing evaluation (otoscopy, audiometry, word recognition and dichotic listening tests, distortion product otoacoustic emissions), eye examination (refraction, visual acuity measures, contrast sensitivity, accommodation, near vision, digital images of the retina and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the macula), olfaction testing (San Diego Odor Identification Test and olfactory threshold test), vascular measures (carotid ultrasound to measure the intima-medial thickness and blood pressure) and cognitive function measures (Trail Making Test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Digit Symbol Substitution, Mini-Mental State Exam). A standardized questionnaire about medical history, life-style factors and medication usage will be completed. Hemoglobin A1C will be measured on blood samples obtained at the examination. Inflammatory markers will be measured on samples from the 5-yr and 10-yr follow-up. Vitamin D, B12, cadmium and lead levels will be measured to determine their associations with sensory and cognitive changes. Stored samples from adults in the BOSS and the parent cohort seen in the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (AG11099), will be genotyped using a 384 SNP custom array for use in analyses evaluating associations of genetic risk scores with sensory and cognitive function. This study of middle-aged adults will provide important new information about the epidemiology of sensory impairments in the people born since World War II compared to people born in earlier periods. This study will contribute to developing interventions targeted at midlife to prevent or delay the onset of age-related changes in sensory and cognitive function and provide essential information for planning to meet the health care needs of the aging baby-boom generation."
"9249077","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although advances in genome wide and candidate gene association studies continue to identify common genetic variants contributing to birth defects (a leading cause of infant mortality [54]), recent evidence indicates that discovered loci only account for a small fraction of risk. As a result, researchers are shifting focus to investigae rare variants that could be responsible for this missing heritability of birth defects. The trio design (genotyping the affected child and both parents) is preferred for such association studies because it is robust to population substructure and only requires sequencing three people, rather than larger families. However established methods for analyzing common variants using trio data are hindered by reduced power when analyzing rare variants using sequence data. Thus, there is a critical need to develop methods that jointly test for common and rare variants using the trio design to comprehensively model the genetic factors associated with birth defects in order to identify the genetic variants driving the association with disease risk. Current methods for analyzing rare variants primarily focus on pooling the rare variants in a region and performing a global test for that region. To further increase power, some methods include common variants in the model as covariates. Of the few most recent methods that can statistically identify rare variants that drive the association, all are based on the case control design, which requires birth defect researchers who have been collecting trio data to find an external set of controls. This is less than ideal. There is a strong need for methods that can jointly analyze common and rare variants using trio data in such a way that can statistically identify the genetic variants (rare and common) that drive association with birth defects. We propose to fulfill this need with the following aims: (1) Develop a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection method for common and rare variant analysis using trio data that can identify the variants driving the association; and (2) Compare the performance of the global component to existing global tests for trio data using both simulated and real data for congenital heart defects. To achieve these aims, we will develop a novel Bayesian model for trio data, using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to quickly compute the modes of the Bayesian posterior distribution as estimates for genetic regions as well as specific variants (rare and common). The proposed research is innovative because it will develop new and powerful statistical methodology. The proposed research is significant because it will produce a new powerful and widely applicable method for uncovering the genetic basis for birth defects and other childhood diseases. Ultimately, the new methods will improve birth defects research, and the application to real data can improve our understanding of the etiology of congenital heart defects, potentially improving genetic counseling and prevention strategies for congenital heart defects."
"9376000","PROJECT SUMMARY Complex brain disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders stem from heterogeneous genetic predispositions (and at times, with environmental influences). A common hallmark of these disorders is a systems level brain dysfunction. Although human genetic studies have identified a repertoire of disease susceptibility genes with functions ranging from transcriptional and translational regulation to synaptic structural modulation and neurotransmission, at present, little is known as to how disruption of genes and associated molecular and cellular processes alter brain connectivity that define certain behavioral features of each disorder.  This exploratory R21 application aims to develop a new platform for understanding, at the basic circuit level, how disruption of genes alters brain connectivity, thereby attempting to connect molecules cells and behavior. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have explored resting-state or task-related functional connectivity, which measures correlations among distinct neurophysiological events in human brains. These studies have provided a valuable framework, but the lack of cellular resolution and difficulty to carry out experimental perturbation in humans precludes further cause-effect relationship studies. To uncover brain functional connectivity at systems levels with cellular resolution, we propose to perform brain-wide calcium imaging and computational analyses employing larval zebrafish. As a vertebrate genetic model organism, zebrafish shares considerable neuroanatomical and genomic similarity with humans. Larval zebrafish, with a transparent brain of ~100K neurons (as compared to ~75 million in the mouse, and ~1 billion in the human brain), is particularly suitable for dynamic single-cell resolution imaging in vivo. In this application, through brain-wide calcium imaging and computational data analyses, we propose to determine how genetic alterations may affect brain functional connectivity at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish. Expected outcomes and impact: If successful, this project will establish a new paradigm to uncover, at systems level and with cellular resolution, how genetic changes alter brain connectivity. These studies will lay critical foundation for future understanding of mechanisms between gene alterations and circuit activity changes, as well as expanding the studies to a greater number of genes. We will make technologies including image acquisition, processing, and computational algorithms available to the broad research community. In the long run, new basic knowledge about gene and brain connectivity relationships will aid in developing novel therapeutic ideas. The high risk and high reward nature of the proposed work makes this application well suited for the R21 mechanism."
"9312841","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years, three leading Delaware institutions -the University of Delaware, Christiana Care Health System and Nemours/ Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children - have received over $140M in biomedical infrastructure awards through the IDeA program. As a result of this funding, a strong statewide biomedical research network has developed. However, as is true for most IDeA programs, relatively few of the currently funded research programs are clinical or translational in scope. These Delaware institutions have developed a strategic partnership with the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), the lead institution of an existing NIH-CTSA award. The Delaware Clinical and Translational Research Program (DECTR) will leverage MUSC's experience and further build the infrastructure in both states needed to create sustainable, nationally competitive, clinical an translational research programs. The Specific Aims of the DE-CTR are to: 1) develop the infrastructure to facilitate the growth and development of clinical and translational research within Delaware and South Carolina; 2) facilitate the recruitment, training, and professional development of clinicians, scientists, and engineers that will synergistically develop outstanding clinical and translational research programs; and 3) develop model community engagement outreach programs that promote health and wellness to a diverse population of Delawareans. The five Key Component Activities (KCAs) outlined in this proposal- Clinical Translational Pilot Grants Program; Clinical Research Education, Mentoring and Career Development; Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Clinical Research Expansion and Support; and Community Engagement and Outreach - will be supported by the proposed Administration and Evaluation Cores. The DE-CTR will develop the infrastructure to rapidly grow and develop clinical and translational research programs within and across the partnering institutions by concurrently building on the existing strengths of each institution and providing the key components to allow growth in strategic areas to improve the health of the citizens of Delaware, South Carolina, and the nation."
"9355205","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an intractable interstitial lung disease characterized by fibroblastic foci, remodeling and obliteration of alveoli, and a median survival of 3 to 4 years. The only definitive treatment is lung transplantation, an intervention hampered by low availability of donor organs, and severe surgical and immunological complications. Innovative approaches are therefore urgently needed. We identified three major challenges towards improving the prognosis of IPF, and propose to address these challenges in the three research hubs of our consortium: (1) Cell sources should be established to study pathogenesis of IPF and to eventually prevent or reverse fibrosis. In Hub 1, we propose directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into lung tissue to investigate pathogenesis and establish platforms for drug discovery. (2) Cell removal/delivery methods are needed to either replace irreversibly damaged lung tissue, or the cells that carry pathogenesis of IPF. In Hub 2, we will develop the necessary bioengineering modalities that will take advantage of directed differentiation of hPSCs into lung tissue. (3) The field requires a large animal model for the validation of pathogenetic mechanisms and preclinical validation of novel therapeutic modalities for IPF developed by the first two research hubs. We therefore propose to establish a miniature swine model for IPF to validate pathogenetic mechanisms discovered in Hub1, and cellular replacement approaches developed in Hub 2. The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain desperately needed insight into the pathogenesis of IPF (Hub 1) and to use these insights to inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches for IPF (Hub 2). As IPF is currently an untreatable disease, it is not possible to predict which approaches will be beneficial, and the therapy may be dictated by disease stage. Pharmacological approaches may target the fibrotic process itself, or pathways emanating from epithelial cells that initiate this process and would likely be useful in early stage disease or in patients that are genetically predisposed. Regenerative approaches could consist of cellular therapies, in particular targeting ATII cells, most likely early in disease or in patients predisposed to IPF, but may extend to transplantation of recellularized lung scaffolds in end-stage disease. Both types of regenerative approaches will require bioengineering technologies that will be developed Hub 2 and informed by a deeper understanding of IPF pathogenesis achieved in Hub 1. Ultimately, verification of disease mechanism and preclinical testing of therapeutic approaches requires a large animal model, which is the focus of Hub 3."

He received his M.D./Ph.D. from Yale University, where he studied the innate immune response to malaria in the laboratory of Dr. Richard Bucala. After Dr. Griffith?s clinical training, he joined the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Luster at the Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases (CIID) at MGH, where he has focused on the role of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in modulating the immune response to influenza. The short term-goals of this K08 award resubmission are to provide training in adaptive immunology, advanced microscopy, and genomic techniques. Dr. Griffith?s long-term goal is to develop an independent R01 funded research program studying the factors that modulate the host response to respiratory viral infection. Environment: Dr. Griffith will perform the work in this proposal in the CIID at MGH, under the mentorship of Drs. Andrew Luster and Benjamin Medoff. The CIID is a state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research center focused on mechanisms of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and is the foundation for immunology research at MGH. Additionally, Dr. Griffith has organized a Training Advisory Committee consisting of Drs. Lawrence Turka, Nir Hacohen, and Thorsten Mempel to provide expertise and training in Treg biology, advanced genomic techniques, and advanced microscopic imaging. Dr. Griffith will additionally attend meetings and complete didactic courses in adaptive immunology, imaging, bioinformatics and systems biology. Research: The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ST2+ and CXCR3+ Tregs in the lung of influenza- infected mice are distinct Treg subsets with unique requirements for activation and non-redundant functions. Specifically, we propose that ST2+ Tregs are ?innate Tregs? that modulate IL-17 producing innate-like gd T cells, while CXCR3+ Tregs are ?adaptive Tregs? that directly influence the antigen specific effector responses. Furthermore, we present data that the chemokine receptor CCR5 is required for the formation of ST2+ Tregs in the lung during influenza while IFN? signaling specifically reduces the number of these cells. This suggests that modulation of these pathways could specifically augment ST2+ Treg function and fine-tune innate inflammation without compromising the adaptive response and viral control. We therefore plan to use mouse models, conditional knockout mice, transcriptome analysis and imaging to understand the role and regulation of the these Treg subsets in influenza. Specifically, we propose (1) To determine the roles of the ST2+ and CXCR3+ Treg subsets during influenza infection, (2) To determine the role of CCR5 in ST2+ Treg generation, (3) To understand the significance of IFN? mediated downregulation of the ST2+ Treg subset during influenza."
"9302826","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly half of patients become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. Unfortunately, the success of existing interventions to address this problem has been relatively limited, either because of the nature of the intervention or their broad applications to patients who do not require them or will not benefi from them. The efficacy of future efforts is likely to be increased by targeting interventions to non-adherent patients with poor or worsening control of their chronic conditions and tailoring interventions to individual patients based upon the willingness and ability to improve their adherence. Because the most effective interventions appear to be those that are multi-faceted and thus often complex, there is also a need for multimodal interventions that are simple and which can be integrated into routine practice. The validation of adherence measures that are not based upon administrative claims data, but which can be derived from self-reported adherence or rapidly available and routinely collected pharmacy transaction records, is also a priority.  To this end, we propose a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a novel tele-pharmacist based intervention to improve adherence to medications for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes. This application builds on many years of research by our group on improving medication use and evaluating novel interventions in existing real-world delivery systems. The intervention will integrate the use of the electronic health record (EHR) and pharmacy claims data to identify approximately 3,000 adult patients cared for by approximately 150 primary care physicians who are both non-adherent and not achieving recommended clinical targets for glycemic, blood pressure, and cholesterol control in a real-world primary care setting. Following EHR-facilitated referral from the treating primary care physicians, a clinical pharmacist will direct an outreach program using multiple communication technologies including text messaging, secure email, mail, and video visits with the intensity of the intervention tailored to the patient's level of activation.  The aims of the study are to: (1) implement and evaluate the ability of a novel tele-pharmacist intervention in a multispeciality group practice to improve adherence and clinically relevant outcomes, (2) assess the cost- effectiveness of the intervention, and (3) validate the ability to use retail pharmacy filling data and self-reported daa to evaluate adherence. Using a rigorous randomized design, we have proposed a feasible and sustainable intervention that links adherence to clinically relevant outcome measures as a core component of the program. As the nation considers substantial investments in health information technology and primary care based population management, our intervention will provide important insights into how to effectively improve medication adherence and ultimately, chronic care outcomes."
"9273359","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is designed to support the career development of Susan Fink, MD, PhD, a laboratory medicine physician (clinical pathologist) trained in cellular biology who has begun postdoctoral research under the guidance of Dr. Akiko Iwasaki. The proposed mentored research experience and career development activities describe a 5-year training program to give Dr. Fink the skills to become an independent investigator at an academic medical center, studying innate immune responses to viral infections. She will achieve this goal through the guidance of her mentors and advisory committee, coursework and seminars and development of scientific expertise in virology and immunology. Her mentor, Dr. Iwasaki is an established leader in immunology with a history of training successful young scientists, and the Departments of Immunobiology and Laboratory Medicine at Yale provide a rich scientific environment.     Programmed cell death is a defense mechanism used by multicellular organisms to eliminate potentially harmful cells, including pathogen-infected cells. Dr. Fink's graduate research allowed her to identify pyroptosis, a novel form of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death triggered during bacterial infection. She seeks to build on her prior training to study cellular responses to infection in a setting in which she has less experience, namely viral infection. Dr. Fink's initial postdoctoral research has revealed the importance of apoptotic host cell death in response to two viruses: herpes simplex virus-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus. Her findings uncovered a pathway whereby activation of the host protein Ire1? inhibits apoptosis. Ire1? is activated during the unfolded protein response, a cellular pathway to detect and alleviate dysfunctional protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ire1? is also activated by genetic deficiency of it downstream target, Xbp1. Dr. Fink found that activation of Ire1? in Xbp1 genetically deficient cells caused resistance to apoptosis during infection with herpes simplex virus-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus. The inability of these infected cells to undergo apoptosis prolonged viral replication and significantly increased production of virus.     These findings suggest the hypothesis that infections and cellular stresses that activate Ire1? will also cause resistance to apoptosis. The experiments outlined in this proposal will determine the molecular mechanisms of Ire1?-mediated apoptosis resistance (Aim 1A) and examine whether viruses that trigger ER stress utilize this pathway (Aim 1B). In addition, this proposal will address the hypothesis that inhibition of basal Ire1? activity increases susceptibility to apoptosis (Aim 2A) and examine whether apoptosis susceptibility can be modulated as an antiviral therapeutic strategy (Aim 2B). Together these aims will illuminate inhibition of Ire1? s a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the host response to diverse viral infections."
"9274370","?    DESCRIPTION:  There are many areas of biomedical research where the study of rare circulating cells is important. Examples include cancer metastasis, hematological malignancies, organ transplant biology, immunology, and reproductive medicine and stem-cell therapies. In this project we will develop a new high-throughput optical scanner with unprecedented capabilities for studying rare circulating cells in small animals in vivo.  Circulating cells are normally quantified by drawing small blood samples which are purified and analyzed with hemocytometry or flow cytometry. However, it is known that handling and purifying blood samples can affect cell viability, and that rare cells can escape detection due to the small sampling volume. More recently, `in vivo flow cytometry' (IVFC) methods have been developed that allow enumeration of cells without drawing samples. While extremely useful, these generally rely on interrogation of microscopic blood vessels with small flow rates, so that rare cells are undetectable. New high-sensitivity and high-accuracy tools for studying circulating cells are therefore greatly needed by the research community.  In this proposal we will develop a miniaturized optical scanner that will use diffuse photons to interrogate circulating blood in the limb of a mouse. The technology - termed ultra-rare cell IVFC (UR-IVFC) - will employ a number of unique design elements including, i) multiple tomographic optical rings with fiber-coupled lasers and fluorescence detectors, ii) efficient geometric light collection, iii) frequency encoded lasers and detector channels, and, iv) advanced signal processing algorithms for accurate counting and tracking of cells. In combination, UR-IVFC will allow single-cell sensitivity in a 10 minute scan and with a false alarm rate less than 0.001 per minute.  We anticipate that the unique capabilities of UR-IVFC will have immediate impact in many research fields. We will first use UR-IVFC to study treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), a hematological malignancy for which there is currently no cure. We will study cell mobilization therapy, which is an emerging treatment strategy for MM. MM cells are chemically forced from the protective bone marrow niche into circulation where they are vulnerable to chemotherapy. We will use UR-IVFC to study whether specific clonal sub-populations of MM cells are resistant to mobilization, and we will test the efficacy of mobilizing agents for minimal residual disease (MRD). In addition to illuminating molecular mechanisms of MM biology and treatment resistance, these studies could yield new therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from MM. Moreover they are extremely difficult (or outright infeasible) to perform with existing technology."
"9263998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ensuring the safety and comfort of the more than 100,000 critically ill infants and young children supported on mechanical ventilation in the US each year is integral to the practice of pediatric critical care. Humane care of these young patients requires the use of sedating medications, most commonly combinations of opioids and benzodiazepines. Unfortunately, sedative use also carries risk. Animal studies found that even transient administration of benzodiazepines and other sedatives during periods of developmental synaptogenesis caused widespread neuronal apoptosis and residual learning and memory deficits. Sedation is administered for days to weeks to >90% of acutely-ill, ventilated infants and children. Thus, a commonly used treatment in critically ill young children may itself have detrimental, age-dependent long-term effects. An opportunity to increase the understanding of the long-term cognitive effects of sedation during critical illness in children ha been provided by the cluster randomized, controlled trial of a sedation protocol, Randomized Evaluation of Sedation Titration for Respiratory Failure (RESTORE), U01 HL086622, PI Curley, 31 sites, n=2,816. This trial will determine if the trial's sedation protocol used at intervention sites can decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and sedative exposure among children with acute respiratory failure due to a primary pulmonary process. Control sites continue usual sedation practice. We are collecting detailed data on doses and durations of sedative medications, in-hospital course, and post-discharge quality of life. Testing neurocognitive outcomes was beyond the scope of the initial trial design. However, given evolving concerns about the long-lasting neurocognitive effects of some sedatives, understanding these outcomes is now crucial in this population, regardless of the protocol's short-term effects. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationships between sedative exposure during pediatric critical illness and long-term neurocognitive outcomes. We will assess multiple domains of neurocognitive function 3 years post-discharge in 500 RESTORE subjects with normal baseline cognitive function aged 2 weeks to eight years at pediatric intensive care unit admission. In addition, we will study 310 matched, healthy siblings of RESTORE subjects to provide data on an unexposed group with similar baseline biological characteristics and environment. Our goal is to increase our understanding of the relationships between sedative exposure and long-term neurocognitive outcomes in infants and young children."
"9312851","The DE-CTR partners appreciate the critical importance of evaluating the process and outcomes in each of the key Core and other program areas (KCAs) described in this proposal and in the DE-CTR as a whole. This includes process evaluation, both ofthe design and implementation and outcome evaluation ofthe products and effectiveness in each area. Even more important, evaluation requires assessing the consequences of collaborative efforts across the areas, beginning with increased communication and leading to changes in how  decisions are made and resources shared. Since translational science is a dynamic and non-recursive process in T1 and T2 and ultimately T3 and T4 processes, evaluation has a critical role in (1) determining that these translation processes do in fact occur, (2) providing formative feedback to inform midcourse corrections, (3) providing summary results that demonstrate effects, and (4) disseminating findings among the DE-CTR partner institutions and more generally to the health services community. To fulfill this role, the Evaluation Core will  involve all the DE-CTR partners in Delaware and South Carolina in a dynamic and participatory fashion, providing formative feedback to the other KCAs and the Steering and Advisory Committees throughout the course ofthe DE-CTR. Finally, the Evaluation Core will provide all ofthe grant-required summative feedback. The Evaluation Core recognizes that its evaluation program will be shaped by collaborative efforts with our South Carolina CTSA partners (SCTR), Delaware community partners, and other regional and national CTSA and IDeA-CTR programs; by cooperation with NIH's national evaluators; and by participation in plans for evaluating the IDeA-CTR grants nationally. Therefore, this proposal describes an evaluation plan that will evolve iteratively as the DE-CTR collaborative develops and will continue to monitor progress beyond the CTR grant."
"9416324","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, yet coronary artery (CA) development and regeneration remains incompletely understood. Artery development is guided by both genetic and mechanical cues, the latter of which involves hemodynamic forces that function to shape the hierarchal organization of vascular beds. Mechanical signals are particularly important for CA development since their differentiation is only induced after the unperfused coronary plexus attaches to the aorta and begins to receive blood flow. Our long-term goal is to understand how initiation of coronary blood flow is translated into developmental signals that trigger CA differentiation and stimulate their subsequent maturation and stabilization. We recently discovered that Dach1, a transcription factor in the Drosophila retinal determination gene network (RDGN), is expressed in developing CAs, but is downregulated by high, laminar shear stress once the vessels mature. CAs in Dach1 knockout mice are small with frequent structural abnormalities including some loss of hierarchal structure. Furthermore, Dach1 depletion in vitro decreases the proliferation and migration of coronary endothelial cells. The goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms through which Dach1 supports CA development and whether its flow-induced downregulation is necessary for maturation and/or stabilization. We hypothesize that Dach1 interacts with other RDGN members to regulate the transcription of genes essential for proper CA growth, and that this activity must be decreased during vessel maturation/stabilization due to its inhibition of BMP/SMAD- induced vascular quiescence. These hypotheses will be tested in three Aims. We will (1) identify how Dach1 influences gene transcription, whether RDGN members act as its partners, and how these interactions modulate endothelial cell behavior during CA development, (2) investigate the function of high shear stress mediated Dach1 downregulation during artery maturation, and (3) test whether Dach1 interacts with BMP/SMAD to regulate artery size. These studies will delineate how Dach1/RDGN transcriptional complexes direct arteriogenesis. They will also provide insight into the mechanisms by which hemodynamic forces regulate transcriptional programs to shape the hierarchal organization of the mature vascular tree. Knowledge of these mechanisms could be utilized stimulate the growth of existing or new arteries during disease."
"9259678","Project Summary/Abstract  The deubiquitylase USP22 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 22) is highly expressed in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Moreover, additional studies showed that human AML samples with mutations in an upstream activator of Ras signaling expressed the highest levels of USP22. Studies in vitro have shown that USP22 is required for the transition from self-renewal to differentiation in embryonic stem cells, is necessary for the transcription of c-Myc target genes and its germ line deletion is lethal. However, the function of USP22 in leukemogenesis is unknown.  The long term of goal of this project is to understand the function of USP22 in cancer. Reason for which, our lab generated the first conditional mouse model of Usp22. Preliminary observations using a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasm and T-ALL (MPN/T-ALL) induced by Ras, showed that contrary to what was expected, Usp22 genetic deletion did not improve mice survival. These mice presented non-hematological tumors that impeded further studies on the function of Usp22 using this mouse model. For this proposal, a different mouse model that develops only myeloid malignances ?Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) driven by MLL-AF9? will be used for studying the function of Usp22. Based on the data obtained using the MPN/T-ALL mouse model, the central hypothesis for this study is that Usp22 mediates hematopoietic differentiation and its absence increases the accumulation of early stage progenitors under oncogenic conditions. This hypothesis will be addressed in two aims. The first aim will focus on studying the phenotype and cellular mechanisms by which Usp22 deletion will accelerate MLL-AF9?driven AML. The second aim will address the molecular mechanisms involving Usp22 transcriptional regulation of Myc in AML. The methods that will be used to accomplish the proposed aims include novel transgenic mouse models, genome wide RNA sequencing, molecular biology assays and biochemistry techniques.  The studies proposed in this project will provide fundamental insights into the in vivo functions of USP22 in myeloid malignances. It will also result in the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis. In future studies, we will study the function of USP22 in other blood malignances such as T- Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia, in which USP22 is also highly expressed."
"9288547","Summary Little is known about dementia disparities for Mexican Americans, who comprise the majority of United States (US) Latinos. Mexican Americans experience substantial social disadvantages compared with non-Latino whites in the US, including lower education, lower socioeconomic status, and migration-related stressors. Despite sustained disadvantage, the limited available evidence suggests that Mexican Americans exhibit similar rates of dementia as non-Latino whites. Unexpected health advantages of Mexican Americans have also been observed for many other health outcomes. Selective migration, both of healthy people from Mexico to the US and return migration of unhealthy adults back to Mexico, is a leading explanation for the Mexican American health advantage. Several known risk factors for dementia are also predictors of migration from Mexico to the US. However, no work has quantified selective migration and the bias it introduces to the comparison between Mexican American and non-Latino whites with respect to dementia risk. Therefore, it is unknown whether a dementia risk disparity exists for Mexican Americans after correcting for selective migration. In this study, we propose to combine data from two harmonized, nationally representative cohorts of adults aged 50+: the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS, n=26,690, including 2,452 Mexican Americans) and the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS, n=13,798). These cohorts include harmonized longitudinal cognitive measures that are robustly linked to dementia risk. Accounting for selective migration is almost impossible with US-only data. Combining data from a Mexico- and a US- based cohort, we include both migrants and non-migrants, allowing us to test whether there are disparities in dementia risk and major factors driving dementia risk in Mexican Americans after accounting for migration patterns. This binational study will allow us to (Aim 1) quantify selective migration from Mexico to the US and return migration to Mexico as a function of established childhood and adult dementia risk factors that may influence migration patterns. We will then create a ?propensity to migrate? score. This score will adopt a new approach to evaluating the contribution of social factors to selective migration bias, based on evaluating relative social position within Mexican Americans born in Mexico, US-born Mexican Americans, and US-born non-Latino whites, rather than directly comparing people with the same absolute social position. Using this score to account for selection bias, we will show the magnitude of (Aim 2) differences in dementia risk comparing Mexican Americans to US non-Latino whites and (Aim 3) differences in dementia risk associated with migration to the US, compared to people who remained in Mexico. The link between socioeconomic factors and health in Mexican Americans is uncertain, so we will (Aim 4) identify effects of education, household and neighborhood disadvantage, and discrimination on dementia risk of Mexican Americans, accounting for selective migration. This study will provide critical information about dementia risk in this growing US population and other disadvantaged or immigrant groups."
"9221054","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In this P01 proposal entitled ?Pathophysiology of genetically defined dementia and neurodegeneration: Defining therapeutic targets and pathways,? we seek to push forward the development of precise medicines to treat debilitating diseases associated with C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansions, the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success in developing a treatment for c9FTD/ALS will require a well-orchestrated effort that addresses multiple aspects of the drug discovery process. To improve the prognosis for patients suffering from c9FTD/ALS, we thus propose to investigate pathomechanisms by which C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansions cause disease, as well as develop bioactive small molecules and biomarkers. We have assembled a world- class team combining expertise in chemistry, neurology, cell biology, disease modeling, and biomarker development that has worked closely together and has all resources in place. Our significant progress to elucidate how expanded G4C2 repeat RNA transcripts drive toxicity and how to abrogate aberrant features associated with c9FTD/ALS has led to the discovery of: (i) novel pathomechanisms caused by the accumulation of G4C2 repeat RNA or ?c9RAN proteins? unconventionally translated from G4C2 repeat RNA; (ii) the first small molecule known to influence c9FTD/ALS disease biology; and (iii) a first-in- class biomarker to investigate new therapeutic strategies.  We now bring forward novel and innovative chemical approaches to develop and optimize chemical probes to study and mitigate c9FTD/ALS disease mechanisms. We also present evidence that nucleocytoplasmic transport defects may be a fundamental pathway of c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis amenable to therapy. Indeed, we reported that disruption of the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport is a primary cause of neurodegeneration in Drosophila and patient-derived cell models of c9FTD/ALS. In addition, we have established that poly(GP) c9RAN proteins are not only detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from c9FTD/ALS patients but also in peripheral blood lymphocytes. What is more, preliminary data suggest that CSF poly(GP) levels associate with clinical features of disease. As such, poly(GP) proteins may prove useful in monitoring disease severity and rate of progression. Building upon these exciting findings, our multi-disciplinary studies will improve understanding of C9ORF72-related neurodegeneration, identify therapeutic targets and potential clinical and pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and lead to the design of bioactive small molecules with therapeutic potential. Combined, our efforts are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of an effective therapy for c9FTD/ALS."
"9402456","Abstract Kidney dysfunction can precipitate serious medical conditions including proteinuria, osteoporosis, and formation of kidney stones. These conditions occur more frequently, and progress faster, in crewmembers stationed on the International Space Station. Current static models of the proximal and distal tubules are unable to recapitulate cellular functions including protein reabsorption via megalin, vitamin D metabolic bioactivation, and micro-crystal mediated injury response. We have developed a microphysiologic model of the proximal tubule using primary proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) that has successfully demonstrated physiologic cellular structure/polarization, transport of glucose and drug substrates, bioactivation of inactive 25- hydroxy vitamin D to 1?,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (which promotes beneficial bone remodeling), and physiologic injury response to toxic exposure. We will expand this technology to develop a distal tubule epithelial cell model (DTEC) which will be used to explore the pathophysiologic response to oxalate microcrystals. Studying the proximal and distal tubules in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station presents the unique opportunity to observe accelerated disease processes (proteinuria, osteoporosis, kidney stones), which will facilitate the discovery of factors that contribute to the development and progression of kidney diseases that cannot be observed on a conventional time scale. Therefore, the aims of this project are: to determine the effects of microgravity on the polarized structural aspects (eg., ion and solute transporters) of the kidney proximal and distal tubule epithelium in a 3D microphysiological system, to determine if Vitamin D bioactivation/homeostasis within the kidney proximal tubule is compromised in response to extended exposure to microgravity, and to create a disease-state models of proximal tubule proteinuria and distal tubule kidney stone formation to evaluate the harmful or adaptive modulating effects of microgravity. A better understanding of the factors and pathways that underlie proper cellular structure and the development and progression of kidney diseases will uncover novel therapeutic targets that can be used in the development of pharmacologic agents that can improve the health of Space Station crewmembers as well as the health of the general public by preventing or reversing proteinuria, osteoporosis, and kidney stones."
"9288206","During pregnancy, dramatic growth of fetal and placental vasculatures is required for remarkable increases in fetal and placental blood flows to supporting the developing fetus. During these processes, vascular endothelial cells reside under physiological chronic hypoxia (pCH), which is critical for cell homeostasis as more severe hypoxia is known to be associated with many endothelial dysfunction related diseases such hypertension and preeclampsia. VEGF and FGF2, two potent growth factors actively regulate many endothelial functions via protein kinases and also via G proteins including GNA11 and GNA14. Specifically, GNA11 has been shown to be required for VEGF-simulated growth of new blood vessels. GNA14 has also  been implicated in human hypertension and preeclampsia. However, nothing is known regarding the actions of GNA14 in endothelial cells. To study the roles and underlying signaling mechanisms of GNA14 and GNA11 in mediating fetal endothelial functions, we propose to examine the roles of GNA14 and GNA11 in modulating pCH-enhanced vascular growth and vasodilatory actions in response to VEGF and FGF2 using primary HUVE and HUAE cell lines established under pCH (-20-25 days; 37 C, 5% C02, 3% 02) and standard cell culture normoxia (-20-25 days; 37 C, 5% C02, 95% air, SCCN). These studies are the first to systemically explore the role of GNA14 in mediating endothelial functions, and the role of GNA11 in mediating eNOS expression and activation. The findings of these studies will greatly advance our understanding of actions of GNA14 and GNA11 in human fetal angiogenic and endothelial vasodilatory  functions, particularity under pCH, which will provide clues about novel targets for therapeutic intervention in these hypertension-related diseases."
"9276004","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite its growing prevalence in Western society, the underlying molecular mechanisms that control the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain poorly understood. The overall objective of the current proposal is to apply in vivo 2H/13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and metabolomics profiling to identify liver phenotypes that accelerate the transition from NAFLD to NASH and to assess in vivo responses to pharmacologic and genetic interventions designed to inhibit this transition. These studies will use a melanocortin-4 receptor knockout (MC4R-/-) mouse model that has been previously shown to rapidly and spontaneously develop characteristics of human NASH upon Western diet feeding. To enable the analysis of intermediary liver fluxes in this and other transgenic mouse models, a novel GC-MS-based MFA approach has been recently developed that requires only 40 ?L of blood plasma, yet can determine in vivo fluxes with precision equivalent to state-of-the-art NMR-based approaches. This approach will be applied to simultaneously assess changes in citric acid cycle (CAC) and gluconeogenesis fluxes in response to chronic or acute lipotoxic treatments. The central hypothesis is that abnormal ER calcium release promotes overactivation of mitochondrial metabolic pathways and oxidative tissue injury leading to NASH. The rationale for this research is that identifying in vivo metabolic pathway alterations that differentiate simple steatosis from NASH will enable better targeted approaches for NASH prevention or treatment. The research involves three specific aims. The first aim is to identify metabolic phenotypes associated with Western diet-induced liver injury. The working hypothesis is that overactivation of mitochondrial CAC flux accelerates hepatocyte lipotoxicity in the context of NAFLD. The second aim is to determine the extent to which inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism can prevent oxidative stress in fatty liver. The working hypothesis is that pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism in liver will dose-dependently reduce oxidative tissue injury in NAFLD mouse models. The third aim is to determine the extent to which inhibition of ER calcium release can reverse mitochondrial overactivation in fatty liver. The working hypothesis is that enhancing the ability of ER to sequester calcium will normalize mitochondrial metabolism and reduce hepatocyte lipotoxicity. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it applies a newly developed GC-MS-based MFA approach that is faster, less expensive, and requires less sample volume than NMR-based approaches. The research is expected to achieve the following key outcomes. First, it will identify metabolic phenotypes that promote the transition from simple hepatic steatosis to progressive NASH. Second, it will identify potential therapeutic targets for inhibiting this transition. Third, it will establish a scalable in vivo MFA approach that is suitabe for routine mouse liver phenotyping. This research is significant because it will identify dysregulated metabolic pathways that can be targeted to inhibit the progression from NAFLD to NASH."
"9271186","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Human amylin, a pancreatic peptide hormone, is the principal constituent of amyloid deposits in the pancreas, a hallmark of type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Aggregation of human amylin into small soluble oligomers and ?-sheet-enriched fibrils is linked to dysfunctions of beta (?)- and other islet cells and pathogenesis of T2DM. Although much progress has been made in understanding the actions of amylin oligomers and aggregates, the cellular events and factors that contribute to amylin oligomerization, aggregation and toxicity in the pancreas remain largely unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate factors regulating amylin oligomerization and aggregation in the pancreatic human islet cells, and to determine the underlying mechanisms of amylin-mediated islet cell death. Our published and preliminary results suggest that plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol and endocytosis play a key role in amylin turnover and toxicity in the human islet cells. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that the amylin receptor (AM-R), clathrin and v- SNARE/Rab endocytotic proteins mediate amylin uptake and degradation in lysosomes, the impairment of which stimulates amylin oligomerization and aggregation, oxidative stress and consequently apoptosis of human islet cells. To test this idea, amylin trafficking, degradation and toxicity pathways in cultured human islet cells will be explored by combinations of atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal microscopy, spectroscopy and biochemical approaches. The objectives of the proposal are to: (1) elucidate amylin trafficking and degradation pathways in human islet cells, and determine the extent to which they contribute to formation and accumulation of toxic amylin oligomers and aggregates, (2) determine the causal relationship between amylin turnover and toxicity in human islet cells, and (3) determine the mechanisms by which amylin oligomers and/or aggregates stimulate oxidative stress in human islet cells and thereby activate redox-sensitive stress kinases, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These studies should provide a better understanding of the molecular and biochemical events leading to formation of amyloid aggregates and soluble toxic amylin oligomers, knowledge which is critical for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of T2DM."

"9309125","Summary - The Yale KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program began in 2006 as the educational arm of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation. The mission remains to attract a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health and Biomedical Engineering who are interested in pursuing careers in any aspect (T1-T4) of translational research: to imbue them with a spirit of discovery; to train them in the use of state-of-the-art research tools; to give them the skills to work in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams; and to support their professional development. This Program has been highly successful, attracting to date 105 Scholars who have successfully competed for more than 140 individual NIH awards and of whom 98% have gone on to positions in academia or industry after completion of the Program. Going forward we seek to build on this exciting success in developing the next generation of translational researchers by promoting our core strengths of strong mentor/mentee relationships, outstanding learning opportunities, and strong programs for career development while simultaneously encouraging even greater numbers of this diverse group of Scholars to participate in multidisciplinary team science, community-based participatory research, and industry-academia partnering. To oversee these diverse and highly motivated junior investigators, we have established an educational leadership team consisting of 3 premier investigators with strong mentoring skills and expertise in different areas of translational research, along with 2 outstanding education experts with expertise in the evaluation and dynamic reshaping of medical education programs. The leadership team will work directly with Scholars and their mentors to develop programs in team-based research that address complex medical and/or societal problems of health and healthcare delivery, and to use this research to solve problems in patient care in ways that provide real and measurable positive impacts on health in the US and around the world. In recognition of the complexity of the research needs and the career paths of these Scholars, the leadership team has adopted a logic model to track and evaluate the activities of the Scholars, track the success of the program, and continuously improve the program to meet the Scholars' needs. With these new additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of representative and diverse translational researchers as they navigate the rapidly changing healthcare challenges and opportunities inherent in successfully performing outstanding clinical and translational research."
"9265839","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus are key to the central regulation of glucose and energy expenditure. Of particular importance is PI3K signaling in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a brain region central for the regulation of sympathetic outflow. Our preliminary results reveal the complex nature of PI3K signaling, with multiple subunits, each responsible for different aspects of energy homeostasis. Within this application we have developed novel mouse genetic tools to study the physiological requirements for the PI3K pathway and leptin signaling in anatomically identified SF1 neurons. Furthermore, we will examine how these pathways converge to mediate the beneficial effects of exercise. Together, these studies will increase our understanding of the biological control of energy balance, how it relates to exercise, and will provide mechanistic insights to the effectiveness and safety of newly approved anti-obesity drugs."
"9281598","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting healthy brain aging is of increasing concern to an aging population as the baby boom generation approaches age 65. Dietary management has received a great deal of interest as mounting evidence from observational studies suggests dietary factors may be associated with the risk of developing neurological diseases, including cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive decline, in the elderly. Many of the neurological diseases of aging are known to develop as a result of subclinical brain changes. These brain changes can now be visualized and quantified using MRI; therefore MRI markers of brain changes are worth being considered to better understand the association between diet and brain aging. Neuroimaging markers are extremely sensitive measurements of changes occurring in the aging brain, and can also help us understand better the associations of different aspects of diet with specific changes of brain dysfunction. Current literature on the associations between diet and neuroimaging markers in the elderly has been extremely sparse. In particular, dietary patterns and longitudinal change of neuroimaging marker have been rarely investigated. Our previous work shows that higher adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet was associated with lower prevalence of subclinical brain infarcts but not white matter hyperintensity, emphasizing the value of exploring dietary patterns and multiple imaging markers. The overall aim of this study is to examine how dietary factors are related with brain changes seen on MRI imaging. Specifically, the proposed study will examine the association between dietary factors (both individual nutrients and dietary patterns) and neuroimaging changes of the brain (including global and regional brain atrophy measured by volume and cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity, subclinical brain infarcts) through a series of studies including: during the mentored phase, (1) a cross-sectional study of the relationship between baseline dietary factors and above-mentioned neuroimaging markers using data from the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) -II Imaging Study; and during the independent phase, (2) a longitudinal study of the association between baseline diet and change of these imaging markers in a subset of WHICAP-II Imaging Study participants who have repeated imaging evaluations, (3) a cross-sectional replication study based on data from an on-going WHICAP-2010 Imaging Study to examine the reproducibility of the study (1) findings, and (4) a cross-sectional exploratory study based on data from an on-going WHICAP-2010 Imaging Study to explore the relationship between diet and two additional MRI markers collected in WHICAP-2010, cerebral blood flow and brain connectivity. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the role of dietary factors in imaging markers of brain aging."
"9277447","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of protease-inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy (PI-ART) has reduced the mortality associated with HIV infection (HIV+). Unfortunately, PI-ART use is a major risk factor for insulin resistance, an important risk factor fr diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile salt, improves insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant people who do not have HIV. We have found that TUDCA markedly ameliorates ritonavir-induced insulin resistance in human myotubes and mice. The mechanism(s) responsible for these TUDCA-induced metabolic improvements are unclear, but could be related to: 1) TGR5 receptor activation, which upregulates cellular factors in muscle, including type 2 deiodinase (which increases intracellular triiodothryonine) and PGC-1 that increase mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation and/or 2) acting as chaperones that reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by assisting protein folding. Initiation of ritonavir-boosted PI-ART worsens insulin sensitivity in HIV+ people and induces markers of ER stress in adipose tissue. We propose to perform a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to determine if TUDCA improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant, HIV+ people receiving PI-ART and to clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for these improvements. We will randomly assign 48 insulin- resistant, HIV+ subjects to either placebo or TUDCA (1.75g/day x 30 days) and will measure multi-organ insulin sensitivity before and after the intervention by using a multistage hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with infusion of stable isotope labeled tracers. To clarify the mechanisms responsible for the anticipated improvements in insulin sensitivity, we will examine the effect of TUDCA on TGR5 activation (type 2 deiodinase expression) in skeletal muscle biopsies and on ER stress by measuring Grp78 in adipose tissue biopsies taken before and after TUDCA administration. The results from this study will determine not only whether TUDCA may be effective for treatment of PI-associated insulin resistance but is also expected to identify new pathways by which TUDCA exerts insulin sensitizing effects. In addition to improving clinical care of people with HIV, the findings of this study may allow development of new drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes."

"9330486","PROJECT SUMMARY Accumulating basic, clinical, and population research suggests that high amounts of abdominal fat, particularly visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the intra-abdominal depot, plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic diseases (i.e. type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and stroke). This research has elegantly described the intimate nature of VAT as a powerful metabolic driver of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. It also suggests that total body fat, and more specifically subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), may be relatively less important or even benign in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic disease. Despite this burgeoning framework of knowledge, much remains unknown about the relationship between abdominal VAT and SAT levels with incident cardiometabolic disease events ? a critical gap in the evidence base since further insight resulting from research on this topic would have major implications related to the importance of body composition and obesity in cardiometabolic disease prevention. The central reason for the bottleneck in the evidence base has been feasibility. Researchers and clinicians have had to rely on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure specific adipose tissue depots. Issues such as cost, radiation, and availability have made these methods impractical in the clinic and for large research studies; and the few studies which have incorporated these technologies may have limited sample size, or have not accrued enough follow up time and events to adequately address the topic. However, there is an efficient and economical solution to this problem via the application of new technology that quantifies abdominal VAT and SAT from existing Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans. This technology has demonstrated strong validity with gold-standard measures of abdominal adipose tissue depots from MRI and CT scans. Therefore, we propose to apply this novel technology to the existing Women's Health Initiative (WHI) DXA cohort to quantify abdominal VAT and SAT from existing DXA scans. This proposal will create a valuable, new, minority enriched, analytic longitudinal cohort that will utilize repeated DXA measurements in the WHI at baseline (N=10,607), year 3 (N=8,939), year 6 (N=8,239), and year 9 (N=4,595) to address essential questions on the topic of abdominal adiposity/body composition, and cardiometabolic disease risk in postmenopausal women as they age. This project capitalizes on a rich scientific resource and will provide new and advanced results that will delineate the importance of abdominal adipose tissue depots in cardiometabolic disease risk and the potential for targeted interventions and prevention efforts."
"9291483","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks continued funding to expand and improve the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS), the nation's most comprehensive source for statistical data, geographic data, and metadata describing spatial characteristics of the American population. Census data provide the denominators that are essential for all spatial analyses of epidemiological and demographic change; it is impossible to interpret the incidence of disease or death without knowing the population at risk. Over the past decade, NHGIS has collected area-level U.S. census data from diverse sources, formatted them consistently, developed comprehensive standardized machine-readable documentation, and created high-precision boundary files describing historical census tracts and counties. To make it feasible to assess change over time, NHGIS has developed integrated data tables that incorporate comparable data across multiple census years. To make the data broadly accessible to the research community, the project has produced powerful new dissemination tools that allow heath researchers to navigate quickly and easily through the intricacies of the U.S. statistical system. With 253 billion data points, NHGIS is the largest accessible population database in the world, and it represents an essential component of big data infrastructure for population and health research. Over the past five years, the number of researchers using the database has increased 600%, and the project is now disseminating 26 terabytes of data per year. This continuation project has four major goals: (1) To expand the database through the addition of all new American Community Survey summary files, new historical census data, new health datasets, and additional integrated time series tables. (2) To realign historical NHGIS boundaries to ensure compatibility with the 2010 census features, thereby allowing users to execute spatiotemporal analyses that include both recent and historical data. (3) To improve data infrastructure and access by implementing novel database structures, an Application Programming Interface that allows external software to access NHGIS data, and new capabilities to reduce redundant effort by researchers. (3) To ensure dissemination and preservation through the development of a long-term preservation plan, implementation of digital object identifiers (DOIs) to facilitate data citation and research replication, and user support, training, and outreach. NHGIS represents a permanent and substantial contribution to the nation's health research infrastructure. It gives investigators the power to analyze variation in human behavior simultaneously across both time and space, opening unprecedented opportunities to understand processes of change. With the addition of new data describing health and the environment, NHGIS will become an even more powerful tool for spatiotemporal analysis of population health."
"9291418","Project Summary/Abstract Autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes arise through a breakdown in immune tolerance. We have now come to understand that immune tolerance consists of a multi-layered network that keeps such untoward responses in check. In this program project grant, three complementary teams will be working together to further unravel how these checkpoints operate to improve our understanding of autoimmunity and ultimately improve its treatment. This program project will have three highly collaborative and interactive projects headed by Drs. Mark Anderson (Project 1), Jeff Bluestone (Project 2) and John Kappler (Project 3) along with two scientific cores (Animal core and Molecular core). The major themes of the grant are: 1. The impact of central thymic tolerance on the T effector and Treg repertoire in T1D.. 2. Insulin as a critical self-antigen specificity for both T effectors and T regulatory cells in T1D. 3. Peptide specificity of Tregulatory cells in T1D 4. Using peptide binding characteristics of islet antigens to improve bioassays and tolerance methods. The long term objectives of this work is to improve our understanding of how T cell tolerance is controlled and the further refining the specificity of the autoreactive T cell response in type 1 diabetes. The investigators will be using state of the art tools in both animal models and in human subjects with type 1 diabetes. Results of these studies will help further refine our understanding of autoimmunity and help improve methods for its treatment and diagnosis."
"9245561","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is focused on understanding the molecular composition, mechanism of action, and modes of communication of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-organelle membrane contact sites (MCSs). Increasing evidence indicates that ER MCSs are crucial regulatory hubs, but they are poorly defined on both the molecular and functional levels. I will address this deficit by examining the mammalian homologs of a newly described class of conserved ER MCS proteins, termed Loc (lipid transfer at organelle contact site), identified in our lab in yeast (yLoc). We have demonstrated that in vivo yLocs directly facilitate membrane contacts between the ER and many other organelles and in vitro yLocs mediate the non-vesicular sterol transport between liposomes. My preliminary data reveal that the mammalian Loc (mLoc) family member GRAMD2 localizes to Ca2+-dependent ER-plasma membrane (PM) MCSs, which function to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE is a PM Ca2+ influx pathway that is induced by depletion of Ca2+ from ER stores and is critical for cell homeostasis. Building on this observation and our yLoc data, I will  focus on understanding the molecular basis and functions of mLocs at ER MCSs. Specifically, in Aim 1, I will examine the functional role of GRAMD2 at Ca2+-regulated ER-PM contacts. In Aim 2, I will define molecular activities and the mechanistic role of GRAMD2. In Aim 3, I will probe the functional role of other mLoc protein family members and examine their relationships at ER MCSs. Understanding the fundamental role of mLoc will inform upon MCSs regulation and composition will provide fundamental insight into the roles of ER MCSs in cell physiology, which will improve our understanding of the etiology human disease and could reveal new targets for therapeutics."
"9387645","One of the major challenges in the clinical management of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Although microRNAs (miRNA) are potential predictors of cancer progression, to date there are no molecular studies reporting the role of circulating miRNA as biomarkers for predicting response to treatments in ccRCC. Our group has been conducting clinical trials in ccRCC patients with the aim to develop effective combination therapies. We have recently completed a Phase I/II clinical trial to assess the clinical benefit of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat in combination with the VEGF blocker bevacizumab in patients with prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and assessed the expression of serum miRNA pre and post treatment. Exiqon microarray analysis has revealed the differential regulation of 134 microRNAs in the post- vs. pre-treatment samples. In particular, in patients who achieved an objective response (Responders) we have observed a significant up regulation of miRNA-605 at baseline as compared to patients who had progressive disease (Progressors). Interestingly, further analysis has revealed that following treatment downregulation of miR-605 expression occurred only in the Responders group. The decrease of miR-605 in the circulation suggests its availability inside the cells. Our bioinformatics prediction algorithms have revealed that SEC24D, a member of coat protein complex II (COPII), is targeted by miR-605. SEC24D is involved in the selection of cargo, concentration, and secretion of biomolecules such as proteins and RNA. To evaluate the effect of HDAC inhibition on SEC24D ccRCC cells were treated with vorinostat and assessed SEC24D expression. We found significant inhibition following HDACi treatment. Furthermore, we observed an increase in intracellular levels and decrease in exosomal miR-605 in 786-0 cells, suggesting an effect of vorinostat on miR-605 secretion. In addition, we also observed the inhibition of mutant p53 expression, as a reported target of miR-605. The current proposed study is aimed to determine a specific miRNA alteration associated with response to epigenetic modulators. Our hypothesis is that the inhibition of SEC24D leads to decrease of extracellular secretion of miR-605 which correlates with response to epigenetic modulators. We have designed the following specific aims to test our hypothesis: Specific Aim 1- To determine the effect of HDAC inhibition on SEC24D and miR-605 in ccRCC cells and patient derived tumor xenografts (PDXs); Specific Aim 2- To assess the correlation between clinical outcome and miR-605 expression in serum from RCC patients receiving HDAC inhibitors in combination with VEGF and PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The results from this pilot project will identify a specific circulating miRNA as potential biomarker of response to HDACi treatment that will need to be validated in further prospective clinical studies. Identification of specific molecular alterations of miR-605 and SEC24D in ccRCC patients will provide the rationale for future personalized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of HDACi in combination strategies."
"9366078","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathies represent prevalent causes of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality worldwide. While landmark clinical trials have led to the establishment of effective heart failure therapies and improved clinical outcomes, mortality rates remain high and many patients ultimately experience disease progression, highlighting the clinically unmet need to identify novel treatments. Myocardial recovery is an increasingly recognized outcome for a small but significant number of patients with heart failure. Patients who experience myocardial recovery have improved quality of life and survival. Based on these observations, myocardial recovery represents an achievable outcome and a potential new therapeutic target. However, the mechanisms that dictate recovery and ultimately determine why some patients recover cardiac function while others experience disease progression are poorly defined.  Remarkably, children with heart failure demonstrate a significantly greater capacity for myocardial recovery compared to adults. To dissect the mechanisms that mediate myocardial recovery in this context, we developed a mouse model of acute heart failure and successfully recapitulated the observation that the pediatric heart has a robust capacity for tissue repair and functional recovery. Mechanistically, we discovered that the injured pediatric and adult heart harbor distinct primitive and definitive macrophage subsets and that these cells govern why pediatric and adult mice display differing pathologic responses and capacities to recover following tissue injury. Collectively, these experiments uncovered a previously unrecognized complexity within the innate immune system and have challenged the paradigm that all macrophages are derived from monocyte progenitors. While these observations are thought provoking and provide proof of principle that distinct macrophage lineages have the capacity to differentially orchestrate cardiac tissue repair and heart failure progression, it is unclear how these concepts apply to the chronically failing heart.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the chronically failing mouse and human heart contains evolutionarily conserved macrophage subsets derived from distinct developmental origins that orchestrate cardiac tissue repair and adverse remodeling, respectively. Specifically, we hypothesize that primitive macrophages preserve cardiac function by stimulating tissue repair, whereas definitive monocyte-derived macrophages promote heart failure progression through inflammation, resultant collateral damage, and subsequent adverse remodeling. Clinically, the identification of reparative and inflammatory cardiac macrophage populations and elucidation of the signaling pathways by which these cells exert their effects is likely to provide the necessary information to develop novel therapeutic strategies to limit disease progression and promote recovery of the failing heart."
"9330758","Project Summary  Loss of cholinergic innervation is an early pathological sign in many neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) and it is thought to underlie cognitive deficits in these diseases. Another early symptom, one that precedes the canonical symptoms of these diseases by many years is deficits in olfaction. It stands to reason that if we can provide a mechanistic explanation linking these early deficits to AD and PD, we will have an early biomarker for these diseases and allow for the design of strategies for early intervention and treatment.  In this proposal we test the idea that olfactory insults can cause the degeneration of central neurons that express genes that confer susceptibility to degeneration. To test this idea, we will use mouse models that over-express these genes only in cholinergic neurons. The two genes being tested are the tau, implicated in AD (and now in PD) and the A53T mutant ? synuclein (A53T ?syn) along with a flurophore (GFP or Td-Tomato).  The mice will be subject to either chemically-induced anosmia or treatments that specifically target dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb (intranasal MPTP or stereotactically injected 6-OHDA).  We will then examine the cholinergic projections in these mice. For this we will use the CLARITY technique for rendering the brain transparent coupled with light sheet microscopy that allows us to image deep into tissues. Using this technique we will reconstruct and render in 3-D the cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain to the olfactory bulb. This will allow us to compare changes in cholinergic innervation under conditions of olfactory insults.  This project is the first attempt at providing a link between olfactory dysfunction and the cognitive symptoms seen in AD and PD. It will also be the first to provide a detailed 3-D rendering of the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Results from this study will provide the basis for using olfactory dysfunction as an early biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases."
"9310285","ABSTRACT The lymphatic system is essential in mediating tissue fluid homeostasis and intestinal lipid uptake. Importantly, lymphatic dysfunction positively correlates with body-mass index in morbidly obese patients accentuating the importance of the lymphatic system in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. In support, mice lacking one allele of Prox1 (a master regulator of lymphatic differentiation) develop adult onset obesity due to defective lymphatic vessels. How dysfunctional lymphatics aggravates metabolic syndrome, and conversely, how obesity impairs lymphatic function are poorly understood but highly medical relevant questions. This is highlighted by the fact that obese breast cancer patients undergoing lymphadenectomy are 3.6 times more prone to develop secondary lymphedema than non-obese breast cancer patients. Our long-term goal is to uncover molecular mechanisms governing lymphatic vascular function in health and disease and to identify critical regulators in hopes of offering potential new therapeutic targets to combat devastating metabolic disorders. We have identified two molecules that cooperatively regulate the pro-lymphangiogenic VEGFR3 signaling pathway. Using novel mouse models, we will determine whether manipulating these molecules will enhance the repair and regenerative response of lymphatic vessels after challenges such as lymphadenectomy and high fat diet. We will use sensitive imaging approaches and clinically relevant mouse models to address our questions. Specifically, we will determine molecular mechanism by which Foxc2 regulates lymphatic function in adult mice and define the regulatory machinery controlling the expression of Foxc2 and epsin in lymphatic endothelial cells. Finally, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting Foxc2 or epsin in lymphatic dysfunctions. In summary, our findings could translate into innovative approaches to treat lymphatic dysfunctions and metabolic disorders."
