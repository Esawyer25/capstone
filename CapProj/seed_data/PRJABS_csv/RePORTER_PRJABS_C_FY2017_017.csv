"9245468","Project Summary There is growing consensus that, because 97% of adolescents use social media sites (SMS) and because SMS content frequently portrays heavy drinking as normative and glamorous, SMS may powerfully shape teen drinking behavior. NIAAA has identified first-year college students, particularly during their first six weeks on campus, as a high-risk group for heavy drinking and harmful consequences and our pilot research suggests that this cohort may be especially likely to turn to SMS during this critical period for cues about the social norms of their new college environment. Given that normative perceptions are among the strongest known predictors of alcohol use, these students may be particularly influenced by SMS alcohol content during this time. However, extant research has suffered from important methodological limitations (e.g., relying on self-reports of SMS alcohol exposure, examining Facebook alone despite emerging evidence that Instagram may be more influential; examining only one hypothesized mediator [normative perceptions] of the SMS-drinking relationship). Further, no interventions have yet been designed to mitigate the risk associated with SMS alcohol influence, largely because an understanding of the cognitive pathways involved is severely lacking. In order to advance the scientific knowledge of SMS influences on underage college drinking and inform the development of SMS-based prevention efforts, the proposed project seeks to: 1) evaluate short- and long-term effects of viewing SMS alcohol content on later drinking using recently-developed content analysis software to objectively assess exposure to peers' alcohol-related posts on Facebook and Instagram during the first weeks of college; 2) elucidate both explicit (perceived norms, expectancies, beliefs) and implicit (approach/excite alcohol associations and implicit expectancies) cognitive mechanisms by which exposure to peers' alcohol- related SMS content influences drinking trajectories; 3) identify the characteristics of student observers (e.g., demographics and personality characteristics) that make SMS alcohol influence more likely; and 4) identify the specific attributes (e.g., media richness, social context) of alcohol-related social media posts that make influence more likely. This project will follow 400 incoming students from July prior to matriculation through April of their spring semester. A software application installed on participants' computers and smartphones will monitor time spent using SMS while a novel web portal designed for the present study will systematically sample content from participants' Facebook and Instagram newsfeeds during the first 30 days of college. Throughout the year, participants will complete web-based measures assessing their explicit and implicit alcohol-related cognitions, personality and individual difference variables, and alcohol consumption and consequences. Findings will substantially bolster our understanding SMS alcohol influence during a critical developmental period and will inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of SMS-based prevention and intervention efforts aiming to mitigate alcohol-related risks on college campuses."

"9123934","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities of varying degree of severity and affect approximately 2-3% of all births in the U.S. The currently recommended first-tier prenatal genetic screen (PGS) from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists involves genome-wide screening of structural variations (SV), which represent the leading genetic cause of congenital anomalies, ranging from numerical abnormalities in the chromosomes to submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs). There are two validated cytogenetic procedures for genome-wide detection of SV; karyotyping and chromosomal microarray (CMA). Karyotyping detects gross changes in the chromosomes, including balanced chromosomal rearrangements (BCRs), while CMA can identify large genomic imbalances. Neither method is capable of detecting both BCRs and CMA-resolution CNVs. Moreover, detection of submicroscopic BCRs and sub-array resolution CNVs is intractable to both methods, yet my preliminary studies suggest these `cryptic' SVs are an important and currently uncharacterized genetic cause of congenital anomalies. This fellowship will focus on the application of an innovative whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach to detect all mutational classes of SV in prenatal diagnostic testing, at a timeline and cost comparable to conventional cytogenetic methods. The project will leverage 4,400 already collected samples from the Prenatal Diagnostic Consortium in which both karyotyping and CMA have been performed at a centralized laboratory. The study hypothesizes that SV sequencing will have superior resolution to conventional methods, and that delineation of cryptic SVs will increase diagnostic yields by at least 50% compared to any currently available method. Aim 1 will test the sensitivity of WGS compared to karyotyping and CMA by analyzing over 200 prenatal samples with a cytogenetically detected and clinically significant SV. Aim 2 will establish the incidence, frequency, and diagnostic yield of cryptic SVs on 400 trios in which the proband harbors a structural defect / dysmorphism detected on ultrasound but no known pathogenic SV. Putative pathogenic SVs will be annotated and interpreted by large-scale quantitative analysis using convergent genomic data from CNV burden in >135,000 individuals and loss of function mutations in exome sequencing of >75,000 samples. Aim 3 will test the feasibility of SV detection from deeply sequenced prenatal libraries, and will perform an exploratory analysis comparing SV detection from amniocentesis vs cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA), which if successful could have a significant impact on PGS for cffDNA. Overall, this project represents a unique training opportunity to develop skills in each of my targeted areas of career development by gaining access and expertise in a diverse set of genomics technology, bioinformatics, statistical genetics, clinical genetics, and exposure to molecular diagnostic techniques. Moreover, while the training potential of the project is high, the studies proposed have the potential to transform PGS."

"9316956","Eight herpesviruses cause disease in humans. Most are virtually ubiquitous, and collectively they impose a huge burden on human health, ranging from the pain and inconvenience of genital herpes caused by herpes simplex viruses (HSV) to the devastating congenital disease and life-threatening pneumonia caused by human cytomegalovirus to the cancers associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). For some there are safe and effective antiviral drugs, but for others the drugs that might be effective have serious side effects that rule them out for many applications. Clearly there is much more to be done to reduce the vast impact of herpesviruses. This proposal focuses on EBV, not because it is the herpesvirus most in need of antiviral treatments but because it is the most amenable to studying membrane fusion, an essential process for entry of all herpesviruses into cells. There are two reasons for this. (i) In the context of epithelial cells, only glycoproteins gB and gH/gL are needed for fusion, with gH/gL believed to bind gB and trigger a conformation change that activates its fusion activity. For most other herpesviruses, gH/gL must itself be activated by an additional viral protein before it can activate gB. (ii) EBV gB can also be conformationally activated by heat, providing an experimental mechanism for distinguishing between gB mutations that prevent gH/gL binding and those that prevent the conformation change. Binding of gH/gL to gB is a potential target for antiviral drugs, but the rational design of such drugs is currently not possible because the 3D structure of the binding site is unknown - neither the gB residues that constitute that site nor the structure of gB before activation (pre-fusion gB, to which gH/gL most likely binds) have been determined. The known structures are for post-fusion gB (the structure after membrane fusion), and the pre-fusion form has resisted crystallization. The experiments proposed will identify the residues that form the binding site and identify mutations that lock gB in its pre-fusion state, thus enabling the future determination of that structure and subsequently rational drug design for preventing EBV entry into cells. Most importantly, this proof-of-principle will hasten the rational design of antiviral drugs for any herpesvirus. The aims are therefore: (1) to identify the gB residues required for binding of gH/gL; (2) to identify mutations that prevent gB from undergoing the conformational change from its pre-fusion form to its post-fusion form. A novel approach to selection of sites for mutagenesis has been developed. Activation of correctly folded mutants by gH/gL, by heat, or by neither, combined with susceptibility to proteolysis, will identify those which cannot bind gH/gL, those which can bind gH/gL but not switch to the fusogenic conformation, and those which fold during synthesis into the post-fusion form and therefore cannot be activated. The roadblocks standing in the way of drugs designed to prevent entry of herpesviruses into cells will then have been removed."
"9258929","Abstract Despite the public health burden posed by human papillomavirus (HPV) - associated cancers, it is unclear how social and behavioral traits, different kinds of host immunity, and competition between types shape the epidemiology of HPV. The individual-level risk factors that sustain HPV, which may differ between HPV types, define high-risk subpopulations that are key to behavioral public health interventions. Biological interactions between HPV types, which may be synergistic, neutral, or competitive, determine the effect of HPV vaccines. The eradication of vaccine-targeted types could lead to ?type replacement? by competing non-targeted types, a phenomenon that has been observed in pneumococcus. The proposed project investigates these aspects of HPV ecology and epidemiology by fitting mechanistic mathematical models to longitudinal data. The data span 37 different HPV types in over 4,000 men sampled across nine years at six-month intervals. The data contain information about patient demographics and sexual practices that affect viral dynamics. By fitting a mechanistic transmission model, we will measure how different behavioral and health traits affect susceptibility to infection and identify core risk groups that may sustain transmission in the population. Furthermore, we will infer the degree and timescale of HPV interactions. We will measure the impact of previous infections on HPV dynamics to infer the extent and duration of immunity in natural infection. We will also measure the impact of coinfections to infer how types interact directly. Our approach, based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Partially Observed Markov Processes, implicitly incorporates the stochastic, nonlinear dynamics of infection. The proposed research will, for each HPV type, measure its transmissibility in different subpopulations, interactions with other types, and interactions with host immunity. This information will be used in contact network simulations to predict the consequences of current and hypothetical eradication efforts and to optimize intervention strategies."
"9385180","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this R21 proposal is to provide the foundation for future research to examine the utility of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) as a new treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Interest in OT as an alcohol treatment stems from its role in adaptive processes including reward, associative learning, memory, and stress responses. Support for its use is based on studies in animal models of addiction showing that OT reduced alcohol reinforcement, attenuated drug tolerance, and decreased withdrawal symptoms. OT exerts its effects via interactions with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as well as dopamine mesolimbic reward and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) stress systems. OT effects on stress systems are of high interest given the strong link between stress, alcohol drinking and relapse, and known dysregulation of HPA-axis activity in heavy drinkers. Both preclinical and clinical evidence provide evidence that OT may help to normalize blunted stress responses, and attenuate alcohol withdrawal associated hypercortisolism, negative mood and withdrawal symptoms. Using gold-standard laboratory procedures in heavy drinkers, we will examine the effects of intranasal OT administration on cortisol stress responses and different measures predictive of alcohol use and misuse under double-blind placebo controlled conditions. Aim 1 will examine the effects of oxytocin on alcohol withdrawal, including symptom severity, alcohol craving, cortisol and negative mood. Aim 2 will examine the effects of oxytocin on response to social stress. Aim 3 will examine the effects of oxytocin on motivation to drink. Aim 4 will examine the effects of oxytocin on alcohol sensitivity. These preliminary data will provide critical information on the potential of OT as a treatment for alcohol drinking problems and will provide the basis for determination of sample sizes for future comprehensive research and clinical trials."
"9203629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of milder and more efficient methods towards complex molecule construction is a vibrant area of research within organic synthesis. In particular, certain structural motifs have achieved a privileged status within organi chemistry, due to their seemingly ubiquitous presence in bioactive molecules. For example, the benzylic carbon stereocenter is a common motif found in medicinal agents, agrochemicals, and natural product isolates. The substitution and functionality provided on the carbon framework can profoundly alter cell membrane permeability, half-life time of the molecule in a biological environment, and potency of a drug within the human body. Thus, the generation of a broad catalytic platform for this motif would be highly desirable.     Recent advances in copper(I) hydride chemistry have demonstrated the potential of this catalytic platform for producing diastereoenriched and enantioenriched molecules under mild conditions with inexpensive sources of copper and silane. Still, significant advances could be achieved with this chemistry towards other asymmetric methodologies. Two specific aims outlined in this proposal detail two transformations that are catalyzed through reductive copper catalysis: enantioselective hydroarylation and enantioselective benzylic alkylation. The starting material proposed is styrene, a class of molecules produced on a millions of tons scale each year, and a variety of commercially available or easy-to-produce electrophilic sources.     Lastly, mechanistic investigations will be pursued to isolate any competent intermediates in the catalytic cycle, identify the presence of any Cu(II)/Cu(III) or radical intermediates, and to develop a stereochemical model. Computational, kinetic, and spectroscopic investigations will, in turn, be applied to second-generation ligand framework synthesis and the expansion of this asymmetric methodology to other classes of olefins."
"9218420","PROJECT SUMMARY Obesity is an accelerating worldwide health crisis associated with the comorbidities of metabolic syndrome. An alluring possibility to combat obesity and metabolic disease is to activate beige adipocytes, brown-like adipocytes that reside in white adipose tissue with the capacity to conduct non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis (NSAT). To this end, mice engineered to have increased beige fat activity resist weight gain, have enhanced insulin sensitivity, and improved lipid levels. Further, a recent study of the FTO obesity risk allele in humans implicated impaired beige fat activity as a causal factor associated with human obesity. Thus, increasing beige fat activity appears to be a novel and viable method to treat metabolic disease. However, doing so will likely require a greatly improved understanding of the mechanisms governing the development and function of beige adipocytes. It is well appreciated that thyroid hormone and its receptors, the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), are associated with thermogenesis, although the basis for this action is not clear. Recently, we demonstrated that pharmacological TR activation by a synthetic agonist, GC-1, can profoundly induce beige fat activation, `beiging', in vitro and in vivo. This finding has led us to believe that TR signaling represents a crucially important, yet overlooked, component of beige fat activation. Thus, the overarching theme of this proposal is to precisely define the role of TR signaling in beige fat function, specifically to test our hypotheses that TR activation is both necessary and sufficient to induce beige fat activation. We seek to do so within the following 3 aims: 1) To determine whether TR activation is sufficient to induce white adipocyte beiging. 2) To determine whether TR signaling is necessary for WAT beiging and required for beiging by agents such as ?-AR agonists and cold exposure. 3) To determine the origin of beige adipocytes that arise following TR activation. At the completion of these aims we expect to understand how TR signaling regulates beige fatdevelopment and activity, knowledge which we expect will help us develop new anti-obesity therapies."
"9376150","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medications designed to diminish the psychologically rewarding effects of methamphetamine (METH) use could offer substantial protective effects for patients trying to cease METH use, especially if these medications could reduce the medical setbacks caused by recidivism. Anti-METH monoclonal antibody medicines that tightly bind METH in the bloodstream and sequester METH away from its site(s) of action in the brain are showing promise as a viable medical therapy. Importantly anti-METH antibodies are non-addicting, long acting and suitable for use in combination with existing behavioral therapies for METH addiction. The aims of this project are to integrate innovative medical breakthroughs in antibody engineering and gene therapy technology, to generate a long-acting antibody-based medicine that will both protect patients from relapse to METH use and minimize treatment failures associated with long-term patient compliance. We will achieve these goals by utilizing adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles to deliver genes encoding high-affinity anti- METH antibody fragments discovered by our research team. We envision that AAV-mediated gene transfer could be used to deliver these purposely designed single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies, which have precise specificity and high affinity for METH. The specific aims include 1) use of molecular engineering techniques to strategically design therapeutic anti-METH scFv medications suitable for packaging the encoding DNA into AAV particles for gene therapy, 2) conduct pharmacokinetic studies of these AAV-scFvs and METH to objectively determine the ability of these AAV-delivered anti-METH antibody fragments to safely and favorably alter METH disposition in rodent models, 3) examine the ability of gene therapy to safely mitigate METH-induced locomotor and cardiovascular effects in rats, 4) determine the efficacy of METH abuse gene therapy in preventing relapse to METH abuse in rat behavioral models. By the end of these studies, we will know if gene therapy can safely deliver sustained doses of antibody medications sufficient to significantly reduce METH pharmacological effects. If successful, these well-integrated approaches could provide a significant medical breakthrough in the treatment options for METH addicted patients."

"9211330","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Network Chair's Office application is one of 3 parallel applications for a five-year extension of funding for the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG). Since its inception in 1997, PEDIG has conducted 4 protocols in strabismus, 19 protocols in amblyopia, 3 protocols in nasolacrimal duct obstruction, 2 protocols in myopia/hyperopia, and several pilot studies. By the time the funding requested in this application would begin, it is expected that 3 new protocols will have started in the current cycle a randomized trial to evaluate treatment for convergence insufficiency, a randomized trial to compare botulinum toxin with incisional surgery for esotropia, and a clinical disease registry to evaluate uveitis incidence in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Despite these accomplishments, many important questions and controversies remain in pediatric eye care and strabismus. PEDIG has developed, or will be developing, clinical trials to address many of these questions. These include: (1) treatment strategies for children with a visual deficit despite maximal amblyopia treatment, (2) the effect of prescribing versus not prescribing spectacles for hyperopia in young children, (3) the best surgical and non-surgical treatments for intermittent exotropia, (4) risk factors for complications after cataract surgery, and (5) the optimal treatment for convergence insufficiency. Specific aims for the next 5-year funding period for PEDIG are to: (1) complete the 7 protocols that are expected to be in progress at the time the funding period begins, (2) initiate 10 new protocols in common pediatric eye disorders where the current management does not have a proven rationale, (3) continue to expand the PEDIG network by soliciting the participation of new sites and investigators and encouraging the involvement of young investigators, (4) continue to educate pediatric ophthalmologists, pediatric optometrists, and clinical research coordinators on the principles of clinical trials and good clinical research practices, (5) train pediatric ophthalmologists and pediatric optometrists to be leaders in clinica trials and clinical research, and (6) develop new methods and outcome measures needed to conduct future amblyopia and strabismus trials."
"9385643","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria control critical cell functions that can impact epilepsy and its comorbidities. Key features of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) such as its progressive nature, rising incidence with aging and bioenergetic demands suggest mitochondrial involvement. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various neurological diseases including experimental models of TLE. However, the precise mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in TLE remain unclear. The proposal builds upon our previous discoveries of impaired mitochondrial redox status and bioenergetics in experimental models of TLE. A central mediator that links mitochondrial oxidative stress with bionenergetic dysfunction is sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase known to maintain metabolic homeostasis. SIRT3 is exquisitely sensitive to aging and serves as a major switch to regulate mitochondrial protein acetylation to control metabolic flux and energy. It is hypothesized that decreased SIRT3 activity and consequent increases in mitochondrial protein acetylation contribute to the impaired bioenergetics in TLE. Using novel mass spectrometry-based quantitative mitochondrial acetylomics, brain-specific SIRT3 conditional knockout mice and restorative therapies, we plan to explore the role of SIRT3 in TLE. Aim 1 will determine if SIRT3 dysfunction occurs following chemoconvulsant-induced epilepsy. Aim 2 will determine if conditional deletion of SIRT3 or its target, Sod2 is sufficient to cause age-related epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction and Aim 3 will determine if restoration of SIRT3 activity by supplementation with NAD+ precursor attenuates deficits observed in chemoconvulsant-induced TLE. Collectively, this project can identify a novel role of SIRT3 as a mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction in chronic seizures and/or cognitive impairment associated with TLE and provide a therapeutic approach for its treatment."
"9254663","Abstract  Plants produce an exceptional diversity and number of natural products, many of which are unique to the plant kingdom. However, the difficulties in sourcing medicinal compounds from native plant hosts in sufficient quantity and diversity present a critical barrier to supplying existing medicines, identifying new drug candidates, and progressing through the path to FDA- approved pharmaceuticals. Noscapine is an established antitussive API currently under evaluation to treat a number of diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Noscapine is only available via extraction from opium poppy and the need to source this compound through a drug crop leads to increased cost and regulation, which could be avoided if an alternative source was developed that was not inherently linked to the production of controlled substances. A novel approach will be developed for sourcing this and related compounds, by engineering noscapine biosynthesis from sugar for the first time in an industrial microbe, Baker's yeast. By utilizing a ?clean? host that is highly amenable to metabolic engineering and industrial-scale production, this approach will establish a constant, secure, and abundant supply of noscapine and related medicinal compounds that is free from contaminating controlled substances and unnecessary regulation.  The objectives of this Phase I project will be to develop engineered yeast strains that produce high levels of natural and non-natural noscapinoids, secoberberines, and other valuable alkaloids, thereby providing microbial platforms for the biosynthesis of diverse plant- based medicinal compounds. To achieve high-level production of the target alkaloids, the rate- limiting activities of five pathway cytochrome P450 enzymes will be optimized. In addition, substrate-feeding experiments that target the incorporation of both early precursor molecules and later-stage scaffolds, will enable the synthesis of numerous novel, non-natural BIA molecules and provide key information on the substrate promiscuity of the enzymes for later combinatorial engineering strategies. Through the development of a disruptive and safe technology for producing an important class of plant alkaloids, the deliverables from this project will open up access to a diverse array of natural plant alkaloid compounds and an even greater number of non-natural derivatives. The successful completion of this SBIR project will provide proof-of-concept for a new commercial manufacturing process for established plant-based medicines and a combinatorial biosynthesis platform for the generation of novel drug molecules."
"9379482","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The academic iobio project delivers web-based applications that visualize and provide real-time interactive analysis with multiple different data  types generated as part of next-generation sequencing projects. These applications are open-source and provided for free. This proposal aims to develop critical computational infrastructure to enable the iobio project to offer commercial applications, providing more power and functionality than is possible for the academic project. In particular, it is necessary to build multiple components that will facilitate management of large computational resources in an on-demand, scalable and robust manner and provide mechanisms for remote file storage. Additionally, functionality to seamlessly combine real-time analysis which is the mainstay of the academic developments with large scale analysis undertaken by commercial applications will empower all users of sequencing data from clinicians / genetic counsellors to large scale sequencing centres and institutions. The long-term objective of the proposal is to position Frameshift labs to rapidly and easily build new commercially viable web-based applications to tackle current bioinformatics analysis problems. This proposal also includes the development of a commercial application called multibam.iobio that will provide producers and consumers of large scale sequencing studies the means to evaluate the quality of their massive data sets. In order to perform population level genome wide association studies (GWAS) or more focused Mendelian studies on small family pedigrees, the quality of the data must be understood prior to expending large amounts of time and resources on analysis. The multibam.iobio application will visualize high-level statistics allowing outlier samples or data trends to be rapidly identified. More focused real-time analysis will be accessible for all samples. The effectiveness of sequencing projects, from focused somatic variant identification in tumor / normal pairs to population scale GWAS demands consistently high data quality, whether this is the underlying sequence alignments or genetic variants. Multibam.iobio will ensure that all interested parties, regardless of computational experience and resource limitations, can interrogate and fully understand their data."
"9240444","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT OAT1 (SLC22A6) is the prototypical kidney organic anion (PAH) transporter. It is responsible for the transport of many drugs (eg. antibiotics, diuretics, antivirals, NSAIDs) and toxins (organic mercurials). We identified the transporter (as NKT); we also first published the Oat1 knockout (Oat1KO) and phenotypes. Our recent data indicates that OAT1 is central to many systemic and proximal tubule metabolic processes. Oat1KO metabolomics data indicates OAT1 may be the key in vivo transporter of uremic toxins accumulating in renal insufficiency and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Altering OAT1 function and/or expression may ameliorate the metabolic changes in states of compromised renal function. We hypothesize that the ?true? physiological role of OAT1 is as a central component of a larger metabolic network involved in normal physiological and pathophysiological processes, and OAT1 exerts a modulatory effect on metabolic diseases (eg. uremic syndrome) via this network. We will define the OAT1-centered network in detail. Specifically: 1) We will construct the OAT1-centered metabolic network through metabolic reconstruction of transcriptomics and metabolomics data from the Oat1KO (using the systems biology techniques described). We should be able to clearly delineate the pathways by which OAT1 regulates normal metabolism by: a) overlaying ligand-based pharmacophore models (in-hand) upon this preliminary reconstructed OAT1-centered network, and b) testing of ?hits? in wet lab transport assays. 2) We will then determine what role the validated OAT1-centered metabolic network (and key pathways within it) plays in the metabolic alterations of renal insufficiency using rodent subtotal nephrectomy models and human CKD metabolomics data. We seek to build a very detailed, fully validated, network of >200 metabolites and reactions that makes predictions that can be evaluated in pathophysiological models and disease states. In response to previous criticisms, we have revised the proposal, particularly with respect to the disease model?and included an expert collaborator from the UCSD O?Brien Center to help with the studies and interpretation. Although the project was considered ambitious, we emphasize the huge amount of preliminary data and ?in house? expertise. The team of investigators has expertise in transport, metabolism, network biology, epidemiology of kidney disease, animal models, and statistical analysis of large data sets. This project will thus produce a validated detailed map of OAT1-centered metabolism in normal physiology and a diseased state, possibly the first of its kind for any multispecific ?drug? transporter (Nigam, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2015). The studies could lead to design of strategies for improving the metabolic abnormalities in CKD by affecting OAT1 function or expression; they will also help predict how OAT1-transported drugs affect metabolism in kidney disease."
"9396206","7. Project Summary/Abstract My research is rooted in a developmental psychopathology framework and focuses on understanding mechanisms that influence the development and persistence of aggression in youth, with the long-term goal of translating this knowledge to develop more effective prevention and intervention efforts. The prevalence of aggression among clinically referred youth and the well-documented associated risks speaks to the urgent need for research to identify child and familial risk mechanisms to better determine who is most vulnerable and how to best intervene with those youth and their families. The current proposal seeks to examine emotional reactivity as a neurobiological vulnerability for the persistence of reactive aggression (RA) during the critical transition to adolescence, a time period marked by substantial changes in the neurobiology underlying emotional development. Additionally, it aims to assess how dynamic parent-child transactions may serve to exacerbate RA over time, as parenting may be particularly potent for at-risk youth during this developmentally sensitive period. This application details a comprehensive training plan that allows me to address these questions and build on my previous experiences in several important ways. First, in light of the heterogeneity among youth engaging in aggressive behaviors, I aim to examine mechanisms underlying a more specific behavioral phenotype of aggression, namely RA, during the transition to adolescence, a time of rapid neurobiological change. Second, I seek to expand my knowledge of neurobiological assessment modalities to psychophysiological assessment of mechanisms underlying RA. Third, I hope to master the processing and analysis of ecological momentary assessments as an innovative tool to comprehensively assess RA and its underlying mechanisms in daily life. Concordant with NIMH strategic priorities 2.1 and 2.2, the current proposal takes a transactional approach and focuses on within-individual differences by utilizing a multi-modal, ecologically informed assessment of RA, emotional reactivity and parenting during the transition to adolescence. Independent and interactive effects of individual variation in emotional reactivity and parenting dimensions on the development and persistence of RA over 18 months will be tested in a clinically at-risk sample of youth. The aims of the study are 1) investigate concurrent and prospective associations between individual variation in emotional reactivity and RA during the transition to adolescence; 2) examine the bi- directional nature of parental response to emotional reactivity and RA over 18 months; 3) assess parental response to emotional reactivity as a moderator of the association between emotional reactivity and RA. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that heightened emotional reactivity as measured multidimensionally confers risk for the persistence of RA into adolescence, with variation in parental response to emotional reactivity and RA serving to exacerbate or ameliorate this association. This knowledge can ultimately be used to further develop prevention and intervention targets for these specific processes."
"9238859","The mitochondrial dynamism/fitness/biogenesis interactome in cardiac disease Dorn GW II Abstract  Cardiomyocyte mitochondria are essential providers of ATP that fuels contraction and normal or reparative cardiomyocyte growth. Observationally, cardiomyocyte utilization of metabolic substrates evolves during cardiac development from a fetal preference for carbohydrates to the normal adult preference for fatty acids. In adult hearts, pathological reversion toward mitochondrial utilization of carbohydrates is postulated to contribute to cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and myocardial infarction. However, our grasp of specific mechanisms that direct cardiac substrate utilization is incomplete, and forced genetic production of cardiomyocyte mitochondria has not proven therapeutic in experimental models of heart disease.  Our conceptual breakthrough was that cardiac metabolism is not determined by a ?master regulator?, but is directed by the interplay between mitochondrial dynamism, fitness and biogenesis. We posit that myocardial metabolic remodeling requires coordinated modulation of mitophagic mitochondrial removal, biogenic mitochondrial replacement and fusion/fission-mediated mitochondrial redistribution. By individually disrupting these pathways and defining the consequences on mitochondrial, cell and organ functioning we determined how these three processes are co-regulated and functionally-interdependent, therein defining a central role for Mfn2 as orchestrator of mitochondrial fate (i.e. retention vs removal). By engineering artificial Mfn2 mutations and studying damaging human Mfn2 mutations identified through DNA sequencing of cardiomyopathy cohorts we are learning how each major process within the interactome is internally fine-tuned through modulation of functionally opposing pairs. Specifically, Mfn-mediated mitochondrial fusion is opposed by Drp1- mediated mitochondrial fission; PGC1-mediated biogenesis of fatty acid-catabolizing mitochondria is opposed by PRC-mediated biogenesis of carbohydrate-catabolizing mitochondria; and mitochondrial replication is opposed by Parkin-mediated mitochondrial elimination. Based on these insights, which represent a convergence of the research aims of HL59888 (mito fusion) and HL128441 (mitophagy), we developed novel genetic and biochemical tools, namely Separation-of-Function mutant Mfn2 proteins and cell-permeant peptides, to specifically manipulate mitochondrial dynamism or mitophagy in vitro and in vivo. We will employ these new concepts and reagents to dissect the molecular mechanisms that drive metabolic remodeling in normal and diseased hearts, and to develop translatable means of optimally matching cardiac metabolism to pathophysiological status by ?dialing- in? mitochondrial quality and quantity via precision manipulations within the interactome."
"9198170","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To preserve the integrity of their genomic DNA, eukaryotic cells utilize a variety of surveillance mechanisms known as checkpoint controls. For example, during cell duplication, cells must make sure that they have replicated their DNA accurately. To cope with the challenges of copying the DNA precisely and rectifying any problems that arise in the process, cells utilize a myriad of regulatory proteins. In vertebrates, the kinase ATR acts as a pivotal regulator in the mechanisms that detect problems with DNA replication and enable cells to address such defects. A key feature of this kinase is that it undergoes precisely regulated activation upon genomic perturbation. Accordingly, this activation involves elaborate control mechanisms. For example, a binding partner known as ATRIP helps to recruit the ATR-ATRIP complex to RPA-coated regions of single-stranded DNA, which are characteristic of numerous detrimental DNA lesions. However, the ATR- ATRIP complex still remains weakly active upon associating with RPA on the DNA. At some point thereafter, ATR-ATRIP interacts with another protein called TopBP1. This binding results in a massive increase in the kinase activity of ATR and represents the culmination of numerous steps that trigger activation of a checkpoint response. Past studies have indicated that the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex plays a role in controlling the interaction of TopBP1 with ATR-ATRIP. However, many aspects of this overall process have remained nebulous. It has also been unclear whether activation of ATR occurs solely through this route in animal cells.  We have recently observed that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex plays a novel role in the activation of ATR in response to aberrant DNA replication. The MRN complex had been best known for its role in another type of checkpoint mechanism, namely, the response to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). In the upcoming grant period, a variety of studies will be carried out to elucidate the mechanism by which MRN collaborates with TopBP1 and other checkpoint control proteins to promote the activation of ATR. A systematic series of experiments will be conducted to explore: (1) how the nuclease activity of MRN affects checkpoint induction at replication forks; (2) how MRN and TopBP1 interact with one another and with replication forks during the checkpoint response; and (3) how these steps ultimately lead to the activation of ATR. Moreover, searches will be undertaken for novel regulators in these pathways. These studies will be performed with both Xenopus egg extracts and human tissue culture cells. This strategy will capitalize upon the complementary advantages of each experimental system. Overall, these studies will exploit new perspectives on checkpoint signaling and hence promise to uncover original insights into the mechanisms that safegaurd genomic integrity. This information would be invaluable for understanding how cells forestall cancer-promoting mutations and other disease-inducing genetic abnormalities."

"9228579","This 5-year R61/R33 phased-innovation award, ?Developing KCNQ Channel Modulators for Mood Disorders,? is designed to efficiently examine the neuronal KCNQ2/3 potassium (K+) channel subtype as a novel treatment target for depression and related conditions. Depressive disorders are among the most disabling medical conditions worldwide and currently available treatments fall short of addressing this large public health burden. Dysfunction within the brain reward system is emerging as a core feature of depressive disorders, in particular giving rise to deficits in motivation, interest, and response to pleasure (e.g., anhedonia). The proposed R61/R33 project capitalizes on a series of preclinical studies from our group that highlight the KCNQ subtype of neuronal potassium (K+) channel as a novel target for the treatment of depressive disorders. In model systems, up-regulation of KCNQ channels normalizes pathological functioning within the brain reward circuit, reversing an anhedonic phenotype. Building on these data, the current project will assess reward circuit activity following treatment with the KCNQ-selective channel opener ezogabine in depressed patients with anhedonia [Aim 1], and will examine the relationship between change in reward circuit activity and clinically relevant symptom and behavior outcomes [Aim 2]. Our project capitalizes on recent advances in conceptualizing and measuring reward-processing alterations across species, and utilizes the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain of Positive Valence Systems (PVS) as a unifying framework. In particular, our animal and human work indicate that enhancing KCNQ channel function within the reward circuit normalizes behavioral processes that map to the PVS constructs of approach motivation (reward expectancy) and initial responsiveness to reward. The project takes advantage of (1) availability of ezogabine (Potiga, GlaxoSmithKline) for human use as a unique first-in-class KCNQ channel opener [FDA-approved for the treatment of seizure disorders], and (2) availability of reliable methods for measuring reward processing at the level of neural, behavioral, and clinical levels in humans. The proposed studies have significant potential to advance treatment discovery for depression within an RDoC framework."
"9380501","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biofilms are associated with hundreds of thousands of infections each year and greatly increase treatment costs and mortality. These adverse effects are caused not only by increased resistance of bacteria living in the biofilm matrix but likely also by adaptive evolution of mutants into different, recalcitrant forms. To study this evolutionary process in biofilms we devised a method enabling long-term selection of populations of the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia that undergo a cycle of attachment, biofilm assembly, and dispersal. Selection repeatedly favored mutations in loci commonly mutated during chronic infections, suggesting that biofilm adaptation recapitulates aspects of evolution during infections. This proposal focuses on two genetic loci that coordinate the sensing of a secreted signal (BDSF) with internal regulation of a switch governing biofilm production (cyclic-di-GMP). Mutations in different protein domains led to different ecological strategies and together different mutants produced a more robust biofilm. The overarching goal of this project is to precisely define the selective advantages of mutants with different strategie of signaling, adhesion, and dispersal in diverse biofilm environments. To tackle this complex problem we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in molecular genetics and evolutionary biology, biochemistry and mass spectrometry, and biophysical structure-function analysis. Our objectives are to 1) quantify how mutants that vary in sensing BDSF and producing cyclic-di-GMP are adaptive in biofilm communities, 2) determine how BDSF mechanistically controls the activity of the primary locus under selection, and the effects of adaptive mutations on this process, and 3) to develop an ecological model of how these processes operate in mixed-mutant and mixed-species communities. We expect to learn how this system may be manipulated to induce dispersal from biofilms and increase their susceptibility, which could be broadly relevant for developing novel antimicrobials."
"9242912","PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting a career development award to support my research proposal titled ?Investigating a Novel Co-regulation of Multi-Drug Efflux Pumps and Polysaccharide Capsule in E. coli.? I will be undertaking this work under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Seed at Duke University. The aims of this proposal arose out of my interest in identifying virulence specific factors that can be used as targets for new classes of antimicrobials against Gram negative organisms. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is one of the most common Gram negative and a major cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). However, rapidly rising antibiotic resistance threatens the effectiveness of all commonly used antibiotics. In addition the global rise of the multi- drug resistant (MDR) UPEC clonal subtype ST131 has been termed an urgent threat to public health by the Centers for Disease Control. Together this underscores the critical need to identify new antimicrobial strategies. Since most cases of community acquired UTI occur in patients with an intact immune system an alternative approach to treating such infections would be to render the bacteria susceptible to natural immune clearance. We have identified a highly potent small molecule inhibitor of E. coli capsule biogenesis that targets a transcriptional regulator of an MDR efflux pump. This proposal centers on the hypothesis that this capsule inhibitor uniquely binds to the efflux pump transcriptional regulator to control E. coli polysaccharide capsule expression through a novel co-regulatory pathway that results in decreased virulence and increased susceptibility to the host immune system. This study will test the hypothesis by investigating the binding of capsule inhibitor to the transcriptional regulator, by identifying the components of the co-regulatory pathway and by determining the role of the transcriptional regulator in establishment and persistence of UTI. Dr. Seed will be providing mentorship and expertise in the field of molecular microbial pathogenesis, microbial genomics and the murine model of UTI. I have worked with Dr. Seed since 2011 as a pediatric infectious disease fellow and will continue to do so as junior faculty. Duke University is a world-class research institute with numerous support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my transition to being an independent investigator. My long term career goal is to be independently funded leading my own lab focused on using molecular approaches to identify mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance and to use this knowledge to identify novel targets for pathogen/disease-specific anti-infectives. This award will enable me to build upon the research foundation I have developed thus far and be exceptionally well poised to transition to independence."
"9397326","Project Summary/Abstract Learning requires the extraction of salient information from a continuously changing environment in order for an animal to generate appropriate cognitive and behavioral adaptations. Inducible transcription factors (ITFs) are a class of immediate early genes that support learning and memory by converting transient molecular signals into long-lasting changes in cellular function. For many ITFs, a mechanistic understanding of how they alter cellular physiology remains poorly defined. A recent and notable exception is the transcription factor Npas4. Npas4 is undetectable in quiescent neurons, but is highly expressed in response to elevated excitatory activity and the associated calcium influx. Once expressed, Npas4 triggers a gene expression program that ultimately recruits inhibitory synapses to the soma and destabilizes those that form in the dendrites. Consequently, Npas4 recalibrates the balance between excitation and inhibition (E-I) within specific domains of the pyramidal neuron, simultaneously gating action potential output while also creating a dendritic environment that is more permissive for plasticity. In spite of this progress, it is not known if Npas4 regulates inhibitory synapses specifically within the domain from which the excitatory signals originate or if Npas4 regulates distinct sets of genes in response to different types of excitatory activity. This proposal uses electrophysiology, two-photon glutamate uncaging, immunocytochemistry, and genomic techniques to explore the molecular mechanisms that control Npas4 expression and gene regulation. We show that Npas4 is locally translated in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the mouse hippocampus. We will define the nature of the excitatory activity that induces dendritic Npas4 and explore signaling pathways that transduce synaptic activity to Npas4 translation. The results of this work will reveal fundamental neurobiology that underlies E-I regulation and may inspire novel treatment strategies for disorders that stem from dysregulation of E-I balance."
"9396429","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most evidence-based interventions in traditional mental health care require that patients participate in activities outside of the treatment setting  (e.g., at home or in other relevant settings). These homework (HW) assignments increase generalization of skills learned in the treatment setting and play a crucial role in positive outcomes (i.e., decreased symptom severity, increased recovery and treatment retention) and ultimately the quality of child mental health services. Despite being an integral component of treatment, systematic use of and adherence to HW assignments generally is low to moderate, and thus results in poorer clinical outcomes and increased dropout. Solutions that effectively improve HW utilization and adherence may have potential to improve the efficiency of treatment, completion of treatment, and benefit from treatment. The candidate has proposed a wide range of training opportunities to prepare him to lead multi-disciplinary, innovative research that identifies, evaluates, and disseminates technology-based solutions designed to improve quality of care in child mental health treatment. His proposed pilot under this F32 will make use of qualitative interviewing methodology to take initial steps toward addressing provider- and patient-level barriers to HW use/adherence via mobile technology. The treatment model chosen for this project will ensure strong translatability of this work to a wide range of behavioral healh treatments. Data collected during this project will be used to develop and preliminarily evaluate a functional mockup of a mobile application. The functional mockup will not itself be a mobile application but will allow the candidate to create a resource that has the full look and feel of a mobile application to solicit feedback from providers and families without the expense associated with development of a fully programmed web intervention or native application. Data obtained via this pilot work will guide the development of a mobile/web-based application that the candidate intends to develop and test in a subsequent exploratory study (e.g., NIH R21/R34). The proposed investigation and training program will leverage ongoing research and dissemination initiatives allowing for an ideal training environment for the candidate. The proposed F32 award will allow the candidate to continue ongoing programmatic research focusing on the integration of technology into evidence-based practice. It will also support training of the candidate toward his career goals of becoming an independent clinical researcher in this area."
"9246115","Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer is one of the most common acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related malignancies. Cervical cancer is the second deadliest cancer in women around the world, and has currently become a major threat to Chinese women's health, especially in rural China and HIV epidemic areas. High-risk types of HPV are the causative agents of cervical cancer and WHO has recommended HPV testing for cervical cancer screening in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as China. However, PCR-based HPV detection requires expensive PCR instruments and is unaffordable for widespread use in LMICs. Recently emerging careHPVTM test, based on nucleic acid hybridization detection, has offered comparatively simpler, less expensive and more portable HPV testing, but still has many shortcomings for point-of-care (POC) diagnostic applications, including: i) relatively long detection time (~3 h), ii) use by well-trained technicians, and iii) reliance on relatively expensive instruments. In collaboration with investigators at the Cancer Institute/Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CICAMS), we propose to develop, test, and validate a low-cost, minimally-instrumented POC diagnostic system for rapid detection of 14 individual high-risk HPV genotypes and HIV virus among women in HIV epidemic areas in China. Our POC diagnostic system is unique in: i) adapting a new isothermal amplification strategy for multiplex molecular diagnostics (i.e., HPV, HIV virus), ii) utilizing chemical exothermal reactions to produce the heating for isothermal amplification and freeing its operation from electrical power, and iii) leveraging ubiquitous mobile phone technology to record, analyze and report the results without the need for specialized optical detectors. We propose the following specific aims: i) development and optimization of POC diagnostic system, ii) evaluation and validation of its feasibility for clinical application, and iii) field validations and acceptability evaluation of POC system in HIV epidemic areas of China such as Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan Province. This is a complementary collaboration research between the U.S. PI with the experience on point-of-care diagnostic technology, and the Chinese PI with expertise on cervical cancer screening and field- testing. If successful, this project will readily translate into a new point-of-care tool for cervical cancer screening, which will be of tremendous value in resource poor settings (i.e., rural China) benefiting numerous women."
"9309527","Contribution of LiaFSR to pathogenesis and carriage of group A Streptococcus PROJECT SUMMARY Asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens is a common but poorly understood phenomenon. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the cause of severe infections such as the ?flesh-eating? necrotizing fasciitis and more benign infections like pharyngitis. However, GAS is also carried in the throats of humans in the absence of symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic carriage). We understand little of the bacterial molecular genetic determinants contributing to GAS carriage. We hypothesize that mutations in GAS carrier strains contribute to a unique phenotype characterized by increased ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces and decreased ability to cause disease. We identified a mutation, unique to a GAS carrier strain, leading to a single amino acid change in a highly conserved sensor kinase, LiaS, of the poorly described GAS regulatory three component system (3CS) LiaFSR. We previously showed complete recapitulation of the carrier phenotype (increased adherence to mucosal surfaces and decreased virulence) when the carrier mutation in liaS was introduced into a serotype- matched disease-causing strain of GAS. We also discovered that the carrier mutation altered global gene regulation. The LiaFSR 3CS has been described in other bacteria but its contribution to virulence gene regulation in pathogenic bacteria is largely unknown. Further, the mechanism by which the carrier amino acid change in LiaS leads to gene dysregulation and the carrier phenotype is incomplete. We hypothesize that the carrier mutation alters function of the sensor kinase, LiaS, resulting in decreased activation of the target response regulator, LiaR, affecting gene regulation and leading to the carrier phenotype. By defining the mechanism by which the carrier mutation alters gene regulation and leads to a carrier phenotype, we may better understand the gene regulatory events associated with the transition from disease to carriage in GAS. We have proposed three aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define in vitro and ex vivo-human conditions that activate the LiaFSR system. Aim 2 will determine global gene regulation by LiaFSR in GAS and define the genes affected by the carrier LiaS mutation. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the effect of the carrier mutation on the function of LiaS and subsequent response regulator activation. Upon completion of these aims, we will have defined the mechanism by which the carrier mutation leads to gene dysregulation and the carrier phenotype and simultaneously learned more about gene regulation in GAS pathogenesis. Ultimately, these studies will provide a foundation for future carriage research and potentially have implications in diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development for GAS and other bacterial pathogens."
"9199113","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this research program is to develop and apply state-of-the-art computation methods to understand stereoselectivity, chemoselectivity, and reactivity at the molecular level with the aim of designing new, more effective reagents, catalysts, and biological ligands. The control of selectivity and reactivity ar essential features of efficient synthesis, yet our molecular level understanding of how fundamental interactions perturb these aspects is only rudimentary. Further, many aspects of how these same fundamental interactions govern binding in a biological context are incompletely understood. This program seeks to quantitate these fundamental interactions to explain observed results and to build on this foundation. In addition to developing improved computational and analytical tools, a primer will be constructed tabulating the prevalence and strength of these widespread, fundamental interactions.  We have identified three overall goals. In the first, transition state calculations will be used to probe mechanism, understand control elements, and quantitate fundamental interactions. In the second, empirical modeling tools will be developed and used to identify the key control factors governing reactivity and selectivity. This knowledge, in turn, focuses the studies in aim 1 to the most important elements. In the third, a new experimental measure of hydrogen-bonding is outlined, which is an important component of the interaction primer that is being built and also addresses timely questions in the selectivity and strength of biological binding. Relevance:  The fundamental hallmark of this proposal is the ability to design new reactions and catalysts via computation to construct important organic structures in an efficient and rational manner. New synthetic methods greatly increase access to untapped chemical space, leading to materials and pharmaceuticals that benefit society. To achieve this goal, investigations will focus on obtaining an improved understanding of the fundamental interactions governing reactivity and selectivity. These same interactions govern biological systems, and further understanding will enable the design of enzymatic inhibitors and agents targeting other biomolecules to disrupt biological functions. Invaluable training will be afforded to undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers involved in this proposal."
"9406431","The human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein is needed for viral replication. Infection with ?high risk? HPV types can progress to pre-malignant lesions called dysplasias, which over a period of years, can eventuate in invasive and metastatic epithelial malignancies. HPV E6 proteins bind to the ubiquitin ligase E6AP and this complex targets p53 and other E6 binding proteins for proteasome mediated destruction. This E6-dependent loss of p53 enables HPV to bypass host cell defenses and facilitates activation of the cell cycle.  E6AP and other E6 interacting proteins utilize a charged leucine ?-helical LxxLL peptide motif to bind to E6. Using molecular modeling based on the structure of this E6AP motif, we previously identified a series of novel flavone like molecules that inhibit HPV-16 E6 binding to E6AP. Exposure of cervical cancer cells to these compounds led to increases inp53 and p21Cip1/Waf1 proteins and decreased proliferation of HPV expressing cell lines. We used computational modeling to predict where these compounds bind onto the recently described high-resolution three-dimensional co-crystal structure of HPV-16 E6 with an LxxLL peptide. The highest scoring fits placed the flavone inhibitors in a hydrophobic pocket that forms molecular bonds with leucines in the E6AP binding pocket and a series of flanking arginines of E6. These data support our structure-based screening and compound selection based on inhibition of E6 association with E6AP. Importantly, LxxLL peptide binding induces an allosteric change in the E6 protein needed for entry of p53 into the complex. Our inhibitors may interfere with this conformational change in E6 and/or its protein-protein interaction with p53.  Flavonoid small molecules inhibit HPV E6 but have poor aqueous solubility and unfavorable drug metabolism properties and thus are suboptimal as therapeutics. Additionally, development of small molecule HPV E6 inhibitor therapeutics will require a proprietary compound class. We took advantage of the flavone- based structure-activity relationships and modified the core structure to establish a novel and highly druggable chemical series. Pilot studies prove we can alter the scaffold and retain E6 inhibitory activity. While less potent than the flavones, this SBIR grant will allow us to rapidly increase potency using established assays of competitive inhibition of E6AP binding, E6 thermo-stabilization, and p53 degradation in vitro and in cells. A focused series of mutated E6 proteins that disrupt the hydrophobic and charged surfaces of the E6 binding pocket let us explore the binding interface between E6 and inhibitory compounds. We have observed some point mutations disrupt the E6-E6AP interaction but do not alter compound binding to E6 and, conversely, some mutants retain E6AP binding but restrict compound association. These data substantiate our positioning of compounds on the E6 structure and instruct design of more specific and potent HPV E6 inhibitors.  We have shown we can select and synthesize inhibitors of the E6-E6AP interaction and thus potentially, a novel treatment for the millions afflicted with pre-malignant and malignant HPV associated cancers."

"9317010","Abstract  The Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system (T3SS) functions like a molecular syringe to inject toxins into host cells. The primary cellular targets are phagocytes and epithelial cells. The injected toxins promote phagocytic avoidance and tissue destruction resulting in systemic spread of the bacteria and overwhelming sepsis. Deployment of the T3SS is highly regulated and only activated when bacteria contact host cell surfaces. The overriding hypothesis guiding the studies is that increased understanding of mechanisms that regulate T3SS gene expression will lead to the identification of critical steps that can be targeted by anti-virulence therapeutics, the long term goal of the proposed work. The primary protein required for contact- dependent activation of the T3SS is a transcription factor called ExsA. Preliminary data demonstrate that exsA transcription, ExsA synthesis, and ExsA activity are each subject to control by global regulatory systems. The goals of this proposal are to define novel mechanisms that control exsA transcription, and possibly ExsA synthesis or activity. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the 297 bp intergenic region located between exsB and exsA functions in two capacities. First, the intergenic region contains a Vfr-dependent promoter dedicated to exsA transcription. Vfr is cAMP-dependent transcription factor previously known to regulate T3SS gene expression but the mechanism has not been defined. Second, expression of the intergenic region in trans has a stimulatory effect on T3SS gene expression. Preliminary data suggest that two small peptides encoded within the intergenic region modulate T3SS gene expression. The three aims will characterize the stimulatory activity of the intergeneic region and factors that regulate intergenic promoter activity as follows:  Aim 1. Characterize the trans-acting functions of ExsF and ExsG.  Aim 2. Characterize IR promoter activity.  Aim 3. Determine whether Vfr, MvaT/MvaU, and VqsM function together, antagonistically, or  independently to modulate IR promoter activity."
"9317853","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic, chronic, progressive, relapsing, and immunologically mediated condition. In spite of remarkable advances in our understanding of the clinical manifestation, epidemiology and risk factors, challenges remain in identifying the pathogenesis of IBD. Advances over the past four decades have led to the understanding that IBD is a complex and multifactorial disease that might emerge from interaction and integration of multiple components, including genetic susceptibility, microbiota imbalance, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and aberrant immune response. Epidemiological studies found that early-life infection is a risk factor for the development of pediatric and adult IBD, and gastrointestinal infection in adolescents and adults is a trigger for the onset or exacerbation of IBD. However, it is not clear whether and how these two events cause an aggravated and prolonged intestinal barrier dysfunction, which is the hallmark of IBD. Neonatal life is a uniquely vulnerable period during which neonates are susceptible to environmental challenges. Some of those challenges can induce durable epigenetic changes, predisposing the host to complex diseases that occur many decades after those initial events. We and others have shown that severe neonatal inflammation (NI) permanently alters gene expression in the colon and stomach, leading to motility dysfunction and functional dyspepsia-like symptoms, in a rat model of NI induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), which provides a valuable preclinical model for research on disease susceptibility. Our preliminary findings suggest that NI causes stable reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut, resulting in heightened colonic epithelial permeability when subjected to a second inflammatory insult in adult life. Our central hypothesis is that neonatal colonic inflammation renders the host susceptible to intestinal barrier dysfunction by inducing functional microbiota imbalances that epigenetically target MMP9E-cadherin interactions. The hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Aim 1, by using a newly-established two-hit rat model, we seek to demonstrate that NI alters composition of gut microbiome, production of short chain fatty acid, and expression of MMP9 and E- cadherin. Together, these changes induce susceptibility to IBD-like aggravated intestinal barrier dysfunction and abnormal immune response, which should be mitigated by butyrate supplementation. We will also validate the neonatal injury findings in IL10 deficient mice, an established IBD model. In Aim 2, by using human enteroids we will test the hypothesis that NI induces demethylation of DNA and histones at the MMP9 promoter, making it more susceptible to histone hyperacetylation and activation, when exposed to proinflammatory stimuli. Our results should help establish a novel paradigm that NI induces long-lasting epigenetic modifications to increase susceptibility to IBD. Our mechanistic findings on NI-induced epigenetic modifications, MMP9 activation, and E- cadherin cleavage should also provide new insights important for the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies for IBD."

"9249210","This proposal will structurally characterize the conformational transitions of five homologous FKBP domains by a combination of NMR relaxation, NOE analysis, quantitative amide hydrogen exchange analysis, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. As these five FKBP proteins participate in regulating distinctly different sets of signaling pathways, development of pharmacological selectivity among these proteins is of significant interest. However, the marked similarity among their crystal structures has appreciably impeded this process. We have observed a substantial degree of diversity in the conformational dynamics of these five domains. We are identifying mutations which modulate these transitions that can then assist both in structurally characterizing these transitions and in the stepwise optimization of drug leads. This systematic mutational modulation of the intrinsic conformational transitions of the FKBP domains will facilitate the analysis of the potential role of these transitions in coupling to the larger scale signaling processes of the biological complexes in which these proteins function as will be examined regarding their roles in regulating cardiac Ca2+ and Na+ membrane channels and in the transcription factor complexes of the glucocorticoid and PPAR? receptors.  Specific Aim 1: The structure of transient conformations sampled by the FKBP domains of FKBP51, FKBP52 and FKBP38 and the interactions between these transitions will be characterized by a combination of NMR, crystallographic and molecular simulation studies. Variants of FKBP51/52, designed to modulate these transitions, will be used to test a structural model for regulatory selectivity in steroid receptor interactions. Similar structural studies will be applied to both human FKBP38 isoforms. Models of transient conformations and known catalytic site-binding molecular scaffolds will be used for in silico ligand design.  Specific Aim 2: This set of experimental and modeling approaches will be applied to FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 to understand the structural basis of the energetic coupling between two distantly separated conformational transitions centered on either side of the catalytic cleft. Structural insight into the comparative inefficiency of this long range coupling in FKBP12.6 will be obtained.  Specific Aim 3: Murine embryonic fibroblast knockout cell lines will be transfected with genes for the FKBP51/FKBP52 variants. Glucocorticoid and PPAR? receptors will be tested for competitive FKBP binding, cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization, transcription activity, and p38 kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Cardiomyocyte Ca2+ spark frequency and voltage-gated sodium current will be measured in FKBP12.6-KO and FKBP12cKO mouse cells, respectively, with FKBP12/12.6 variant proteins being introduced by dialysis."
"9379422","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma the fastest growing cancer incidence in the world today and the American Cancer Society reports that death rates for melanoma continue to rise. Alarmingly, melanoma is the most common cancer in young adults under 30. One characteristic of metastatic melanoma cells that is recognized as a potential target for new therapies is upregulation of cell-surface receptor melanocortin subtype I (MCR1). However, there are no agents currently available that exploit this identifiable difference between melanoma and normal cells. This proposal is focused on development, validation and commercialization of an automated system for the preparation of [203/212Pb]-labeled peptides that bind with high affinity and specificity to MCR1 for targeted imaging and therapy of metastatic melanoma. Our innovative approach enlists matched-pair isotopes 203Pb/212Pb to enable quantitative dosimetry based on 203Pb-SPECT imaging for 212Pb-alpha-particle therapy. Viewpoint Molecular Targeting, LLC has developed a strong-strategic business-partnerships that are driving our commercialization of diagnostic/therapeutic agents [203Pb]DOTA-VMT-MCR1/[212Pb]DOTA-VMT-MCR1. Matched pair isotopes 203Pb/212Pb is also attractive due to a relatively long half-life (51 h) of 203Pb, which is favorable for centralied manufacturing of radiotracers for their direct shipment to imaging facilities.  Our overall objectie is to develop effective image-guided therapy for metastatic melanoma that will improve outcomes for melanoma patients with fewer-milder side effects than current therapies. To achieve these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Determine the feasibility of an automated cassette- based fluid handling system for clinical manufacturing of 203/212Pb labeled chelator-modified VMT-MCR1; and 2. Determine the feasibility of [203/212Pb]TCMC-VMT-MCR1 and [203/212Pb]C2N2-VMT-MCR1 for molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy for metastatic melanoma.  With success in our Aims, we expect to determine the feasibility of an automated system to produce high specific activity 203/212Pb VMT-MCR1 under Aim 1. We further expect to have determined the feasibility of three VMT-MCR1 compositions to advance to clinical imaging trials via an eIND under Aim 2. We expect these successes to have the positive impact of advancing VMT-MCR1 through initial commercial risk-mitigating milestones to a first in humans imaging trial with 203Pb VMT-MCR1. We expect this to lead to 212Pb VMT-MCR1 therapy, which has the potential to circumvent drug resistance that limits the effectiveness of current treatments for metastatic melanoma."
"9257871","Project Summary Cancer cachexia is a devastating syndrome resulting from the wasting of peripheral tissues as a result of pathophysiological interactions between tumors and distant tissues. Although ~80% of cancer patients suffer from cachexia and has been implicated in ~25% of death in cancer patients, there is no approved therapeutics to combat this deadly disease. Part of the reasons for limited progress in cancer cachexia is because we know little about the underlying molecular mechanisms on how tumor induces cachexia through long- range interactions. During my postdoctoral studies, I propose a number of studies that will provide mechanistic insights into how ImpL2 and other tumor-secreted factors are regulated to modulate organ wasting. In Aim1, I will dissect which tumorigenic pathways regulate ImpL2. In Aim 2, I will utilize targeted DamID technique to identify other tumor-derived factors that affect distant tissue homeostasis relevant for organ wasting. Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore whether other conditions that induce organ wasting interact with ImpL2-dependent signaling. Together, these studies will identify regulatory networks orchestrating organ wasting in pathological conditions and also provide novel insights into potential therapeutic targets for organ wasting."
"9241302","The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), a CWOW proposal in response to RFA-NS-16-012, is designed to facilitate the development of antiepileptogenic therapies by removing barriers and promoting large-scale collaborative research efforts by multidisciplinary teams of basic and clinical neuroscientists with access to extensive patient populations, well-defined and rigidly standardized animal models, and cutting-edge analytic methodology. We focus our proposal on antiepileptogenesis in post- traumatic epilepsy (PTE) following traumatic brain injury (TBI), as this condition offers the best opportunity to determine the time of onset of the epileptogenic process in patients. The EpiBioS4Rx Scientific Premise is: Epileptogenesis after TBI can be prevented with specific treatments; the identification of relevant biomarkers and performance of rigorous preclinical trials will permit the future design and performance of economically feasible full-scale clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies. Based on the work from a P20 planning grant, our program will consist of the following: (1) identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis in our animal model and in patients, (2) Develop and utilize a standardized platform for preclinical trials of potential antiepileptogenic (AEG) drugs, (3) Identify 1 or more lead antiepileptogenic drugs for a future interventional clinical trial, (4) Establish a network of advanced TBI centers capable of carrying out future clinical trials featuring our lead antiepileptogenic drugs used in the context of a personalized, medicine-based approach utilizing our panel of biomarkers, and (5) Develop and incorporate a public engagement program involving the mutual education and collaboration of consumers, consumer organizations and professionals to design and execute future large-scale interventional clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies."
"9197983","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury to the spinal cord results in paralysis below the level of the injury, and there are no current therapies that are able to restore function. Limited regeneration occurs as result of the local environment, which is deficient in stimulatory factors and has an excess of inhibitory factors. Our long-term goal is to develop multi- functional biomaterials that bridge the injury site to control the microenvironment to promote and direct axonal growth into and through, and to re-enter the host tissue to form functional connections with intact circuitry. In the previous funding periods, we have developed multiple channel bridges that mechanically stabilize the injury that limits secondary damage, and using a transgenic mouse model with a GFP reporter construct expressed predominantly in the corticospinal tract (CST), we demonstrated that large numbers of CST axons grow through the bridge, re-enter the host tissue, and extend up to 3 mm down the cord by 10 weeks post- implantation. Additionally, we have an unparalleled ability to localize delivery of gene therapy vectors, with which expression of neurotrophic factors significantly enhanced the number of regenerating axons. This proposal builds on these results and focuses on enhancing the number of neural progenitors (either through recruitment or transplantation) and promoting their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes that can myelinate axons and functionally reconnect a significant number of regenerating axons with the intact circuitry below the injury. Our development of bridges is targeted toward the 14% of spinal cord injuries that result from penetrating wounds that create a gap in the spinal cord, and may necessitate a different approach to restoring function than contusion/compression injuries. We propose that providing a bridge soon after a penetrating injury in order to stabilize the spinal cord and attenuate the host response. The bridges could be an off-the- shelf product that is readily available for implantation, and the bridge is initially designed to target survival, migration, and differentiatin of the endogenous progenitor cell population. Alternatively, we investigate delivery of neural stem cells rostral and caudal to the bridge a week or more after the bridge is implanted. While a bridge can be delivered soon after injury, stem cell transplants immediately after injury are contraindicated, as the cells are allogeneic and would require immunosuppression. The survival, recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of endogenous or exogenous progenitor cells will be targeted through the immune response at the scaffold (Aim 1). We propose to use the bridges to modulate the macrophage phenotype towards M2 in order to promote secretion of pro-regenerative factors following injury. Alternatively, we propose to delivery trophic factors tht target the function of progenitor cells by complementary pathways. The bridge platform can support multiple aspects of the regenerative process, and the well-defined components, which have been used in the clinic, may facilitate the ultimate translation to the clinic."
"9299086","Rotaviruses, a genetically diverse and rapidly evolving group of segmented double-stranded RNA viruses, are a major cause of severe life-threatening gastroenteritis in infants and young. Progress towards understanding rotavirus biology and pathogenesis, and the potential development of more effective next generation rotavirus vaccines, is hampered by the lack of a fully recombinant reverse genetics (RG) system for the virus. Without this fundamental tool, many studies are not possible including those intended to understand the role of viral proteins in virulence and spread in the infected animal, identify and characterize gene-specific packaging (assortment) signals in viral RNAs, and analyze virus replication and assembly by live-cell imaging of infected cells expressing fluorescently-tagged viral proteins. The consequence for vaccine development and evaluation is perhaps even more profound, as an RG system is critical for generating live-virus vaccine candidates through directed attenuation of viral virulence determinants, for modifying antigenic epitopes in older vaccine virus strains to better match those of contemporary viruses, and for generating vaccine candidates through directed reassortment of the genomes of human and animal virus strains. Moreover, an effective RG system is essential for pursing attempts to develop rotaviruses as plug-and-play expression vectors of antigens of other enteric/mucosal pathogens (e.g., norovirus). In previous work, we established a highly efficient single gene RG system for rotavirus and showed that foreign sequences can be inserted into, and stably maintained by, the rotavirus genome. Investigators working on other viruses that, like rotaviruses, belong to the Reoviridae family, have developed fully recombinant RG systems using T7 transcription vectors to drive the expression of complete genome sets of viral +RNAs in cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Through the introduction of 2A stop-start translational elements, these RG systems have been used to generate autonomously replicating recombinant Reoviridae that express foreign antigens and fluorescent proteins. In this R03 grant application, we propose to (i) establish a fully recombinant plasmid based RG system for rotavirus using T7 expression vectors and (ii) develop recombinant rotaviruses as plug-and-play expression vectors using 2A elements to drive synthesis of foreign proteins. Achievement of these aims will revolutionize the nature of studies that can be pursued for a virus that kills >200,000 children each year."
"9398424","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether the height of the incision made during trichiasis surgery affects surgical outcomes as measured within 12 months after surgery. The trial will be conducted in southern Ethiopia, where trachomatous trichiasis is endemic. Approximately 2,400 adult subjects will be enrolled. They will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to surgery with an incision height of 3 mm or 5 mm. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks after surgery and participants will be examined again at 6 weeks and 12 months after surgery. The primary outcome is presence of post-operative trichiasis, defined as one or more lashes touching the eye or confirmed evidence of epilation. The secondary outcome is presence of a moderate or severe eyelid contour abnormality. Nearly 8 million individuals are in need of trichiasis surgery. If this trial is successful in reducing th rate of post-operative trichiasis by 25%, an estimated 300,000 individuals will be spared from post-operative trichiasis, which will allow reallocation of resources from repeat surgery to provide services to hundreds of thousands of individuals needing initial trichiasis surgery."
"9193606","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  This project will add a time diary supplement for older participants in the longest running national panel study in the US, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). When used in combination with PSID's long-term ; measures of health, economic wellbeing and rich familial context, the proposed diary collection will allow unparalleled exploration of mechanisms that promote subjective wellbeing in later life. The overarching goals of this project are: 1) to create a free, publicly available national resource of diary-based measures of time use and wellbeing for older adults in the 2013 PSID; and 2) to undertake new analyses that will refocus the literature on disability and related care on the mechanisms through which participation and wellbeing are maintained in later life. Time diaries will be collected by telephone from approximately 2,100 to 2,400 individuals who are either age 60 or older or the spouse/partner of someone that age, for one random weekday and one random weekend day. Supplemental questions will focus on disability, evaluative wellbeing, and new items will address quality of relationships, as well as psychological factors such as personality. After the data are publicly released, the project team will undertake the first national portrait of ? later-life disability, time use, and affect during the 24-hour day. We will also investigate the role of economic, social, and psychological factors in buffering the effects of disability on time use and experienced wellbeing and the circumstances under which giving time to others yields well being. These analyses are made possible by PSID's rich panel measures of health, recent and longer-term economic wellbeing, and familial context. Public availability of such data will allow investigators to more fully understand the consequences of loss of functioning in later life for subjective wellbeing. Such atopic is of substantial scientific and public health import, given the aging of the population, the high prevalence of disability in later life, and projected increases in the number of older adults with limitations."
"9233280","SUMMARY Nicotine is a major component of nicotine delivery systems [Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)] i.e. electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Nicotine is known to have the addictive properties, and a knowledge gap exists on how inhaled nicotine affects the pulmonary system. Our supporting data show that ENDS nicotine aerosol delivery and exposure cause oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in human lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and in mouse lungs. Currently, no information is available on the biological effects of e-cig containing inhaled nicotine in humans and in mouse models. Inhaled nicotine may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases in particular via lung inflammation, injurious, and dysregulated repair responses. We hypothesize that e-cig nicotine influences toxicity as evidenced by oxidative and inflammatory responses in humans and in mouse models, leading to dysregulated repair and emphysematous responses. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1: Inhaled nicotine induces lung and systemic inflammatory mediators in human subjects Determine the impact of inhaled nicotine in users and non-users of e-cigarettes. This will be accomplished by monitoring biomarkers of exposure (inflammatory, exosomes and lipid mediators by lipidomics) in human biofluids (saliva, Exhaled Breath Condensate, plasma, and urine) along with clinical outcomes (lung function tests) in a prospective cohort study (baseline and follow-up). Along with human studies, we plan to conduct mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro. Aim 2: Inhaled nicotine induces lung inflammatory and dysregulated repair responses via its receptor Here, we will use a mouse preclinical model for mechanistic studies. We will determine if e-cigarettes containing low and high nicotine concentrations have differential pro-inflammatory and abnormal repair effects in vivo via the ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (?7nAChR) dependent mechanism. Aim 3: Mechanisms whereby nicotine aerosol induces inflammatory and dysregulated cellular repair responses Determine inflammatory and dysregulated cellular repair responses to e-cigarette nicotine vapor in human lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts using the state-of-the-art reporter models (NF-?B luciferase) as well as a 3-D cell culture model. This will determine how nicotine affects cellular processes, such as early cellular senescence and myofibroblast differentiation, as well as lipogenic and myogenic pathways in healing/repair process.  The outcomes of this study will provide an understanding of the clinical impact and mechanisms of inflammatory, senescence, and dysregulated repair responses following nicotine exposure in human subjects and, in primary lung cells in vitro and mouse model in vivo."
"9296274","ABSTRACT The vertebrate antiviral innate immune system is often considered to be composed of two distinct groups of proteins: pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect viral infection and activate the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, and effectors that directly act against viral replication. Accordingly, previous studies on PRRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5, have been primarily focused on their functions in viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) detection and downstream signaling. Limited effort has been made in characterizing and dissecting their potential roles outside these canonical PRR functions. We have recently discovered that RIG-I and MDA5 utilize their helicase domains and ATP hydrolysis-driven receptor dynamics to displace viral proteins from dsRNA, and can perform signaling-independent antiviral functions against a broad spectrum of RNA viruses. This notion of the non-canonical, effector-like functions of RIG-I/MDA5 was also supported by publications from other laboratories (Weber, Takaoka and tenOever), although the deeper molecular mechanisms remain to be dissected. These findings challenge the conventional views that PRRs passively bind pre-exposed ligands and that their antiviral activities are solely dependent on their ability to induce immune signaling. In this proposal, we examine molecular mechanisms by which the protein displacement activity of RIG-I and MDA5 can exert signaling-independent antiviral functions. In particular, we examine the following two non- exclusive hypotheses using a combination of biochemical and cellular assays. In Aims 1-2, we test the hypothesis that displacement of viral dsRNA-binding proteins by RIG-I and MDA5 could lead to increase in overall accessibility of viral dsRNA, thereby promoting functions of other dsRNA-dependent antiviral proteins in the host, such as PKR, OAS1 and ADAR1. In Aim 3, we explore the hypothesis that the protein displacement activity of RIG-I/MDA5 could be exerted on the viral replication or transcription complexes or capsid proteins, which may lead to direct inhibition of core viral life cycle steps. While this proposal explores the new function of RIG-I/MDA5, our previous work on these receptors, both their canonical and non-canonical functions, provide a solid foundation for the proposed research. In addition, our expertise on biochemical and cellular analysis of protein-RNA complexes will further help us achieve the goals outlined in this proposal. We believe that this investigation would not only re-define the functions of RIG-I and MDA5 as a novel class of receptors with ?effector-like? functions, but would also bring unique perspectives on functions of related proteins in antiviral defense."
"9316901","PROJECT SUMMARY  Elucidating the molecular basis of neurological and psychiatric disease is of critical importance for the design of improved therapies. One signaling pathway that has been identified as a hub of dysregulation in several brain disorders is the mTOR pathway. A large body of work has established that altered mTOR signaling affects key aspects of neuronal structure and function including cell morphology, connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and excitability. However, very little is known about the molecules downstream of mTOR responsible for regulating these processes. This information is essential as the effectors of mTOR signaling represent potential drug targets that could provide improved specificity compared with systemic mTOR blockade; a current treatment strategy that is associated with problematic side-effects.  A central cellular process regulated by mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is protein synthesis. Therefore, identifying the translational targets of mTORC1 is a key first step towards understanding how this pathway controls neuronal function in both normal and disease states. Here we will generate a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of mTORC1's influence on protein synthesis in distinct disease-relevant cell types in the mouse brain. To do this we will genetically and pharmacologically manipulate mTORC1 signaling in vivo and perform translational profiling of defined classes of neurons. We will use a novel approach, called FLEX-TRAP, to express a tagged-ribosomal protein selectively in sub-populations of neurons and use translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to isolate mRNAs that are being actively translated. These mRNAs will be analyzed using next generation sequencing and translational profiles will be compared across conditions and cell types. For this exploratory project we will examine the impact of mTORC1 signaling on the translational profile of four disease-relevant populations of neurons: hippocampal pyramidal cells, direct and indirect pathway striatal projection neurons, and midbrain dopamine neurons. This analysis will provide the first comprehensive and cell type-specific description of mTORC1's impact on mRNA translation in the brain and identify the molecules downstream of mTORC1 responsible for mediating changes in cellular and synaptic function."
"9241209","Chronic systemic inflammation is associated with immune dysfunction and morbidities in the elderly, treated HIV infection, and HCV infection. We propose that circulating inflammatory proteins drive immune exhaustion and senescence and contribute to the immune dysfunction seen in these patient groups. Nearly 4 million Americans are infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and the mean age of US veterans infected with HCV is nearing 65 years. Although the new IFN-free direct-acting antiviral therapy is highly effective at clearing virus from patients, the patients are left with the consequences of decades of infection and liver damage, and it is still unclear how long soluble mediators of inflammation persist, and how long immune dysfunction and associated morbidity lasts. Similarly, even HIV-infected patients that have successfully controlled viral replication with ART for decades have increased mortality and morbidity and persistent inflammation. The VA is the largest single provider of HIV care in the US. Understanding what causes the continued morbidity in these veteran patient populations is critical. The elderly, HCV and HIV-infected patients all have chronic immune inflammation and these three patient groups share many of the same comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and liver disease. The project design of this CDA-2 application is based on the understanding that patients with chronic viral infections and elderly patients show chronic elevated plasma levels of IL-6, and our more recent data demonstrating elevated levels of IL-1? in lymph nodes of HIV-infected patients. The central goals of this study are to determine the underlying mechanisms of IL-6 and IL-1? that contribute to the development of immune exhaustion and senescence and to examine the potential therapeutic role of temporarily blocking IL-6 and IL-1? during chronic infection to improve immune function and recovery of exhausted or senescent T cells. The hypothesis that chronic elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-1? during aging, HCV infection and HIV infection contribute to immune senescence and exhaustion and resulting immune dysfunction will be tested in 3 specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the phenotype and function of T cells that have been exposed to IL-1? or IL-6 in vitro by sorting the cells positive for exhaustion or senescent markers (PD-1, CD57, Tim-3, KLRG1, Lag3) and examining their functional abilities to determine if inflammatory cytokines alone can drive senescence, independent of antigen exposure. Aim 2A will examine the expression levels of exhaustion and senescent markers and the intracellular production of cytokines associated with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in lymphocytess from HCV-infected, treated HIV-infected, and elderly patients by flow cytometry. Aim 2B will examine the recovery and normalization of immune function, longitudinally, in HIV-infected patients after initiation of ART and in HCV-infected patients after initiation of IFN-free direct-acting antiviral therapy. In Aim 3 we will use a mouse model of chronic viral infection (LCMV) to determine the effect of late blockade of IL-6 and IL-1? on the development of exhausted and senescent T cells, and the recovery of T cell function and proliferative ability. The candidate's long term goals are to understand the effects of chronic inflammation on health, the mechanisms by which the immune system maintains homeostasis, and how inflammation disrupts the ability of the immune system to reestablish homeostasis after infection and during aging. This focus supports a growing need nationwide to advance our understanding and develop therapeutic strategies in the aging veteran population with and without chronic viral infection. The candidate's career goals are to use this Career Development Award to successfully transition to an independent investigator at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC, and to establish a productive, thriving, national leading research program in the VA system."
"9236153","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alcohol abuse is a major burden on society and even more of a problem in the veteran population.  Chronic alcohol ingestion can have serious health consequences including pneumonia and acute lung injury, which can occur suddenly and without warning even in physically fit individuals, such as trained military personnel, even without apparent signs of alcohol dependence. Therefore, it is vital for the health of our veterans and indeed our entire population to identify effective treatments that can limit or even prevent these devastating consequences. The primary goal of this clinical research project is to determine if either dietary zinc or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplements can augment lung immune defenses in otherwise healthy alcoholics and thereby decrease the risk of lung injury and infection. There is already strong evidence from our experimental animal models that moderate daily alcohol ingestion for as little as six weeks causes both redox stress and zinc deficiency in the lung. Regular alcohol consumption interferes with the body's ability to take in zinc from food and deliver it to the lung where it is essential for normal immune function and overall health of the lung. Research in the animal model suggests that oxidative stress and zinc deficiency in the lung result in dysfunction of the alveolar macrophage, which is the resident immune cell, and predisposes animals to the development of pneumonia. Importantly, in this same animal model, we found that adding either zinc or glutathione to the diet prevents these problems and preserves lung health even during daily alcohol ingestion.  This CDA-2 project will translate basic findings in the animal model to the clinical setting and determine whether or not zinc or SAM supplements are effective in humans who pathologically consume alcohol. Parallel to the animal model data, our preliminary results from otherwise healthy alcoholic volunteers shows there exists both zinc deficiency and oxidative stress in the lung. This project will extend these findings and enroll veterans who are beginning alcohol treatment at the Atlanta Veterans Hospital in the Substance Abuse Treatment Program (SATP). Participants will be  evaluated by undergoing a procedure to obtain samples of fluid from their lungs, measure zinc levels,  redox potential, and assess how well their alveolar macrophages respond to bacteria (by determining  phagocytic capacity). After completion of the initial evaluation, the participants will be randomized to receive standard treatment (placebo), zinc supplements, or dietary SAM for 14 days. All subjects will be evaluated for two weeks as they undergo treatment. At the end of this two week period, measurements of lung zinc, redox potential and macrophage function will be repeated and compared between the two groups. The hypothesis is that both dietary zinc and SAM supplements will improve alveolar macrophage immune function (as reflected by bacterial phagocytic capacity).  If this project is successful, it will lead to larger scale clinical trials o determine if either dietary zinc or SAM supplements can be effective even in the acute clinical setting and improve outcomes in alcoholics who develop pneumonia or acute lung injury. Both zinc and SAM supplements are safe, simple, and inexpensive to provide, allowing these potential treatments to be easily implemented in the veteran population as well as society in general. Given the significant burden of unhealthy alcohol use, we desperately need to find ways to limit the physical consequences of alcohol abuse in this vulnerable population while we continue the efforts at public education and addiction treatment."

We are, therefore, confident in our ability to prepare both Pre- and Post-Doctoral Fellows with the strongest foundation of knowledge, skills, and experience to achieve and sustain careers as scientific investigators, contributing to advances in HIV prevention, specifically, and public health, in general."
"9277636","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are super-bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions that result from exposure to a variety of chemical and physical agents such as antitumor drugs, environmental/ occupational toxins, ionizing radiation, and endogenous free radical-generating systems. Due to their unusually bulky nature, DPCs are hypothesized to interfere with normal DNA-protein interactions required for DNA replication, transcription, and repair, potentially leading to mutagenesis, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. However, the biological outcomes of DPC lesions in cells are poorly understood because of their inherent structural complexity and the difficulty of generating DNA substrates containing structurally defined DPC for biological evaluation. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the role tha spontaneous and induced DPCs play in human disease and in the anticancer activity of common chemotherapeutic agents. The objectives of this application are to determine the biological consequences of DPC formation in human cells and to discover the mechanism(s) responsible for the removal of DPCs from DNA. Our studies will for the first time systematically examine the influence of DPCs on DNA repair and replication. Our central hypothesis is that, if not repaired, DPCs exert mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, significantly contributing to the biological effects of many known carcinogens and antitumor drugs. Collectively, these studies will provide significant new insights into the molecular and cellular biology of DPCs and are expected to fundamentally advance the fields of DNA repair, cancer biology, and molecular mechanisms of aging."

Because it is usually diagnosed in an advanced stage with no curative therapies, developing novel strategies to prevent or delay the progression of pancreatic cancer is of utmost importance. We propose to study phospho-valproic acid (P-V), a novel derivative of valproic acid (VPA), in combination with cimetidine, a clinically available antiulcer compound, as a novel drug combination for pancreatic cancer prevention. P-V is twice as effective against pancreatic cancer as VPA. For example, in xenograft models P-V reduces tumor growth by 68%, compared to control, whereas VPA reduces it by 34% (chemoprevention protocol). Remarkably, when given in combination with cimetidine, P-V completely prevents the growth of pancreatic tumors in the same animal model. P-V appears to be safe, as shown by genotoxicity and animal toxicity studies, and its key mechanism of action is the inhibition of STAT3 at the mitochondrial level. Our hypothesis is that P-V + cimetidine is an effective and safe chemopreventive drug combination against pancreatic cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim # 1: Determine the chemopreventive efficacy of P-V + cimetidine in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer; Aim # 2: Determine the mechanism of action of P-V + cimetidine in vitro and in vivo. At the completion of these studies, we expect to have determined key pharmacological parameters of a promising novel drug combination approach for pancreatic cancer prevention. Given the importance of pancreatic cancer and the lack of effective chemopreventive agents against it, we believe that the proposed work holds the promise of a significant advance in this area."
"9405736","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying small-molecule inhibitors of protein interactions has traditionally presented a challenge for modern screening methods, despite interest stemming from the fact that such interactions comprise the underlying mechanisms for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The objective of this application is to employ insights from computational methodology we have recently developed to address the distinct challenges associated with finding inhibitors of different classes of protein surface. Our central hypothesis is that exploring protein fluctuations leading to formation of surface pockets is criticl for understanding the regions of chemical space in which suitable inhibitory compounds may be found.  We propose to meet our objective by pursuit of the following three specific aims: 1) Apply pocket optimization for selecting and characterizing protein targets. 2) Employ protein-ligand complementarity to build libraries enriched in protein interface inhibitors. 3) Extend these tools to allosteric inhibitors of protein interfaces.  The proposed research is innovative in its ue of insight from protein fluctuations to identify binding pockets. By first confirming the ability o a target protein to form a suitable pocket and second assembling a complementary library, we collectively address the two main hurdles outlined above that have hitherto hindered identification of small molecules that directly inhibit protein-protein interactions. By combining this approach with in vitro biochemical screening, we expect to identify novel inhibitors of protei interactions involving each of three well-validated cancer targets: Bcl-xL, survivin, and b- TrCP."
"9309344","PROJECT SUMMARY: The ability of bacteria to modify gene expression in adaptation to environmental cues is a key component of bacterial pathogenesis. Two component gene regulatory systems (TCS), which generally consist of a membrane-embedded sensor kinase that alters phosphorylation and dimerization status of its cognate response regulator in reaction to various stimuli, are a central mechanism by which bacteria adjust expression of a diverse array of genes. The control of virulence regulator (CovR) of the major human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a model system for understanding how TCS proteins influence bacterial infectivity. Phosphorylated CovR (CovR~P) primarily serves to repress virulence factor production such that hypervirulent GAS strains with decreased CovR~P levels emerge during human infection and following experimental mouse challenge. It was recently shown that inactivation of the control of virulence sensor kinase (CovS) reduces CovR~P and that CovR~P levels vary between GAS strains of different M serotypes. The goals of this project are to delineate how changes in CovR~P levels impact GAS pathogenesis and to determine the molecular mechanisms by which differences in CovR~P levels alter GAS global gene expression. In aim 1, the effect of CovR~P variation on GAS virulence and the emergence of hypervirulent GAS strains will be evaluated in two murine models using a series of isoallelic strains that have defined CovR~P levels due to engineered single amino acid substitutions in either CovR or CovS. Identified variation in virulence will be correlated with global gene expression profiles to determine mechanisms by which CovR~P alterations influence GAS infectivity. Specific Aim 2 will seek to decipher the specific role of CovR phosphorylation and dimerization in the regulation of CovR-controlled genes that differ in their response to varying CovR~P levels. To this end, we will employ in vivo protein-protein interaction assays to identify co-factors that interact with CovR isoforms that have defined phosphorylation and dimerization characteristics. The effect of these interactions on CovR-mediated expression for genes belonging to various sub-groups will be verified using in vitro transcription assays. In aim 3, we will generate the first in vivo analysis of CovR-DNA interaction via a ChIP-Seq approach. Actual visualization of CovR-DNA complexes using atomic force microscopy will be used to test the hypothesis that CovR~P differentially interacts with distinct arrangements of cis-regulatory elements found in the promoter regions of virulence factor encoding genes belonging to the different subgroups of CovR-regulated genes noted in Specific Aim 2. Given that CovR belongs to the large OmpR/PhoB family of bacterial transcription factors, completion of the proposed research will significantly augment understanding of the mechanistic basis by which TCS impact bacterial pathogenesis."
"9199225","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field."

"9256129","Abstract Management of chronic wounds are a burden in today?s aging population. Expert wound care is needed to monitor and track skin health. Advances in digital photography have made it an efficient and economic option for surveillance and treatment. However, even with the best of circumstances, photographs typically provide qualitative color information that the clinician will interpret to assess physiological tissue health. Recent advancements in optical imaging methods and devices offer the ability to perform quantitative characterization of tissue structure and biochemical status. Modulated Imaging (MI), also known as Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) employs multispectral, patterned illumination to non-invasively obtain subsurface images of biological tissue. The broad goal of this research proposal is to build and validate a handheld system that brings MI technology to point-of-care (PoC) applications. This ?PoC-MI? device will dramatically simplify system complexity and size, while utilizing primarily off-the-shelf consumer-grade components. Based on research accomplishments in Phase I, we have identified hardware and algorithms that will enable us to build a PoC-MI device at lower cost (~10x BOM reduction), lighter weight (~10x lighter), and with faster acquisition (0.1 ms, ~100-1000x faster) compared to previous revisions of the technology. In this Phase II proposal, we propose to design and fabricate a low-cost, hand-held tablet form factor, quantitative skin imaging camera with careful assessment of device performance on tissue-simulating phantoms and performance validation in well-established pre-clinical and clinical models. The results of this grant will be the first PoC MI system that provides quantitative biochemical information of the skin into a tablet form factor, enabling wide applicability in clinical management of chronic wounds."
"9238170","PROJECT SUMMARY This Program has defined what some have called a paradigm shifting pathway of neutrophilic inflammation which, unlike the ?classic? mode associated with IL-8, can become self-propagating in chronic inflammatory diseases such as COPD. Specifically, IL-8 initiates neutrophil (PMN) influx, the PMNs in turn release matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and prolyl endopeptidase (PE) which degrade collagen and generate the PMN-specific matrikine, proline-glycine-proline (PGP). In more common acute inflammatory circumstances, the PGP pathway is terminated by the aminopeptidase activity of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) which destroys PGP. Cigarette smoking (CS) can chemically modify and inactivate LTA4H?s aminopeptidase but not hydrolase activity as well as acetylate PGP rendering it immune to LTA4H. This drives persistently elevated PGP levels and chronic neutrophilic inflammation in COPD. In the Program?s journey to understand the PGP system, we have identified a novel potential prognostic biomarker for COPD, CF, and ARDS, linked matrix degradation to vascular leak, and discovered an anti-inflammatory role for a pro-inflammatory enzyme, LTA4H. PGP has also recently been shown to link extracellular matrix degradation to: acute lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic brain stroke, and modulation of acute pulmonary infection. Consequently, the discovery of the PGP system has particular significance as a fundamental mediator of pathophysiology in a number of disorders and organs. One enigmatic aspect of our studies has been an inability to generate PGP in vitro with collagen and the appropriate proteases in solution. The thesis of this R35 application is that this enigma is due to the requirement that PGP generating enzymes, such as PE, be exosome associated. This idea is supported by many observations, most notably, that airway exosomes from COPD patients, but not controls, are PMN-derived and cause a COPD-like phenotype when transferred to mice. Collectively, the findings led to our hypothesis that proteolytic exosomes constitute a new aspect of the inflammatory process and may participate in chronic inflammatory disorders such as COPD via the PGP pathway. If successful, the results of this project will define a novel entity, i.e. proteolytic exosome, which drives neutrophilic inflammation via PGP generation which is regulated by LTA4H and can cause a COPD-like disease in mice. In human studies, we will phenotype proteolytic exosomes and delineate whether they are biomarkers of COPD that correlate with disease parameters and can transfer pathology from humans to mice. In a smoking mouse model of COPD we will characterize the evolution of such exosomes and whether they can transfer disease from smoked to nave animals. Although, the definition of a new pathogenic entity is daunting, the track record of this Program and the expertise of the PI and team suggest a successful endeavor. If so, a complete understanding of the proteolytic exosome may lead to new diagnostics and therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases such as COPD."
"9237074","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular and metabolic effects of fetal hypoxia on the development of fetal hepatic insulin resistance and activation of fetal hepatic glucose production rate (GPR). This is important because pregnancies complicated by placental ischemic diseases and specifically placental insufficiency induced intrauterine growth restriction (PI-IUGR) expose the fetus to hypoxia. We have shown that the fetal liver during PI-IUGR has increased hepatic GPR, which is resistant to suppression by insulin. While hepatic insulin resistance and increased GPR are likely vital adaptations in the PI-IUGR fetus, these events also are early key hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), to which PI-IUGR offspring are more susceptible. The PI-IUGR fetus also has limited glucose oxidation capacity and decreased hepatic oxygen consumption, suggesting decreased mitochondrial substrate oxidation, which may re-direct carbon for GPR. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms for the early activation of hepatic glucose production in response to fetal hypoxia. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that fetal hypoxia is the major driver of hepatic insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in the fetus. In Aim 1, we will test the role of fetal hypoxia on the development of hepatic insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased hepatic mitochondrial oxidation. In Aim 2, we will determine whether chronic fetal hypoxia produces hepatic insulin resistance via increased nuclear FOXO1 and decreased AMPK activity resulting in increased PCK1 and PDK4 expression in the fetal liver. In Aim 3, we will determine the synergistic coordination between glucose production and mitochondrial oxidation in isolated hepatocytes. The results of our studies will allow us to determine the specific role of fetal hypoxia in the fetal liver on the activation of hepatic GPR and development of hepatic insulin resistance. We also will identify the molecular and metabolic pathways involved in GPR that are regulated by hypoxia in the fetal liver. Our studies also will differentiate hypoxia from relative hypoglycemia as a principal cause of fetal hepatic GPR. The fetal liver is one of the most severely affected organs by PI-IUGR and the only fetal organ to demonstrate insulin resistance, a hallmark of later life T2DM. Defining fetal hypoxia as an early driving factor and the pathophysiological adaptations induced by hypoxia may represent the key to understanding how fetal hypoxia programs the fetal liver to produce glucose, establishing a direct risk for developing T2DM in later life."
"9256599","Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and worldwide. Recent improvements in lung cancer treatment have come from the identification of distinct patient subgroups with targetable molecular drivers. The current paradigm is typified by the treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib. An emerging subgroup are those 8-14% of NSCLC patients with targetable alterations in the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met (MET) pathway. Lung cancer patients with either MET amplification or certain MET mutations, respond to MET targeted therapies, such as the TKI crizotinib. However, patients with MET-driven NSCLC often demonstrate de-novo resistance or inevitably develop acquired therapeutic resistance to crizotinib. The molecular factors influencing resistance to targeted TKIs in EGFR mutant NSCLC are well characterized and the pro-apoptotic protein, BIM, has been shown to be required for response and decreased levels of BIM have been shown to lead to therapeutic resistance. However, the role of BIM in response and resistance to crizotinib in MET-driven NSCLC remains poorly elucidated. Given the inevitability of resistance to crizotinib, there is significant need for studies identifying the molecular factors and mechanisms that contribute to resistance. Interestingly, we have previously shown that TWIST1, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor that is commonly overexpressed in NSCLC and associated with poor survival, is required for MET-driven NSCLC tumorigenesis. We have also shown that TWIST1 can regulate BIM expression and TWIST1 overexpression can lead to crizotinib resistance in a MET amplified NSCLC cell line. Therefore, we hypothesize that direct suppression of BIM transcription by TWIST1 promotes crizotinib resistance in MET amplified/mutant NSCLC. To elucidate the mechanisms by which TWIST1 regulates BIM expression and leads to crizotinib resistance, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of TWIST1 suppression of BIM expression. We will investigate whether TWIST1 is directly suppressing BIM transcription. We will also explore if TWIST1 is indirectly regulating BIM expression by influencing the AKT2/FOXO3a signaling axis and/or influencing ERK signaling. Aim 2: Determine the role of TWIST1 in mediating crizotinib resistance in MET-driven NSCLC. Using both in vitro and in vivo models of MET- driven lung cancer, we will determine if TWIST1 overexpression can lead to crizotinib resistance, if TWIST1 suppression of BIM expression is the dominant mechanism by which TWIST1 promotes crizotinib resistance, and if inhibition of TWIST1 can increase crizotinib sensitivity. Overall, this study will further elucidate the biology of TWIST1 in MET-driven NSCLC and determine if BIM and TWIST1 are potential biomarkers of response and resistance to crizotinib, respectively. Additionally, these proposed studies will provide the rationale for TWIST1 inhibitors as a strategy to prevent and/or overcome therapeutic resistance in MET-driven NSCLC."
"9317583","SUMMARY Salmonella is still one of the most important pathogens in humans throughout the world resulting in millions of infections and economic losses. Each year, Salmonella causes 1.3 million illnesses in the United States, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths. Although there are several vaccines against S. typhi, they are only moderately efficient, are costly and multiple immunizations are necessary. There is no licensed vaccine against S. paratyphi A, B and C and Nontyphoidal Salmonella. Recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines (RASVs) can deliver antigens from a variety of pathogens, generating a range of immune responses including serum and mucosal antibodies, and a panoply of cell-mediated immune responses at local and distal sites. We hypothesize that RASVs with innovative features manipulate cell surface synthesizing protective antigens from Salmonella could induce protective immune responses to multiple Salmonella serovars. To test it, we propose new strategies using triple sugar regulation of cell surface components in vivo, and regulated production of Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens in vivo to augment the immune responses against conserved surface antigens. The RASV strains with triple sugar regulation will be used to deliver conserved protective antigens from Salmonella to induce cross protection to multiple virulent Salmonella serovars."
"9394998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the proposed research is to discover the molecular basis for life-long tooth succession in reptiles and to apply this knowledge to the regeneration of human teeth. The post-doctoral fellow will be using a unique model, the leopard gecko, for this project. There are two main benefits to using reptiles as opposed to the more typical model, the mouse. First, reptiles are amniotes and thus share a common ancestry with mammals. What we learn in reptiles is relevant for humans. Second, tooth replacement in reptiles is on-going, independent of wear or injury and is rapid (30-90 days) thus it is feasible to study the process in a lab setting. In contrast, mammals have at most two sets of teeth and usually the second generation continues to form well into the post-natal period. The first question to be addressed is what is the precise timing and pattern of tooth replacement in healthy adult reptiles? To answer these questions, the leopard gecko is used as the model. These animals are easy to handle and it is possible to adapt many dental procedures used for humans to their smaller mouths. Miniature, serial wax bites and ?CT scans will be taken over a 6 month period and measurements of when teeth are lost and replaced will be taken. The tooth replacement phenotypes will then be correlated with the expression of genes in the dental tissues. We are interested in finding genes that are periodically expressed along the length of the jaw since some of these may coordinate tooth spacing and timing of induction of replacement teeth. The second question to be addressed is what are the long term sequelae of disrupting the activity of the dental lamina on the patterns of tooth replacement? To answer this question, micro surgeries will be carried out in adult geckos including cutting of the dental lamina. The outcomes are predicted to be a change in the spacing or rate of tooth replacement that can be traced back to molecular changes in the dental epithelium. The third and final question to be asked is what are the molecular controls of tooth patterning and induction during embryonic initiation and adult replacement? The roles of two candidate molecules will be studied. These two pathways, called Wingless related (Wnt) and Notch were selected in part because mutations in Wnt increase or decrease tooth number in humans, and because Notch- Delta signalling is known to regulate cell fate decisions between adult stem cell renewal and differentiation along with its role in regulating developmental clock mechanisms. To mirror the human condition, to look for evidence of homeostatic switches regulating tooth renewal, activators or inhibitors of Wnt and Notch will be injected into eggs and the effects on tooth epithelial growth and patterning will be studied. The synergistic research partnership between the applicant/postdoctoral fellow and supervisor will one day lead to more natural ways to replace teeth lost to disease or injury."
"9220049","Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Given the limited regenerative capacity of the human heart following myocardial injury, stem cell-based therapies, including the recent cKit+ cell therapy have emerged as a promising approach for improving cardiac repair and function. Clinical and preclinical data suggests that benefits of cKit+ cell transplantation include improved cardiac function and myocardial mass. However, the ability of cKit+ CPCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes as a significant mode of cardiac repair is controversial. Published data from our group has established the beneficial effects of stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for cKit, in improving the abundance of cKit+ cells, angiogenesis and cardiac function in both rat and pig models of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Further, our preliminary data suggest that secreted paracrine factors, particularly the membrane-bound exosomes, may mediate most of the pro-angiogenic paracrine activity of the SCF-treated cKit+ cell. Our central hypothesis is that mobilization of a heterogeneous group of endogenous CPCs using gene transfer for the receptor tyrosine cKit ligand stem cell factor (SCF) can enhance cardiac tissue repair following myocardial injury via their paracrine secretion. We will test the necessary and sufficient conditions of SCF-induced CPC recruitment using the MI model of heart failure in swine to evaluate the roles of SCF-induced cKit, PW1 and PDGFR? expressing CPCs in myocardial repair, regeneration and restoration of function. We will test the hypothesis that cKit, PW1 and PDGFR? progenitor cells are sufficient for SCF induced cardiac repair by gain of function experiments using SCF modRNA. We will test the hypothesis that cKit, PW1 and PDGFR? progenitor cells are necessary for cardiac repair by loss of function experiments using shRNA-mediated knockdown of cKit, PDGFR? and PW1 receptors. RNAs will be delivered one-week post-MI by the clinically relevant intracoronary route and animals will be evaluated for survival, cardiac remodeling, cardiac function, cell-specific proliferation and differentiation and the molecular mechanisms involved. We will determine the role of paracrine secretion from cKit+ CPCs in SCF-induced cardiac repair. Our preliminary data suggest that exosomes, and not the exosomes-depleted fraction from swine post-MI cKit- secretome have pro-angiogenic activity. Using specific expertise for exosomes research, we will identify the miRNA expression of cKit+ exosomes in response to SCF. In addition, we will investigate the functional mechanisms of cKit+ exosomes-induced proliferation and contractile function of cardiomyocytes and angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro. Finally, we will determine the therapeutic benefits of cKit exosomes in a swine model of heart failure."
"9186853","ABSTRACT Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a leading cause of cancer death in children. The goal of my research is to use integrated genomic and epigenomic profiling to define the genomic alterations that drive leukemogenesis and treatment failure in ALL, and to use this information to develop mouse models to translate these discoveries to innovative therapeutic approaches. My research program has revised the molecular taxonomy of ALL, identified constellations of genetic mutations that define subtypes of ALL, has dissected the genetic basis of clonal evolution, identified new targets for therapeutic intervention, notably with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and has established several new engineered models of high-risk B-progenitor ALL. Recent advances include identification of a high frequency of mutations in epigenetic regulators at relapse in ALL, and demonstrating that specific genomic alterations perturb the interaction of leukemic cells with the microenvironment, resulting in resistance to therapy. This research proposal will determine the mechanistic basis by which genetic lesions present at diagnosis, or enriched at relapse, determine resistance to therapy, and exploit these for therapeutic intervention. Research goals are (1) to identify the constellations of genomic and epigenomic alterations that characterize each subtype of ALL across the age spectrum, and identifying those alterations that cause treatment failure. This involves genome and transcriptome sequencing of childhood and adult ALL, and integrated whole genome, whole genome bisulfite, transcriptome and chromatin mark sequencing of a cohort of 100 ALL cases, including matched samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse and corresponding xenografts. This is essential to identify all coding and non-coding mutations driving disease, to systematically examine the effect of genetic alterations on chromatin remodeling, and to guide the development and interpretation of mouse models of ALL. (2) To perform multiplexed loss-of-function screens using expression of founding oncogenic fusions, coupled with RNA interference and genome editing to dissect the interaction of polygenic alterations in leukemogenesis. (3) To use gene-specific and loss-of-function screens to examine the role of epigenomic alterations in ALL relapse. These include detailed characterization of Crebbp knockin models of ALL, and RNAi/CRISPR/Cas9 screens targeting over 700 chromatin modifier genes in B-ALL leukemia models. Enriched hits, and their effects on chromatin modeling and transcriptional regulation will be compared to data from human leukemic cells; and the resulting models used to test the effect of epigenetic modifying agents on modulating drug resistance. (4) To use mouse models of B-ALL to dissect the role of cellular mislocalization and ?hijacking? of the bone marrow niche and the role of this phenomenon in drug resistance. Together, these approaches provide a comprehensive strategy to fully define the genomic alterations driving treatment failure in ALL, and to mechanistically validate these in logical experimental systems to guide further drug development approaches."
"9281532","7. PROJECT SUMMARY [UNCHANGED] The development of strategies to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementing illnesses will depend on an understanding of the underlying pathologic processes. In recent years it has become apparent that in older persons, these illnesses are usually the result of two or more fundamental pathogenic processes, often interacting additively. This complexity has been recognized largely as a result of neuropathological research in the context of longitudinal epidemiologic projects such as the Nun Study and the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS), both now completed. The proposed project will compile accrued data and images from 854 HAAS autopsies and approximately 500 Nun Study autopsies, develop a common dataset and archive of photographic images of brain sections, and will be employed in parallel assessments of newly revised neuropathologic criteria for the identification and measurement of the AD disease process, which will be compared to previous criteria. In addition, these same data will be utilized for in an in-depth analysis of the interdependent and independent roles of AD brain lesions and brain atrophy as proximate causal factors responsible for dementia. These efforts are expected to: (1) provide a foundation for future analytic use of the accrued resources of the two projects, (2) examine the likely impact and utility of the revised neuropathologic AD assessment criteria for future research addressing the dementing illnesses of late life, and (3) facilitate a conceptual convergence of our understanding of the causes and importance of brain atrophy from neuroimaging and neuropathological perspectives."
"9391408","Abstract Establishment of a proper balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) connectivity is achieved during development of cortical networks and adjusted through synaptic plasticity, but there are fundamental gaps in our understanding of how this process is regulated. Without further characterization of developmental synapse remodeling, our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with GABAergic inhibitory connection disruption such as schizophrenia and autism is limited. The purpose of this research is to characterize molecular mechanisms that establish E/I balance in the prefrontal cortex, which may identify novel targets for treatment of disorders in which E/I balance is altered. The specific goal of this proposal is to define a mechanism for limiting inhibitory connections between GABAergic basket interneurons and pyramidal neurons. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM and tyrosine kinase EphA3 form a presynaptic receptor complex for postsynaptic ephrinA5 to promote elimination of perisomatic synapses during early postnatal development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). I also hypothesize that formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in later postnatal development of the PFC terminates NCAM/EphA3-mediated basket cell remodeling. To address these hypotheses, I will (1) characterize the importance of NCAM/EphA3 binding by using non-binding mutants in functional assays including receptor clustering, downstream EphA3 signaling, and growth cone collapse, (2) determine whether Neurocan competitively inhibits binding of NCAM/EphA3, (3) develop novel mouse models to conditionally delete NCAM in cortical neurons and assess perisomatic synapse remodeling using live two-photon imaging, and (4) test whether PNNs prevent remodeling of basket cells in brain slices. The findings of these studies are expected to be of great value to our understanding of novel molecular mechanisms of synapse remodeling of GABAergic interneurons in postnatal PFC and could provide insight into the etiology of neurological disorders involving E/I balance disruption."
"9293109","Project Summary Indirect airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a fundamental feature of asthma, yet the immunopathology of this critical aspect of asthma remains incompletely understood. In contrast to other features of asthma such as direct AHR to methacholine challenge and airflow obstruction that are present in other lung diseases, indirect AHR is a unique and specific feature of asthma. We have examined the pathogenesis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as a prototypical feature of indirect AHR. In cross sectional studies, EIB is present in 30-50% of subjects with asthma, and can be ascertained precisely by a dry air exercise challenge test. In addition, subjects with EIB in the absence of other features of asthma have a high risk of progression to other aspects of the asthma syndrome, further verifying the fundamental relationship between indirect AHR and asthma. Our research on the pathogenesis of EIB has revealed that subjects with EIB have high levels of eicosanoids such as leukotrienes (LT) in their airways, as well as epithelial shedding into the airway lumen. Following exercise challenge, we have identified mast cell (MC) degranulation and sustained release of eicosanoids. As we have worked to unravel the basis of these alterations in the airway function, we have identified a secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) that serves as a regulator of eicosanoid synthesis and is elevated in the airways of subjects with asthma, and discovered infiltration of the airway epithelium with MCs that have a distinct phenotype in subjects with EIB. Thus, the overall goal my research program is to understand the alterations in the airways that lead to indirect AHR in humans. Based on our initial observations, we hypothesize that epithelial-derived sPLA2 group X (sPLA2-X) serves as a key regulator of innate cells including MCs, leading to the generation of products such as LTs that mediate bronchoconstriction through the sensory nerves, leading to goblet cell degranulation and smooth muscle constriction. In the first aim, we use airway samples and primary epithelial cell culture models to examine the regulation and function of epithelial sPLA2-X. In the second aim, we determine differences in the number and proliferation potential of MC progenitors in the airways, and whether these cells serve as a critical source of IL-13 in asthma. In the final aim, we use design-based stereology to examine the cellular and structural basis of indirect AHR in asthma using airway biopsy samples from informative groups of subjects with and without asthma. These projects will move the field forward through a better understanding of the structural and molecular basis for indirect AHR in asthma, and will serve to train the next generation of patient-oriented researchers in this important area."
"9347088","Abstract The global burden of HIV remains severe, and resistance develops steadily to new antiviral agents, requiring ongoing development of new therapies. Raltegravir, the first FDA-approved inhibitor of integrase (IN), binds the enzyme active site and blocks DNA strand transfer. Evolution of HIV in the presence of raltegravir elicits resistance mutants, however, motivating studies of potential additional targets on IN. IN binds the host cell protein PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 (henceforth LEDGF), which is important for efficient IN function, including targeting HIV integration to active transcription units via a tethering mechanism. We and others have found that the LEDGF binding site on IN can be bound by small molecule inhibitors (allosteric integrase inhibitors, or ALLINIs), and now highly active inhibitors targeting this site are available. Surprisingly, inhibition by these molecules does not act strongly on the integration step of the replication cycle, but instead interferes with proper maturation of the viral core after budding, implicating IN in assembly. We hypothesized that a detailed understanding of ALLINI function and escape will allow development of more potent inhibitors. We thus crystallized full-length HIV-1 IN bound to the ALLINI GSK1264, and analyzed the inhibitor interface. This represents the first time X-ray quality crystals have been generated that contained full length HIV IN. The structure shows GSK1264 bound to the dimer-interface of the catalytic domain, and also positioned at this interface is a C-terminal domain (CTD) from an adjacent IN dimer. In the crystal lattice, IN forms an open polymer mediated by this interaction. Further studies of several ALLINIs show that HIV escape mutants with reduced sensitivity commonly alter amino acids at or near the inhibitor-mediated interface, and that HIV escape mutations often encode substitutions that reduce multimerization. We propose that ALLINIs inhibit particle maturation by stimulating inappropriate polymerization of IN through the newly identified CTD-catalytic-domain interface. In preliminary data, we show that these escape mutants are far more amenable to crystallographic studies than wild-type IN, making possible aggressive new studies of IN structure and inhibition. In Specific Aim 1, we will obtain high resolution structures of IN variants in the presence of ALLINIs In Specific Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis of the mechanism of ALLINI action by generating HIV viruses carrying mutations in IN designed to disrupt the CTD-catalytic domain interface and assess their capacity for replication in cell culture and sensitivity to ALLINIs. In Specific Aim 3, we will we will take advantage of new information on IN properties to crystallize and determine the first structures of IN/DNA complexes."
"9196350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Periodontitis affects 64 million US adults, leading to bone and tooth loss and contributing to systemic conditions. Subgingival bacteria play a major role in periodontitis. Because 50% of the oral microbiome is unrecognized or uncultured, important species may have been overlooked, representing a gap in knowledge.  The progress in cultivating relevant oral uncultured taxa has been slow. The few studies available are either low-throughput or open-ended, which are less suitable to cultivate putative pathogens. Because our goal is to improve periodontal health, we aim at cultivating taxa that are relevant in disease, and not just any uncultured taxa. Results from my R03 showed that many unrecognized/uncultured subgingival taxa were uncommon, thus unlikely to be relevant. In contrast, I identified 30 abundant uncultured taxa that merit further pursuit and will be the focus of this proposal. Our long term goal is to identify new periodontal pathogens and their pathogenic mechanisms. The overall objective of this proposal is to recover and domesticate uncultured taxa associated with periodontal disease. Our central hypothesis is that their growth results from interactions with community members and the habitat, which have not yet been reproduced in vitro. Our rationale is that targeted systematic cultivation of relevant taxa in ex vivo biofilms is a cost-effective approach to isolate new periodontal pathogens. We will use technological and conceptual innovative approaches to achieve our goals.  We will test this hypothesis and accomplish our objective by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Support the growth of prominent uncultured taxa in ex vivo periodontal biofilms: we will use the Calgary Biofilm Device to multiplex the cultivation conditions (using multiple growth conditions in paralle) of subgingival samples pre-screened for the target taxa using 16S rRNA lllumina sequencing; 2) Identify helper species that can sustain the growth of target uncultured periodontal taxa: we will use CLASI-FISH (a multiplex FISH) on the biofilms and correlation network analysis of 16S rRNA data to identify in situ and in silico the best helper species based on their co-occurrence and physical proximity with target uncultured taxa; and 3) Domesticate uncultured periodontal taxa in a small consortium of helper species: we will use the best growth conditions and helpers species identified above for the high-throughput parallel co-cultivation of uncultured taxa.  This proposal is significant because it will allow the cultivation of novel putative periodontal pathogens, a key step to determine their pathogenicity. Our contribution to the field will be the identification of ecological relationships that allow their growth, the generation of whole genomic sequences as well as the development of a systematic approach that can be useful to study other biofilm diseases. The outcomes of our study will support NIDCR's research initiatives for FY2014 (the role of uncultivable bacteria in the oral microbiome) and their mission to foster the knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of oral infectious diseases."
"9358151","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is growing evidence that lifelong health, including mental health, is particularly shaped by the environment experienced during the in-utero developmental period. The intrauterine environment is influenced by a complex variety of factors, including maternal lifestyle, environmental exposures, socioeconomic status, and psychosocial aspects, making risk determination based on identification of these factors difficult and inaccurate. Yet, defining children at-risk early is utterly critical to improving future mental health outcomes. Due to the unique regulatory features of imprinted genes and their sensitivity to environmental exposures, genomic imprinting has been proposed as an ideal integrated measure of the intrauterine environment for use in epidemiologic studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. As imprinted genes in the placenta can impact the function of this critical organ in directing fetal development and programming, there is also strong evidence to support establishing and validating the link between alterations in imprinting and newborn neurodevelopmental outcomes. Compelled by strong rationale and by emerging evidence, including work from our laboratories linking placenta imprinted gene expression to infant neurodevelopment, this project aims to develop an imprinting-based biomarker that can prospectively predict neurobehavioral outcomes, which ultimately can be used for immediate identification of infants at-risk in order for early intervention to be initiated/implemented. We have developed a multi-stage research plan to first utilize the comprehensive resources of the ongoing Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS), which employs the validated and prospectively predictive NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) as a phenotypic measure of newborn neurobehavior in a birth cohort of 900 newborn infants, to define a biomarker panel associated with key neurobehavioral measures. We will then demonstrate the validity and generalizability of this biomarker using an established but independent resource, the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS), which uses similar data collection procedures as RICHS. In addition, although the environment is extraordinarily complex, we have decided to focus on fetal exposure to metals, specifically those which are widely considered neurotoxins or those considered protective, as a paradigm to build a comprehensive model to examine the inter-relationships among in utero trace metals exposure, genomic imprinting, and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. Identification of an imprinting signature associated with abnormal neurodevelopment or environmental exposure would have significant clinical and public health implications by pinpointing certain environmental risk factors for neurobehavioral defects or serve as a basis for early diagnostic tools thus providing an opportunity for early intervention."
"9194415","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric drugs which are used as anesthetics, sedatives and antiepileptics in neonatal and pediatric medicine, can be harmful to the developing brain. They have been shown to cause widespread cell death, impair synaptic maturation and plasticity and inhibit neurogenesis (the birth of new nerve cells) in the brains of rodents and non-human primates (NHP). Studies in rodents and in NHPs have provided compelling evidence that early life exposure to these drugs also triggers behavioral toxicity, i.e. causes long term behavioral and cognitive deficits that persist when the animals mature. Furthermore, retrospective clinical studies raise serious concerns that exposure of human infants to these classes of drugs may lead to neurocognitive and behavioral disorders. Practicing medicine without anesthetics, sedatives and antiepileptics is impossible. These medications must be used during surgeries, prolonged sedation during critical illness, and for the treatment of seizures. Thus, the crucial question arises whether protective measures can be developed and applied in the clinical setting to avoid potential iatrogenic adverse effects of these classes of drugs on brain health and subsequent development in the most vulnerable age groups, specifically neonates and infants during the first year of life. Hypothermia is successfull applied in neonatal and pediatric medicine to minimize brain injury from perinatal asphyxia, cardiac surgery and neonatal stroke. We propose to investigate hypothermia as a potential protective treatment of the developing primate brain against histological, behavioral and neurocognitive toxicity of anesthetic, sedative and anticonvulsant drugs. Research will be conducted in NHP infants using clinically relevant drug combinations and durations of treatment. We plan to use sevoflurane (SEVO), which is becoming one of the most frequently used general anesthetics in pediatric medicine and the combination of phenobarbital and midazolam (Pb/M), a protocol commonly used for sedation or antiepileptic therapy in neonates and infants. We want to test the following three hypotheses: (1) Exposure of NHP infants to SEVO anesthesia for 5 hrs will cause death (apoptosis) of brain cells, and application of hypothermia throughout the duration of anesthesia and for 1 hr thereafter will prevent or reduce the severity of this injuy; (2) Application of hypothermia during and 12 hrs after exposure of NHP infants to a 24 hr long treatment with the antiepileptic/sedative drug combination phenobarbital/midazolam (Pb/M) will prevent or mitigate the acute cell death (apoptosis) response caused by the drugs; (3) Exposure of NHP infants to the drug combination Pb/M for 24 hours will cause long- term neurobehavioral impairment (NBI), and application of hypothermia throughout the duration of Pb/M treatment and for 12 hrs thereafter (the period during which the drugs are still present at toxic concentrations n the brain) will prevent or mitigate the long-term NBI. These questions cannot be answered by research on human subjects, but can be successfully addressed and answered by research using non-human primates."
"9263542","ABSTRACT It is easy for children to overeat in today's food environment, leading to weight gain. However, not all children are obese, suggesting that there is individual variability in how people perceive and interact with the current food environment. Research on obesity shows that overweight and obese people, and those that gain weight, compared to healthy weight people, have greater reward sensitivity, as demonstrated by increased BOLD response in neural areas associated with reward, evaluation and taste in response to the taste of food. Since relationships are learned through associative conditioning between environmental cues and eating, it is possible that this individual variability in how people interact with the food environment could be explained by different rates of learning between food cues in the environment and tastes of food. Thus, an alternative hypothesis, is that people that gain weight could be more likely to learn the relationships between cues in the environment predicting food (cue-reward learning). In this study, we propose to evaluate whether reward sensitivity, cue-reward learning, or both are differentially associated with children at risk for obesity and those not at risk for obesity, and to evaluate whether these neural mechanisms predict weight gain over time. We propose to recruit and scan 66 healthy weight 8-10 year old children at high-risk for obesity (HR: two overweight/obese parents) and 66 healthy weight age matched children at low-risk for obesity (LR; two lean parents) using functional MRI evaluating BOLD response to a cue-reward learning paradigm which pairs innocuous cues with chocolate milkshake and tasteless saliva. In particular, we are interested in evaluating whether reward sensitivity and cue-reward learning in the amygdala, insula, hippocampus and striatum will differentiate the HR from the LR children, and whether these two mechanisms predict weight gain and eating over two years. We will achieve this goal through the following three primary aims: 1) Compare the rate of cue-reward learning to cues paired with chocolate milkshake compared to cues paired with tasteless saliva between HR and LR children, 2) Compare the reward sensitivity, as measured by peak BOLD response, between HR and LR children 3) To evaluate cue-reward learning and reward sensitivity to hedonic taste as predictors of weight gain and eating over time in the children (HR and LR). This program of research tests a novel hypothesis regarding overeating and the development of obesity in children, and could provide critical data on individual vulnerabilities to overeating for further research. Furthermore, this study could provide mechanisms for intervention with regards to cue-reward learning in children, to ultimately prevent obesity in youth."
"9186811","Project Summary Genetic and functional data have demonstrated the importance of somatic mutations in signaling effectors and in epigenetic modifiers in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the mechanisms by which these two classes of leukemia disease alleles cooperate to induce transformation, and how coordinate mutations in signaling pathways and in epigenetic regulators affect the response to targeted therapy, has not been fully elucidated. Here we propose to investigate how mutations in signaling effectors cooperate with mutations in epigenetic regulators to induce myeloid transformation, and how these mutations influence the response to targeted therapies including the development of therapeutic resistance. We will then extend our studies to investigate whether combination therapeutic approaches can achieve increased efficacy in models of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The long-term goals of this proposal are to characterize novel mechanisms by which oncogenic disease alleles cooperate to induce leukemogenesis, and to credential novel combination strategies that can be investigated in the clinical context. We will investigate this using a combination of novel, genetically accurate animal models, epigenomic studies in murine models and patient samples, and preclinical therapeutic studies aimed at rational design of combination therapeutic strategies. Our studies have a mechanistic focus, but are aimed to rapidly translate these insights to the clinical context."
"9260546","Globally, an estimated 16.2% of the human population is infected with HSV-2 including >17% of the U.S. adult population. Genital herpes is associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission of HSV-2 infection can cause neonatal herpes with high infant mortality. HSV-2 infection in the adult population has increased substantially in the past two decades despite the availability of antiviral drugs. The failure of antiviral drugs to prevent the spread of HSV-2 and the sheer magnitude of the public health problem associated with HSV-2 infection indicates a need for a safe and effective vaccine that is not available. As to the protective mechanism, the current consensus of HSV-2 experts is that serum antibody response alone is insufficient to provide protective immunity, primarily based on the disappointing clinical trial results. Therefore, mucosal immunity and T cell responses are considered very important. HSV-2 is a very unique virus able to escape from immune surveillance, and inhibit immune responses in order to successfully infect the host and establish latency. With NIAID-SBIR phase I and II grant funding, we made a significant finding that HSV-2 infected Guinea Pigs (GP) untreated or provided with a reference vaccine (that mimics the HSV-2 vaccine which failed in latest clinical trial) were unable to elicit vaginal IgA. Unlike other HSV-2 vaccine candidates, our mucosal vaccine technology employs a patented heterologous prime-boost strategy consisting of a DNA vaccine prime given intramuscularly (i.m.) and a protein-encapsulated liposome vaccine boost delivered intranasally (i.n.). This two-step heterologous immunization strategy developed as a mucosal vaccine regimen provides a multi-tiered protection with a Th-1 biased, broad and potent cellular and humoral immune response especially mucosal immune response and vaginal protection against primary and latent HSV-2 infection.  This novel HSV-2 vaccine shows both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies particularly at the genital site of the guinea pig models. The company was recently funded by a phase IIB SBIR grant for our HSV-2 vaccine, to support cGMP manufacturing of key vaccine components towards the ultimate goal of IND filing and clinical trials. This new phase I R43 SBIR grant application was developed in response to the Study Section's suggestion of strengthening studies on nasal delivery devices. We plan to conduct bio-distribution, bioavailability studies comparing nasal spray vs. nasal drop delivered HSV-2 gD-Liposome vaccine in New Zealand White rabbits. We also propose to compare the immunogenicity and immune protection efficacies of gD-lip formulation delivered by nasal drop vs. nasal spray in female GPs that will be first primed with our HSV- 2 DNA vaccine. If funded, it would help fill in the gap in the critical pathway of advancing our mucosal HSV-2 vaccine candidate to clinical trials. The net result of these research efforts will be to identify a more efficient nasal delivery device for our mucosal HSV-2 vaccine, and ultimately alleviate pain risk and suffering in the 35- 40 million Americans with genital Herpes."
"9275365","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Immunotherapeutic strategies to orient the immune system against tumor cells continue to hold great promise for patients with advanced melanoma. The paucity of conventional treatment options and the complexity and inconsistency of clinical immunotherapy have motivated the development of scientific models to identify ways to improve immunotherapy. Thus far, these models have employed melanoma-specific T cell populations that have been activated and expanded ex vivo for adoptive transfer into lymphodepleted hosts bearing melanoma tumors. Although designed to mimic paradigms of experimental adoptive immunotherapy used in human subjects, the complexity of these models has obfuscated our ability to precisely characterize the in vivo interaction that takes place between adoptively transferred melanoma-specific T cells and melanoma tumors. Our laboratory has developed a simple quantitative animal model of melanoma-induced T cell suppression to demonstrate that in vivo exposure to growing melanoma tumors weakens the ability of T cells to undergo antigen-driven proliferative expansion by heightening their susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. This alteration of T cell responsiveness fundamentally reshapes the entire spectrum of activated T cell homeostasis with one interesting exception: memory T cells appear to be uniquely resistant to this melanoma- induced suppression. In this proposal, we have drawn on our previous experience to introduce new, simplified models of melanoma adoptive T cell immunotherapy to test a central hypothesis: that the efficacy of melanoma adoptive immunotherapy can be optimized with the use of memory T cells. In the first series of experiments, we will test a first subhypothesis: that the in vivo durability of adoptively transferred melanoma-specific T cells is impaired by melanoma-induced upregulation of T cell apoptosis. We will examine the fate of adoptively transferred T cell populations in vivo to characterize how melanoma influences the ability of therapeutic populations of melanoma-specific T cells to persist. In the next series of experiments, we will test a second subhypothesis: that memory T cells are optimal mediators of melanoma adoptive immunotherapy because of an enhanced ability to survive and target melanoma antigens following adoptive transfer. We will compare the in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred melanoma-specific T cells in various stages of maturation (resting T cells, acute effector T cells, unsorted memory T cells, central memory T cells, and effector memory T cells) following adoptive transfer, as well as their abilities to infiltrate melanoma tumors, induc tumoral regression, and promote tumoral immunity. From there, we will test a third subhypothesis: that adoptive immunotherapy is more effective when endogenous melanoma-specific T cell responses are preserved. We will employ highly quantitative assays used in our laboratory to determine how endogenous melanoma-specific T cell responses are affected by adoptive immunotherapy, and will determine if therapeutic efforts to preserve and enhance those endogenous responses promote the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy. In the fourth and final series of experiments, we will test a fourth subhypothesis: that melanoma-specific memory T cells can be harvested and expanded to quantities that will permit the clinical realization of memory T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy. Here, we will examine human melanoma tumors to verify that the biological advantages of memory T cells can be put to clinical use. This final piece will enable us to begin the next phase of investigation: a clinical rial to introduce a novel and critical form of cancer treatment. In summary, we are proposing a series of experiments with which the biological underpinnings of adoptive T cell immunotherapy may be rationally and critically explored. It is our expectation that this work will allow us to fuly actualize the enormous potential of this desperately needed treatment for veterans afflicted with melanoma."
"9382179","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomarkers are cellular, biochemical or molecular alterations that can be easily and non-invasively measured in human tissues and are directly or indirectly in the pathway of disease. Over the past two decades, scientific research has repeatedly shown that ambient air particulate pollution, also known as particulate matter (PM), induces lung and systemic inflammation, as well as reductions in lung function and accelerated lung aging. The limited availability of biomarkers that reflect at-risk exposures and preclinical effects on lung function dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention. To address this gap, our long-term goal is to identify novel biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired lung function. We will leverage recent experimental and clinical evidence on the roles of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)-i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by human cells into the bloodstream-and of their bioactive cargo of microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel conveyors of inflammatory responses. Recent evidence from animal and human studies has shown that PM induces the release of EVs into the bloodstream from cells in the lung and other relevant tissues. In particular, PM exposure causes release of EV-encapsulated miRNAs, which are key bioactive molecules that can control the expression of genes in recipient cells. Yet to date, no data in large, well-phenotyped populations are available to address the potential roles of EVs as part of the paths linking PM exposure to its adverse effects on lung function. In this proposal, we exploit the unique nature of the Normative Aging Study (NAS) cohort (n=750) in which we have repeated collections of blood samples, exposure data and lung function measures in up to 7 visits conducted over 20+ years of follow up. All findings will be independently validated in KORA (n=750), a cohort remarkably similar to the NAS for study design, exposure levels, and participants' characteristics. We hypothesize that the number, size, and miRNA cargo of blood EVs are modified in response to short- and/or long-term exposures to ambient PM (Aim 1); and that the EV number, size, and miRNA cargo reflect reduced lung function at the time of blood sampling and/or over subsequent serial visits (Aim 2). We will use advanced statistical modeling to integrate a panel of inflammation markers in the paths linking exposure, EVs, and impaired lung function; we will establish and make publicly available a reference dataset on the tissue/cell type of origin of blood EVs and of their miRNAs; we will use this dataset to estimate the sources of EV- encapsulated miRNAs linking PM to impaired lung function (Exploratory Aim 3). Across all aims, we will use detailed characterization of PM chemical components to capture their emission sources. As we can leverage a wealth of extant, ready-to-use resources and data from the NAS and KORA cohorts, we will be able to cost- effectively recapitulate data from more than two decades of follow up over a single grant cycle."
"9242553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research background: Over the past four years, Dr. Gros has worked as a Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) Staff Psychologist, providing evidence-based psychotherapies to Veterans with depressive and anxiety disorders and completing related research projects to better understand and improve clinical outcomes in Veterans with these disorders. To date, Dr. Gros has authored 43 peer-reviewed publications and 32 conference presentations at meetings of national and international societies. Dr. Gros has also served as Co- Investigator on two DVA Merit Awards. Immediate and Long-Term Career Goals: Dr. Gros' long-term career goals involve improving the effectiveness, efficiency, dissemination, and implementation of evidence-based psychotherapy for Veterans with depressive and anxiety disorders. Consistent with these long-term goals, Dr. Gros' DVA Career Development Award (CDA) proposes to evaluate a single unified transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in Veterans with depressive/anxiety disorders to improve clinical outcomes and reduce comorbidity as compared to an evidence-based psychotherapy control condition of behavioral activation treatment (BAT). Primary Aims in Career and Mentorship Plan: In order to accomplish these goals, Dr. Gros' CDA also will provide vital trainings in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including advanced methodology, implementation, statistical evaluation, and grantsmanship. Specialized coursework, scheduled time with mentors, and hands-on trainings will be used to enhance Dr. Gros' background in each of these areas. Relevance of Research Plan: CBT is robustly effective in treating Veterans with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, CBT is underutilized due in large part to the complexity and number of protocols across disorders, as well as extensive training needed to apply them. These limitations have reduced Veterans' access to CBT, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes and quality of life. To address these concerns, world renowned experts in the CBT field have been calling for a new transdiagnostic approach to treatment in order to improve access to care by distilling the existing disorder-specific CBT protocols for emotional problems into an unified CBT protocol for the great majority of depressive/anxiety disorder presentations. Primary Aims in Research Plan: The proposed CDA research aims to: 1) compare the efficacy of transdiagnostic CBT on reducing mental health symptoms and improving quality of life to the BAT control condition, and 2) compare the feasibility and acceptability of the transdiagnostic CBT to the BAT control condition. Participant population: The participants of the proposed study will include 96 DVA patients with depressive/anxiety disorders. General inclusion criteria includes: 1) a principal diagnosis of a depressive/anxiety disorder; and 2) a willingness and competence to provide informed consent for research participation. Procedures to be used: A RCT of the transdiagnostic CBT and BAT control condition will be completed. Participation in the RCT will involve completion of: 1) consent documentation, 2) intake assessment, 3) random assignment to treatment condition, 4) weekly 50 minute appointments of individual psychotherapy for 12-16 weeks, and 5) self-report assessments of symptomatology and quality life at intake, one week post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: If successful, this proposed project will lead to reduced symptomatology, comorbidity, and improved quality of life and recovery in DVA patients with depressive/anxiety disorders by eventually improving access to and availability of evidence-based CBT through this new transdiagnostic CBT protocol."
"9190245","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Necrosis has long been regarded as a passive, uncontrolled form of cell death. However, recent discoveries have challenged this notion providing evidence to show that necrosis is a tightly regulated cell death program with implication in various human pathological conditions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Similar to its cell death counterpart apoptosis, necrosis can be induced by an array of intrinsic and extrinsic stress signals [5]. The morphological manifestations that ensue have been well characterized which include increase in cell volume, swelling of the cellular organelles, rupturing of the cell membrane and subsequent spillage of their cellular contents into the surrounding environment [1]. Due to the lack of knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying necrotic cell death pathways, necrosis is often characterized by these features. However, insights into the necrotic process have recently emerged from studies conducted in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans which have suggested that lysosomes are a major convergence point for necrotic stress pathways [17, 18]. In these studies, lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cysteine peptidase activity was triggered by a broad array of cellular insults. Interestingly, LMP and necrosis were blocked by overexpressing a single intracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin), SRP-6, suggesting that necrosis is regulated by a proteases-driven mechanism. Our preliminary data indicates that similar necrotic pathways are employed in mammalian cells. In this proposal, we describe a research strategy aimed at identifying necrotic regulators of LMP and executioner proteases using two independent biochemical approaches. First, we will utilize a newly developed LMP activity assay to identify LMP regulators from human cell extracts using a series of purification steps followed by mass spectrometry. The second objective is to exploit the protease-inhibiting properties of human serpins in order to enrich for necrotic executioner proteases using an affinity tag pulldown method. A novel chemical compound, NB24, will be used to help stabilize serpin-protease complexes in the cell after necrosis induction. The protein composition of serpin-protein complexes will be analyzed via mass spectrometry. The function of all identified candidate proteins will be validated using cell-based survival assays to determine their function and mechanism of action during necrosis. Ultimately, the identification of these proteins will lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent LMP-induced necrosis, as well as provide the long-sought in vivo biomarkers of necrosis needed to further uncover necrotic pathways similar to how caspases have served for apoptosis research."
"9316158","Project Summary Allergic disorders have become an issue of major public health significance, especially in children. Although the combined effects of genetic/environmental/developmental may be contributed to the observed global increase of prevalence of allergic disease, the mechanisms underlying modern increases in prevalence of human immune-mediated diseases that likely occur very early in life, such as food allergy remain unclear. Prenatal exposures have been associated with altered risk for allergic disorders. Heritability may pose susceptibility to these conditions. But, genetic mutations with clear relationship to allergy have been elusive. There is an increasing body of epidemiological and animal studies indicating that the immunological environment encountered by the fetus during pregnancy is a strong determinant not only of fetal growth and development, but also of disease risk later in life. However, the mechanisms by which maternal factors regulate the immune function of offspring are not fully understood. Thus, we consider the possibility that food allergy is acquired through maternal imprinting onto the newborn during pregnancy. In this case, if the mother is of an allergic phenotype, the immunologic milieu throughout gestation may be altered which may, in turn, skew the developing fetus toward an allergic phenotype. Our preliminary results showed that feeding a model food antigen to the offspring of mothers who have been sensitized with OVA in the context of the Th2-skewing adjuvant alum prior to pregnancy induced a Th2 type of immune response to this normally tolerogenic stimulus. Moreover, such offspring go on to develop an allergic response when challenged with OVA. These outcomes are antigen specific ? maternal sensitization to bovine serum albumin does not abrogate oral tolerance to OVA in the offspring. They are also dependent on the Th2 environment ? maternal exposure to OVA in the absence of alum does not affect oral tolerance in the offspring. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that intrauterine exposure of maternal Th2-skewed immune response and antigen (OVA) at critical periods of development may contribute to impaired neonatal immune tolerance and predispose the offspring to allergy through (1) utero sensitization to antigen, which may be transferred to the fetal circulation via binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), and (2) Th2-dependent transplacental conditioning of the developing immune system in the fetus. Accordingly, these hypotheses will be tested in the experiments described in this revised R21 proposal. The experiments proposed in this application will provide new insights that will be applicable to our understanding of the pathogenesis of food allergy in children. A clearer understanding of the immunoregulatory effects of maternal factors on the fetal and newborn offspring may suggest new therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of food allergy in both children and adults."
"9238183","Skin cancer prevention is a public health priority. Over 3.5 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) occur annually and melanoma rates have doubled in the last 30 years, burdening the nation's health system. Increasing evidence points to the need for prevention programs to be targeted to young adults2,3 as invasive melanoma of the skin is the third most common cancer among adolescents and young adults (ages 15- 39) in the U.S. Skin cancer is preventable as excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), the primary risk factor, is modifiable and a number of public health campaigns have been developed to increase awareness about skin cancer risk and to promote sun safety. Despite these efforts, skin cancer rates continue to rise. Many adults still forget to apply sunscreen, do not pre-apply prior to sun exposure, fail to reapply, do not use clothing or wide-brimmed hats that physically block UVR and do not use shade. 4.2% of US adults engage in indoor tanning. It is well established that continued efforts are needed to promote skin cancer prevention. Concurrently, approximately, 25% of American adults have a tattoo with younger adults more likely to have tattoos than older adults. The popularity of tattoos continues to grow in the general population and particularly among members of the military. Individuals with tattoos need to take extra precaution when exposed to the sun not only to protect themselves from harmful UVR rays but also to reduce damage to their tattoos. We propose to develop and test Sun Safety Ink! (SSI!), a skin cancer prevention program targeted to clients of licensed tattoo studios. The studios have been selected as the venue for this study because tattoo studios, at times, promote sun protection for new tattoos to keep them from fading, and offer a unique opportunity to reach younger adults who have high sunburn rates and are often less likely to practice sun protection. The studios provide a unique and compatible environment for sun safety promotion. Further, a number of successful programs have promoted health practices through similar venues such as beauty parlors and barber shops. Our exploratory research with the tattoo community determined that: (1) tattoo studios were receptive to a skin cancer prevention program; (2) tattooed individuals had high rates of sunburns and low rates of sun protection but were open to receiving sun safety information and (3) a prototype SSI! program confirmed feasibility for recruitment and implementation. Based on these results, we propose to fully develop SSI! to include an online sun safety training for artists, a website, and additional sun safety education materials (e.g., social media). We will work with the Alliance of Professional Tattoo Artists and the National Tattoo Association to recruit 30 licensed studios to participate in a group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled quasi- experimental design. The primary outcomes of the study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of SSI! at: (1) increasing full-body comprehensive sun protection practices; (2) decreasing sun burning and tanning; and, (3) decreasing positive attitudes regarding tanning and tanning attractiveness."
"9197299","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision loss from complications of diabetes is growing at a fierce rate in developing nations around the world and in various populations in our country. A tremendous obstacle to better population-wide prevention is a basic understanding of the early pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. While current approaches are centered on lowering serum glucose, the roles that lipid abnormalities play in this disease have largely been ignored. Seminal large clinical trials have shown a beneficial effect of fenofibrate on retinopathy progression in diabetes. The effect was independent of circulating lipoprotein levels. Fenofibrate is a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR??). This transcription facor acts as a coordinator of cellular responses to nutritional status by binding to various lipids, including phospholipids. An insulin-sensitive catalyst of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS), is required for the provision of specific phospholipid ligands to PPARs in multiple tissues, but has not yet been studied in the retina. This pathway represents a novel potential link between insulin deficiency in Type 1 diabetes or insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes and progressive damage to the retina in both of these conditions.  In this application, we outline a series of experiments in cell culture systems and in animals lacking retinal FAS that are aimed at understanding mechanisms and functions of DNL in the healthy and diabetic retina. We then propose a cross-sectional study to identify people with diabetes at high risk for developing retinopathy through electroretinography, a non-invasive clinical tool that we use extensively at our institution. In patients with this early stage of retinopathy, we will measure erythrocyte phospholipids that have been shown to correlate highly with retinal phospholipids. Together, these studies are aimed at establishing a novel link between abnormalities in systemic and retinal phospholipid metabolism and early functional abnormalities in diabetic retinopathy. We will test the related hypotheses that changes in retinal lipogenesis contribute to diabetic retinopathy and that lipid alterations in peripheral blood are highly correlated with earl ERG changes in the diabetic retina. Towards this goal, we will address the following three aims: (1) To define roles for FAS in regulating retinal lipid metabolism; (2) To determine if targeted deletion of FAS exacerbates retinopathy in diabetic animals; (3) To define specific erythrocyte phospholipid profiles that may be associated with early diabetic retinopathy using a mass spectrometry-based analysis of peripheral blood from human subjects.  Through a partnership between endocrinologists and ophthalmologists at our institution, this application has the potential to uncover early pathologic changes in lipid metabolism associated with early diabetic retinopathy, which may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Through our studies, we may deliver blood-based phospholipid biomarkers of early disease that could identify patients who are at high risk for progression. An easily recorded blood-based indicator of early retinopathy may also improve access to care. Prevailing wisdom surrounding prevention of microvascular disease with aggressive glycemic control must be balanced by concerns for increased mortality associated seen with these measures (23, 24). Moreover, because current treatments do not ameliorate diabetic eye disease in many patients (25) and because there are increasing concerns with the safety of currently-used agents (26, 27), lipid-based therapies offer an attractive alternative approach to therapy for this intractable disease."
"9224985","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) effectively controls HIV-1 infection, it has several limitations including uncomfortable side effects, low accessibility, and high cost. The development of a sterilizing or functional cure would address many of these limitations. The primary obstruction to a cure is the presence of persistent, replication-competent HIV in patients on ART. Recently, several clinical trials have shown that they can target persistent HIV with small-molecule inhibitors. However, most of this work has focused on virus that is pharmacologically easily accessible in the circulatory system. The next important step is to specifically determine where reservoirs of persistent HIV exist in patients on ART so that new therapies can be targeted to these locations. This project focuses on the lymph node follicles, which are a known source of persistent HIV-1. However, the role of the individual cell types in the lymph node follicles in the persistence of HIV is not fully defined. The lymph node follicles contain follicular-dendritic cells (FDCs) that can sequester replication competent virus on their cell surface, which could then potentially infect susceptible follicular T helper cels (TFHs). Depending on whether the persistent HIV in the lymph nodes is primarily seeded by latent HIV proviruses in target cells or whether FDC-associated virions are contributing to persistence drastically affects how future strategies aimed at clearing this virus should be developed. To address this question, we have collected lymph node follicles from study participants on long-term ART and will characterize the morphology of the FDCs and TFHs using microscopy. Then, we will isolate both the FDC and the TFHs using laser-capture microdissection and will use single-genome sequencing and single-proviral sequencing to characterize the virus in these cells and determine whether HIV sequestered on FDCs acts as a reservoir of infectious virus in patients on ART and whether this virus can then disseminate to other known reservoirs of persistent HIV. By defining the role of FDCs in the persistence and dissemination of HIV in patients on long-term ART, this important work will contribute to the development of future HIV eradication clinical trials and allow them to focus and direct therapeutics to the anatomical locations that are the most relevant sources of persistent HIV. Additionally, this project will specifically address the NIAIDs area of emphasis to Cure HIV Infection priority one to determine if additional reservoirs of HIV infection exist."
"9244326","Project Summary/Abstract Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive and fatal disease. Sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling are the major causes for the elevated PVR and PAP in IPAH patients. An increase in cytosolic Ca ([Ca ]cyt) in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) is a major  2+ 2+ trigger for pulmonary vasoconstriction and for pulmonary vascular remodeling due to its stimulatory effect on PASMC proliferation and migration. Abnormally enhanced Ca2+ entry in PASMC because of upregulated expression of membrane receptors (e.g., CaSR) and Ca2+ channels (e.g., TRPC6/C3) contributes to the development and progression of PAH. Downregulation of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel expression and decrease in Kv currents (IK(V)) in PASMC contribute to a) increasing PASMC contraction, proliferation and migration by inducing membrane depolarization that opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and raises [Ca ]cyt and b) inhibiting PASMC apoptosis by attenuating apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and maintaining 2+ high [K ]cyt to inhibit caspases. Enhanced PASMC proliferation and inhibited PASMC apoptosis both contribute  + to pulmonary vascular wall thickening. Our data show that selectively increased miRNAs are involved in posttranscriptionally downregulating Kv channels to stimulate PASMC proliferation and inhibit PASMC apoptosis in IPAH patients. Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein-coupled receptor that can be activated by extracellular Ca2+, is upregulated in IPAH-PASMC compared to normal PASMC. Activation of CaSR in IPAH-PASMC induces receptor-operated Ca entry (ROCE) via diacylglycerol (DAG), while IP3-mediate active 2+ depletion of Ca2+ from the SR results in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Extracellular Ca2+-induced CaSR activation also inhibits Kv channels and activate other signal transduction pathways to induce cell proliferation. The overall goal of this research program is to continue to investigate: i) the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the posttranscriptional downregulation of Kv channels and other K+ channels by miRNAs that are enhanced in PASMC from IPAH patients; ii) the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of CaSR and receptor-operated (ROC) and store-operated (SOC) Ca2+ channels (e.g., TRPC3/C6, TRPV1, Orai1/2 and STIM1/2) in PASMC from IPAH patients; iii) the cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the CaSR-mediated functional activation of TRPC/Orai channels (and STIM1/2 oligomerization and translocation) and functional inhibition of Kv channels in PASMC from IPAH patients; and iv) the potential targets involved in the pathogenic Ca2+ signaling that can be used to develop novel therapy or combination therapy for PAH. Our laboratory has extensive research and technical experience in studying pathogenic mechanisms of IPAH and pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxic lung disease. The forthcoming results from these studies will provide highly impactful insights into developing novel therapies for IPAH and other forms of pulmonary hypertension."
"9278071","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Aims and Rationale: The primary objective of this research is to produce an empirically validated treatment that increases smoking cessation in Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one that can be easily integrated into smoking cessation clinics and/or mental health clinics within Veterans Administration (VA) facilities. PTSD is highly prevalent in the VA patient population and is associated with a rate of smoking (53% - 66%) that far exceeds that of VA enrollees in general (22%). PTSD is also associated with unusually high rates of smoking cessation treatment failure. The disparity in smoking cessation outcomes amongst veterans with PTSD may occur because standard smoking cessation treatment does not address PTSD-specific vulnerabilities. Veterans with smoking-PTSD comorbidity may respond optimally to treatment that addresses PTSD and associated affective symptoms, because such symptoms can both reinforce smoking and undermine quit attempts. Recent evidence shows that behavioral activation therapy (BA), a behavioral treatment that increases engagement in reinforcing activities, significantly reduces PTSD symptoms. BA may improve smoking cessation outcomes amongst veterans with PTSD because it reduces overall PTSD symptom severity and affective distress (low positive affect, high negative affect), which can cause smoking relapse. The proposed research will determine whether BA as an adjunct to standard smoking cessation treatment (ST+BA) is superior to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment + health and smoking education (ST+HSE) in improving smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with PTSD. The HSE intervention is intended to constitute a credible intervention that controls for contact time. Secondary objectives are to determine if BA improves PTSD symptomatology and associated affective distress, and to identify potential mediators of BA on smoking outcomes.  Methods: A total of 120 veterans with PTSD who are motivated to quit smoking will attend an initial diagnostic and baseline assessment session. Those who are interested, eligible, and who provide consent will be randomly assigned to receive ST+BA or ST+HSE and will be contacted by their individual study therapist to schedule the first treatment session. Participants will be stratified into treatment groups based on: 1) major depressive disorder (MDD; present versus absent), and 2) PTSD symptom severity. All participants will receive eight, individual sessions of ST+BA or ST+HSE. All participants will receive 20 minutes of identical standard smoking cessation treatment in each of the eight sessions. Those in the ST+BA condition will receive an additional 30 minutes of behavioral activation therapy; those in the ST+HSE condition will receive an additional 30 minutes of health education and information about smoking. All participants will receive 8 weeks of the nicotine patch. Smoking cessation outcomes will be assessed 2, 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after the quit date.  Significance: This research has important clinical and public health significance because smoking is especially common among veterans with PTSD and it is the leading preventable cause of disease and disability. Reducing smoking rates among veterans with PTSD would result in substantially lower smoking-related illness and death in this vulnerable group of smokers. It would also reduce tobacco related healthcare costs charged to the VA. Study methods and findings may potentially be extended to smoking cessation treatment for patients with mental health disorders other than PTSD."
"9240565","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Malaria is one of the leading causes of mortality in the world. Current therapy for malaria is limited by drug resistance. Toxoplasma gondii is found worldwide and causes devastating eye disease and encephalitis. Current therapy for toxoplasmosis is poorly tolerated and does not eradicate infection from its host. Veterans are exposed to these infections during their military service and new treatments would greatly improve veterans' health. Dr. Doggett and his colleagues have developed new drugs, endochin like quinolones (ELQ) that are highly effective against malaria and T. gondii. He has chosen ELQ-316 as a lead drug because it is orally available, non-toxic and highly effective. Dr. Doggett's preliminary studies in T. gondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that ELQs inhibit the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (cyt bc1).  Dr. Doggett will test the hypothesis that ELQ-316 inhibits cyt bc1 and characterize how ELQ-316 interacts with the cyt bc1. He will also test if inhibiting both active sites of cyt bc reduces P. falciparum's ability to develop drug resistance. Dr. Doggett will test this hypothesis by measuring the rate of resistance against the combination of ELQ-316 with atovaquone and the rate of resistance of ELQ-316 against a P. falciparum clone that has atovaquone resistance. If mutations occur in both cyt bc1 active sites, he will measure the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Dr. Doggett will optimize the administration of ELQ-316 by finding synergistic combinations of ELQ-316 with clinically used drugs against toxoplasmosis and malaria, determining the pharmacokinetics of ELQ-316 orally and transdermally, and developing an ELQ-316 prodrug.  Dr. Doggett is an infectious disease physician at Oregon Health & Sciences University and the Portland VA Medical Center. He is specifically interested in new treatments for neglected tropical diseases that affect veterans. He has carried out research in Dr. Mike Riscoe's lab investigating drug mechanism of action and drug resistance in protozoan pathogens. Dr. Doggett has developed proficiency in the biochemical and molecular methods that are needed for his current research plan. The VA CDA-2 award will provide Dr. Doggett further training in drug mechanism and new training in pharmacokinetics, drug design and computer based molecular modeling. As a part of a robust training plan, Dr. Doggett has selected a panel of senior scientists with expertise in molecular parasitology, T. gondii, Plasmodia, preclinical drug development and S. cerevesiae as a model system. This panel is experienced in mentoring early investigators and will meet with Dr. Doggett formally every 6 months. The panel will provide advice regarding experiments, publications and career development. In addition, Dr. Doggett will attend the Woods Hole molecular parasitology course, attend science courses at OHSU and present his research at conferences. This award will culminate in the establishment of Dr. Doggett's independently funded lab devoted to anti-protozoan drug discovery for veterans and his infectious disease career as a physician with parasitology expertise devoted to the care of veterans."
"9391469","Project Summary/Abstract Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) is a well-studied gene that is known to play a critical role in brain development, neuronal differentiation, survival, and plasticity. Rodent Bdnf consists of nine 5? non-coding exons (I-IXa) and one 3? coding exon (IX). Each non-coding exon has its own unique upstream promoter region, where transcription can be initiated. Through differential splicing, several Bdnf mRNA transcript variants are produced, which all code for the same mature Bdnf protein. The complex structure of the Bdnf gene allows for tight spatiotemporal regulation of its specific variant expression, guided by environmental stimuli. The regulation of Bdnf transcription has been extensively studied, however, no clear mechanism of differential variant induction has been identified and it is still unclear why so many transcripts exist to encode one single protein. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the activity-dependent regulation of different Bdnf transcript variants and the role of specific transcripts in guiding cellular physiology and animal behavior. CRISPR/dCas9 fusion constructs will be used to selectively manipulate the expression of one Bdnf transcript variant at a time in hippocampal cultured neurons. Fused to the catalytically inactive dCas9, effector proteins that promote transcriptional activation, VP64, or repression, KRAB, will be targeted to a specific Bdnf promoter using a short guide RNA (gRNA) to modify epigenetic profiles and alter gene expression. The induction of all Bdnf variants and other plasticity-regulated genes will be analyzed using qRT-PCR and whole-genome RNA sequencing. Furthermore, since Bdnf expression is essential for synaptic plasticity, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices, as well as new memory formation in live animals, CRISPR/dCas9 tools will be used to target specific Bdnf transcript variants in vivo. By selectively upregulating a single Bdnf splice variant, the functional role of individual Bdnf transcripts will be tested for the induction of LTP or contextual memory formation. This study will shine light on the regulation of Bdnf transcript variant expression in neuronal plasticity and assess the therapeutic potential of site-specific epigenome editing of the Bdnf gene in synaptic plasticity disorders using the cutting-edge CRISPR/dCas9 tools."
"9298037","Project Summary/Abstract Many debilitating and costly diseases are associated with inflammation and driven by macrophage signaling. Medical costs attributable to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) alone exceed $22.3 billion annually, and this incurable disease can severely impact patient quality of life, including the ability to work. Existing treatments for RA block macrophage inflammatory cytokine release or function and thereby also suppress antimicrobial immunity; the use of these treatments in patients suffering from infections is therefore problematic. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new therapies that target hypersensitive macrophages contributing to RA without impairing immune function. As a postdoctoral researcher I discovered a mechanism of macrophage signaling, through the protein LynA (but not a closely related protein, LynB), which functions only at sites of inflammation, as in the joints of RA patients, and is not required for antimicrobial immunity. This has led to the hypothesis that inhibition of LynA signaling could be an innovative new approach to relieving the symptoms of RA and other inflammatory diseases without suppressing immunity. LynA and LynB are thought to have opposing functions, with LynA pri- marily stimulating cell activation but LynB primarily initiating negative regulation. Dissecting their independent roles has been difficult, however, because existing Lyn-/- mice lack both LynA and LynB. We propose to overcome this obstacle to discerning the true functions of LynA and LynB in macrophage signaling and in inflammatory disease by generating LynA-/- (LynB-only) and LynB-/- (LynA-only) mice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tech- nology. We will then perform experiments to test LynA and LynB function in macrophages from these mice, inducing antimicrobial signaling and hypersensitive signaling in an inflammatory environment in macrophages lacking LynA or LynB. Finally, we will test the progression of inflammatory arthritis in mice lacking LynA or LynB. We predict that LynA deletion will protect macrophages from inflammatory signaling and protect mice from de- veloping severe inflammatory arthritis, suggesting that inhibition of the LynA signaling pathway in the continued presence of LynB may be an effective strategy for treating autoinflammatory disease. Through the proposed approaches we aim to build the first definitive link between LynA, hypersensitive signaling, and inflammatory arthritis, while generating reagents and data to support a competitive R01 application. LynA-/- and LynB-/- mice will have long-term utility for mechanistic signaling and phosphoproteomics experiments to map unique roles of LynA and LynB in immune-cell signaling. These mice will be useful resources in which to begin the search for novel therapeutics targeting the LynA pathway in RA and other autoimmune diseases. Because this innovative therapeutic strategy is not expected to impair innate immunity to pathogens, it could expand treatment options for patients, make long-term suppressive treatment safer, and prevent disease recurrence."
"9405128","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The accurate distribution of the replicated genome during cell division is crucial for genomic inheritance and cellular fitness. Conversely, disruptios in any of the steps associated with mitosis (the process in which a parental cell divides into two identical daughter cells) are often correlated with disease, especially cancer. The rapidly emerging picture is that mitosis is driven by the intricate balance between cell cycle kinases and phosphatases, especially the ser/thr phosphatase protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). While PP1 itself has a broad specificity, it acts in a highly specific manner by forming stable complexes (holoenzymes) with a host of regulatory proteins that direct its activity and localization. Our lon-term goal is to understand the structural and functional mechanisms that control PP1 activity in health and disease, an area in which our laboratory has made many fundamental contributions. Here we describe a complete research plan to understand the regulation of PP1 in the nucleus. The presented research project uses a powerful integrated approach that combines X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy with biochemical and cell biology experiments to obtain novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate PP1 activity during distinct stages of the cell cycle.  Specifically, we are focusing on the regulation of PP1 by four PP1-targeting proteins: 1) Repoman (recruits PP1 onto mitotic chromatin at anaphase), 2) PNUTS (PP1 nuclear targeting subunit), 3) Knl1 (Kinetochore null protein 1) and 4) the ASPP (Apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein) family of proteins. Abnormal expression of each of these regulators is associated with the increased incidence and severity of multiple cancers. Detailed descriptions of the molecular interactions of these regulators with PP1, which are currently missing, are needed for a comprehensive functional understanding of these important holoenzymes. In our combined efforts, we will: 1) determine the structures of the free form of these PP1 regulators, 2) determine the structures of the PP1 holoenzymes and 3) determine how these complexes direct and regulate PP1 activity. We will then leverage these protein and protein complex structures to elucidate, at a molecular level, the biological functions and modes of action of these key nuclear PP1 holoenzymes. The research described in this proposal leverages the extensive expertise of leading investigators in the PP1 research field, as well as takes advantage of the best possible national and international collaborators. Finally, it has the preliminary data that demonstrates that this work will provide unique, novel insights into the molecular regulation of PP1 and its fundamental roles during distinct stages of the cell cycle."
"9203894","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Globally, transgender (`trans') women have 49 times higher odds of HIV infection compared to other groups and trans women living with HIV (TWH) access HIV care and adhere to medication at significantly lower rates than other at-risk groups. Poor engagement in HIV care for TWH is a result of reduced access to and avoidance of healthcare due to stigma and negative experiences with providers, and occurs in the context of social and economic marginalization that foments unstable employment and housing, familial alienation, limited social support, and substance abuse. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to care are critical to reducing HIV-related disparities and poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable population, particularly where disparities are most apparent, including Brazil. Peer-based navigation (PN) interventions have demonstrated success in improving engagement in HIV care in low-resource settings. Our research group is currently conducting a PN intervention (`I-Care') in rural South Africa that significantly improved both linkage to care and retention for men and women. While the PN intervention addresses HIV care engagement by providing social support and skills to work with health providers and family, it requires specific adaptation and a conceptual model that addresses the unique needs of TWH identified during formative research and in consultations with Brazilian stakeholders in 2015. We propose to develop and conduct a trans-specific PN intervention in Brazil, tentatively named `TransAmigas', which integrates the I-Care approach with the Model of Gender Affirmation (GA), developed by our research team to specifically address HIV prevention and care among trans women. We will use the ADAPT-ITT methodology to develop TransAmigas, incorporating the GA model in the Brazilian context (Aim 1). We will then conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of TransAmigas in So Paulo, Brazil (Aim 2) by randomizing TWH to the intervention (n=100) or to clinical referral (n=50). During the nine month pilot, we will track both navigator and patient adherence to the program, recruitment needs, cohort retention, and reported satisfaction and preferences for program content through surveys at baseline and nine months. Finally, we will prepare for a multi-site efficacy trial (Aim 3) by extracting clinical data from participants' records at the referral clinic, generating preliminary efficacy data by comparing retention in HIV care and viral load by intervention arm. Clinical data will inform future trial sample size. We will implement this study in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where universal access to care and public support for gender transition care provide an enabling environment for this work to be most effective and where the team has established academic partnerships and a collaboration with the State-run reference and training clinical site (CRT), which includes trans-specific clinical services. If feasible, acceptable, and ultimately proven efficacious, TransAmigas will be the first evidence-based HIV care intervention for TWH globally ? filling a crucial gap in programming."
"9404506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phenomenal advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled systematic identification of genetic variants in human individuals, and the recent FDA marketing authorization of the first next-generation genome sequencer signals the arrival of a new era of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. Nevertheless, DNA sequencing alone fails to provide complete information on the genetic makeup of an individual, as two homologous sets of chromosomes are present in the human genome. Delineation of both maternal and paternal copies, or haplotypes, is critical for determining an individual's genetic composition, and for understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. Yet genome- scale haplotyping, or phasing of DNA variants, has long remained an elusive goal. Existing approaches are prohibitively expensive, technically challenging, require specialized instrumentation, or fall far short of reconstructing chromosome-spanning haplotypes. Arima Genomics has recently developed an innovative new approach for whole-genome haplotyping, combining proximity-ligation and DNA sequencing with a probabilistic algorithm for haplotype assembly. This new method, known as HaploSeq, achieves chromosome-spanning haplotypes with high completeness, resolution, and accuracy in mammalian genomes. As a cost-effective, streamlined technology, HaploSeq is poised to underpin a new standard in genome sequencing in biomedical applications and other markets from pharmacogenomics to agricultural biotechnology. The objectives of Arima Genomics' proposed R&D efforts involve improvement of HaploSeq's ability to phase rare variants in human cells by adapting the protocol to achieve more uniform genome coverage, extension of the HaploSeq algorithm's capabilities to provide genotypes concurrently with haplotypes from the same source sequencing data by developing a new smart-mapping computational module, and demonstration and benchmarking of HaploSeq's utility in ongoing next-generation genetic association studies in partnership with clinical research collaborators at UC San Diego. Successful completion of our research aims will contribute invaluable new knowledge to ongoing investigations of how human genetic variation influences the gene regulatory networks involved in cardiac biology and disease, and will substantially advance the capabilities of HaploSeq toward commercial viability in diverse research, biomedical, and clinical sequencing applications. HaploSeq promises to greatly enhance our understanding of human genetics in health and contribute to the realization of personalized medicine."
"9187797","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Podocyte depletion is a major determinant of chronic kidney disease. Because podocytes lack the ability to regenerate, the only way that podocytes can cope with ongoing functional stress is by hypertrophy of remaining podocytes. Currently, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that coordinate this process in acquired kidney diseases. In the current proposal, we identify and characterize a novel podocyte to podocyte hypertrophic signal that is activated by injury and coordinates the podocyte injury response. We recently reported that increased expression of the Rap1 activator inhibitor Rap1GAP rendered genetically resistant podocytes sensitive to injury (J Clin Invest, 2014). Examination of injured podocytes in murine kidney disease models and kidney biopsies from glomerulosclerosis patients revealed that podocyte injury was associated with enhanced Rap1GAP expression and subsequent Rap1 inhibition.  Here, we identify synaptogagmin-like protein 2a (Slp2a), an exocytosis effector molecule, as a direct binding partner of Rap1GAP. Similar to Rap1GAP, expression of Slp2a is massively increased in injured podocytes both in mouse models and in human glomerulosclerosis patients. Our preliminary data in cultured podocytes suggest that over-expression of Slp2a results in a paracrine signal that drives cellular hypertrophy of adjacent cells by a mechanism that requires mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Slp2a in mice abrogates compensatory podocyte hypertrophy after uni-nephrectomy resulting in proteinuria and accelerated glomerulomegaly. We hypothesize that after podocyte injury, increased formation of a protein complex that includes Rap1GAP and Slp2a drives compensatory hypertrophy by stimulating release of podocyte-derived proteins that then activate mTORC1 in adjacent cells. The goals of this grant are to definitively prove the existence of such podocyte crosstalk. In aim 1, we examine the mechanisms of Slp2a-mediated cellular hypertrophy that include proteomic studies to identify the secreted hypertrophic factor. In aim 2, we characterize podocyte hypertrophy in a novel mouse model that allows for stochastic Slp2a expression in individual podocytes. In this way, we will be able to determine the ability of enhanced Slp2a expression to induce hypertrophy both in an individual podocyte and in its neighboring cells. Finally, in aim 3, we build on our preliminary finding that absence of Slp2a in mice abrogates compensatory podocyte hypertrophy. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have defined a novel type of podocyte crosstalk as a mediator of compensatory hypertrophy, the only available mechanism by which podocytes try to adapt to ongoing stressors induced by podocyte loss. This will represent a major step in our understanding of the mechanisms of proteinuria."
"9414125","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the great mysteries in biology is how do certain animals regenerate lost body parts in response to trauma. Few examples of tissue regeneration exist in mammals, and studies of tissue regeneration in non- mammalian species are limited by a lack of molecular tools. This research plan aims to elucidate how mammalian tissue regeneration unfolds in a genetically defined mouse model of tissue regeneration. Aim #1 will determine the cellular basis of tissue regeneration utilizing developmental biology, lineage tracing, and conditional mouse genetics. Aim #2 will determine the role of a specific protein in regulating gene expression and chromatin accessibility during tissue regeneration. Aim #2 will utilize quantitative mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and a new technique to footprint chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq). Successful completion of the proposed aims will greatly advance our understanding of how mammalian tissue regeneration unfolds, and this knowledge may offer insights on how to trigger tissue regeneration in humans and impact future strategies in regenerative medicine.

"9376937","DESCRIPTION: Cross-sectional studies have identified that court-involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) juveniles exhibit similar substance use and HIV/STI risk behavior rates as those detained or incarcerated. Yet, among first-time offending, CINI juveniles, there is a gap in our knowledge about who might develop drug use problems, engage in HIV/STI risk behaviors, have psychiatric difficulties and/or recidivate and what risk and protective factors may be related to their outcomes. The objective of the proposed research is therefore to investigate 24 month trajectories of drug use, HIV/STI risk behavior, psychiatric symptoms, and recidivism from the point of first juvenile court contact among a cohort of 400 first-time offending, CINI juvenile offenders. Specifically, we seek to characterize the two-year developmental course and co-occurrence of drug use, HIV/STI risk, psychiatric symptoms and recidivism in this population and to identify the individual, family and extrafamilial- level risk and protective factors associaed with these outcomes. First-time offending juveniles, ages 13-17, and a caregiver (N= 40 dyads for Phase I pilot study; N=400 for Phase II survey study) will be recruited from the Rhode Island Family Court, Juvenile Intake Department to participate in computerized survey assessments. In Phase I (first eight months of Year 1), 40 juveniles and a caregiver will be randomly sampled to complete the computerized survey measure once (at baseline, i.e., time of first contact with the juvenile court) to allow for pilot testing of sampling methodology and to provide quantitative and qualitative feedback related to survey development, administration and implementation. In Phase II (last quarter of Year 1 through Year 4), 400 juvenile/caregiver dyads (N=800 total) will be recruited (using a systematic disproportionate stratified sampling approach) at baseline and then re-assessed at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months subsequent to the juvenile's first court contact. Biological specimens for juvenile drug use and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) will also be collected at each assessment. Baseline and follow-up data will be used to construct individual and latent class growth analyses to characterize longitudinal trajectories of CINI juvenile's drug use, HIV/STI risk behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, and recidivism."

"9387054","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One major challenge in biomedical research is to leverage advances in genome sequencing into lead therapeutic modalities to treat human disease. This precision medicine approach holds great promise to advance patient-specific therapeutics and to provide highly selective chemical probes of function to study disease biology. In this proposal, we describe an innovative precision therapeutic approach to custom synthesize highly selective and potent lead therapeutics in only disease-affected cells and tissues by using a disease-causing gene product as a catalyst. That is, the disease-affected cell serves as a reaction vessel and a disease-causing RNA as a catalyst to allow for the synthesis of its own treatment. This is in contrast to traditional precision medicine approaches in which both healthy and disease-affected cells are exposed to the therapeutic, potentially causing toxicity due to binding off-targets.  Our technology will be applied to develop compounds to treat and study microsatellite disorders that affect millions of people worldwide and have no known cure. Microsatellite disorders are caused by expanded repeating sequences located in both coding and non-coding regions, with the RNA being a key pathogenic agent. We have previously shown that repeating transcripts are most effectively targeted with multivalent compounds. However, as the compounds increase in valency, their molecular weights increase and their drug- likeness decreases. We therefore recently developed an innovative strategy to synthesize multivalent compounds, from their monovalent components, in cellulo using a disease-affected cell as a reaction vessel and a toxic, disease-causing RNA as a catalyst. We will take these exciting results in new directions and apply them to other debilitating microsatellite disorders including Huntington's disease, various forms of muscular dystrophy, the genetic defect that causes fragile X syndrome (the only known single gene cause of auti"
"9256022","The 2015 WHO guidelines recommend anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected people, and massive efforts to expand ART access will result in >30M adults and >1.7M children on ART by 2020, at a cost of almost US$53B. Consequently, the number of patients prescribed alternative, protease-inhibitor (PI)-based ART following failure of first-line regimens will also increase. Studies of patients on PI-based ART in resource-limited countries have shown high rates of virologic failure at 12 and 24 months on treatment, and patients maintained on failing PI-based regimens accumulate drug resistance mutations (DRMs) that hamper current and future treatment options. Resource constraints often limit the ability to collect genotype information, and genotype-blind drug switching has been shown to be cost-ineffective when compared to stratifying patients based on resistance genotype. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for an affordable HIV genotyping option for patients failing PI- based ART. Focused genotyping could significantly enhance patient care by: 1) optimizing the NRTI backbone in patients failing a PI-based regimen with only NRTI resistance; or 2) preventing ART switches in patients failing without resistance until adherence issues are rectified. Aldatu?s Pan-Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA?) technology is a novel point mutation assay that enables inexpensive and high-throughput focused genotypic resistance testing, and such an approach could be cost-saving for national ART programs. PANDAA compensates for high intra- and inter-patient HIV genomic variability by removing secondary polymorphisms, minimizing their impact on qPCR sensitivity/specificity, and enabling qPCR for HIV genotyping for the first time. Feasibility studies have demonstrated that PANDAA: 1) detects NNRTI and NRTI-resistant HIV variants with >99% sensitivity; 2) is HIV subtype-independent; and 3) can be multiplexed to simultaneously quantify resistance at multiple genomic positions. Aldatu has pioneered the commercial development of PANDAA and established a reagent formulation that allows for the production of PANDAA-based diagnostics in a thermostable, sample- ready format. In this Phase II project, Aldatu will apply the PANDAA technology to the development of PANDAA PIDR+, a rapid, low-cost, thermostable test for detection of drug resistance in patients failing a PI-based ART regimen, which can radically improve clinical decision-making in low- and middle-income countries. Through the aims proposed here, we will 1) experimentally validate the design of PANDAA reagents to quantify mutations associated with protease inhibitor resistance comprising 10% of the viral quasispecies; 2) establish an extensive, collaborative proficiency panel of drug resistant and drug sensitive HIV-1 isolates for PANDAA PIDR+ validation; 3) assess PANDAA PIDR+ using established performance criteria for HIV drug resistance genotyping and produce PANDAA PIDR+ under GMP conditions; and 4) verify that end-user, multi-site implementation of PANDAA PIDR+ is highly reproducible. The first of its kind, a validated, GMP-produced PANDAA PIDR+ test kit from Aldatu will be poised to capture a significant share of this rapidly growing diagnostic market opportunity."
"9392225","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learning processes allow organisms (including humans) to adapt their behavior to changes in the environment, and are thus crucial for survival. However, learning does not take place in a vacuum. Indeed, most learning experiences occur within complex environments composed of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile stimuli. To successfully learn about biologically significant events (e.g., the presence of food or prey) that occur within particular environments, animals must first combine individual features of the environment into an integrated memory, or context representation. Contemporary research suggests that this type of learning occurs within cortico-hippocampal networks in the brain. However, the exact pathways and individual functions of particular regions essential for learning about contexts have not been fully resolved. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the restrosplenial cortex (RSP) is essential for forming integrated context representations, and that the postrhinal cortex (POR) is essential for updating these memories. This proposal addresses unanswered questions about the neural substrates of contextual fear learning (Specific Aim 1). It also addresses the functional role of RSP and POR in the recovery of fear to a previously extinguished fear cue. Fear extinction is context specific, and recovery can result either from re-experiencing the aversive event (i.e., reinstatement; Specific Aim 2) or when a significant amount of time has passed since fear extinction occurred (i.e., spontaneous recovery; Specific Aim 3). In all studies, RSP and POR will be temporally inactivated using a new and innovative technique: Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). This temporary inactivation will allow for isolation of the role of these regions during encoding and/or retrieval processes. In sum, this proposal examines the role of RSP and POR in context learning and fear extinction, two processes that are important in the development and subsequent treatment of several mental illnesses in humans (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder: PTSD; anxiety related disorders, phobias). Further, the RSP is known to be compromised in human disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, investigating the role of RSP and POR, during both fear learning and fear extinction, could prove to be especially informative to clinical practice in humans."
"9317975","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA alphavirus which is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. Infection with this virus causes a debilitating arthralgia and results in death in some people. The virus has acquired mutations in the envelope proteins (E1 and E2) that have allowed for increased transmission by mosquitos to humans in over 40 countries, making this a great concern for public health. There is no current vaccine or specific anti-viral therapy for this disease. The goal of our proposal is to develop novel adjuvant formulations for use with a CHIKV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine expressing key CHIKV antigens, E1 and E2. The adjuvants will contain a synthetic toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist (SLA) and/or a retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I)-like receptor agonist (5'ppp-dsRNA). We first plan to test the stability and compatibility of each of these agonist formulations (containing an oil-in-water emulsion, liposomes, or Alum) with the CHIKV VLP. Those adjuvants that are compatible with the CHIKV VLP antigen will be tested for immunogenicity in the C57BL/6 mouse model. Immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates will be assessed following either a prime or boost immunization. The vaccine candidates will be down-selected using a defined rank-based selection criteria: (1) antibody responses (enhanced neutralizing antibody titers and increased IgG2c:IgG1 ratios); (2) increased B cell and antigen-specific bone marrow plasma cell responses; (3) Increased germinal center responses (and enhanced Tfh cells); (4) increased CD4+ TH1 polyfunctional cytokine responses (including IFN-?, TNF and IL-2); and (5) increased CD8+ T cell responses. In our last Aim we plan to test the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in the arthritic C57BL/6 mouse model, and in a partial type-I IFN receptor deficient mouse model (A129; IFN-?/?R+/-). Finally, we will test two lead CHIKV vaccine candidates in a passive antibody transfer study, where antibodies from immunized mice will be transferred into the lethal AG129 CHIKV infection model (AG129 lack both type 1 and type 2 IFN receptors) to determine whether these antibodies are protective."

"9313438","Abstract  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen of humans. It is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients and a major cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. We are proposing to study Hfq, a highly conserved RNA chaperone that is thought to function through its interactions with small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and mRNAs. We have obtained evidence that Hfq is essential in P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 and that cells containing a deletion of hfq carry suppressors that allow these cells to grow. Here we propose to determine what roles Hfq plays in cells of P. aeruginosa and determine the molecular basis for the essentiality of Hfq in this organism. In particular, in Aim 1 we propose to identify sRNAs and mRNA transcripts that Hfq associates with using RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (RIP-Seq). In Aim 2 we propose to use a ClpXP protease-based depletion system coupled with RNA-Seq to determine what effect Hfq depletion has on transcript abundance on a genome-wide scale in P. aeruginosa. Our preliminary RIP-Seq studies indicate that Hfq associates with the transcripts of several key regulators of virulence gene expression in P. aeruginosa, and as part of the second aim we propose to determine whether this association might exert any regulatory effect at the level of either transcript or protein abundance. In Aim 3 we will identify those mutations that can suppress the effects of a hfq mutation. We will then attempt to determine what effect these mutations have on gene expression in both the presence and absence of Hfq. Our studies have the potential to reveal the basis for the essentiality of a key RNA chaperone in P. aeruginosa. Because Hfq appears to be critical for the growth of P. aeruginosa, the work we propose might aid in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of patients that suffer from P. aeruginosa infections."
"9329592","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twin studies have provided fundamental information about how genes and environment contribute to individual differences in brain structure and cognitive function in health and psychiatric disease and how these influences change during development. Previous twin studies in older children, adolescents and adults indicate that genetic and environmental influences are region/structure specific and change with age. Early childhood is period of rapid structural and functional brain development that is implicated in the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the role of genetic and environmental contributions to brain structure and function in this crucial period of development.  The Early Brain Development in Twins study has been the first, and to our knowledge the only, twin study of early childhood brain development. To date we have enrolled and studied over 275 twin pairs, at birth, 1, 2, 4, and 6 years and provided novel and previously unknown information about genetic and environmental influences on brain development in early childhood. In the next funding cycle, we propose to complete our twin study of early childhood brain development by following the current cohort to age 6. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be done at ages , 4, and 6 years. Cognitive development, including RDoC constructs of language and working memory will be assessed. Additional innovations for this funding cycle include the application of a recently developed methodology for delineating cortical thickness and surface area in very young children, and the addition of resting state fMRI. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, allow us to determine how modifiable abnormal developmental trajectories associated with risk for psychiatric disease may be, and help us determine when in development early interventions would have the greatest impact. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding genetic and environmental influences on early childhood brain development, a period of risk for many neuropsychiatric disorders and will provide the fundamental information critical for developing preventative strategies for these disorders."
"9295172","Project Summary  The glycans that decorate cell-surface glycoconjugates, represent a rich molecular language that mediates a myriad of important biological functions. In bacteria, these glycoconjugates are critical determinants in interactions amongst bacterial communities and between both pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria and human host cells. A major challenge in understanding the roles of complex glycans in bacteria is that the pool of monosaccharide building blocks and diversity of glycosidic linkages reflected in the glycoconjugates is greatly expanded relative to eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, the currently-available glycan-binding proteins, which include lectins and monoclonal antibodies, are simply inadequate for detecting a majority bacterial glycan epitopes. In light of the importance of bacterial glycans in human infectious disease, the development of experimental reagents, as ?glycan readers?, to selectively characterize and monitor pathogen-specific glycan determinants is of utmost current importance. Selective glycan readers towards bacterial glycan epitopes promise to be valuable reagents for identifying bacterial pathogens and understanding the biological significance of glycoconjugates in infectious disease.  In this exploratory research program, we aim to establish proof-of-principle for engineered protein-based glycan readers for the detection and analysis of pathogen-specific glycans and glycoconjugates. This proposal includes two aims. Aim 1 will involve preparation of chemically-defined C. jejuni glycan epitopes, including pseudaminic acid and N-acetyl bacillosamine, which are prokaryote-specific carbohydrates. These glycan epitopes will be armed, via established linker chemistry, with biotin for directed evolution of novel glycan binding proteins, based on the Sso7d scaffold, using yeast surface display. Aim 2 will develop applications of the evolved modular glycan binders using protein engineering approaches, with a focus on utility for the study of disease-related bacterial glycans. In particular, sortase-mediated ligation will be applied for modifying the C- and N-termini of glycan binders to include fluorophores and biotin. These ?glycan readers? will be valuable for applications including glycan array visualization, live and fixed imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and affinity chromatography. In addition, azide-modified glycan readers will be amenable to click chemistry-based conjugation reactions with alkynes enabling, for example, multivalent display to exploit avidity effects."
"9403124","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Successful goal-directed behavior requires the ability to select actions that result in reward and avoid actions that result in no reward, or worse, punishment. In the real world, the rules that link actions and their outcomes often change, such that an action that was once rewarded ceases to be so and vice versa. The ability to update decision-making strategy based on positive or negative feedback is the basis for behavioral flexibility. A balance in the weighting of positive and negative feedback's influence over choice selection may be vital for optimal decision-making. It is believed that in disease such as addiction, the ability to learn from negative feedback becomes blunted and reward-seeking overrides normal decision-making processes (Cox et al., 2015; Parvaz et al., 2015). It is well-known that addiction is associated with lower D2 receptor expression in the striatum (Bowirrat et al., 2005; Goldstein and Volkow, 2011; Besson et al., 2013). Previous data from our lab and others implicate D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in signaling non-rewarded outcomes and promoting avoidance behavior (Kravitz et al., 2012; Tai et al., 2012). However, the causal role of D2 MSNs in learning from positive and negative outcomes remains unknown. Understanding the contribution of D2 MSN activity to behavioral flexibility will illuminate neural circuit mechanisms that underlie impaired flexibility  seen in several psychiatric disorders. I propose to study learning-induced plasticity in the corticostriatal microcircuit to determine if there is a neural signature for behavioral flexibility I will record channelrhodopsin evoked excitatory transmission from the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) to the DMS onto D1 or D2 MSNs following the discrimination or reversal phase in a lateralized two-choice decision-making task (Aim 1). Furthermore, I will compare corticostriatal transmission in adults to juveniles, who enact more efficient reversal learning. Next, I will employ chemogenetic tools to selectively inhibit or excite D2 MSNs during a T-maze based spatial reversal task, a 4 choice nonspatial reversal task, and a probabilistic switching task, tha all require flexible updating of decision-making strategies, albeit across different cognitive domains and time-scales (Aim 2). These data will contribute to establishing the striatal circuit mechanisms that support flexible decision-making and reversal learning. By comparing juvenile and adult mice, these experiments will also help to establish how corticostriatal circuits mature during adolescence to alter decision-making strategies. My sponsors and I anticipate that our highly controlled, sensitive, and cell-type specific experimental data from mice will help the larger health community understand the neural basis of impairments in behavioral flexibility. In addition, it may also illuminate a neural basis to developmental changes learning from positive versus negative feedback."
"9243470","Project Summary/Abstract Title: Volume-based analysis of 6-month infant brain MRI for autism biomarker identification and early diagnosis Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disability, characterized by deficits in social interaction, language skills, repetitive stereotyped behaviors, and restricted interests. Based on a new government survey, it shows 1 in 45 children (ages 3 to 17) are diagnosed with ASD, a significant increase from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's previously estimated prevalence of 1 in 68 from 2011-2013. Volume-based analysis of neuroimaging data is playing an increasingly critical role in adult autism studies, and has revealed widespread structural and functional abnormalities. However, existing volume-based analysis tools developed for adult brains are ill-suited for infant studies, due to great challenges in brain tissue segmentation and ROI labeling, caused by the extremely low tissue contrast. To become an independent investigator on infant neuroimaging research, the candidate proposes in this K01 application to receive training in clinical phenomenology and child developmental cognitive neuroscience of children with ASD, developmental neurobiology and neurodevelopmental disorders, and biostatistics. These training activities will greatly augment the candidate's background in ASD, infant neuroimaging mapping and establish a solid foundation for his long-term goal of being a leading researcher on developing imaging-based early biological markers for autism. In the research plan, the candidate will create a unique suite of infant-specific, volume-based neuroimaging analysis tools that enable accurate characterization of early brain development in autistic infants, as well as improved capabilities in early identification of biomarkers and early diagnosis of at-risk infants. Specifically, a new method for unified skull stripping and tissue segmentation will be developed (Aim 1). Also, a new atlas-guided multi-channel forest learning will be proposed for ROI labeling (Aim 2). With the accurate tissue segmentation and ROI labeling, ROI-based volume measurements will be performed and used to identify early indicators or biomarker of risk for autism (Aim 3). Finally, early diagnosis of infants will be performed (Aim 4). Results from this research will help identify early biomarkers of risk for autism and also design targeted preemptive intervention strategies. All created tools and atlases will be integrated and released freely to the public, such as through NITRC (www.nitrc.org)."
"9195741","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arthropod-borne pathogens account for millions of death each year. Understanding the genetic basis of vector susceptibility to pathogens is pivotal to novel disease control strategies. The hypothesis that induction of apoptosis is a fundamental innate immune response has been supported by virology studies, which demonstrated that the anti- apoptotic activities of many viral genes are essential for their infectivity and/or virulence However, the cellular mechanism mediating the induction of apoptosis following virus infection remained enigmatic. In addition, studies with cultured insect cells showed that either there is a lack of apoptosis, or the pro-apoptotic response happens relatively late, casting doubt on the functional significance of apoptosis as an innate immunity. Using in vivo mosquito models mimicking native routes of viral infection, we found that there is a rapid induction of pro-apoptotic genes (RIPAG) within a few hours following exposure to DNA/RNA viruses. More importantly, using genetic tools in Drosophila, we showed that the RIPAG, and the ensuing apoptosis, is responsible for denying the expression of viral genes and blocking/limiting the infection. Animals with compromised RIAPG are much more susceptible to viral infection than wild type. In this proposal, we seek to unravel the transcriptional mechanisms and the regulatory pathway(s) controlling RIPAG using a combination of Drosophila genetics and comparative genomics. In addition, utilizing the information obtained through the mechanistic analysis, we will test the hypothesis that increased innate immunity against viral infection may be achieved by enhancing the RIPAG response to viral infection. Finally, we assess the fitness of the antiviral constructs we create in Drosophila, then translate the most powerful and most fit constructs to two mosquito vectors and perform preliminary evaluations of transgene effectiveness against Dengue."
"9307294","PROJECT SUMMARY Recently, we demonstrated that the lineage-restricted BROMO and WD40 domain containing epigenetic reader BRWD1 opens Ig? and enables assembly of RAG proteins at J?. We now report that BRWD1 has a much broader role in late B cell development. At distances of up to 5 mb from sites of binding, BRWD1 reshaped chromatin landscape by closing enhancers of genes expressed early in B cell development and opening those of genes expressed in late stages. In the absence of BRWD1, over 7000 genes were aberrantly expressed. While many of these genes were normally expressed in earlier developmental stages, many were also part of the germinal center (GC) transcription program. BRWD1 is first expressed in small pre-B cells. However, Brwd1 expression was much higher in nave follicular (FO) and highest in day 12 GC B cells. In light zone (LZ) cells, BRWD1 is expressed in Myc- cells, a transcription factor repressed by BRWD1. Finally, analysis of genes differentially expressed in GC dark zone (DZ) and LZ, compared to those differentially regulated by BRWD1 in small pre-B cells, predicted that BRWD1 represses the DZ program and induces the LZ program. These data suggest similarities between genetic programs that separate proliferation and Ig? recombination in development and those that segregate proliferation from selection in GCs. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that BRWD1 is required for maintaining FO cell identity. Furthermore, we hypothesize that, by repressing DZ and inducing LZ genetic programs, BRWD1 is critical for GC-dependent humoral immunity. These hypotheses will be tested in the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Derive a conditional allele of Brwd1. Aim 2. Determine role of BRWD1 in maintaining follicular B cell identity. Aim 3. Determine the role of BRWD1 in adaptive immunity."
"9241876","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal for this project is to determine how cleavage of Bcl-xL by caspases contributes to cell death in vivo. Caspase cleavage of cellular substrates is a key event in mediating apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xL is an inhibitor of apoptotic cell death, and can also be a substrate of caspases. Cleavage of Bcl-xL [not only abolishes its anti-death activity] but also convert Bcl-xL from a potent anti-apoptotic protein to  potent pro-death molecule. Cells transfected with the N-terminally truncated Bcl-xL cleavage fragment (?N-Bcl-xL) display accelerated cell death. To probe the in vivo effects of Bcl-xL cleavage, a caspase-uncleavable Bcl-xL knock-in mouse was generated by mutating the two caspase cleavage sites within Bcl-xL. Interestingly, caspase-resistant Bcl-xL mice retain a healthy thymus in old age suggesting that cleavage of Bcl-xL leads to cell death that results in thymic atrophy. My preliminary data suggest that these mice may have defective positive selection (generation of a viable T-cell receptor). Therefore, we will explore the possibility that  caspase-cleavage of Bcl-xL kills developing thymocytes that fail the positive selection checkpoint. By doing so, we will provide mechanistic insights into what is termed death by neglect, the failure of thymocytes to receive survival cues. Because these mice maintain a morphologically normal thymus throughout life, I will determine if they also maintain normal immune responses to influenza virus. Influenza particularly affects the elderly, who display poor T-cell responses to the virus. This is presumed to be because of immunosenescence, in part attributed to thymic atrophy. A long-standing assumption is that thymic atrophy contributes to waning immune responses due to decreased T-cell production, but mouse models to definitively test this hypothesis have been lacking. Therefore, we are in a unique position to determine if preserved thymic function also confers protection from influenza infection in aged animals. We will critically evaluate whether thymic atrophy compromises the immune responses needed to control influenza. These studies will also address the role of thymic selection and T-cell contributions to influenza virus immunity."
"9254240","Project Summary/Abstract  Exposure to high concentrations of Manganese (Mn) can cause irreversible neuronal injury in both adults and children associated with neurobehavioral, motor and cognitive deficits. Our laboratory previously demonstrated using mouse models that inflammatory changes in glial (brain) cells as a result of Mn exposure during development lead to increased susceptibility to neurological dysfunction later in life. Gram-negative bacterial infections from food poisoning, gingivitis and periodontitis are common and can also have severe neurological sequelae, including meningitis, due to circulating levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide/LPS). However, it is not known why infection in some patients progresses to chronic encephalitis and neurodegeneration, whereas other patients recover. It is thought that a background of exposure to heavy metals such as Mn may elevate the risk for more severe neuroinflammatory responses to infection due to increased activation of the inflammatory transcription factor, NF-?B. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that juvenile exposure to Mn potentiates susceptibility to neuroinflammation caused by endotoxin exposures later due to NF-?B- dependent signaling in glial cells that promotes neurodegeneneration and neurological dysfunction in the basal ganglia and other affected brain regions. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis: Specific Aim 1- Determine the role of NF-?B in modulating the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative effects of Mn and LPS during development and aging. ; Specific Aim 2- Determine cellular interactions between astrocytes and microglia that potentiate the effects of Mn and LPS on NF-?B-dependent inflammatory signaling and neuronal injury. Achieving the goals of these aims will help to identify environmental exposures, such as heavy metals found in diet and bacterial infection. This would enable effective preventative measures for such progressive and incurable disorders."
"9261866","Disorders of hemoglobin production are the most common inherited disorders of hematopoiesis, and are a cause of immense human morbidity and economic loss across the globe. Recent advances in gene-editing technology have demonstrated the potential to directly manipulate the endogenous globin locus in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, significant barriers remain for translation of gene editing as an effective therapeutic approach to disorders of globin production, including 1) definition of gene-edited globin locus architectures that support high levels of non-sickling globin production, 2) maintenance of multi-lineage reconstitution capability of gene-edited HSPC, and 3) development of methods for efficient engraftment and selection of gene-edited HPSC. In this application, we propose two coordinated specific aims that collectively address these barriers. Specific Aim 1 will utilize recently published methods for efficient HSPC gene editing to define globin locus architecture(s) that support high levels of erythroid specific globin production and that enable post-engraftment selection of gene-edited cells. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate engraftment and selection protocols for gene-edited HSPC in a clinically relevant macaque autologous transplant model.

"9193087","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many devastating neurodegenerative diseases result from protein misfolding that leads to plaques or inclusions containing the misfolded protein. Despite a recognized central role of protein misfolding, we generally lack insight into the causative molecular events, in part due to the complex etiology of diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Huntington's Disease (HD) and at least eight other neurodegenerative disorders have been traced to a remarkable well-defined mutation occurring across different genes: the expansion of a pre-existing CAG codon repeat. In HD, this leads to expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the huntingtin protein, with expansion beyond a threshold of ~35 Gln leading to a devastating neurodegenerative disease, with the age of onset dependent on the degree of expansion. HD alone places more than 200,000 Americans at risk of disease, with currently no effective curative or preventative treatments. A dramatic improvement in our knowledge of the misfolding pathway is essential to enable the design of treatments that can ameliorate misfolding, disease onset and toxicity.  To address this need, we will deploy state-of-the-art magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. This approach has previously allowed us to characterize various protein aggregates with site-specific and atomic resolution, most recently including an array of polyglutamine-related aggregates. Our past and future success in this endeavor is enabled by an in-depth NMR expertise, exquisite NMR hardware, and highly effective collaborations, which have allowed for key insights into the misfolding process and disease-causing toxicity in HD. Informed by our existing NMR data and mechanistic studies, we hypothesize that there is a critical role for intramolecular collapse into a likely common -hairpin conformation. Crucially, this conformational change facilitates self-assembly of the misfolded polyQ into oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates that likely contain a signature structural motif characteristic of the collapsed initial structure. Thus, by studying the misfolded states, we probe the molecular underpinnings of the misfolding by expanded polyglutamine. Using MAS ssNMR we will both characterize and leverage an unusual spectroscopic signature that we hypothesize to reflect a unique internal polymorphism that is characteristic of misfolded polyQ domains. Applying these methods to different disease-related proteins, we test our hypothesis that a common structural mechanism is at work across the polyglutamine disease family. We will examine diseases where previous work suggests qualitative differences in the misfolded structure (and thus misfolding mechanism), and in HD will examine polymorphic aggregates that reportedly have differing toxicities. This work will provide the much needed systematic and detailed characterization of this family of disorders that will not only benefit their treatment, bt will also impact our understanding of structure and toxicity as applied to amyloid-related diseases with more complex etiologies, ranging from AD to various systemic amyloidoses."
"9239522","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the liver and the third leading cause of death from cancer. However, currently there is no effective treatment for HCC. It is therefore urgent to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of HCC. Increasing evidence suggests that being able to modulate specific miRNAs may lead to the development of novel cancer therapies. Our studies (and others) indicate that a microRNA, miR-26a, represses proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin 6 (IL-6) and its downstream mediator, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), suggesting a tumor suppressive role of miR-26a on HCC development. However, the role of miR-26a in HCC development in the setting consisting of both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in appropriate HCC mouse models has not been determined. Furthermore, whether modulating miR-26a in hepatocytes and/or Kupffer cells can be an effective therapeutic approach for treating HCC has not been tested. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which miR-26a overexpression in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells inhibits HCC development. In addition, we have identified small molecules and developed siRNA/RNA in vivo targeted delivery technology that can increase miR-26a expression in the liver. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of overexpression of miR-26a in hepatocytes and in Kupffer cells on suppression of HCC development. We have generated hepatocyte-specific as well as Kupffer cell-specific miR-26a overexpression transgenic mice. We will use these unique transgenic mouse lines to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which miR-26a exerts its effect on HCC. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of small molecules on miR-26a induction and HCC suppression. We have also developed an innovative siRNA/RNA in vivo targeted delivery technology-- CpG-siRNA/RNA?that enables RNA in vivo delivery into Toll-like Receptor 9-positive Kupffer cells and inflammatory/malignant hepatocytes. CpG-Stat3 siRNA is moving towards clinical trials for glioma and lymphoma patients at City of Hope. We will assess the effect of both CpG-miR-26a and CpG-Stat3 siRNA on HCC development in hepatocytes or/and Kupffer cells in animal models. The proposed studies will not only provide mechanistic insights into pathways underlying HCC but also help to develop effective treatment strategies for HCC."
"9187969","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During development, dendrites and dendritic spines form and turn over dynamically. In adult brains, however, most dendrite branches and many dendritic spines are stable. Defects in dendrite arbor and dendritic spine stability underlie numerous psychiatric and neurological diseases, including late-onset disorders such as schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. I provide evidence in this proposal that loss of the extracellular matrix protein laminin ?5 specifically from excitatory neurons disrupts spine stability, causes dendrite regression during adolescence, and compromises normal synaptic transmission and animal behavior. In my research plan, I propose to identify which synaptic partner produces the necessary laminin ?5, determine when it functions to stabilize dendritic structure and synaptic transmission, and test whether activity changes cause spine stability disruption found in laminin ?5 knockout neurons. Aim 1. To elucidate where the ?5-containing laminin is produced and when it is necessary. My preliminary data show that loss of laminin ?5 specifically from excitatory forebrain neurons causes dendrite loss and synaptic dysfunction in CA1 neurons starting after P21. I also show that adult excitatory neuron- specific laminin ?5 KO mice lack laminin ?5 protein specifically near synapses. Which synaptic partner provides this laminin is a fundamental and unresolved question. Knowledge of its source is critical to understanding how its expression, processing, and secretion are controlled, and ultimately what factors govern dendritic stability. To address this, I will selectively inactivate the lama5 gene in presynaptic (CA3) or postsynaptic (CA1) cells and then measure dendritic arbors, dendritic spine density, and synaptic currents in the postsynaptic neuron. Another critical question is when laminin ?5 functions to control these phenotypes. To determine this, I will use inducible genetic inactivation of laminin ?5 at time points before, during, and after adolescence and then measure dendrite arbors, dendritic spines, and synaptic currents. Aim 2: To determine whether synaptic transmission defects drive dendritic spine destabilization in laminin ?5 knockout neurons. My preliminary studies indicate that acute hippocampal slices from excitatory- specific laminin ?5 knockout mice exhibit increased currents at CA3:CA1 synapses beginning after P21. I also find cultured laminin ?5 KO neurons exhibit decreased spine density, increased spine head width, and increased spine size fluctuations relative to WT neurons. These phenotypes can all be rescued with application of exogenous ?5-containing laminin. A fundamental question that arises from these studies is whether the increased currents at laminin ?5 KO synapses drive the loss of dendritic spine stability. To test this possibility, I will use calcium imaging to test whether rescue with exogenous ?5-containing laminin attenuates calcium transients before rescuing spine fluctuation and also whether restoring WT activity levels restores normal spine fluctuation, density, and morphology in laminin ?5 KO neurons."
"9297007","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Commensal bacteria in the gut have a significant influence on the development and physiology of the brain, indicating their critical involvement in human neurological disorders. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to obtain a basic understanding of the key molecular and cellular processes responsible for the interactions between the gut microbiota and the brain. The current project is based on unique findings in a Drosophila voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel mutant Shudderer (Shu). Shu mutants display severe neurological phenotypes including abnormal wing posture, neuronal hyperexcitability, spontaneous tremors and heat-induced seizures. Unexpectedly, these phenotypes were found to be drastically rescued when the mutants were treated with antibiotics. In addition, Shu mutants showed increased innate immune signaling and abnormalities in GABAergic neurons. The fruit flies carry relatively simple commensal bacterial communities and are amenable to versatile genetic approaches, providing a powerful experimental system to uncover the fundamental biological processes important for host/microbiota interactions. The strong microbiota-brain interactions identified in Shu thus offer an exciting opportunity to advance knowledge regarding the roles and action mechanisms for bacteria-dependent modulation of neural function and behavior. Guided by preliminary results, the central hypothesis for the current project is that severity of the neurological phenotype of Shu is increased by particular bacteria species in the gut, which causes aberrant activation of the host immune system to modify neural development and function. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of particular gut bacteria on severity of the phenotypes of Shu, and 2) Identify the mechanisms by which the gut bacteria modulate the neurological phenotypes of Shu. For Aim 1, Shu mutants mono-associated with particular bacteria species will be generated and their neurological phenotypes will be examined. For Aim 2, immune pathways are genetically manipulated in Shu mutants and the effect on the mutant phenotypes will be investigated. As a consequence of this project, particular bacterial species that significantly exacerbate Shu phenotypes is expected to be identified. A causative relationship between gut bacteria, immune signaling and neural development and/or function is also expected to be revealed. Given that the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the basic biological processes are highly conserved between flies and mammals, the proposed study in Drosophila should provide valuable insights into the effect of the gut microbiota on neural development and function in humans. Such new information is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in etiology and pathophysiology of neurological disorders that are linked to abnormal Nav channel functions, such as epilepsy, autism, migraine, ataxia and pain syndromes, leading to the future development of novel bacteria-related strategies that reduce the burden of patients with these neurological disorders."
"9309675","PROJECT SUMMARY The treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) remains unsatisfactory and presents a major global health and economic burden to individuals and society. Unfortunately, currently available medications are not uniformly effective and are associated with significant central nervous system (CNS) side effects that limit their clinical utility. Translation from preclinical findings to a viable clinical therapy for NP has been fraught with disappointments, possibly because animal studies have primarily relied on outcome measures such as reflex responses that fail to mimic the chief symptom of spontaneous and ongoing pain in patients. Our recent studies suggested that peripherally acting -opioid receptor (MO-R) agonists alleviate mechanical and heat hypersensitivities in rodent models of NP. Here, our preliminary studies also indicate a role for peripheral cannabinoid receptors (CB-R) in NP, and further suggest that both peripheral MO-R and CB-R are valuable targets for alleviating ongoing pain after nerve injury. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that: 1) Activation of CB1-R and MO-R in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) attenuates ongoing NP, and has no significant adverse effects that would suggest CNS penetration, impaired G.I. motility, or undesirable immune effects; 2) Subpopulations of DRG neurons, especially those that express CB1-R, MO-R, and TRPV1, develop spontaneous activity after injury that can be inhibited by peripherally acting CB1-R and MO-R agonists; 3) Activation of peripheral neuronal CB1-R and MO-R decreases nociceptive transmission in dorsal horn neurons; 4) CB1-R agonists enhance peripherally acting MO-R agonist-induced inhibition of NP-related behavior by potentiating MO-R-mediated inhibition of DRG neurons. A broad range of strategies will be used to rigorously test our hypotheses in three inter-related Aims. In Aim 1, the efficacy, receptor subtypes involved, and potential adverse effects of systemic administration of the drugs will be studied. In Aim 2, we will use calcium imaging, patch clamp recording in spinal cord slices, and in vivo dorsal horn recordings to determine the mechanisms by which CB13 and DALDA inhibit ongoing NP in the PNS. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional interactions between CB1-R and MO-R in PNS for NP inhibition. Our study involves comprehensive and innovative approaches including: Operant behavioral tests to reveal the relief of ongoing and affective components of NP, high-throughput Pirt-GCaMP6 calcium imaging of DRG neurons in vivo, peripherally restricted CB1-R and MO- R conditional knockout (cKO) mice using a Cre/loxP system, neurophysiologic recordings in functionally distinct subgroups of dorsal horn neurons (e.g., excitatory, GABAergic inhibitory) identified by fluorescence, and multiplex cytokine ELISA. The results of these studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie the peripheral pain-inhibitory effects of opioids and cannabinoids, and will contribute to the development of novel, translatable therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NP that may be associated with minimal adverse effects. Accordingly, the scientific premise, innovation, and rigor of our proposal are high."
"9188820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is protein-nucleic acid (NA, namely RNA and DNA) structure prediction, for the ultimate goal of rational drug design. Protein-RNA interactions play critical roles in RNA processing, gene expression and viral replication. Screen of compounds that inhibit or promote specific protein-RNA binding and design of short RNA sequences (RNA aptamers) that bind to cancer cell-surface antigens or other disease-associated protein targets have profound applications in drug development. Protein-DNA interactions are essential for transcription, DNA damage repair and apoptosis. Reliable predictive model for protein-NA structures will thus have a far-reaching impact on understanding the fundamental biological processes and on rational design of therapeutic interventions. However, despite the widespread biomedical significance of the problem, computational studies on protein-RNA structure prediction remain very limited. One of the key bottlenecks is lack of large training and testing data sets of experimentally determined protein-RNA complex structures. In this project, we propose to establish a platform service for the protein-RNA structure prediction community by constructing rigorous benchmarking data sets and for the first time, flexible decoys for algorithm development (including parameter training), assessment and systematic improvement. We also propose to develop a new statistical scoring framework for predicting protein-RNA structures by extracting the molecular interaction information from the benchmarks and by accounting for molecular flexibility. The datasets including flexible decoys and the software will be freely distributed to the academic community. The methods will be generalized to protein-DNA structure predictions. We will also test the predictive power of our algorithms by predicting RNA aptamer binding to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Our prediction and rational design of PSMA-inhibiting RNA aptamers will be tested thoroughly through experimental assays. Our ability to predict and design RNA aptamers that bind to cancer cell-surface antigens such as PSMA with high affinity and specificity will have great potential for targeted cancer diagnostics and therapy."
"9317105","PROJECT SUMMARY  A significant limitation in natural product drug discovery is the inability to effectively convert sequence information to new compounds in a rapid and high throughput fashion. The long-term objective of this project is to systematically address this issue with the goal of re-establishing the once vibrant pipeline of environmentally-derived natural compounds, with a special emphasis on discovering new antibiotics. The final vision is the development of a microfluidics biosynthetic platform capable of generality, speed, throughput, and economy in natural product pathway reconstitution and compound discovery. The goal of the current R21 application is captured in the following specific aim: To generate the complex natural product antibiotic erythromycin A using cell-free biosynthesis. By doing so, precedent will be set for the ability to produce such compounds using a purely in vitro approach. This and additional preliminary data collected through the proposed work will then be the basis for continual research towards a cell-free biosynthetic platform capable of precise engineering and ultra-high throughput. As a result, the platform will allow unprecedented access to the broadest range of new chemical entities, including novel antibiotic compounds, while being unencumbered by the constraints of a cellular host."
"9285372","Influenza virus infection causes contagious respiratory illness in humans and animals, and significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Humans fail to make a universally protective memory immune response to influenza A, as Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase, the two immune-dominant influenza A virus-encoded epitopes, undergo antigenic shift and drift, resulting in influenza A strains to which even previously infected humans are susceptible to. In the absence of a universal influenza A vaccine, prophylactic or therapeutic agent, influenza A will remain a significant threat to human health. To generate such agents, we developed a panel of Matrix Protein 2 extracellular (M2e)-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The extracellular domain of the M2-ion channel is an ideal antigenic target for a universal therapeutic agent: It is 99% conserved across influenza A serotypes, has a low mutation rate, and is essential for viral entry and replication. However, less than 20% of infected individuals generate M2e-specific antibodies in response to influenza A infection, perhaps due to M2e's small size and rarity. Thus, we seek to accomplish our long-term goal, to develop a universal prophylactic or therapeutic agent to prevent or treat influenza A infection and associated pathologies, by provision of M2e-specific MAbs, an essential component of a protective influenza A-specific immune response currently lacking in most humans. To achieve this goal, we generated seven monoclonal antibodies specific to M2e, two of which completely protect, and three of which partially protect highly influenza A virus susceptible Balb/c mice from lethal challenge. Based on these considerations, it is our central hypothesis that a cocktail of M2e-specific MAbs can prevent or ameliorate influenza A infection and associated pathology. As antibodies can mediate a variety of complementary effector functions that contribute to host protection, we hypothesize that a combination of M2e-specific MAbs capable of interference with M2-ion channel activity, elicitation of ADCC, phagocytosis and complement activation will be most effective at reducing influenza A virus replication and associated pathology, while preventing immune escape. We expect to test our central hypothesis and to achieve the objective of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1: to identify biological effects of MAb binding on M2e-function and viral replication in vitro; Aim 2: to develop protective and therapeutic MAb treatment regimens in vivo; and Aim 3: to dissect the individual contributions of M2e-specific MAb-dependent cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and complement activation to host protection from influenza A virus infection. To achieve our aims, we have assembled and expert team of collaborating scientists: Dr. Beeton, an expert in the ion channel function; Dr. Tompkins, an expert in animal models of human and zoonotic influenza infection, vaccination, and therapeutics, with specified M2 expertise; Dr. Ross, an expert in the ferret model of influenza vaccination and infection; and, myself, Dr. Paust, an expert immunologist with a detailed understanding of the innate and adaptive immune response to Influenza A infection."
"9299336","The parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum can infect and cause disease in humans, each with specific pathogenesis etiologies. Currently, there are no in vitro platforms for studying the enteric stages of these parasites, in large part because robust methods to expand intestinal epithelial cells from animals that are definitive hosts for these parasites have been lacking. Recently, methods were developed to continuously grow intestinal crypt organoids from human and mouse tissue. We have adapted these methods to isolate and grow intestinal crypt organoids from various large farm and small companion animals that serve as definitive hosts for parasites. These cell lines have expanded over time and have been propagated to high passage number. We intend to characterize these lines for the presence of Lgr5+ crypt cells and other intestinal cell linages, and to develop a 2D growth platform for use in parasite infection and differentiation assays.  Much work has been carried out to understand the biology of the intermediate stages of T. gondii, the tachyzoite and bradyzoite. These culturing methods have allowed researchers to develop an extensive molecular toolbox for Toxoplasma, resulting in an increased understanding of the infectious intermediate stages. As of yet, culturing methods for stages beyond the bradyzoite, the merozoite and sexual stages, have not been developed, hindering the ability to study a large portion of the parasites life cycle. We isolated merozoites for genome-wide expression profiling, showing the unique state of the merozoite stage in context with the rest of the life cycle and identifying merozoite specific genes. This information was vital in allowing us to make a transgenic T. gondii parasite, ME49-MSFp-DHFR-Ty (MSF), which expresses a Ty tagged drug marker only at the merozoite stage allowing for the selection of enteric stage growth in vitro and the determination of merozoite differentiation via expression of the Ty marker. We propose to use this transgenic parasite to infect cat intestinal epithelial cells derived from intestinal crypt organoids, and thus determine if the cell type itself is sufficient for enteric differentiation or if additional cell culture requirements will be needed.  Culturing methods are also limited for Cryptosporidium parvum, and although there have been advances in propagating Cryptosporidium in IFN? -/- mice providing a platform to perform selection and transgenic experiments, an in vitro culture system that allows for the robust expansion of the parasite still does not exist. Using C. parvum sporozoites, we will perform merozoite differentiation assay in organoid derived cow intestinal epithelial cells, determining the growth and or expansion potential of parasites in this platform using IFA or qPCR."
"9241448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG codon expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (htt) gene. Exon 1 spanning protein products, referred to as Httex1 are the major components of neuronal intranuclear inclusions that are the hallmarks of HD. Y-27632, a small molecule inhibitor of the rho-associated kinase (ROCK), was shown by the Diamond lab to reduce Httex1 aggregation in cells and ameliorate Httex1-mediated toxicity in Drosophila and mouse models. Serine-137 of profilin was established as the direct target of ROCK. Phospho-profilin does not reduce Httex1 aggregation whereas unphosphorylated profilin modulates Httex1 aggregation through direct interactions thus explaining the effect of Y-27632. We envisage a direct therapeutic approach that involves the design of molecules to mimic the effects of profilin. Such an approach requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which profilin suppresses Httex1 aggregation, and this is the focus of our proposal. Our goal is to understand how profilin modulates the aggregation of exon 1 of huntingtin through interactions with its polyproline regions. Our approaches will include intracellular assays of aggregation and in vitro biophysical studies that combine fluorescence spectroscopies, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The relevant entity for modulation of Httex1 aggregation by profilin is the 38-residue proline-rich stretch (C38) that is C-terminal to polyglutamine in Httex1. This stretch encompasses two polyproline modules that are connected via a 17-residue flexible linker. Profilin binds to the polyproline modules in C38. Our preliminary data show that in the presence of profilin, a higher total concentration of Htt-NTFs is required to form large spherical and fibrillar aggregates because profilin binds preferentially to smaller oligomeric species. Our preliminary data also establish that the apparent affinity of profilin for Httex1 constructs is higher when compared to C38 alone. This appears to be due to increased avidity that derives from oligomerization of Htt-NTFs in the M-phase. Avidity refers to the increased local concentration of C38 modules within oligomers. We will build on our preliminary data to uncover the mechanisms by which profilin binding impacts the phase behavior of disease- relevant N-terminal fragments of Httex1."
"9317980","Project Summary The premise of this R21 is that we overlooked a dendritic event in our recent, axon-focus study on cerebellar degeneration in the dysmyelinating Shiverer mouse (Joshi et al., 2015). In the Shiverer cerebellum, we found a parallel increase in SNPH and two forms of cerebellar neurodegeneration, Purkinje cell death and axonal injury, and that genetic deletion of SNPH protects both forms of neurodegeneration. Because SNPH is an axon-specific anchor for mitochondria, we focused our 2015 study on axons and proposed that SNPH upregulation at axons causes mitochondrial traffic congestion that first kills axons then secondarily leads to neuronal death. Deletion of SNPH is protective primarily by preventing axonal death. However, when we re- examined the dendritic layers of Purkinje cells in the Shiverer cerebellum intermingled with densely packed presynaptic axons with the expected upregulation of SNPH, we discovered upon careful 3-D confocal examination that SNPH regulation also occurs in dendrites. This is a total surprise, and may constitute the first demonstrated case that this prominent, axon-specific mitochondrial anchor can lose spatial specificity in pathology and intrudes into the dendritic compartment. The goal of this R21 is to examine if dendritic SNPH intrusion has pathologic consequences that independently kill neurons unrelated to axonal injury. In Aim #1, we will use complementary molecular approaches in addition to the standard 3-D confocal methodology to prove that dendritic SNPH intrusion is not an artifact. In Aim #2, we will demonstrate that dendritic SNPH intrusion is not an innocuous epiphenomenon but can sensitize neurons to excitotoxicity. Conclusion - Given the novelty of this discovery we designed the two aims to be very limited in scope: Eliminating Artifact in Aim #1 and Establishing Causality in Aim #2. Success will engender a future RO1 to elucidate mechanisms of how dendritic SNPH intrusion kills neurons, possibly opening up a completely new category of dendritic pathology in the field of neurodegenerative diseases."
"9259429","SUMMARY Therapeutic immune checkpoint blocking antibodies and oncogene-targeted chemical inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape for cancers, and now provide real hope to patients with advanced disease. However, while some patients will experience benefit, others will not respond at all ? a dilemma that is intimately linked to the genetic composition of the tumors. Identification of the molecular processes that enable, as well as preclude, positive responses to such therapies are urgently needed, and are likely to identify rational combinatorial approaches that will improve outcome. For immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the mutational burden in the patients' cancer, through an increased frequency of neoantigen peptides, causes immunogenicity. In order to grow, such antigenic tumors must develop mechanisms that enable them to evade immune-mediated destruction, which makes these tumors vulnerable to immune checkpoint therapies that reverses tumor immune evasion. From our ongoing studies on how melanoma cells elude the efficacy of oncogene-targeted therapies, we have identified an immunosuppressive molecule whose expression levels are directly linked to the tumors metabolic state. While oncogene-targeted therapies tend to cause an increased expression of melanoma antigens, which is triggered by altered metabolic demands and MITF-mediated regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC1???there is a drastic decrease in the levels of this immune suppressive molecule. Hence, these data suggested that increased immune surveillance may intersect with the effects of targeted therapies. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that oncogenic signaling governs transcriptional regulation of transcriptional regulation of this immune suppressive molecule, and that manipulation of its levels alters tumor growth in vivo, associated with changes in tumor immunogenicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that heightened expression of this molecule is correlated with poor prognosis in patients who otherwise would be expected to benefit from immune checkpoint therapies. In this proposal, we will perform studies that dissect the molecular mechanisms that control this immune suppressive molecule's expression levels. We will further assess the degree to which this protein modifies the effects of immune checkpoint therapies, and determine if its prospective use might be used to inform clinical decisions. Successful completion of the proposed studies should improve clinical management and propose combinatorial targets for investigation. "
"9312992","Candida albicans is the most common cause of mucosal and systemic fungal infections in humans and is frequently responsible for hospital-acquired bloodstream infections. There is an urgent need to improve the therapeutic management of C. albicans infections, since current antifungal drugs have limited effectiveness and drug-resistant strains are emerging. The pathogenic effects of C. albicans are caused by its ability to grow in the host and disseminate to internal organs. Central to these processes is the plasma membrane, an essential barrier that mediates a broad range of functions that are critical for virulence. These functions include cell wall synthesis, secretion of virulence factors, morphogenesis, and nutrient uptake. The importance of the plasma membrane for virulence is underscored by the fact that it is directly or indirectly the target of the currently used antifungal drugs. Recent studies have revealed that the fungal plasma membrane is divided into distinct subdomains, including the punctate patches termed eisosomes. These 300 nm-sized domains contain integral membrane proteins, such as Sur7, and an adjacent complex of >20 peripheral membrane proteins including Pil1 and Lsp1 that promote formation of eisosomes. Our recent studies showed that Sur7, Pil1, and Lsp1 are the key players in the eisosome, as their mutation causes multiple defects including impaired cell wall synthesis, abnormal morphogenesis, and increased sensitivity to stress, oxidation, and antifungal drugs. Therefore, the Aims of our current proposal are to determine how eisosomes regulate three functions that are required for virulence: (Aim 1) cell wall synthesis and invasive hyphal morphogenesis, (Aim 2) resistance to different types of stress including copper and high temperature, and (Aim 3) a novel antioxidant pathway we discovered that protects the plasma membrane from oxidation and is needed for virulence. The proposed studies will identify novel drug targets and increase our understanding of the effects of current antifungal drugs. Defining eisosome function in C. albicans will also provide a model for the role of these plasma membrane domains in other pathogenic fungi."
"9300369","PROJECT SUMMARY  Majority of the newer vaccine initiatives against intracellular diseases (such as TB, AIDS and malaria) are hinged on the induction of robust multimodal protective immunity, comprising both long-lived memory B cells and T cells. Memory CD8 T cells (or cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTLs) possess the highly desirable, distinctive ability to mount rapid clonal cytotoxic attack against infected target cells ? a key attribute for swiftly culling secondary infections. Hence, optimal quantity and quality of memory CTLs at the portals of pathogen entry and sites of infection are important goals of vaccine-induced immunity.  In recent investigations of how functionally potent, long-lived memory CTLs develop, we made a surprise finding ? we discovered that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are vital for optimal development of durable, potently protective memory CTL pool. It has been long believed that, ensuing pathogen clearance, conversion of effector CTLs into memory is an ?autopilot program? involving passive shutdown of ?killer? programs and progressive acquisition of cardinal memory properties over time. While lack of TCR stimulation is essential for development of long-lived protective CTL memory, our studies showed that Tregs play a critical role in the process of effector-to-memory conversion. We found that Tregs were necessary for mediating shutdown of CTL effector program and for metabolic reprogramming of memory-fated CTLs into a quiescent state. Thus, both quantity and quality of memory CTLs were compromised upon loss of Tregs during memory conversion. Conversely, enhancing Treg numbers or function during the effector-to-memory transition phase led to improved quality of infection-induced CTL memory. Together, these data led us to hypothesize that timely targeting of Tregs during effector-to-memory transition may represent a novel adjuvant strategy for accelerating and possibly enhancing vaccine-induced protective CTL memory by promoting effector program shutdown and preserving metabolic fitness.  In this developmental/exploratory R21 proposal, we will establish a clear correlation between extent of effector program downregulation, metabolic fitness and protective capacity of memory CTLs. This effort is expected to define an objective new benchmark with strong vaccine efficacy predictive power. We will further explore Treg-mediated downregulation of CTL effector program and metabolic switch as a potential adjuvant strategy for augmenting protective CTL memory during immunization with a variety of candidate viral and bacterial vaccine vector platforms. Systematic exploration of strategically-timed Treg- manipulation to enhance the functional quality of vaccine-induced CTL memory represents a novel adjuvanting strategy that bears relevance to situations where accelerated protective immunity is desirable, such as in cases of childhood vaccinations, infectious disease outbreaks and urgent deployment of troops to disease endemic areas."
"9198553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World Health Organization cites multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria as one of the top three threats to human health. Unfortunately, antibiotic development has essentially ground to a halt thanks to these rapidly emerging resistant strains. No one wants to invest in a therapeutic with such a short shelf life. The need for a viable, broad treatment strategy is overwhelming. The only new classes of antibiotics introduced in the last twenty years are active solely against Gram-positive bacteria and resistance to these is already endemic. And that's the good news. Much worse, there have been no real advances in treating Gram-negative infections whatsoever. Clinicians have adopted the following mantra: for the treatment of Gram-positives we need better drugs; for Gram-negatives we need any drugs. Without a deeper understanding of the bacterial resistance/persistence and transmission mechanisms, along with the development of new approaches to combat these MDR pathogens, countless people will die. Our studies have two aims. First, we would like to better understand the protective mechanisms that bacteria employ to overcome antibiotics and the host immune response. Second, we would like to impede these mechanisms using small molecule intervention. During the last funding period we elucidated functional processes and molecular recognition characteristics of proteins involved in a variety of bacterial responses, including biofilm formation and environmental sensing. These studies were aimed at identifying druggable points in signal transduction pathways. As a result of these efforts, we were able to develop an arsenal of compounds (referred to as 2AIs) that re-sensitize MDR bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) to current antibiotics. We have demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds against 20-plus bacterial strains. Here we will characterize a complete signaling pathway responsible for biofilm matrix production in order to determine sites for possible therapeutic intervention, elucidate the mechanism of action of our 2AI compounds, develop improved 2AI compounds and evaluate lead 2AIs to act as adjuvants to current antibiotics in an animal model."
"9197692","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an untreatable inherited adult onset neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion in the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the Huntington (Htt) protein. The polyQ expansion makes mutant Htt (mHtt) prone to aggregate, but the relationship between aggregation and neurodegeneration has been difficult to understand. In the previous funding period, we invented a new imaging platform to study a neuron model of HD and discovered that the aggregation of mHtt into visible deposits called inclusion bodies (IBs) appears to be a coping response. Recently, we developed new methods to study neuronal protein homeostasis in the context of mHtt in live neurons. Surprisingly, we showed that neurons recognize and target mHtt for accelerated degradation in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, we found that the protein homeostasis and clearance capacity of different types of neurons varies and significantly predicts their susceptibility to mHtt. We discovered that a major protein clearance pathway called autophagy is differentially regulated in neurons. We found small molecules that stimulate neuronal autophagy and showed that they lower mHtt levels and protect them from neurodegeneration. These findings have led to the overarching hypothesis that motivates this proposal: the demand made by aggregation-prone mHtt on the protein homeostasis network of susceptible neurons exceeds their capacity leading to neurodegeneration. In the first Aim, we will investigate how neurons recognize and respond to misfolded protein. The highly conserved heat shock response mediates responses to misfolded proteins in most cells, but it seems different and ineffective in neurons. In Aim 2, we will test two major hypotheses about how protein dyshomeostasis leads to neurodegeneration-that inadequate capacity created by the demands of mHtt (1) leads to cell-wide protein misfolding and deleterious loss-of-function of metastable proteins or (2) a competition for flux through critical clearance pathways such as mitochondria and accumulation of substrates, such as dysfunctional mitochondria. In Aim 3, we propose to adapt our powerful in vitro single cell longitudinal methods to study neuronal protein homeostasis and Htt metabolism in vivo. The results could help validate the protein dyshomeostasis model of HD and lead to new therapies."
"9255526","ABSTRACT  The estimates of natural product producing gene clusters within the genomes of microorganisms are far greater than the number of known natural products, indicating that there is a wealth of untapped molecules within these organisms that offer huge potential as leads for new medicines. Unfortunately, the prevailing paradigms for natural product discovery are ill suited for accessing this bounty of molecules, providing a rate of discovery that is unacceptable in the modern era. There is, therefore, a significant gap between the potential of microorganisms to deliver new natural products and our ability to access this potential effectively. To bridge this gap, Microbial Pharmaceuticals is developing the next-generation technology that will deliver unparalleled access to these compounds and the means by which they can be characterized and put to use.  The long-term goal of Microbial Pharmaceuticals is to provide a complete roadmap of secondary metabolism within actinobacteria?known to produce the greatest numbers of natural products?by conducting metabologenomic screening of 10,000 different strains. The data generated from this process will provide all expressed metabolites and their coupled biosynthetic gene clusters, while the large scale of this effort will overcome the ?cryptic? gene cluster problem faced by approaches that only investigate a few strains.  Microbial Pharmaceuticals will optimize our metabologenomics data acquisition platform (Aim 1) and simultaneously improve upon our correlation algorithms (Aim 2). Optimization of the platform to allow rapid and reproducible data acquisition will be achieved using UPLC and high-mass accuracy mass spectrometry with the goal of decreasing cost and increasing the rate of acquisition (Aim 1a). This process will be piloted on 50 new bacterial strains and the data incorporated into a database of known and new natural products (Aim 1b). The successful outcome of Aim 1 during Phase I will lay the significant groundwork to achieve our long-term future goal of screening 10,000 strains cheaply and efficiently. We will also implement an MS2 networking feature into the metabologenomics database (Aim 2).  The combination of metabologenomic data from the 50 strains investigated, coupled to the improved correlations, will provide a plethora of new molecules that may be accessed in a deterministic fashion. By operating in a fundamentally new modus operandi, a steady stream of high value compounds will emerge, which have been honed by nature over millennia for activity in complex biological systems."
"9258799","Abstract 48,960 new cases of pancreatic cancer were predicted for 2015 and despite extensive treatment options, the 5 year relative survival rate has consistently remained below 8% for the past 40 years. Current treatments are non- targeted agents with inherent side effects and only prolong survival on the order of months. Kras is mutated in over 90% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer. Under normal conditions, Kras is a tightly regulated signaling protein that can toggle between active and inactive states to control cell proliferation. Mutated Kras (G12D) predominantly remains active, thus, constitutively promoting proliferation and tumorigenesis. Studies that target downstream pathways of Kras, Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT, have had some preclinical success but minimal clinical impact on pancreatic cancer. Therefore, it remains possible that other undiscovered protein-protein interactions exist, including transient ones. This study aims to identify such interactions via cutting edge proteomics technique, BioID (a promiscuous biotin ligase). Firstly, BioID fusions to wild type and mutant Kras will be expressed in mouse tumor cells and human pancreas cell lines to differentially label local proteins, and thus identify context specific interactors of Kras. The relative amounts of proteins will be measured using mass spectrometry and western blot analysis. Preliminary data in murine cells reveal that Rab42 is a major Kras effector. Secondly, depletion experiments of this protein of interest will be performed to study the role of Rab42 in proliferation, transformative potential, EGF dependency, tumorigenesis, and invasive potential in vitro. The role of Rab42 in tumor initiation and engraftment will be determined in vivo with orthotopically grafted organoid (OGO) mouse model. This proposed study will identify mutant specific Kras effectors and hopefully lead future studies to novel therapeutic targets for mutant Kras- driven PDAC. Knowledge that comes out of this study may also shed light on other Kras mutant cancers such as lung and colon adenocarcinoma."
"9257259","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although current research indicates an important role for sleep disturbance in the pathophysiology of PTSD, our understanding of PTSD-related sleep physiology is based primarily on studies of male subjects (8, 9, 15). This is highly concerning: evidence of gender differences in neurobiology and behavior suggests that research on sleep in males with PTSD may not pertain to females (12, 16-18). Dr. Richards proposes to examine sexual dimorphism in PTSD by examining sex differences in the role of REM sleep on a fundamental component of the disorder: negative emotional memory. Strong evidence indicates that REM sleep plays an essential part in consolidating memory for negative emotional stimuli (6, 11, 20-22). Research also indicates that women have better recall of negative emotional material than men (12-14). Surprisingly, such research has not been conducted in PTSD subjects. Dr. Richards recently published findings showing increased REM sleep in women with PTSD which has potential relevance for explaining sexual dimorphism in memory mechanisms in PTSD and increased PTSD risk in women. Dr. Richards' long-term objective is to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD in both men and women. Her current objective is to examine the contribution of REM sleep to PTSD disease mechanisms in male and female subjects. She expects that insights gained from her research will ultimately contribute to the development of targeted treatments for PTSD symptoms in both men and women. She will benefit from exceptional training resources at UCSF, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Stanford University and the San Francisco VA Medical Center and an outstanding team of mentors within the VA to develop her expertise in a unique area of inquiry: the measurement of sex differences in PTSD-related sleep physiology and their relationship to negative emotional memory. Her research will build on solid clinical experience with male and female veterans, on the research training and experience she acquired during public health and psychiatry residency training, and on her PTSD and sleep research as a VA staff psychiatrist under the mentorship of Dr. Thomas Neylan. The Stress and Health Research Program, directed by her primary mentor Dr. Neylan, and her co-mentor Dr. Daniel Mathalon, will ensure the adequacy of staff and equipment resources to accomplish the proposed objectives. The San Francisco VA Medical Center will provide the necessary sleep laboratory space. The research study will assess the relationship of sex and REM sleep on negative emotional memory in subjects with PTSD and age- and sex-matched trauma-exposed PTSD-negative controls. Twenty (20) male and 20 female veterans with PTSD and 20 male and 20 female controls between the ages of 18 and 40 will be enrolled. All participants will participate in a sleep laboratory admission involving an adaptation night and a night of undisturbed sleep. A subsample of forty participants (10 in each group) will participate in a second admission involving a REM-deprivation condition, in a counter-balanced cross-over design. The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) will be used to assess recall of negative emotional images in the undisturbed sleep and REM-deprived sleep conditions (23). Subjective arousal responses and the late positive component (LPC) of event-related potentials (ERPs) will also be used to study emotional arousal reactions to IAPS images and to compare the impact of arousal on memory across groups. Sleep of female subjects will be studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Her primary hypotheses examine the relationship of sex and REM sleep with consolidation of negative emotional memory in male and female PTSD and control subjects. Her secondary hypotheses examine sex differences in negative emotional memory following REM-deprivation sleep in PTSD and control subjects."
"9385461","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In its most recent research plan, the NHLBI's National Center for Sleep Disorders Research identified the need to train investigators as its highest priority. The Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine Program for Training in Sleep, Circadian and Respiratory Neurobiology, based at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has been addressing this need since 1998 and has been modified to address the new challenges in our field. This program provides structured, comprehensive research training to prepare outstanding individuals for academic positions in the broad field of sleep science and sleep medicine. For each trainee, the training program consists of core required courses and activities, elective courses and activities, and an intensive research experience. Cross-disciplinary and translational research is a highlight of this program, and formal mentoring and tracking components are integral features. Intensive research training experiences are available across the breadth of sleep, circadian and respiratory neurobiology areas, including basic as well as clinical and translational research opportunities, with several program projects that span multiple laboratories and institutions. There are 15 Full Preceptors with extensive experience and demonstrated success at training pre- doctoral and post-doctoral fellows, well-funded research programs (training faculty have current research support totaling over $25 million of direct costs per year), and outstanding resources that trainees will utilize for research. In addition, we have 11 Associate Preceptors who also oversee our trainees, and are actively being trained to be our next generation of mentors. Our training record over the past decade reveals the success of our efforts to train leaders in academic sleep science. Of our pre- and post-doctoral trainees funded by this training grant over the last 10 years, >80% have remained in academic medicine (still in academic training or now in faculty positions). More than 40% of those still in academic medicine have already received external grant support as PI or Co-I with the remainder well on their way to independence. Funds are requested to support four pre-doctoral graduate students, three pre-doctoral short-term summer minority medical students and eight post-doctoral trainees. Based on our highly completive application process, we are confident these slots will be filled by outstanding future leaders. This formal program has grown and been refined over the decade since inception, and meets a nationally recognized need to increase the number of highly qualified investigators in sleep science and sleep medicine.

"9408489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals demonstrate marked differences in behavioral responses. Even within genetically similar inbred mouse strains, individuals vary in their responses to behavioral tasks and stressors. Underlying this behavioral variation is tremendous diversity at the neuronal level. There may be as many as 10,000 different types of neurons, which can differ in structure, molecular make-up (e.g., expression of different combinations of ion channels), and connections to other neurons. This heterogeneity arises from only ~30,000 genes and determines how neuronal circuits operate; however, the source of such neuronal diversity remains unclear. DNA recombination has been proposed as one source of such diversity. LINE-1 (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements 1; L1) retrotransposons are active elements in the genome that can mobilize in germ cells and neuronal precursor cells. When mobilized, L1 retrotransposons may alter gene expression, potentially supporting neuronal heterogeneity and individual variations; however, the functional role of L1 retrotransposition remains largely undetermined. Focusing on both embryonic and adult L1 insertions, this proposal will address the hypothesis that L1 retrotransposition contributes to individual differences in behavioral and neuronal phenotypes. Aim 1 will determine how environmental experience may modulate L1 activity. Aim 2 will develop transgenic and pharmacological approaches to attenuate L1 activity. And finally, Aim 3 will investigate how attenuating L1 retrotransposition influences behavioral responses and neuronal phenotypes in response to salient environmental experiences."
"9397684","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Training in Emerging Multidisciplinary Approaches to Mental Health and Disease (TEAM HEAD) represents the evolution of a ten year old training program that has focused on training postdoctoral fellows in the area of psychiatric genetics. This renewal application contains several substantial changes and improvements. First, we are proposing a change of leadership. Specifically, Drs. Abraham Palmer and Nancy Cox (multiple-PIs) will replace Dr. Elliot Gershon, who has served as Program Director for the last 10 years. Dr. Gershon, who is now in his 70s, continues to run an active research lab, but is stepping down as Program Director. He will remain on the executive committee and will provide advice to Drs. Palmer and Cox to assure a smooth transition. Dr. Nancy Cox has been a co-I since the training program's inception and will be particularly involved in determining the program's curriculum; Dr. Palmer will also have significant intellectual input and will be responsible for day-to-day operations. Second, for the past ten years this training program has only had two postdoctoral slots, making it unusually small and preventing it from obtaining a critical mass. Thus, we are proposing to substantially expand the program by increasing the number of postdoctoral slots from 2 to 4. Furthermore, we are adding four slots for graduate students, who will apply for support at the beginning of their second year, once they have joined the lab of one of our training faculty and selected a project that is within the scope of this training program. Third, the focus of the training program has been broadened and refocused with an eye towards meeting the demands that the next generation of scientist will face in the coming decades. For example, there is a much greater emphasis on statistical and computational approaches, which is complimented by close integration with a recently funded Conte Center for Computational Systems Genomics of Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes and the developing Grossman Institute. Additional training faculty, particularly from the Department of Human Genetics, have been recruited to meet the new goals of the program. The overall size of the training faculty has almost doubled as a result of these changes.  Students will be supported for 2 years. The number of slots is based on the extremely high quality pool of applicants at both the pre- and post-doctoral levels. Pre-doctoral students will be drawn from a variety of relevant departments and graduate programs. The University of Chicago provides a unique environment with a long history of interdisciplinary collaboration that will benefit the trainees. The scientific interactions among the trainees will be extensive, and will be enhanced by inclusion of a larger cohort of both pre- and post-doctoral students. Formal mechanisms will include student work-in-progress and journal club presentations, trainee- invited speakers, and didactic classes that will be re-structured as full-day retreats and will include a social luncheon. Expanded and appropriate efforts will be made with regard to recruitment of underrepresented minorities and training in ethical conduct of research."
"9193603","This project will design retrospective histories that capture the most relevant circumstances in which PSID respondents lived during their childhood years. These circumstances will include aspects of their economic i life including periods of deprivation, their family life and any reasons for family dysfunction, history of arrests and convictions, their friendship networks, and school experiences. Traditionally, PSID has relied on one respondent to report on both spouses. In this project I will analyze the congruency of proxy and self-reports by comparing spousal and self-reports of the same histories. Building on my past research, I will use this enhanced PSID data to examine impacts of early life conditions including childhood mental and physical health on salient later life adult outcomes spanning adult mental and physical health and socioeconomic status (SES) including levels and trajectories of education, family income, household wealth, individual earnings, labor supply, and the propensity to stay and remain married. The project will also investigate possible determinants of childhood mental disorders including issues in the family, the schools, and social networks."
"9300114","Candida albicans is among the most common causes of fungal infections in humans. Candida causes oral infections in immunocompromised people such as those with AIDS, and it can cause even more serious invasive bloodstream infections in neutropenic patients such as those undergoing cancer chemotherapy and organ transplants. Although there are three classes of antifungals to treat invasive fungal infections, a combination of drug resistance and toxicity limit their effectiveness. Thus, there is a need for new classes of antifungals. The Cho1 phosphatidylserine (PS) synthase represents a potential new drug target for three reasons: 1) Loss of PS synthase blocks virulence, and causes clearance of the fungus in mouse models of systemic or oral infection. 2) PS synthase is not homologous to mammalian (i.e. human) PS synthases, which use a different mechanism to synthesize PS. Mammalian PS synthases exchange head groups from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) for serine to make PS. Fungal PS synthase condenses cytidyldiphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and serine to make PS. 3) Fungal PS synthases are conserved in all fungal pathogens, so PS synthase inhibitors could be broad spectrum. One approach to developing enzyme inhibitors is to look for competitive inhibitors of the enzyme's natural substrates. This approach would be enhanced by a more comprehensive understanding of Cho1's interactions with its substrates: CDP-DAG and serine. Elucidation of the binding motifs for both substrates would allow us to better design potential competitive inhibitors, such as serine analogs, to act as lead compounds for antifungal development. A common CDP-binding consensus motif that is present in CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases is [D-(X)2-D-G-(X)2-A-R-(X)8-G-(X)3-D-(X)3-D], and this is found in Cho1. However, the serine-binding motif for Cho1 is unknown. Using homology sequence alignments and computational tools that superimpose Cho1 on the solved structure of a prokaryotic CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase, a putative serine binding motif was identified. Two aims will be pursued to confirm the CDP-DAG binding motif and discover the serine-binding motif. Aim 1. Genetic analysis will be used to identify residues important for substrate binding in Cho1. Based on the known CDP binding motif, alanine-scanning mutagenesis will be used to test the importance of this motif in PS synthesis. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis will also be used to test the function of the putative serine binding motif. Aim 2: Chemical cross-linking with serine analogs will be used to identify the serine binding domain. In a less-biased biochemical approach, serine analogs have been synthesized that compete with native L-serine for PS synthesis. This set of analogs will be further developed and used to cross-link the substrates to the PS synthase, and follow this with mass spectrometry to identify amino acids with which they interact. Interacting amino acids will then be genetically analyzed using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. "
"9401820","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Without any successful drug trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment and proven efficient therapies for AD, early detection of AD in asymptomatic or prodromal stages is critically important in order to increase chances of reducing irreversible brain damages, slowing down disease progression, and producing better results in any intervention trials. Several biomarkers from MRI, PET, CSF, and peripheral blood show their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic response biomarkers. Among them, blood-based biomarkers, especially proteomic analytes from peripheral blood have great potential as AD screening tools due to its minimal invasiveness and easy access of collection method and would have an extraordinary impact on research and eventually clinical care to facilitate the investigation of early intervention. During the last couple of years, many studies have been performed to investigate the direct relationship between a set of measured plasma (serum) proteomics analyte levels and a set of AD relevant phenotypes using various assay technologies. Due to several technical challenges related to sample collection, storage and assay, previous studies couldn't fully investigate the potential of plasma proteomics data, resulting in relatively weak replications. Beyond these technical issues, previous studies to date overlooked two very important factors: influence of genetic variations associated with each protein analyte and correlational structure of multi-analyte proteomic data. Recently we have shown that genetic variation substantially influences plasma proteomic analyte levels independent of disease status. Therefore, in assessing the diagnostic and prognostic significance of proteomic data, gene variants should be taken into account. Another potential reason of weak replication could be relative weak diagnostic power of individual analytes because the majority of investigation focused on the effect of each measured protein analyte level on a set of given phenotype. In many cases, multianalyte molecular biomarkers are correlated with one another and most of studies using plasma proteomics analytes did not consider correlational structure among analytes when assessing their diagnostic potential. Although the diagnostic power of individual analyte can be weak, multivariate approaches to identify a set of biologically meaningful ensembles of analytes may better elucidate diagnostic and prognostic power of plasma proteomic signature. In this proposed study, we will address these two knowledge gaps in assessing potential of plasma proteomic analytes through a multivariate approach by applying advanced analytic methods including multi-dimensional data reduction, gene pathway-enrichment analysis, imaging genetics, and supervised and unsupervised learning. Results of this project could have a transformative impact on identification and evaluation strategies of proteomic analytes as diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic response biomarkers and proposed advanced analytical strategies can be applied to fluid-based multi-analyte data for various neurodegenerative disorders in addition to AD."
"9259478","Project Abstract 5-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a product of AdoMet mediated polyamine synthesis. 5-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is the sole enzyme to metabolize MTA in humans, producing adenine and methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P). These are salvaged in the methionine and adenine salvage pathways for resynthesis of AdoMet. Previous transition state analysis of MTAP has led to the design and synthesis of powerful transition state analogue inhibitors of MTAP. They show selective anti-cancer effects in human cancer cell lines in culture as well as in mouse human cancer xenografts. A sensitive, continuous assay for characterizing MTAP catalytic activity is needed and will be developed. We propose a new assay with an alternative substrate, 2-amino-5-methylthioadenosine (2AMTA), to yield an intense fluorescent product that can be precisely and continuously quantified. This new technology will provide an accurate method of characterizing kinetic properties of MTAP. It is also applicable to bacterial enzymes using MTA as a substrate. We will further assess MTAP transition state analogues as anti-cancer agents. We will use a mouse model of human Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), APCMin/+, to determine the efficacy of MTAP transition state analogues as treatments for spontaneously forming cancers in immunocompetent mice. Analysis involves potential delay of disease onset and a test of disease reversal based on early and late treatments. Progression of disease analysis uses microPET live-animal imaging. Finally we will solve the transition state structure of human methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT) enzymes, with the goal of setting the foundation for future transition state analogue design. MAT2A, the cancer-cell specific MAT isoform, is upregulated in FaDu cells made resistant to MTAP transition state analogues. We hypothesize that transition state analogue inhibitors of MAT2A will work synergistically with MTAP transition state analogues and will amplify the anti-cancer effects of both therapeutics."
"9402818","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section For many species, access to crucial resources, such as food, protection, and receptive mates, requires a highly coordinated and adaptable system of social behavior. Although the sensitivity of social behavior to previous experience can be adaptive, it also can be detrimental: research has shown that early-life experience, particularly trauma associated with a caregiver, has a unique ability to program social deficits that last well into adulthood.  Data from a variety of species appears to converge on the amygdala as a central mediator of these impairments in social behavior.  However, the specific role of the amygdala in producing social deficits following abuse, or whether this changes over the course of development, remain unclear.  To address this gap in knowledge, and with an eye toward developing interventions, we propose to study social behavior and functional amygdala circuitry in a rodent model of early life abuse. Data from our lab and pilot data collected for this proposal supports the hypothesis that caregiver abuse produces persistent social deficits that emerge at weaning associated with dysregulation of amygdala circuitry, and that a period of environmental enrichment following abuse can prevent the emergence of impairments. Furthermore, the literature suggests a specific role for the basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA) amygdala nuclei in modulating social behavior. To test this, we have measured amygdala activation in rats that were reared in either typical (control) or abusive conditions during tests of social behavior at weaning and adulthood. Next, we will explore the efficacy of environmental enrichment on reversing the effects of early life abuse. Finally, we will dissect the amygdala circuitry causally involved in these effects using optogenetic tools. We have collected data showing that following abuse from a caregiver, peer social behavior deficits will emerge by weaning (PN23), persist into adulthood (PN60) and are linked to changes in BLA function. We hypothesize that 1) enrichment after abuse, but before emergence of neurobehavioral deficits induced by early-life abuse will restore typical social behavior and amygdala function, and 2) targeted optogenetic inhibition of the BLA-CeA circuit will normalize social behavior in abused animals to control levels.  The work proposed here will begin to address the causal role of amygdala circuitry in producing social deficits following abuse and identify interventions to prevent emergence of neurobehavioral deficits following trauma."
"9244438","PROJECT SUMMARY Bioactive lipid mediator signaling systems evolved coincidently with complex vascular, immune and nervous systems of vertebrates. My laboratory discovered the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor and have contributed to our knowledge of how this lipid mediator regulates the vascular and immune systems. S1P receptor is now a target for a drug (Fingolimod/ Gilenya) that is approved for the treatment of relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis. Much effort is directed towards developing second generation S1P receptor- targeted therapeutics for several immune, oncologic and vascular diseases. However, our understanding of how S1P signaling contributes to various diseases is limited and S1P receptor-based therapeutic agents suffer from significant mechanism-based adverse events. This proposal aims to fill the gap in our knowledge about how S1P signaling regulates vascular disease and develop novel therapeutic strategies to reduce vascular disease progression and restore endothelial function, an important factor in cardiovascular health. Specifically, we will focus on the S1P chaperones, protein molecules that bind to S1P and target receptor signaling complexes to activate specific biological responses. In particular, we will explore the mechanisms by which HDL-bound S1P suppresses endothelial injury and promote vascular homeostasis by the activation of S1PR1 signaling complexes. Second, we will explore how the S1PR1 signaling system regulates shear stress- induced vascular endothelial cell homeostasis. Mechanistic details of receptor signaling complexes that translate biomechanical forces that result from homeostatic laminar shear stress and pathologic disturbed shear into intracellular biochemical signals and transcriptional output will be elucidated in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Third, mechanisms by which autoimmunity-associated cytokines (type-I interferons) to exacerbate endothelial injury and accelerate vascular disease will be explored in mouse models and correlated with endothelial cells isolated from normal and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Finally, we will develop stabilized recombinant ApoM fusion protein to deliver S1P to endothelial S1PRs to promote vascular homeostasis and reduce endothelial injury. The use of this biological therapeutic in animal models of hypertension, myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion injury, abnormal angiogenesis and tissue fibrosis will be examined. These studies are anticipated to lead to comprehensive understanding of how S1P signaling promotes vascular homeostasis and lead to the development of novel approaches to control vascular injury and disease using cardiovascular targeted S1P therapeutics."
"9316312","Trypanosomatid parasites cause some of the most challenging neglected diseases worldwide. The human- pathogenic triumvirate of Trypanosoma brucei spp., Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania spp. affect hundreds of thousands of individuals, causing human African trypanosomiasis, Chagas? disease, and a range of visceral to cutaneous lesions, respectively. With no approved vaccines and treatments challenged by resistance, delivery, and efficacy concerns, discovery of new drugs is critical for therapy, control, and elimination of these diseases. Hence, new, validated targets are needed to enter the discovery pipeline. We have recently genetically and chemically validated the T. brucei protein kinase, AEK1, which is both highly conserved in these agents yet different from human protein kinases. The lytic phenotype following knockdown argues that important pathways are controlled by AEK1, yet nothing is known about its regulation or downstream effectors. We propose to fill this knowledge gap. We will test specific cis and trans interactions that we postulate regulate AEK1 activity, including probing a predicted allosteric site and assessing a candidate activating kinase. Our data shows that inhibition of AEK1 leads to inhibition of one or more events required for cytokinesis. To place its action within the cellular context, we will pinpoint the cytologic defect that occurs when AEK1 is inhibited. Because protein kinases exert their functions via modulating downstream effector molecules, the essentiality of AEK1 must reflect essentiality of one or more of its substrates. To identify substrates, we will use a genetically modified AEK1 that specifically accepts large thio-ATP analogs to enable specific thiophosphorylation of its substrates. Substrates will then be captured by virtue of the transferred thiophosphate. Identification of the thiophosphorylated peptides by mass spectrometry will allow development of a list of candidate substrates and a consensus phosphorylation site sequence that will enable identification of additional candidates. The identified molecules will be reviewed for their relationship to the phenotypic processes identified to aid in prioritization for future studies. By revealing mechanisms of regulation and identifying candidate substrates, this project will inform us about the pathway in which AEK1 functions. Given the high similarity of AEK1 across trypanosomatids, it is likely that many of our findings will be applicable to other trypanosomatid pathogens."
"9248762","Following renal transplantation, about 30-40% of patients suffer at least one episode of acute graft dysfunction. Treatment is radically different depending on the cause of renal dysfunction, which may include acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute and chronic rejection (AR/CR) and drug toxicity. The definitive diagnosis of renal transplant dysfunction is based on percutaneous biopsy, which is invasive and difficult to repeat.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an accurate assessment of allograft anatomy, as well as of vascular or obstructive disorders. In addition, functional MRI can provide insight into renal function using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI, using low dose gadolinium contrast agent, which estimates renal perfusion and flow), intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI, which provides information on flow and diffusion), arterial spin labeling (ASL, which quantifies renal flow without a contrast agent), and blood oxygen level dependent imaging (BOLD, which reflects oxygen bioavailability). Although functional MRI is non-invasive, it has not yet emerged as a ?virtual biopsy? because of the small number of validation studies, each generally focusing on a single MRI technique. Multiparametric MRI has the unique potential to identify intrinsic causes of renal transplant dysfunction.  Specific Aim 1: Develop a quality control (QC) framework to evaluate a quantitative multiparametric MRI protocol including IVIM diffusion, DCE-MRI perfusion, ASL, and BOLD in renal transplant patients. Hypothesis: a QC framework will improve data quality and reproducibility of MRI metrics measured in renal allografts. We will build a QC and image optimization algorithm for renal functional MRI, and we will test it in 16 patients with renal transplant.  Specific Aim 2: Quantify MRI parameters in renal transplant patients with normal and abnormal renal function, and assess the value of MRI parameters alone and in combination for characterizing renal dysfunction using clinical parameters and/or pathology as the reference. Hypothesis: Renal graft dysfunction can be diagnosed and characterized by a combination of biomarkers measurable by functional MRI. Renal diffusion and perfusion, as measured by IVIM parameters, renal plasma flow (RPF) measured by DCE and ASL, medullar and medullar-to-cortical ratio of the transverse relaxation time R2* (as measured by BOLD techniques) will decrease, while mean transit time (MTT) of the contrast agent through the renal tubules as measured by DCE-MRI, will increase in dysfunctional allografts compared to normally functional allografts. Furthermore, dysfunctional allografts with ATN can be distinguished from those without ATN by longer mean transit time in the renal tubules, as computed by the three-compartment model from DCE-MRI data, and by a higher ratio of medullar to cortical R2*. We will test this hypothesis in 97 renal transplant recipients with functional and dysfunctional allografts, as clinically indicated by laboratory tests and biopsy."
"9239089","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is diagnosed by pulmonary function test (PFT). PFT is commonly used to evaluate the severity and therapeutic response in COPD. However, complex mixture of COPD phenotypes requires a diagnostic tool with abilities to evaluate broader aspects of lung pathophysiology, and this is the primary reason why PFTs do not provide sufficient correlation with disease status and progression to serve as a reliable surrogate endpoint. What is needed is a quantitative and comprehensive set of COPD biomarkers that can provide phenotyping and staging of COPD, rapid assessment of response to a broad range of therapies, and tracking the progression of disease. The hope is that the hyperpolarized xenon magnetic resonance imaging (HXe MRI) could diagnose and intervene patients at the earliest stages of COPD, guide the selection of appropriate therapies, and extend life. In this proposal, two HXe MRI assessments will be performed. (1) A single sequence that combines a high-resolution image of inhaled HXe with a proton image acquired in the same breath-hold will provide the fraction of the lung volume with compromised airflow. (2) A new imaging protocol that exploits xenon's chemical shift sensitivity to the separate tissue compartments of the lung allows a detailed mapping of gas exchange through lung tissue and into the red blood cells. We hypothesize that these HXe MRI signatures will access physiologic information that were previously inaccessible by the conventional PFT and multimodality CT of chest, (MDCT). We also hypothesize that these imaging signatures will enhance our ability to evaluate COPD phenotypes and disease status better than the PFT and MDCT. Higher HXe MRI resolution based on the anatomy of the lung will further enhance the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In aim 1, we will perform a study of the correlation of imaging signatures of COPD with conventional assessments (PFT, MDCT and clinical outcomes). In aim 2, we will evaluate changes in the lung physiology of the patients with well-characterized COPD after being serially treated with three standard COPD therapies, long acting muscarinic antagonist (umeclidinium) and long acting beta-agonist (vilanterol) to improve ventilation, and inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) to potentially affect the inflammation in tissues. Our study design offers both cross-sectional and longitudinal information. Eighty treatment-nave subjects will be evaluated at baseline, after two serial 30-day courses of umeclidinium/vilanterol and fluticasone. The 320 assessments, considered independently, will determine correlations between functional imaging signatures and conventional metrics which include PFT, MDCT, and clinical outcomes. Within-subject temporal alterations of the HXe MRI imaging will be evaluated as potential biomarkers to assess COPD phenotypes and disease status, both of which we anticipate to deepen our basic mechanisms contributing to the genesis of COPD and to promote development of new strategies to diagnose and treat COPD."
"9304441","Borrelia burgdorferi is one of an increasing number of bacterial pathogens that can incorporate and metabolize cholesterol from the host. This organism requires cholesterol to grow but it lacks the metabolic machinery to synthetize it. In previous studies in our laboratory, we showed that cholesterol is key for maintaining the integrity and properties of the outer membrane of B. burgdorferi. Importantly, cholesterol is essential for pathogenesis of Lyme disease since cholesterol and cholesterol glycolipids form microdomains in the membranes of the spirochetes with all the hallmarks of eukaryotic lipid rafts, and that it may have important physiological functions. Despite the requirement for cholesterol, little is known regarding the effects of high cholesterol levels in serum, in tissues or in the accumulation of fat in tissues targeted by B. burgdorferi in Lyme disease patients. In a recent study [Toledo et al PNAS 2015], we showed that elevated levels of serum cholesterol, achieved with a short term high fat diet in cholesterol-transport deficient mice of two different genotypes [apolipoprotein E (apoE-), and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-) deficient] resulted in increased arthritis as well as increased number of spirochetes in the joints. These results alerted us to the possibility that hyperlipidemias could be a comorbidity factor for: i. increased acute Lyme disease severity; ii. Increased persistence of spirochetes in tissue, and iii. dissemination to and colonization of tissues with high lipid concentrations. Based on the hyphotesis that B. burgdorferi can exploit the excess of serum cholesterol leading to enhanced acute and chronic infection, and that hyperlipidemias are comorbid factors for Lyme disease, we propose the following: Specific Aim 1. To determine whether chronic hypercholesterolemia affect the overall pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi in the murine model of Lyme disease with two subaims to determine whether acute or chronic infection of B. burgdorferi is enhanced by hypercholesterolemia in WT and LDLR- mice; Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the role of subcutaneous adipose and intra-abdominal fat in the dissemination of the spirochete. "
"9218717","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow (BM), are quiescent, can self renew, and generate all lineages of the hematopoietic system. Despite significant progress in our understanding of mechanisms involved in self-renewal, differentiation and quiescence, a coherent picture of how these mechanisms act in concert to regulate steady-state function and homeostatic responses of HSCs in vivo has not emerged yet. Furthermore, reliable renewal of HSCs in vitro has not been achieved, while there is overwhelming evidence that HSC self-renewal occurs in vivo. This implies that despite the identification of dozens of cytokines and of more than 200 genes that affect HSC function in knockout studies, and despite the publication of multiple studies on genome-wide expression and epigenetic signatures, significant gaps in our understanding remain. A particular gap is our understanding of the organellar cell biology of HSCs. HSCs rely predominantly on glycolytic ATP production, while many mature cells use mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Preferential use of glycolysis in stem cells suggests that mitochondrial respiration is more dispensable for HSCs than for progenitors, a notion supported by experimental data. These findings raise the question whether mitochondria play a role in HSCs that is not directly related to ATP production. In addition to ATP production, mitochondria are also required for several biosynthetic pathways and intermediary metabolism, apoptosis and intracellular calcium homeostasis. We show in our preliminary data that mitochondria are regulated in an exceptional fashion in HSCs, and that interfering with this regulation affects HSC function, at least in part by buffering intracellular calcium (Cai2+), which we found to be strikingly low in HSCs compared to progenitors and non-hematopoietic cells. The goal of is the proposal is to better define regulation of mitochondria in HSC, its impact on Cai2+, and HSC on maintenance, identity and function."
"9316941","Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder associated with loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Some ALS patients also develop frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Genetic findings have linked mutations in different genes to the range of symptoms seen in ALS. This proposal focuses on UBQLN2, missense mutations in which cause dominant inheritance of ALS-FTD. UBQLN2 is one of four ubiquilin (UBQLN) proteins found in humans. UBQLN proteins function to clear misfolded proteins from cells through the proteasome and autophagy pathways. This function could be important in neurodegenerative diseases, where a build up of misfolded proteins is frequently seen. Therefore, understanding how UBQLN proteins function and dysfunction has broad implications for neurodegenerative diseases. Animal models of the disease are useful for understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis and for therapeutic studies. Toward such a goal, we generated and characterized transgenic mice carrying Thy1.2 promoter-driven expression of human UBQLN2 proteins encoding either the wild type (WT) or the P497S or P506S mutants that cause ALS- FTD. Mouse lines carrying each of the mutations were found to develop motor neuron disease and cognitive deficits, mimicking the human disease, whereas the WT mice were devoid of motor neuron disease. Immunoblots of spinal cord proteins revealed a dramatic reduction in TBK1 levels in animals with end-stage disease in both the mutant UBQLN2 mouse lines compared to non-transgenic animals. The reduction could be significant because haploinsufficiency of TBK1 expression caused by TBK1 mutations were recently linked to ALS-FTD. Prompted by these relationships, we examined whether TBK1 binds with UBQLN2. Double immunofluorescence staining indicated TBK1 and UBQLN colocalize in cells in autophagosomes. Furthermore, by both immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays we found WT UBQLN2 binds TBK1, but the ALS UBQLN2 mutant proteins bind more TBK1. We hypothesize that the increased binding with UBQLN2 mutants alters one or both of the protein's functions. Accordingly, we propose experiments in Aim 1 to study the functional significance of the interaction, and how mutations in UBQLN2 affect this interaction especially with regard to the function of the proteins in autophagy, which we found is disturbed in our mutant UBQLN2 mouse lines. In Aim 2, we will determine whether transgenic overexpression of TBK1, in an effort to restore its levels in our UBQLN2 mice, will extend survival and delay ALS-FTD symptoms. In Aim 3, will investigate the exciting possibility, supported by our preliminary studies in double transgenic mice, that overexpression of UBQLN1 in our mtUBQLN2 lines will delay ALS-FTD symptoms. The outcome of this work is likely to be important both in terms of its implications for our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in ALS-FTD pathogenesis and because it could reveal whether modulation of TBK1 and UBQLN1 levels can serve as tractable therapeutic strategies to treat ALS-FTD."
"9391422","PROJECT SUMMARY Women are twice more likely than men to be diagnosed with depression, and depression is more severe and associated with greater functional impairment in women. However, the neurobiological underpinnings of this increased female susceptibility to depression are unknown. The dopamine (DA) system has traditionally been associated with anhedonia, the inability to derive pleasure from normally rewarding stimuli, and has been recently implicated in the pathophysiology in depression. Importantly, anhedonia is a core symptom of depression and other psychiatric diseases involving DA system dysregulation and characterized by substantial sex differences in their prevalence and nature, such as schizophrenia and drug addiction. Indeed, recent evidence has demonstrated a causal link between a hypofunctioning DA system (i.e. decreased DA neuron activity) and depression-related behaviors (i.e. anhedonia, despair). Surprisingly, little is known about DA system function in females. Thus, characterizing baseline DA system function, as well as stress-induced alterations within this system, is an essential step in understanding sexual dimorphism in the etiology of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Moreover, given the strong link between the DA system and depression, there is a significant potential benefit from novel interventions targeting DA system dysfunction in depression. In sum, the purpose of this proposal is threefold: 1) to define baseline behavioral and DA system function in male and female rats 2) to compare stress-induced behavioral and VTA DA neuron adaptations in male and female rats and 3) to identify potential pathways mediating susceptibility to stressors (i.e. acute, chronic) that differentially impact females. Our overarching hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of stress on behavior and VTA activity, and that these effects are mediated by decreased compensation (i.e. activity) in the vSub-NAc pathway. To test this, we will use an integrated systems-oriented approach focused on behavioral assays in vivo electrophysiology, chemogenetics. In this way, we hope to provide a unique perspective on the regulation of the DA system in males and females, the role of the DA system in stress-induced depressive-like symptomatology (i.e. anhedonia, despair), and the mechanisms underlying modulation of the DA system in both sexes under baseline conditions, following acute stress (i.e. post-FST) and after UCMS. Ultimately, these findings could shed light on the increased female vulnerability to depression and lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for depression and other psychiatric disorders implicating aberrant DA system function and anhedonia."
"9301230","Shortened current anti-HCV DAA therapies should be less expensive, but have not provided satisfactory efficacy in nave cirrhotics, treatment experienced non-cirrhotics or GT3-infected patients. Integrating drugs with distinct mechanisms of action (MoA) into DAA regimens could solve this issue. Such drugs are the cyclophilin inhibitors (CypI), which target cyclophilin A (CypA) and which have shown high efficacy in patients. Because of their high barrier to resistance and high efficiency against GT3, CypI are ideal as a rescue therapy for patients who have relapsed with DAA resistance-associated variants. Findings presented at 2016 CROI and EASL conferences suggest that current DAA treatments are not going to be the final solution for the treatment of all HCV patients. Specifically, they suggest i) that despite the efficacy of DAAs, virologic failure occur; ii) that DAA treatment results in the reactivation of HBV; and iii) that HCC recurrence occurs in DAA- treated patients. These novel unexpected findings strongly suggest that new agents, such as CypI, with distinct MoAs, are urgently needed. The unexpected HCC recurrence in HCV patients after DAA treatment is of particular interest for this application since we demonstrated that CypI greatly reduce liver fibrosis. Since an ultimate goal is to restore normal liver function, the antifibrotic activity of CypI represents a major benefit for an anti-HCV treatment and emphasizes that including a CypI into a DAA regimen is an attractive option. Despite the fact that NS5Ai and CypI are efficacious, their MoA are poorly understood. Only knowing that NS5Ai and CypI bind to NS5A and CypA, is not sufficient to understand their MoA. It is critical to elucidate how these key classes of inhibitors exert their MoA at a molecular level rather than only at a clinical level. We showed that NS5A and CypA act in concert to form double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which provide sanctuaries for viral factories, and that both NS5Ai and CypI prevent DMV formation. Here, we propose to conduct a new set of experiments aimed at characterizing the MoA of NS5Ai (Aim 1) and CypI (Aim 2) as well as the role of NS5A (Aim 1) and CypA (Aim 2) in DMV formation. The remarkable antifibrotic activity of CypI - distinct from their antiviral activity - emphasizes that the inclusion of a CypI in a DAA regimen is an attractive option. We propose to conduct a set of experiments aimed at defining the MoA of antifibrotic activities of CypI and to analyze the role of Cyps in fibrosis and HCC (Aim 3). The recent finding that DAA trigger recurrence of HCC is a serious warning that current DAA regimens are not flawless and that additional drugs with different MoAs (CypA neutralization) and with attractive properties (anti-HBV and anti-fibrosis properties) such as CypI are needed. This application seeks to characterize i) the antiviral MoA of NS5Ai and CypI; ii) the antifibrotic MoA of CypI; and iii) roles of NS5A and CypA in DMV formation, and virus life cycle. It also seeks to shift the clinical practice paradigm by including CypI into DAA regimens with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost of treatment and of providing new therapeutic properties, which DAAs lack such as blocking HBV and reducing liver damage."
"9395666","Project Summary All of us are taxed with juggling our inner mental lives and immediate external task demands. The temporary maintenance of task-relevant internal information in working memory is a vital cognitive function, but it is vulnerable to disruption by irrelevant perceptual input and competing attention demands. We lack a clear characterization, however, of the conditions under which distraction will be most disruptive, as well as a neurobiological explanation for how we successfully resist its impact. The current proposal uses converging neuroimaging and causal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methods, as well as advanced brain network connectivity analysis techniques, to shed light on the neural processes that promote and prevent distraction during working memory. The experiments employ a novel behavioral task that combines levels of distraction from two primary sources?perceptual interference and attention demand?to look at their unique and interacting effects on maintenance of information in working memory. Aim 1 measures the reconfiguration of functional connectivity patterns between brain networks that control and represent working memory information in response to distraction demands. Aim 2 manipulates neural activity with TMS to a) test the causal contribution of particular brain nodes to WM behavior and b) probe the distraction-dependent effects of that stimulation on activity and connectivity in interacting brain networks. The proposed cutting-edge data acquisition and analysis techniques represent novel strategies for addressing perplexing inconsistencies in our understanding of distraction effects, as well as invaluable fellowship training goals. The application of a non- invasive neurostimulation technique, in particular, will allow a precise and directional delineation of the neural components of distractor-resistant working memory, unachievable with common correlational (i.e., neuroimaging) techniques alone. The proposed studies will mark both a conceptual and methodological advance in understanding the persistence of working memory despite the interruptions and diversions that are so common in daily life."
"9403950","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by significant impairments in social-communication, there is tremendous heterogeneity in the severity of these impairments. Very little is still known about the genetic, neurobiological, and environmental predictors of this heterogeneity. Emerging research suggests that all three of these factors relate separately to social development in ASD, but the lack of integrative research leaves many questions unanswered about how and why children with ASD differ so greatly in developmental course and quality of social skills. A better understanding of how these predictors interact is crucial to 1) understand risk and protective factors in the social development of children with ASD; 2) determine prognosis for young children with ASD; 3) select optimal treatments based on individual characteristics; and 4) develop early interventions to improve social development. The proposed study takes an interdisciplinary approach to examine how genetic risk and early parenting interact to predict later heterogeneity in brain and behavioral markers of social functioning in children with ASD. Participants will be 25 children with ASD and 25 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) controls, ages 7-9 years. All children previously participated in a high-risk infant study at ages , 12, 18, and 24 months and have agreed to return for ongoing imaging studies at the UCLA Brain Mapping Center. The proposed study will examine group differences in trajectories of child social attention and maternal synchrony during early parent-child interactions, as well as how these trajectories predict social functioning in school-age. Additionally, the study will test whether brain connectivity in social brain networks during 1) social reward learning and 2) resting state mediates the relationship between early social interactions and later social functioning. Finally, this study will examine the early social interactions as mediators of the relationship between genetic risk (presence of oxytocin receptor gene OXTR) risk alleles and reduced connectivity in social brain networks. This work will contribute to the field by facilitatig an interdisciplinary understanding of the nature and development of social heterogeneity in ASD with implications for improvement of early prediction and intervention. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to link studies of genes with brain and behavioral development to understand atypical functioning as a transactional developmental process."
"9198226","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tubule atrophy and fibrosis often develop after acute kidney injury (AKI) favoring transition to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The AKI-CKD transition has major implications, but poorly understood. We found that tubules regenerating after AKI often fail to differentiate. Such tubules are growth arrested and atrophic, and exhibit signaling that drives fibrosis. The cause of this pathology is unknown. We obtained three lines of evidence that could explain why recovering tubules become atrophic and profibrotic. First, tubules showed damage to DNA and DNA damage repair responses (DDR) during ischemic AKI, and then, instead of subsiding, DNA damage and DDRs persisted into later stages of tubule atrophy and fibrosis. Altered gene expression caused by DNA damage may explain why tubules fail to recover normally. Chronic hypoxia in kidneys recovering from AKI could inhibit oxygen dependent ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in tubules causing depletion of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and thereby produce DNA damage. Second, dNTPs declined in hypoxic cultured tubule cells, producing DNA damage and DDRs. This was accompanied by growth arrest and a dedifferentiated abnormally signaling profibrotic phenotype similar to that seen during tubule atrophy after AKI in vivo. Provision of dNTP precursors ameliorated the hypoxic DNA damage and reversed the growth arrest. Third, by RNAseq transcriptional profiling of hypoxic cells, we identified increased expression of genes related to inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis. Our hypothesis is that following ischemic AKI, chronic hypoxia inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in regenerating tubules, depletes dNTPs, and, thereby, causes DNA replication stress and DNA damage. Because DNA damage is chronic, the DNA damage repair response (DDR) also persists, giving rise to inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we have three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will explore the relationships between DNA damage and development of tubule atrophy using immunohistochemistry and morphometry, a transgenic reporter DNA damage, and inducible deletion of critical DDR genes to investigate if the intervention modifies late pathology after AKI In Aim 2, we will investigate the relationships of hypoxic inhibition of RNR, dNTP depletion, DNA damage/DDR and cell pathology. We will determine if infusions of dNTP precursors in vivo ameliorate tubule pathology after AKI. In Aim 3, we will use RNAseq and proteomics to selectively identify hypoxic alterations specific to dNTP depletion as apart from other hypoxic effects. Thus, we hope to provide critically needed information relating to basic aspects in the pathogenesis of a major health problem, chronic kidney disease."
"9261881","Project Summary/Abstract Parent emotion-related talk (e.g., use of emotion language) with children has been shown to be associated with later externalizing behavior problems. However, most studies examining parent emotion-related talk have relied on cross-sectional designs and therefore have been unable to understand how parent emotion-related talk changes over time. Existing studies also have primarily included preschoolers and older children, and only a few studies have examined the relation between parent emotion-related talk, child prosocial behavior and emotion regulation with infants and toddlers. Deficits in prosocial behavior and emotion regulation are associated with poor long term outcomes, including impairment in academic functioning and peer relationships, which may be increased by behavior problems. Early signs of behavior problems place these families at high risk of developing later externalizing problems. Considering the high risk of later externalizing problems, it is important to understand if there are differences in parent emotion-related talk in infants and toddlers from low- and high-risk families. The developmental trajectory of parent emotion-related talk (Research Aim 1) and the impact of parent emotion-related talk on infant prosocial behavior and emotion regulation will be examined (Research Aim 2). Specifically, growth curve modeling will be used to examine changes in parent emotion- related talk over time and structural equation modeling using multiple units of analysis, including observational assessment of behavior and parent report will be used to examine the effect of parent emotion-related talk on infant emotion regulation and prosocial behavior. In addition, differences in parent emotion related talk between parents of infants at low and high risk of behavior problems will be examined (Research Aim 3). Mentoring with Dr. Bahrick and Dr. Reeb-Sutherland will consult on normative infant development (Training Goal #1). Dr. Denham will consult on measurement of emotion understanding and socialization, and Dr. Graziano will consult on assessment of emotion regulation (Training Goal #2). Dr. Coxe will consult on developing advanced quantitative skills longitudinal data analyses (Training Goal #3). Dr. Bagner will consult on the impact of parenting practices on infant development and the unique needs of high-risk families, as well as supervise and consult on the overall proposed study and ethics. Findings will inform future work to examine possible mechanisms by which parent emotion-related talk can be targeted to help improve child social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. The proposed training goals and research aims will prepare me for a career as an independent investigator focused on impact of parent-child interactions on the development of emotion in early childhood."
"9411493","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastasis or dissemination of primary tumor cells is the major cause of mortality in cancer patients. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream are key players in the establishment of metastatic tumors. Recent studies demonstrated that the number of CTCs present in patient blood directly correlate with cancer progression, recurrence, and survival rate. Accurate detection of CTCs will provide critical information for proper management of cancer patients. Currently, the CellSearch(R) test is the only FDA-approved method for detection of CTCs in cancer patient blood. However, similar to all other antibody-mediated methods, this test requires multiple steps for sample preparation and cell labeling, which can cause loss of and damage to CTCs in blood samples and adversely affect the sensitivity and accuracy of the test. In addition, the requirement of multiple steps is time- and labor-consuming. In the proposed study, we aim to overcome these technical obstacles and develop a simple point-of-care assay by integrating a novel Tumor Cell-activation Aptamer Reporting system (TCAR) and innovative Spinning Disc Imaging Technology (iSDI). In contrast to current antibody-mediated multi-step tests, the TCAR system will be able to selectively highlight CTCs through natural cellular processes in whole blood within minutes using a single-step reaction. In addition, TCAR will provide no background or off-target signals and will not require a post-labeling cell wash. The iSDI technology will detect CTCs in a high-speed manner and record high-resolution images, similar to a Blu-ray disc player reading bits on disc. Compared to conventional automated fluorescence microscopes, the iSDI system is superior in sensitivity, speed, and operates at a lower cost. We hypothesize that this assay will be able to detect an accurate number of CTCs within minutes in whole blood samples through a single-step reaction, which will eliminate potential loss of and damage to CTCs in the samples. To test our hypothesis, three aims are proposed. We will optimize the TCAR system containing aptamer probes specific for EpCAM to selectively highlight carcinoma tumor cells in whole blood (Aim 1) while constructing and validating the iSDI system for coating, scanning, and imaging cells completely hands-free in minutes (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will integrate the TCAR and iSDI systems, develop a point-of-care assay for rapid detection of CTCs, and validate the performance using tumor cells in normal human blood samples. We predict that this simple assay will provide high-definition morphology of CTCs along with their fluorescence identity in one step within minutes."
"9204365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease with an expected further increase in prevalence due to population aging. Although many drug targets have been identified and preclinical studies have shown efficacy in reducing disease severity, clinical trials on disease modifying OA drugs have failed. Experimental approaches such as testing disease-related differences in expression patterns of selected genes or proteins and analyzing function of these molecules in preclinical models has yielded a large number of pathways and molecules that are abnormally expressed or activated in OA. The limitations of these approaches are (i) that they provide only a selective and biased view of molecular changes that occur in OA and (ii) there has been no successful effort in integrating these findings into networks and prioritizing targets by their relevance as drivers of the OA process. This project leverages (i) our access to and expertise in working with human knee tissues from donors across the entire adult age spectrum and at all stages of OA development; (ii) human knee tissue libraries; (iii) technical advances in large scale, genome wide analyses of transcriptomes and epigenetic changes, which provide the opportunity to generate an unbiased and comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of cartilage homeostasis, aging and OA; (iv) our novel pipeline for integrative network analysis of multi-Omics data sets. Our hypothesis is that the gene expression and epigenetic (miRNA, other non-coding RNA, DNA methylation) data will generate novel signatures, pathways and key regulators of cartilage homeostasis, aging and OA. Aim 1. Healthy cartilage aging: Identify novel transcriptomic and epigenomic (non-coding RNA and DNA methylation) markers of cartilage homeostasis and healthy aging. Aim 2. OA-related changes: Reveal pathways and networks that are disrupted in OA and identify principal regulators of OA pathogenesis. Aim 3. Validation: Confirm differences in gene and protein expression and analyze regulation and function of principal drivers of OA pathogenesis. Impact: To our knowledge, this is the first project to examine genome-wide mRNA expression profiles and genome-wide regulators of expression (miRs, other non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation) in cross-sectional healthy knee aging and OA. The proposed study has potential to lead to the discovery of (i) new biomarkers; (ii) novel pathways and principal molecular switches as therapeutic targets; and (iii) subsets of patients with unique epigenetic signatures and gene expression patterns, resulting in a personalized treatment approach. Ultimately this may lead to interventions to slow aging, and to the identification of therapeutic targets to delay or treat OA. By making the original data sets publicy available, the project will also generate a resource for the scientific community."
"9331848","Tick-borne bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae cause emerging zoonoses across the globe, such as human anaplasmosis and ehrlichioses, where competent vector ticks occur. Due to the non-specific signs and symptoms they cause, and absence of diagnostic antibodies at the time of illness onset, they may be confused with better recognized febrile illnesses such as rickettsioses or viral diseases. Severe human ehrlichiosis is characterized by a pro- inflammatory syndrome, but the bacterial gene products responsible for inducing adverse host reactions are unknown. Determination of gene function in the Anaplasmataceae is complicated by their obligately intracellular nature, yet, this would allow identification of targets for prevention and treatment of disease. Previous animal models of ehrlichiosis do not reproduce features of human disease, which makes it difficult to investigate virulence factors. Our group has isolated a novel human ehrlichiosis agent (Ehrlichia muris-like agent, EMLA) in vitro from both a human patient and a blacklegged tick. EMLA causes disease in laboratory mice that recapitulates human monocytic ehrlichiosis, making it now possible to investigate the factors that cause clinical ehrlichiosis in a mouse model. To elucidate the molecular basis of pathogenicity and tick transmission in ehrlichiae, we propose to generate a library of mutant EMLA using random mutagenesis and characterization by Illumina sequencing-based insertion site determination. We will use a transposon containing a cassette that can subsequently be replaced with a functional gene copy for complementation. We will implement our plan through completion of the following specific aims: AIM 1: Produce a library of Ehrlichia muris-like agent (EMLA) mutants with a replaceable selection cassette in tick and human cell cultures. AIM 2a: Map insertion sites of transposons by Illumina-based sequence analysis of mutant pools followed by assignment to individual mutant lines using PCR. 2b. Identification of mutants defective for invasion and successful colonization of human and tick cells using cell invasion/colonization screens, bioinformatics analysis, and genetic complementation. Ehrlichia species differentially express genes depending on the host cell in which they reside. We will raise mutants in human and tick cells to recover bacteria with disrupted genes that are essential for colonization of only one host cell type, as well as those that govern pathogenicity but are not essential. We realize that genes required for colonization of and transmission by ticks are important for ability of ehrlichiae to infect mammals. With the availability of the human, the EMLA, and the Ixodes scapularis genomes, the conditions are now right to identify ehrlichia genes that mediate interactions with its host and vector in vitro, setting the stage for more comprehensive studies in a subsequent project."
"9047309","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our recent data have suggested that PPAR-? expression in lung macrophages plays a critical role in sustaining pulmonary anti-influenza effector T cell responses by modulating the survival of T cells within the respiratory tract. Furthermore, our data have indicated that diminished PPAR-? expression and/or function in macrophages predispose obese hosts to impaired pulmonary T cell immunity and enhanced disease development during influenza infection. In this application, we wish to define the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which PPAR-? expression in macrophages modulates respiratory T cell immunity and disease development during influenza infection in normal and obese hosts. We will also test the ability of drugs targeting PPAR-? and downstream factors, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as potential therapeutic agents to reduce influenza virus infection and complications in normal and obese individuals. Aim 1. To elucidate the mechanisms by which myeloid-PPAR-? expression regulates pulmonary anti-viral immunity during influenza infection. Aim 2: To determine the role of dysregulated PPAR-? expression and/or function in macrophages in enhanced susceptibility to influenza infection in obese hosts. Relevance statement: Influenza virus poses a serious challenge to public health. Influenza infection is particularly dangerous for obese people. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for example, obesity was convincingly identified as an independent risk factor for multiple markers of disease severity including hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. Recent rodent studies have also demonstrated that genetic or diet-induced obesity increases host morbidity and mortality after influenza virus challenge. Currently, the mechanisms associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in obese hosts remain largely undefined. The proposed research promises to elucidate underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of severe influenza virus infection in normal and obese hosts. If successful, the results may open the door for drugs to treat severe influenza-associated diseases in obese individuals. Given the serious threat of an influenza pandemic involving highly pathogenic virus strains such as H5N1 and H7N9 in the context of the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity, this work promises to have a significant impact on public health."
"9243805","Title Donor tissue specific extracellular vesicle characterization for monitoring rejection in lung transplantation Project Summary (Abstract)  Lung transplantation remains the only curative therapy in patients with end stage respiratory failure. However, morbidity and mortality in lung transplant patients remains the highest amongst all solid organ transplants, and is directly associated with transplant lung rejection and complications of immunosuppression. Yet to this date, there is no reliable biomarker platform to monitor the transplant lung status. An accurate, non- invasive, time-sensitive biomarker platform would have significant translational impact on patient survival and quality of life as it would enable early intervention and immunosuppression titration.  Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are released by many tissues into peripheral circulation. EVs represent stable and tissue-specific proteomic and RNA signature profiles that reflect the conditional state of their tissue of origin. Tissue specific EV profiles and their RNA signatures are distinct in conditions of health versus injury/ pathology. Therefore, understanding tissue specific EV profiles from bodily fluids has promise to serve as a ?liquid biopsy? of the status of their tissue of origin. But no group has studied tissue specific EV profiles in transplantation. From work done over the past three years in our laboratory, we found that transplanted tissues/ organs release a stable and detectable pool of donor-specific EVs into the recipient blood/ bodily fluids. Further, immune rejection of the transplanted tissue leads to distinct changes in the donor EV quantity and in their proteomic and microRNA profiles. These findings have now been validated in the clinical setting. In this mentored research project we propose to investigate the role of donor lung specific EV proteomic and RNA signatures from recipient plasma as a novel biomarker platform in the field of lung transplantation diagnostics.  Since no study to date has characterized transplant lung specific and recipient immune cell EV pools, we propose to investigate this novel concept in two in vivo transplant models: (1) established mouse model of orthotopic lung transplantation under controlled settings of acute rejection versus acceptance, and; (2) human lung transplantation. In both settings we will characterize transplant lung specific and recipient T cell specific EV pools, their proteomic and RNA signatures in conditions of health versus rejection to discover distinct profiles associated with transplant rejection. Successful completion of this project proposal would lay the foundation for future development of a non-invasive, EV-based novel biomarker assay to monitor lung transplant rejection."
"9176756","Continued support is requested to analyze mechanisms whereby components of the Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM) complex contribute to cardiovascular development. Work in the previous funding period established that Heart of Glass (HEG1), a transmembrane protein essential for vertebrate cardiovascular development, anchors a Rap effector, KRIT1, and thus the CCM complex to endothelial cell (EC) cell junctions. Our analysis of the HEG1 interactome revealed a novel interaction of the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain with RASIP1, another Rap effector that plays a critical role in vascular development and integrity. We thus propose that RASIP1 binding to Rap1 regulates its interaction with HEG1 to localize RASIP1 to assembling EC junctions thus mediating some, but not all, of the RASIP1 functions involved in vascular development. To test these ideas we propose to ask if binding of RASIP1 to HEG1 mediates RASIP1 localization to EC junctions and its capacity to suppress RhoA/ROCK activity to maintain EC barrier function. We will minimize the regions of HEG1 and RASIP1 that interact and then test, using purified recombinant fragments, whether the interaction is direct. Functions will be probed by examining the effect of mutants that perturb the interaction on the capacity of RASIP1 to localize to EC junctions, to support endothelial monolayer integrity, to inhibit RhoA/ROCK activity, and to support cardiovascular development in zebrafish. We will also test the hypothesis that Rap1 binding to RASIP1 regulates its interaction with HEG1. Molecular modeling will predict mutations in the RA domain of RASIP1 that block Rap1 binding. The effect of these mutations on the interaction of RASIP1 with HEG1 in cells and RASIP1 junctional localization, regulation of vascular integrity, and cardiovascular development will be assessed. Preliminary data suggest that RASIP1 is auto-inhibited; by mapping self-interacting sites in conjunction with analysis of Rap1 binding we will examine potential mechanisms whereby Rap1 might alleviate such auto inhibition. Thirdly, we will assess whether there are HEG1-independent functions of RASIP1. In addition to suppressing RhoA/ROCK signaling, RASIP1 supports integrin activation and the activities of CDC42 and Rac1. Using the information gleaned in Aims 1 and 2, we will test whether RASIP1 mutants that fail to bind to HEG1 or Rap1 can support these functions. Conversely we will examine the effect of loss of HEG1 on these functions and assess the capacity of HEG1 deficient in RASIP1 binding to support them. Finally, we will test the idea that RASIP1 and KRIT1 might regulate each other's interactions with HEG1. These studies will serve to elucidate the mechanisms whereby HEG1, RASIP1, and KRIT1 play a critical role in cardiovascular development. "
"9224939","Stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death throughout the world, and the leading cause of long-term disability. Ischemic stroke, the most common subtype, is caused by occlusion of an artery in the brain, resulting in the abrupt development of neurological deficits. In the first hours after stroke onset, neurological deficits can be highly unstable, with many patients improving while others deteriorate. These early changes have a major impact on long-term outcome. In fact, changes in neurologic deficits during the first 24 hours account for 40% of the variance of the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (the most widely accepted stroke outcome measure) in patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). In my preliminary analyses, it was discovered that baseline clinical factors account for very little of the variation seen in neurologic deficits during the first 24 hours while genetic factors appear to account for over 50%. Given the finding that genetics influence the variance of early neurologic changes, it is my central hypothesis that genetics play a significant role in determining the early outcomes experienced by patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke (AIS).  As a fellowship-trained emergency physician subspecializing in neurologic emergencies, my long term goal is to develop an independent research program to investigate genetic influences on acute neurological emergencies to improve patient outcomes. In order to achieve this goal, I have developed two short term goals that will be achieved during the award period: 1) to become technically proficient in genetic/genomic analysis and research methodology and 2) to develop greater familiarity with cellular and molecular mechanisms involved with brain and neurovascular injury following AIS. In order to achieve these goals, I have crafted a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors and collaborators. Over the past several years, I have been working closely with my primary mentor, Dr. Jin-Moo Lee (Director of the Cerebrovascular Disease and Neurointensive Care Sections in Neurology) and my secondary mentor Dr. Carlos Cruchaga (a human geneticist with expertise in complex genetic analyses), to examine possible genetic influences on the early neurologic outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. They both have a strong track record of mentoring junior investigators and bring complimentary backgrounds and expertise to my mentoring and career development.  Under the guidance of Drs. Jin-Moo Lee and Carlos Cruchaga, I will engage in structured coursework, advanced training and independent study to become proficient in patient-oriented research, genetic analysis, and research methodology. To capture early neurological change following AIS, we have developed a novel quantitative endophenotype, termed ?NIHSS24h, which is a measure of the change in NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score between baseline (<6 hours after onset) and 24 hours. Using a cohort of AIS patients treated with IV tPA that will consist of 3,000 phenotyped subjects drawn from an international multicenter consortium and representing the largest such dataset of early stroke outcomes linked to genetics in the world, I will explore the following: Aim 1: To perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), examining early neurological change (?NIHSS24h) after AIS. Using the first 3,000 tPA-treated AIS patients (Discovery cohort, estimated accrual September, 2016), GWAS of common & rare coding variants will be performed to discover single variants, genes, and pathways associated with ?NIHSS24h. An additional 3,000 tPA-treated patients (Replication Cohort) will be accrued by September 2019, and used to replicate findings from the initial Discovery cohort. Aim 2: To use extreme phenotype sampling with low frequency functional variants of large effect size for early neurological deterioration (Aim 2a) or improvement (Aim 2b) after AIS. We will select patients with the most extremes of ?NIHSS24h, representing those with greatest deterioration or improvement, and compare to matched controls with little change in ?NIHSS24h. Replication of the top hits in each extreme will be performed in the overall cohort with gene-based sequencing and analysis. Of those patients who deteriorate, we will determine which genetic variants associate with hemorrhagic transformation and which do not.  This research plan reflects my multidisciplinary training and career development in emergency medicine, neurologic emergencies, and genetics. It is a long-term objective that the unbiased approach presented in this research proposal will reveal important variants, genes and pathways involved in acute brain ischemia, possibly leading to both diagnostic and therapeutic targets to improve outcomes following stroke."
"9350434","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral nerve injuries present a serious clinical challenge with greater than 250,000 peripheral nerve trauma cases being reported every year in the United States. After nerve trauma, the standard clinical operating procedure is to oppose the two nerve ends and suture them together without generating tension where possible. While autografts are the best clinical bridging option available today, there are many drawbacks to this procedure, including the need for a secondary surgery, loss of donor site function, limited availability, and neuroma formation at the donor or graft site. Therefore there is a clear and urgent, unmet clinical need to find an alternative approach to the use of autografts. Despite our best efforts, finding alternative 'nerve bridges' for peripheral nerve repair remains challenging - of the four FDA approved nerve 'tubes' for use in the clinic, none is typically used to bridge gaps longer than 10 mm due to poor outcomes. Here, we propose an innovative hypothesis - we hypothesize that recruiting anti- inflammatory regenerative monocytes preferentially to the nerve gap will bias the regenerative cascade to help bridge long nerve gaps without the need for long-term exogenous trophic factor delivery. Specifically we will evaluate the efficacy of acutely delivering fractalkine to investigate its ability to attract regenerative monocytes, and subsequently influence nerve bridging across long nerve gaps."
"9369621","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective generation and long-term maintenance of immune memory cells are critical for the success of vaccines against pathogens. Mice with autophagy deficiency in B cells show a severe defect in the maintenance of memory B cells after immunization, and succumb to viral infections due to failure to generate protective secondary antibody responses. Autophagy is required for the long-term persistence of memory B cells to protect against viral infections. Similarly, it has been shown that autophagy is also required for the protection of memory T cells. However, the precise mechanisms for autophagy in the protection of memory B cells remain to be defined. We have found that Nix and Bnip3, two Bcl-2 family members important for mitochondrial autophagy, are required for the generation of antigen-specific memory B cells. We hypothesize that autophagy is essential for the protection of mitochondrial functions to protect the survival and functions of memory B cells. We will perform the following experiments to test this hypothesis: 1) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which Nix and Bnip3- dependent mitochondrial autophagy protects antigen-specific memory B cells. Whether defective mitochondrial autophagy in Nix- and Bnip3-deficient memory B cells leads to aberrant metabolic functions will be determined; 2) To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial autophagy protects against cell death in memory B cells. Whether disruption of mitochondrial integrity leads to the release of mitochondrial ptoteins or DNA in the induction of cell death in memory B cells; and 3) To determine the molecular mechanisms for mitochondrial autophagy in memory B cells. The functions of novel Nix- and Bnip3-interacting proteins in the regulation of mitochondrial autophagy will be studied. The findings from this study may facilitate the development of better strategies to enhance the efficacy of vaccination against infections by targeting mitochondrial autophagy."
"9221996","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this renewal application of an established (38 years), successful multidisciplinary training program in Digestive Diseases, we will continue to train qualified postdoctoral individuals (M.D., and/or Ph.D.) for academic careers in digestive diseases. Our interdisciplinary, full time faculty of 40 scientists supports two tracks for potentil trainees: i) basic/disease oriented research; and ii) patient-oriented research. The basic/disease oriented tract remains one of long-standing excellence with training opportunities in cancer cell biology, enteric neurosciences, liver pathobiology, and new opportunities organized around regenerative medicine/stem cells and transcription/epigenetics. Training in this track is strongly supported through interactions with the NIH funded Mayo Comprehensive Cancer Center, Basic Science Departments at Mayo Clinic, and the newly acquired NIH P30 Digestive Disease Center grant. The patient-oriented tract, which is educationally buttressed through the Mayo Center for Translational Science Activities (CTSA), maintains training opportunities in human genetics/epidemiology, obesity/nutrition, human imaging/physiology, and a newly developed track in the science of healthcare delivery/comparative effectiveness, the latter being a new area of institutional focus. The initiative in obesity/nutrition proposed in the last renewal has been remarkably successful with 3 new trainees in this track. We continue to request support for 5 postdoctoral trainees/year that are selected through objective and consensus-driven mechanisms from a talented annual pool of approximately 75 M.D., PhD, or M.D./PhD candidates derived from a variety of clinical and basic disciplines. The overall success of the program continues to be outstanding with 65% of trainees from the most recently completed 10-year cohort (n=23) entering into an academic medicine staff appointment and a funding portfolio from this cohort that includes 16 new federal grants (5 K series, 9 R series, 2 P30 pilots). Our aggressive recruitment of both female and underrepresented minority candidates also continues, with 50% of the trainees from female (38%) or minority groups (12%) during the last 10 years. Institutional support also continues to be strong and well documented. Thus, this highly established training program remains creative, innovative, and dynamic, thereby continuing to be highly successful in achieving its goal of training individuals for academic careers in gastroenterology and hepatology."
"9314835","Project Summary / Abstract  Animals are colonized by diverse bacterial strains that influence multiple aspects of the host's behavior and physiology. In particular, neuronal functions are now known to be modulated by the composition of an animal's microbiota. Enteric bacteria greatly influence behavior, mood, cognition, and the onset and progression of neurological diseases via modulation of neuron and neuronal circuit functions. However, it remains challenging to provide a mechanistic description of the effects of gut microbiota on nervous system function in the complex mammalian system.  The nematode C. elegans is associated with a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in its natural habitat. C. elegans can be grown on monoxenic bacterial cultures, and hosts live bacterial colonies in its intestine. As in other animals, these gut bacteria have been shown to influence C. elegans physiology and health. We recently found that cultivation of C. elegans on non-pathogenic bacteria, and the presence of live gut bacteria, alter C. elegans chemosensory behaviors. The overall goal of this R21 is to take advantage of the experimental strengths of C. elegans to identify the molecular and neuronal mechanisms by which enteric bacteria influence sensory neuron function and sensory behaviors.  The specific goals are to: 1) Analyze the neuronal mechanisms underlying gut microbe-induced behavioral plasticity. 2) Identify host molecular mechanisms that mediate gut bacteria-dependent changes in chemosensory behaviors.  Innovative aspects of this work include the establishment of C. elegans as an experimental model for the study of the gut-brain axis, and analysis of the effects of enteric bacteria on sensory neuron and neural circuit function at high mechanistic resolution. Given the extensive conservation of many neuronal and physiological processes, insights from this work are expected to influence our understanding of the pathways by which commensal bacteria regulate diverse aspects of nervous system function in development and disease in other organisms."
"9198027","This is an application from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine to participate in the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (HF-CRN) as a regional clinical center (RCC) and as a Clinical Research Skills Development Core. Our Mid-Atlantic RCC includes Johns Hopkins University and the Lancaster Heart Group. As a composite, our sites follow a demographically diverse population of more than 6,000 patients with heart failure (HF), with more than 1,900 new referrals, 18,000 outpatient visits and 2,900 HF hospitalizations annually. The size and diversity of the existing HF patient population and referral base served by our sites will enable our RCC to identify and enroll patients in virtually any type of HF clinical research study. With this application, we propose a novel clinical trial examining the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) in patients with severe systolic HF. Recognizing that recent studies demonstrate a 30% rate of death or re-hospitalization and the failure of multiple in-hospital interventions, our study couples the logistical advantages of in-hospital enrollment with the need for a post- hospitalization intervention. The therapeutic promise of GLP-1 is based on the hypothesis that the failing heart is challenged bioenergetically and date indicating that myocardial insulin resistance is high among both diabetics and non-diabetics with severe systolic HF. Small published studies demonstrating that GLP-1 improves myocardial performance and outcomes in patients with systolic dysfunction associated with chronic heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and coronary bypass grafting further support the safety and potential efficacy of GLP-1. Each of these trials was led by Dr. Richard Shannon, the Chairman of Medicine at Penn, who will serve as a consultant for this application. In 360 randomized patients, the proposed study will examine the effect of GLP-1 on the primary endpoint of death or recurrent hospitalization and several secondary endpoints including myocardial contractile reserve assessed via dobutamine stress echocardiography, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life. This novel study of GLP-1 in a high risk population is well-suited to the organization and strength of the HF-CRN."
"9244452","Abstract The overall vision is to create a detailed understanding of mechanisms that regulate the blood clotting system, with a goal of elucidating the aspects of the clotting machinery that function differentially in hemostasis versus thrombosis. The conceptual framework is that human thrombotic diseases result from an otherwise protective mechanism (immunothrombosis) gone awry. In this view, hemostasis following vascular injury is driven by the prompt exposure of blood to preexisting, natural procoagulants such as tissue factor and collagen that are ubiquitous throughout the body and that induce rapid formation of hemostatic plugs. On the other hand, immunothrombosis is likely triggered and/or greatly enhanced by the elaboration of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs). An important concept is that many of these PAMPs and DAMPs that drive immunothrombosis are potential therapeutic targets that should have little or no involvement in normal hemostasis. In order to achieve this vision, we need to have a much better mechanistic understanding of what regulates blood clotting reactions, and in particular we need to identify and understand the DAMPs that drive thrombosis and coagulopathies. The proposed work will focus on three general areas within this general conceptual framework: elucidating mechanisms by which procoagulant anionic polymers such as polyphosphate (polyP) and nucleic acids trigger regulate blood clotting and inflammation; identifying key structural details that control the function of the tissue factor/factor VIIa complex; and achieving a detailed understanding of how phospholipid bilayers regulate blood clotting reactions. These studies will build on our prior success in this area and will advance the field."
"9215169","Idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) in premenopausal women is a rare disease (estimated United States prevalence ~125,000) that affects young, otherwise healthy women, many of whom sustain multiple fractures or have extremely low areal bone mineral density (aBMD). There is no FDA-approved therapy for premenopausal IOP. Using transiliac biopsies and high resolution imaging, we documented heterogeneous bone remodeling (very low to frankly elevated), disrupted bone microarchitecture and markedly lower bone strength at all sites in premenopausal women with IOP.In a small open-label, pilot study of 21 women with IOP treated with 18-24 months of the osteo-anabolic drug, teriparatide (TPTD), there were marked increases in aBMD by DXA and improved trabecular microstructure and strength. In 2011, the FDA Orphan Diseases Branch funded our clini- cal trial, ?A Phase 2 Study of Teriparatide for the Treatment of Idiopathic Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women? (FD003902) to test the hypotheses that therapy with TPTD will safely increase areal and volumetric BMD, improve bone microarchitecture and increase bone strength. Despite slow accrual, recruitment is nearly complete, with 39 of 41 women enrolled. This renewal seeks to complete acquisition of FD003902 endpoints in all subjects (Aims 1-3), and in a new Aim 4, investigate novel predictors and mechanisms of responsiveness to TPTD. In our pilot study, 4 women (19%), who were Non-Responders to TPTD, had ~5-fold lower bone for- mation rate (BFR/BS) on baseline bone biopsies. They also had higher baseline serum insulin-like growth fac- tor 1 (IGF-1), suggesting osteoblast resistance to IGF-1, a hormone that stimulates bone formation and is criti- cal for TPTD action on osteoblasts. Our preliminary data in women with IOP show that circulating osteogenic progenitor cells (COPs), isolated by flow cytometry from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and IGF-1 recep- tor (IGF-1R) density on COP cell surface increase with TPTD and that percent increase in IGF-1R density pre- dicts increase in spine and hip aBMD with TPTD therapy. We hypothesize that response to TPTD in premeno- pausal women with IOP is directly related to the increase in %COP cells and IGF1-R density on COP cells, that Non-Responders will have smaller increases in both parameters than Responders, and that COP cell surface IGF1-R density before and after 3 months of TPTD will predict individual response to TPTD. We will test these hypotheses on COP cells that are being isolated prospectively during FD00390. The Specific Aims of this Re- newal are to: 1. establish the efficacy and safety of 6 months of TPTD vs placebo, 2. determine the effect of 3 months of TPTD on tissue-based BFR/BS assessed by transiliac bone biopsy, and whether BFR/BS predicts TPTD response, 3. determine the extent to which 12 and 24 months of TPTD improves areal and volumetric BMD, bone microarchitecture and strength (stiffness), and 4. determine the effect of TPTD on %COP cells and IGF-1R density on COP cells, and the extent to which they predict TPTD response. Our objectives are to es- tablish safety and efficacy of TPTD and predictors of TPTD response in premenopausal women with IOP."
"9238988","Abstract Atypical speech rhythms, like those observed in children with childhood apraxia of speech, autism spectrum disorders, and stuttering, limit social interactions and can impede normal development and cognitive functioning. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to provide a developmentally sensitive model of language production that explains the emergence of typical and atypical speech rhythms. Current models of production are based on sophisticated descriptions of adult language. Influences from slowly developing speech motor, language, and other cognitive skills on speech plan representations and production processes have rarely been investigated. The paucity of research on such influences leads to fundamental gaps in understanding typical and atypical rhythm development, including understanding why young school-aged children do not chunk grammatical words with content words in connected speech to the same extent as adults. This chunking is important because it yields the rhythms we associate with prosodic words in adult language. The proposed research will investigate age-related changes in grammatical word production in typical development to explain prosodic word acquisition. The working hypothesis is that, once lexical stress is acquired, adult-like English rhythm production depends on a meaning- based chunking process at the intonational phrase level. The chunks evolve over developmental time into the supralexical production units we hear as prosodic words. We will test this hypothesis against well-defined alternatives using long-distance coarticulation to index production units. English-speaking school-aged children (5 and 8 years old) and adults will produce sentences designed to elicit either anticipatory or perseveratory lip rounding at different distances from a target content-word vowel. Metrical contexts will also be varied, and children's linguistic and cognitive development independently assessed. An audio-visual gating paradigm will be used to test for coarticulatory onset/offset at specific phonological and temporal locations. Perceiver agreement and acoustic measures will be used to gauge coarticulatory strength. The influence of specific linguistic and cognitive factors on the development of long-distance coarticulation will also be investigated. In all, the proposed research will accomplish 3 specific practical aims. It will (1) identify the scope of ?look ahead? in children's speech and factors influencing the development of anticipatory coarticulation across word junctures; (2) measure the strength of perseveratory and anticipatory coarticulation on grammatical word production across different metrical contexts and ages; and (3) assess the effect of long-distance coarticulation versus other factors on the perceptual coherence of grammatical-content word sequences. The results will inform theory and provide new insights into why speech rhythm is atypical in children with speech planning deficits. The research will also provide important normative data on the extent and strength of long-distance coarticulation in school-aged children's speech, and fundamental information about language and speech interactions in typical development. Finally, it will determine which cues most influence the perception of immature speech rhythm, with implications for clinical intervention."
"9331928","Project Summary/Abstract An increasing body of evidence indicates that the state of activation, phenotype and functional response of the microvasculature to alloimmune injury creates an intragraft microenvironment that both initiates and sustains the progression of allograft rejection. The unique anatomic location of the graft endothelial cell (EC) ensures that it is a target of the alloimmune response, and characteristic phenotypes either augment or inhibit interactions with immune cells. We recently identified DepTOR as a cell intrinsic mTOR-binding partner that modulates mTOR, MAPK and STAT-induced signaling in microvascular EC. In addition, we found that it is potent to regulate activation responses, angiogenesis and EC-dependent mechanisms of inflammation in vitro. These observations allowed us to conclude that the removal of its negative/regulatory effects are a mechanistic component of the EC pro-inflammatory phenotype. Our findings also suggest that augmented levels of expression and/or function of DepTOR may inhibit intragraft EC activation and their immunogenicity to sustain immunoregulation in vivo. However, formal testing of all these possibilities requires models in which DepTOR expression may be regulated in vivo selectively within allografts post transplantation. In this R21 proposal, we plan to develop and use novel DepTOR transgenic mice as donors of cardiac allografts in well-established models in vivo. We will also use cultured EC from transgenic mice for mechanistic studies in vitro. In this manner, we will be able to evaluate whether DepTOR is functional within allografts to promote long-term graft survival, and whether it effects are dependent on its ability to regulate EC-dependent mechanisms of rejection. Our central hypothesis is that cell intrinsic expression of DepTOR within the graft is immunomodulatory and regulates EC activation responses, EC-dependent interactions with CD4+ T cells and acute and chronic rejection. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims in which we will 1), determine the function of DepTOR within the graft, and its association with acute and chronic allograft rejection in vivo, and 2), determine the function of DepTOR in EC-dependent mechanisms of alloimmunity. Collectively, our proposed studies are novel and address clinically relevant questions and our approach provides for cohesiveness to translate in vitro findings into relevant transplant models in vivo. These exploratory studies will, for the first time, define a mechanism whereby the expression of a regulatory protein within the transplanted organ itself may be a determinant of the phenotype and outcome of the rejection process."
"9244690","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Young women are highly vulnerable to HIV infection, particularly in endemic areas, with young adults making up 30-40% of new HIV infections globally. However, there is very little understanding of why there is discordant HIV infection susceptibility in adolescents versus adults. Furthermore, there is currently no established pre- clinical model to assess any prevention or therapeutic interventions with consideration of age. Here we aim to create the first nonhuman primate model of SIV infection and susceptibility in adolescents. We will assess the mucosal environment of the female genital tract (FGT) of adult compared to adolescent pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina). We will determine whether there are baseline differences across the menstrual cycle in adolescent versus adults, and will also determine whether adolescent pigtail macaques are more susceptible to SIV challenge. We will use state-of the art proteomic, microbiome, immunological and in vivo imaging techniques to take advantage of the in depth sampling (multiple tissue and longitudinal) capabilities of the nonhuman primate model. We will determine whether signatures associated with SIV/HIV susceptibility exist in adolescents compared to adults. We will also validate these studies using human cervicovaginal samples from adolescent and adult women. Furthermore, we will assess the mechanisms underlying an altered mucosal environment in adolescents. This will provide the first pre-clinical macaque model of HIV infection in adolescents that can delineate infection susceptibility, correlates of infection, and potential mechanisms underlying altered female genital tract in adolescents. These studies will be a critical advance in understanding of the increased susceptibility of adolescents to HIV infection, and provide the first model for testing interventions in young adults."
"9294488","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The major human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that spends its entire replicative growth cycle within cellular vacuoles called inclusions. The chlamydial inclusion plays critical roles in establishing and maintaining a favorable intracellular niche for Chlamydia, and through the outer inclusion membrane of this vacuole, chlamydiae secrete numerous effector molecules into the host cell. The identity, function, and host interaction targets of the majority of these secreted proteins are not known, in large part due to historical challenges associated with genetic manipulation of Chlamydia. Recent breakthroughs in Chlamydia genetics have removed some of these major obstacles. Capitalizing on these advances, we have developed a genetic?proteomic system for C. trachomatis that selectively labels proteins in close proximity to the inclusion membrane, enabling the isolation and identification of these proteins by mass spectrometry. This system allows highly specific interactive mapping of the inclusion membrane proteome, even early in infection, and therefore makes possible the discovery of the bacterial and host proteins that comprise this pathogenic compartment in situ. The primary goals of this proposal are to: (i) determine the Chlamydia and host proteins that are dynamically recruited to the inclusion membrane at three stages of vacuolar growth, and (ii) extend the development of this technique for the identification of host molecular targets at two additional intracellular microenvironments targeted by chlamydial secreted proteins? the host cytosol and the inclusion lumen. These efforts are expected to derive a detailed proteomic map of host and Chlamydia proteins that are specifically recruited to early and late-stage inclusion membranes. The ability of this technique to capture interacting proteins in situ represents a major improvement over previous proteomic studies. We expect that the rich data generated from this project will yield novel insight into the cellular pathways and molecular factors targeted by Chlamydia during infection, and will provide the technical and biological resources for decades of future research focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms of targets identified by this project. Finally, we anticipate that this technology can be broadly translated to other bacterial systems for analogous investigations of their secreted effectors and host targets."
"9261925","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 4th most common cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer?related deaths in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that 134,490 people will be diagnosed and 49,190 will die from CRC in 2016. Although biologic agents have received much attention, the first-line chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic CRC remains based on a cytotoxic combination chemotherapy backbone of either FOLFIRI (folinic acid+5-FU+irinotecan) or FOLFOX (folinic acid+5-FU+oxilaplatin). It is noteworthy that only 18-25% of CRC patients respond favorably to irinotecan. Although the FDA-approved irinotecan has been used in clinic for 20 years, there is still no diagnostic biomarker to help oncologists decide which of the two regimens is more likely to be effective for a given CRC patient. Our studies suggest that the CULLIN 4B (CUL4B) ubiquitin ligase is a promising predictive biomarker, as well as a therapeutic target for tumor response to irinotecan. The CUL4B gene has been found amplified or overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors, including colorectal, breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Upon treatment with the camptothecin family of chemotherapy drugs, CUL4B, but not its paralog CUL4A, targets topoisomerase I (Top1) for degradation in cancer cells. As a result, CRCs with high levels of CUL4B expression induce excessive destruction of Top1, effectively attenuating the cytotoxicity of this chemotherapy drug. We hypothesize that excessive Top1 degradation by CUL4B is a major mechanism by which CRCs become refractory to irinotecan. Importantly, we showed that inactivation of CUL4B, but not CUL4A, effectively sensitized irinotecan-resistant CUL4Bhigh tumors to cytotoxic killing by Top1-directed chemotherapy drugs. This data suggest that CUL4B is an attractive target for intervention, potentially leading to sensitization of the 75-82% CRC patients who were previously resistant to treatment with a Top1-directed chemotherapeutic agent (e.g. FOLFIRI regimen). In three specific aims, we will (1) assess the value of CUL4B as a biomarker for treatment decisions of CRC using our unique collection of 572 well annotated CRC patient samples treated with irinotecan or FOLFIRI; (2) further develop and validate potent small molecule CUL4B inhibitors we identified via high throughput screening to increase their potency and pharmacological properties; (3) examine our lead CUL4B inhibitors that synergize with irinotecan to enhance its tumoricidal activity in vivo using CRC cell line xenografts, genetic WNT/APC-induced intestinal and colon adenomas, and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models of CRC. We are uniquely prepared for both Laboratory-to-Clinic studies to develop a predictive biomarker for irinotecan-based chemotherapy that is immediately applicable for informing decision- making of CRC management in the clinic, and Clinic-to-Laboratory studies aimed at validating CUL4B as a feasible drug target in pre-clinical CRC models, and developing a new therapeutic agent to render CUL4Bhigh CRC patients, which represent approximately 75% of all CRCs, sensitive to irinotecan-based therapy."
"9216504","Project Summary Background: Dyspnea is a common and debilitating symptom of advanced lung cancer, with approximately 50% of patients reporting marked breathlessness. Dyspnea is associated with impaired quality of life, decreased participation in social activities, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and even desire for death in patients with lung cancer. Unfortunately, limited data support efficacious treatments for dyspnea. Our multidisciplinary team recently conducted a pilot study examining the delivery of a brief, two-session behavioral intervention for dyspnea management in patients with advanced lung cancer. Trained nurse practitioners administered the intervention to patients in the infusion clinic to facilitate greater access and participation. We observed statistically and clinically significant effects on patient-reported breathlessness, quality of life, and depression symptoms, as well as high patient satisfaction with the intervention components and delivery. Study Aims: For the proposed project, we seek to build on our prior positive findings by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention in a larger sample of patients with advanced lung cancers. We will first train oncology nurses to deliver the brief behavioral intervention for dyspnea management, again at the point of care within the infusion clinic as this approach was central to the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in our pilot study. The specific aims of this study are to demonstrate the efficacy of the brief behavioral intervention for improving self-reported dyspnea (primary outcome) as well as quality of life, mood, and activity level (secondary outcomes) in patients with advanced lung cancer. Study Design & Methods: We will enroll and randomly assign up to 200 patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer (100 per study group) to receive either the brief behavioral intervention for dyspnea or usual care. The trial will take place at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Oncology nurses will deliver two, 45 minute interventions sessions for each participant within the infusion clinic. All participants will complete measures of dyspnea, quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as activity level at baseline after completion of the intervention phase at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Conclusions: Other than opioid medications, which offer little clinical benefit, data are lacking to support the efficacy of treatments for dyspnea, a highly impairing symptom in patients with advanced lung cancer. We plan to train oncology nurses in delivering a dyspnea management intervention that incorporates behavioral techniques shown to be effective for improving breathlessness and reducing stress in patients with cancer. By training medical clinicians to administer the behavioral intervention in the oncology care setting, we hope to maximize broad dissemination and patient access to essential symptom management. Data from this R01 will ultimately serve as the basis to apply for funding for a large-scale, multisite effectiveness and dissemination study of the intervention."
"9405273","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This program, presently in its 20th year of funding, supports training of predoctoral (5) and postdoctoral (3) fellows in the biology of pathogenic microorganisms and their interaction with the human host. Preceptors on this training grant work on bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause important human diseases and on the host immune response against these infectious agents. The principal focus is on the interaction of these microbes with the host and the processes whereby these interactions lead to disease. A central tenet for training is that trainees require exposure to broad, interdisciplinary areas of science to investigate the complex interactions between microbes and their hosts. Trainees are provided with conceptual and experimental foundations in microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, genomics, proteomics, chemical biology, and computational biology. Faculty preceptors (28 at present) derive from 5 academic departments, 4 research institutes, and 3 clinical departments, providing a broad base of interdisciplinary research expertise. Preceptors in this program are highly collaborative and interactive, affording trainees exposure to a wide array of methods and approaches to problems in pathogenic microbiology. Trainees are selected by a committee of faculty preceptors from a highly competitive pool of applicants using clearly defined criteria. Successful applicants report research findings at least annually at a department seminar and receive feedback and critiques from multiple faculty members. The program tracks the progress of trainees both during and after their support by the training fellowship. Mentors and trainees provide an annual report describing progress on the research project and on overall professional advancement. An important new component of training entails a yearlong series of Career Development Meetings that allow both pre- and postdoctoral trainees to learn about a variety of career options in science and to develop essential networks of contacts for entering such disciplines. A Steering Committee evaluates the success of the program on an ongoing basis and suggests alterations or improvements as necessary. The program has been very successful in attracting and supporting women and minorities and continues to set a high priority on training members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science. Program support is provided by the institution in the form of administrative positions and fellowships for predoctoral students during the early years of their graduate program and by an additional trainee stipend. This training program has evolved significantly since its initiation, adding a large number of new preceptors and greatly increasing the representation of cutting edge methodologies and novel approaches relevant to understanding how microorganisms cause disease."

Trainers participate in all training program activities including the recruitment into the program of Underrepresented Minorities. The trainers in the program share a common interest in cancer research and together cover both basic and translational aspects. A unique feature of the program is that it is unusually interactive and collaborative resulting in many program projects and collaborative publications involving trainers and trainees both within and between the three institute programs.         All participating trainers continually succeed in attracting excellent predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows including URM trainees to participate in the research program described. Each of the participating trainers successfully compete for mostly federal but also non-federal grant support in cancer research with over 62 % of the participating trainers supported by the NCI and the rest of the trainers supported by other cancer- related funding. Altogether, this training program offers training in cutting edge basic cancer research that will prepare the participating trainee for a productive career in science that will advance our understanding of the malignant process."
"9386337","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because research into both animal and human reproductive biology has such widespread implications for human health we propose to establish a new Reproductive and Developmental Sciences Training Program (RDSTP) that will train young scientists to pursue research in High Priority Program Topic Areas identified by the NICHD/Fertility and Infertility (FI) Branch and the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch. To provide training related to these NICHD target areas, the trainees in the proposed program will select from among four Areas of Specialization: Gonad and Gamete biology, Early Development, Reproductive Tract Biology and Gynecological Pathologies, and Environmental Factors impacting Reproduction, with multiple faculty trainers offering outstanding research opportunities and training environments in each of their specific areas of expertise. The Reproductive and Developmental Sciences program at Michigan State University has expanded extensively in the past six years with substantial institutional commitment, and is continuing to expand which provides a dynamic and rich environment for training young scientists. The RDSTP will pursue dual objectives of providing competence in emerging, cutting-edge, NICHD-recognized areas of high research interest, and providing essential skills for long-term career and professional development, with qualifications to participate in the broader roles of scientists  in our community. The latter will include developing verbal and written communication skills, management and mentoring skills, career advancement skills, teaching skills, and other expertise that will be essential for future success in both academics as well as alternate career opportunities. The training program is designed to ensure that our trainees are fully equipped to meet the challenges required to succeed in any professional environment be it academics or alternate career paths in which their scientific training can be fully utilized."
"9388619","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate's career goal is to become an independent research investigator and make major contributions to advance science in order to improve human health. The candidate is particularly interested in using chemical probes to understand how environmental toxins affect human health through targeting EET and related lipid-mediators signaling pathways. He has had excellent training in chemical biology, protein chemistry, and molecular biology throughout his career. He has applied his knowledge of using chemical probes to study biological effects to several key systems, including that of cytochrome P450, rhodopsin, and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). He now plans to further complement his training by learning to conduct specialized cell-based assays, advanced proteomics, to operate state-of-the-art accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS), and to analyze AMS data in order to identify the receptor(s) of EETs for the first time. During the K99 phase, he will attend courses and seminars, and will present at national meetings in order to improve his technical writing, presentation, teaching, and leadership skills. By the end of the award, he will have publication records and more than enough preliminary data to apply for R21 and R01 grants through the NIH. During the K99 phase, the candidate will be trained under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Hammock at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Hammock is an elected member of National Academy of Science who studies how environmental exposures affect human health. His research focuses on the xenobiotic enzyme called sEH, a major enzyme that degrades epoxy fatty acids. Dr. Hammock is the pioneer of using a multidisciplinary approach to characterize sEH and to study its role in human diseases like hypertension, inflammation, cancer, fibrosis, and neuropathic pain. Through inhibition of sEH, Dr. Hammock has shown that epoxy fatty acids from ?-6 dietary and ?-3 dietary acids play a vital role in several biological processes such as cardiovascular functioning and inflammation response. In addition, the candidate will learn to run specialized cell-based assays related to the cardiovascular system under co-mentor Dr. Chiamvimonvat who is an expert in cardiovascular disease. He will also learn advance proteomics from Dr. Gomes who also has an excellent track record in this field. Lastly, he will learn to operate AMS and to analyze AMS data under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Buchholz, an expert in AMS. UC Davis is one of the top institutions in the world for biological research. Its programs in environmental science and biological science are internationally acclaimed, ranking twelfth and twenty-fifth in the world, respectively. The institution hosts 800 faculty members who are specialized in biological sciences or biomedical research. The departments at UC Davis organize seminars, lectures, workshops, and discussion sessions on a daily basis, which will allow the candidate to interact with experts in different areas. UC Davis also has many core facilities that house a number of state-of-the-art instruments. These instruments are made easily accessible to scientists at UC Davis and training is always provided. Thus, the candidate can both expand the breadth of his academic knowledge and also learn to use specialized instruments that will help his research. The goal of this proposed project is to identify the receptor(s) of epoxy-eicosanoids, which are lipid signaling molecules. Epoxy-eicosanoids, also known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), are potent chemical mediators that play important roles in inflammation, vasoregulation, analgesia, and angiogenesis. The in vivo levels of EETs are greatly affected by exposure to environmental toxins, such as triclocarban (TCC), 2, 3, 7, 8- tetrachloro-dibenzodioxin (TCDD), and peroxisome proliferators. The changes in in vivo levels of EETs lead to physiological changes that could affect human health. The long-term goal for this project is to understand how the modulation of EET and related lipid mediators signaling pathways affect human health. Although there have been decades of research on this subject, the molecular mechanism of how EETs initiate the signal transduction cascade remains unknown. In the proposed research, the candidate will test the hypothesis that EETs induce the signaling pathway through binding to specific cell-surface receptor(s). The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify the receptors of EETs for the first time. To identify the receptor(s) of EETs, which are both lipophilic and labile, the intent is to use a combination of C-14 (14C) mass label, photo labels and AMS. AMS, which counts 14C atoms directly, is 100K times more sensitive than any of the traditional decay counting method. This dramatically increases sensitivity has several advantages that will strongly enhance this chances of identifying the EET receptors. The candidate hypothesizes that using AMS with the use of 14C ligands coupled with unique photo labels represents a new method to identify very low-abundance receptors with highly lipophilic and liable ligands. This project, when accomplished, will have a huge impact on basic science and public health. 1) Identification of the receptor(s) of EETs will allow us to bettr understanding the signaling pathway of EETs. 2) The identified EET receptor(s) will provide a way to screen for the environmental toxins that target EET pathway. 3) The method for receptor identification developed in this proposal will become a new method for general receptor identification."
"9244923","Two highly significant and challenging health care problems converge in the comorbidity of chronic pain and smoking. Chronic pain affects ~116 million persons. Among those with chronic pain, the prevalence of smoking (~50%) is more than twice that in the general population (~21%). This association is alarming. Not only is smoking the leading preventable cause of mortality, but clinical studies clearly demonstrate that smoking exacerbates both the intensity and associated impairments of chronic pain. Moreover, smoking rates are positively correlated with pain severity and its resulting functional impairment. Clinical observations suggest that chronic pain and nicotine use are intertwined in a positive feedback loop. Individuals smoke to relieve their pain, smoking exacerbates the pain, and individuals in turn continue to smoke or smoke more in an effort to alleviate the pain. In addition, persistent pain may diminish the rewarding properties of nicotine. With the rapid acceptance of ?vaping? nicotine as a ?safer? alternative to smoking, the comorbidity of nicotine use and chronic pain will persist as a significant health care problem. Systematic studies of the mechanistic basis for the comorbidity of nicotine use and chronic pain are lacking in the preclinical literature. This explora- tory R21 proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that chronic exposure to nicotine enhances the somatosensory components of pain, exacerbates on-going pain and increases the averseness of noxious stimulation following peripheral injury. To do so, it will use a new method for chronic, intermittent administration of nicotine by inhalation that mimics the pharmacokinetics of nicotine in smokers. It will determine how prior intermittent exposure to nicotine alters the organism's response to peripheral nerve or inflammatory injury using a battery of tests that assess heat hyperalgesia, mechanical hypersensitivity, on-going pain and the aversiveness of noxious stimulation. These measures will be made in the period immediately before injury, shortly after injury (acute pain) and again two weeks later (chronification of pain). In a complementary aim, autoradiography will be used to quantitate ?4?2 and ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and to determine how chronic nicotine, chronic pain and the combination of chronic nicotine and chronic alter these receptors. The dorsal horn, as well as cortical, midbrain, pontine, and medullary nuclei implicated in reward or in pain modulation will be surveyed. These studies will be conducted in male and female rats to investigate potential sex differences given that the prevalence of chronic pain is greater in women and women find nicotine more rewarding. Successful interventions against chronic pain in those who smoke or vape nicotine will require a much better understanding of the pharmacological and physiological bases for the feedforward relationship. Validation of a preclinical model of concomitant chronic pain and nicotine use is a necessary first step, and will provide foundational data to drive additional mechanistic studies. Insights gained from this work will also guide new approaches to abrogate the chronification of pain in other populations as well."
"9204855","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a heart failure syndrome that occurs in up to 50% of type 2 diabetics, and is a major contributor to mortality in this large  population. This cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction with hypertrophy that frequently transitions to gross systolic heart failure. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying basis of this syndrome is unknown. An important clue is that pathogenesis is strongly linked to hyperglycemia, but the absence of a pathway connecting hyperglycemia to downstream pathophysiological events has been a roadblock to progress in the field. We have discovered a new signaling pathway that may constitute an important piece of the puzzle. Hyperglycemia is known to induce the expression of Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein) in rodent and human hearts in vivo through a previously delineated transcriptional mechanism. Txnip has several traditional functions including (a) binding to and inhibition of thioredoxins, which are scavengers of reactive species, thereby resulting in oxidative stress; and (b) binding to and inactivation of glucose transporters, which functions as a protective mechanism during hyperglycemia. A third less studied action of Txnip is to induce apoptosis, including in cardiomyocytes, an event that could contribute to the transition from diastolic dysfunction to systolic heart failure in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, the molecular pathway by which Txnip induces apoptosis is not known. In an unbiased proteomics screen, we found that Txnip unexpectedly interacts with Bax, an important mediator of cell death. Further, increased Txnip levels (as would be seen in diabetes) conformationally activate Bax and induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, Txnip-induced apoptosis in the mouse heart in vivo is Bax- dependent. These results define the outlines of a Txnip-Bax pathway that may provide a link between hyperglycemia and the transition to systolic heart failure in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The goals of this project are to delineate the molecular nature of this pathway and to test its rol in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo. Aim 1 evaluates three potential mechanisms by which Txnip activates Bax: (a) the Txnip-Bax interaction; (b) Txnip-mediated inhibition of thioredoxins, resulting in oxidative post-translational modifications of Bax that cause its activation; and (c) Txnip-mediated inhibition of glucose transporters resulting in metabolic stress and Bax-mediated cell death. Aim 2 employs inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific Txnip and Bax knockout mice to test the overall significance of the Txnip-Bax pathway in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo. In addition, by genetically reconstituting the hearts of Txnip and Bax knockout mice with informative Txnip and Bax mutants, this aim tests the roles of the specific molecular mechanisms linking Txnip and Bax in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo. Elucidation of a pathway connecting hyperglycemia to cardiomyopathy would be a highly significant advance. Moreover, these studies possess high innovation as the pathway we are proposing was not previously known. The resulting knowledge may provide a basis for future specific therapies for diabetic cardiomyopathy."
"9197952","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates two processes of programmed mutagenesis undertaken by activated B cells that vastly increase the efficacy of antibody responses, whether in the context of infection or vaccination. In somatic hypermutation (SHM), AID diversifies the antigen-binding repertoire of antibodies by creating initiating lesions that are converted into point mutations within the immunoglobulin loci variable region exons, the exons that encode the antigen-binding domain. In class switch recombination (CSR), AID activity in immunoglobulin heavy chain switch regions leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that provide intermediates for exchange of expressed IgH constant region exons, which determine pathogen- elimination effector function.  We lack a definitive understanding of two functionally critical aspects of AID activity: how it is targeted to specific DNA regions, and how AID activity leads to different outcomes during SHM and CSR. This is a fundamental gap in our understanding of antibody maturation processes. Recent findings that the variable regions of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV (anti-HIV bnAbs) are extensively and necessarily hypermutated underscore the relevance of understanding these mechanisms.  We now propose to test the hypothesis that the DNA sequence of target substrates promotes specific AID targeting and influences the outcome of such targeting, and, in this context, to elucidate in detai the roles of particular sequences and motifs of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions exons (Aim 1) and switch regions (Aim 2). To this end, we developed a novel V(D)J passenger allele mouse model system and mutation mapping tools that efficiently measure AID mutation activity within a given DNA sequence. We will use hypotheses-driven approaches in which candidate sequence motifs are embedded in synthetic sequences and tested in our passenger allele system for effects on AID activity. In parallel, bioinformatics analyses of mutation and DSB data will be performed to discover novel motifs.  These studies should provide a wealth of basic insights into the mechanism of SHM and CSR and thus into the mechanisms that generate diverse and potent antibodies. Information will also be relevant to our understanding of off-target AID activity that contributes to oncogenic mutations and chromosomal translocations. Beyond that, proposed experiments may contribute to designing approaches to optimize immune responses such as those that promote or direct the maturation of highly mutated anti-HIV bnAbs along desired pathways."
"9243780","Project Summary Abnormal or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain leads to epileptic seizures that, when repeated or prolonged, can cause neuronal damage resulting in delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability and other neurological disorders. In neurons, action potentials are terminated by the inactivation of Na+ channels and by the repolarizing outward currents triggered by activation of K+ channels. One of the major potassium current in neurons is the muscarine-regulated M-current, a non-inactivating slow current that is activated at subthreshold voltages. The M-current, which is generated from the heteromerization of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels (IKM), activates in the time frame of action potential initiation, providing a crucial role in controlling neuronal excitability. The slow kinetics of activation and deactivation of the IKM (KCNQ2/KCNQ3) channel regulates the membrane potential and impedes repetitive neuronal firing. A growing number of inherited mutations have been found in the IKM channel that cause a wide spectrum of early-onset epileptic disorders ranging from benign familial neonatal seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathies. I will determine the molecular mechanisms by which a set of epileptic-inducing mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cause malfunction of the IKM channel. I will use a fluorescence assay, voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF), to simultaneously measure voltage sensor movement and gate opening during IKM channel activation in these mutations. Knowing the mechanisms that lead to defective channel function is essential to study how to modulate and ultimately restore function of these mutated channel. Furthermore, the IKM channel is an attractive pharmacological target to treat hyperexcitability-related diseases, such as epilepsy, because increasing the M-current stabilizes the resting and subthreshold membrane potential, thereby reducing membrane excitability. Lipophilic compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been shown to modulate neuronal function. In particular, PUFAs have been shown to improve the outcomes of epilepsy, therefore constituting very promising anti-epileptic agents. However, the molecular mechanism of action of PUFAs is unknown. For example, it is unknown whether PUFAs affect the voltage sensor movement, gate movement, or both. This is important because knowing the channel region where PUFAs act will allow designing PUFAs derivatives to more specifically tackle the IKM channel. Based on the molecular mechanism for each epileptic-inducing IKM channel mutation, I will assess, using VCF, which type of PUFAs variants would be most suitable to restore physiological channel activity in order to develop an antiepileptic drug. I will also use induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, a simple but powerful model, to test the efficacy of PUFAs on the derived neurons expressing mutated KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 to test both the mechanistic implications of the proposed work and the therapeutic potential of the PUFAs. The anticipated results of these experiments will provide the basis to mechanistically understand how different mutations cause IKM channel defects, and should show proof-of-concept that PUFAs can act as antiepileptic drugs. This would be a milestone toward mutation-specific treatments of epilepsy and other neurological disorders caused by mutations in the IKM channel."
"9404178","Project Summary The use of self-control in everyday life is critical to healthy, adaptive functioning but is often compromised by stress. Neurophysiological responses to stress are thought to alter decision-making circuits in the brain, leading to impaired emotional and behavioral control, and suboptimal decisions that can have deleterious consequences to both psychological and physical health. Exposure to stress is widely considered to be a major predictive factor to the development, maintenance and relapse of a range of mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, and those marked by pathological choice, such as such as obesity, gambling, and substance use. However, a mechanistic account of how stress influences the use of self-control during value- based decision-making is lacking. Recent research has proposed that since the exertion of self-control utilizes cognitive resources, it imposes costs on an individual that may lead them to deviate from goal-directed strategies to control behavior, relying instead on strategies that are less computationally costly but may lead to suboptimal outcomes. The current proposal aims to advance our understanding of how stress might influence decisions to use self-control strategies by measuring the costs individuals assign to self-control use. We will characterize the specific effects of stress on decisions to use self-control using behavioral measures, neuroendocrine measures of stress response, neuroeconomics, functional neuroimaging and computational modeling. Specifically, we will examine how individuals construct the cost of self-control after pre-exposure to stress using a validated neuroeconomic approach (Aim 1). Further, we will characterize the neural mechanisms underlying how self-control decisions are made under stress using model-based fMRI (Aim2). We predict that (1) self-control will be perceived as more costly under stress than under non-stress conditions, (2) the interaction between value-encoding brain regions (i.e., striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC)) and regions that support different aspects of cognitive control (i.e, dorsolateral PFC, anterior cingulate cortex) will register self-control costs in dissociable ways, and (3) that stress will selectively alter patterns of brain activity related to computing self-control costs in these regions. The knowledge obtained from this proposal will advance our understanding of the neurocomputational mechanisms that guide self-control decisions and how these mechanisms are altered under stress. These aims will facilitate the training goals of this proposal by offering training in behavioral economic theory, advanced functional imaging, and computational modeling. The proposed research will have direct implications both for stress-related anxiety and mood disorders and those that are marked by pathological choice, such as obesity, gambling alcoholism and drug addiction."
"9218153","Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects nearly 8 million people and costs >$21B in the U.S. per year. With reduced blood supply to their legs, some patients experience calf pain or fatigue with walking. Although PAD can be reliably detected by a low ankle blood pressure, and anatomic imaging (MRI or CT) of the narrowing arteries, to select the best treatment approach, we need a non-invasive test to assess calf-muscle function.  In this project, we propose to use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure blood perfusion in different groups of calf muscle, and repeat the measurement after a low-load and a high-load exercise of calf muscle. This stress-rest imaging approach is standard of care for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), and has never been successfully applied to PAD. Our preliminary results show distinct patterns of muscle perfusion between healthy and PAD patients, and thus great promise of the technique. In this 4-year project, we will first refine the perfusion imaging method, verify its reproducibility, and then compare the calf muscle perfusion measures in PAD patients against healthy age-matched healthy controls. This comparison will test the feasibility of detecting functional abnormality in PAD patients. After the baseline scans, the PAD patients will undergo a 12-week supervised exercise therapy, and then a post-therapy MRI scan. Comparison of the pre- and post-therapy measurement will indicate how the therapy improves the calf-muscle perfusion, and how this perfusion change correlates with increase in patient?s walking ability.  The long term goals of this project are to develop an improved diagnostic test for patients with PAD to predict who will benefit from therapeutic intervention. The stress-rest perfusion studies of calf muscle can be performed in conjunction with routine peripheral MRA to assess the functional significance of vascular stenosis. As with the routinely performed cardiac stress imaging methods, improved functional measures of calf perfusion should also prove useful in the testing and development of improved therapeutic approaches."
"9280850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Candidate Daryl Shorter, M.D. is a Staff Psychiatrist at Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), Medical Director of the Outpatient Clinical Trials Research (OCTR) program, and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) who has served as co-investigator for studies addressing medication development for treatment of disorders such as cocaine dependence and PTSD. Dr. Shorter believes the quality of addictions treatment for veterans can be improved by evaluating novel medications for addictions treatment through clinical trials, and using pharmacogenetics to identify subpopulations of patients who will best respond to treatment. In the short-term, Dr. Shorter hopes to obtain mentored grant support through the VA CDA in order to (1) hone skills necessary to design and execute medication clinical trials for addictions and pharmacogenetics, and (2) generate pilot data to obtain independent funding. In the long-term, Dr. Shorter hopes to conduct prospective multisite trials for addictions treatment, employing pharmacogenetics, and bringing novel agents into clinical practice.  Environment The research proposed in this CDA will take place in the OCTR program located at MEDVAMC. Directed by primary mentor, Thomas R. Kosten, M.D., the OCTR conducts medication trials for treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders. Given the affiliation of OCTR with Menninger Department of Psychiatry and BCM, and its location in the Texas Medical Center, this environment offers an extensive network of academic and research institutions and study populations Research The educational objectives of the CDA will be met through completion of the outpatient, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial of doxazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, for treatment of cocaine addiction. This 17-week trial will randomize 150 participants onto either doxazosin 8mg/day or placebo; subjects will present to OCTR thrice weekly for urine drug screen and completion of research activities. All participants will receive manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy. The a priori primary outcome is reduction in percentage of cocaine positive urines. Secondary outcomes include reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores, retention, and safety/tolerability. Also, a blood sample will be collected from each participant consenting to genetic analysis. The training plan begins with management of the Doxazosin RCT and data analysis, first using a frequentist, and following with a Bayesian, statistical approach. During phase II, time spent in the genetics lab will provide learning of pharmacogenetics techniques; after which, genetic subgroup analysis using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches will be performed. During phases III and IV, adaptive research design skills will be learned, with preparation of a protocol comparing two compounds (doxazosin versus another medication) for cocaine treatment. This protocol will be used as the basis for a merit review grant."
"9257486","Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. In the US, there are over 1.5 million new diagnoses and half million deaths annually. Over 90% of solid tumors (e.g., breast, colorectal) are characterized by chromosomal abnormalities including aneuploidy, the loss or gain of chromosomes, which contributes to the genomic instability that drives cancer development. Aneuploidy arises from defects in chromosome segregation during mitosis. In late mitosis, the intercellular bridge (ICB) that connects the two compartments of a dividing cell is severed by a process termed abscission. Abscission provides a mechanism for delaying cell division in the presence of missegregated chromosomes (NoCut checkpoint) that are trapped in the ICB. Thus, defects in abscission and the NoCut checkpoint result in aneuploidy and chromosome damage. Abscission involves the constriction and severing of the ICB membrane by the endocytic sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III). Assembly of this multi-component membrane complex is spatially and temporally regulated, and requires the targeting and fusion of ESCRT-III-carrying endosomes with the ICB. To date, however, very little is known about of how ESCRT-III assembly is spatio-temporally coordinated with endosome fusion and how it is linked to the NoCut checkpoint. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that are abnormally expressed in many cancers. Septins assemble into higher order structures that control the spatial organization of membrane and cytosolic proteins. In yeast, septins are essential for the spatial coordination of cytokinesis. In mammalian cells, septins are required for the completion of abscission, but their functions are poorly understood. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that septins regulate the assembly of the ESCRT-III complex. Here, we will determine how septins function in the recruitment and assembly of ESCRT- III subunits into rings and spiral filaments. We will test for septin roles in the spatial organization of the ESCRT- III complex and the endosomal delivery of its components. Importantly, the proposed work will examine how abnormalities in septin expression, which are common in cancer, affect the NoCut checkpoint. The proposed studies require training in cutting edge methods of light and electron microscopy (EM) including structured illumination super-resolution microscopy and correlative light and platinum replica EM. The overarching goal of this pre-doctoral fellowship project is to prepare for an independent career in the broader areas of cell and cancer biology. In summary, the proposed project will shed new insights into the mechanisms of cytokinetic abscission and septins, which are abnormally expressed in many cancers, but their roles remain poorly understood."
"9204852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide are afflicted with sickle cell disease (SCD), a hereditary blood disease caused by a mutation of the ?-hemoglobin gene. Once thought to be simply due to increased rigidity of sickle red cells, SCD pathophysiology is now known to involve numerous cellular interactions among sickle red cells, white cells, platelets, reticulocytes (immature red cells), endothelial cells, and soluble factors (e.g. cytokines, coagulation factors, etc.). Each of these pathologic interactions then contributes to microvascular occlusion, or vaso-occlusion, hemolysis (increased red destruction), and endothelial dysfunction. These key findings were primarily observed using in vivo animal models, which provide physiologically relevant but ultimately qualitative data. As SCD cellular interactions are inherently biophysical in nature, involving pathologic alterations in cell deformability and cell adhesion under hemodynamic conditions, quantitative methods are needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Moreover, due to lack of sufficient technology, the relative contribution of each of these specific interactions on vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and endothelial dysfunction are unknown. To that end, we have recently reported a novel endothelialized microfluidic in vitro model of the microvasculature that recapitulates and integrates this ensemble of pathophysiological processes at the physiologically relevant microvascular (<30 ?m) size scale (Tsai et al, JCI, 2012). This microvasculature-on-a-chip is ideally suited for the systematic and quantitative biophysical analyses of sickle cell vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and endothelial dysfunction. For this work, we will further develop and optimize our microvasculature-on-a-chip microfluidic system to test our general hypothesis that in SCD, specific cellular interactions have differential effects on vaso-occlusion, hemolysis and endothelial dysfunction, and these contributions will change under different conditions, (e.g., white blood cell count, hemodynamics, anatomic site, on therapy, etc.). Specifically, we will first further optimize and build upon our system to enable the simultaneous testing of multiple conditions including concentrations of specific blood cell subpopulations, pharmacologic agents, wall shear stress, endothelial cell type, and oxygen tension, a major effector of sickle cell vaso-occlusion; this will achieve the high-throughput efficiency required to obtain the large amounts of data we need to extract from each experiment. We will then quantify the contributions of these cellular interactions under a variety of condition to determine which dominate, and are therefore the most clinically relevant targets.  Finally, we will apply varying dosages of standard and novel therapeutic agents to quantify their effects on those specific cellular interactions and to establish our microfluidic device as a viable drug discovery system for SCD. Overall, these studies will create a parameter space for the multitude of cell interactions in SCD and provide a quantitative framework for clinical hematologists to generate hypotheses and rationally design clinical trials for future SCD therapeutics."
"9352978","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year mentored research project that has the goal of exploring the relationship between disease-protective major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic loci, gut commensal microbiota and autoimmune diabetes (T1D). This project will build upon the principal investigator's preliminary data and strong background in immunology and infectious diseases. The comprehensive career development plan combines a strong mentorship team with additional didactic and practical training in gnotobiotic, microbiologic and large data set analyti techniques, which will facilitate the PI's transition into a successful independent investigator. The proposed research will take place in the stimulating research environment of Harvard Medical School within the laboratory of Drs. Diane Mathis and Christophe Benoist. The mentor, Dr. Mathis, is a world-renowned immunologist who has successfully mentored many physician-scientists during her 30-year career. The research and career development of the primary investigator will benefit from the extensive scientific and mentorship resources available to him.  The MHC and HLA loci possess the strongest genetic association with T1D, in mice and humans respectively. Some loci such as the MHC class II E molecule offer dominant protection from T1D, but the mechanisms for this protection remains poorly understood. Commensal microbiota also influences the development of the immune system and affects the risk for developing T1D. The goal of this proposal is to explore interactions between gut microbiota, the MHC/HLA loci and the development of T1D in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) strain of mice and its closely related but non-diabetic transgenic line, expressing the protective MHCII E molecule (E?.NOD). Our preliminary data indicate that antibiotic disruption of the gut microbiota induces insulitis in E?.NOD mice. We have also demonstrated maternal transfer of protection from insulitis and T1D from E?.NOD mothers to NOD pups, suggesting transfer of protective microbiota from mother to pup. Therefore, we hypothesize that the diabetes-protective effect of the E molecule reflects an impact on the gut microbiota, which has a secondary influence on the immune system. To explore this hypothesis, we will directly test whether E?.NOD mice possess different microbes than NOD mice, and whether transfer of these microbes protects NOD mice from T1D. We will further identify these protective microbes and identify immune system components in E?.NOD mice that correlate with protection from T1D. To test whether the HLA alleles behave similarly we will explore the microbiota and gut immune system of NOD mice expressing human disease protective or risk-associated HLA alleles in place of their MHC genes. Ultimately, these experiments will shed light on the relationship between MHC and HLA loci, commensal microbiota and autoimmune diabetes. Moreover, identification of immunomodulatory bacteria and their associated immune system targets offers the potential for novel therapies for T1D, and perhaps other autoimmune diseases."
"9212081","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation proposal for Years 23-28 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) cooperative agreement, in response to NIA RFA #AG-12-001. We propose to continue core data collection on the steady-state design laid out in the two previous renewal cycles, and collect biomarkers and measures of physical performance in in-person interviews on the rotating half-sample design established in the previous cycle.        HRS provides a uniquely rich, nationally representative longitudinal dataset for the community of scientific and policy researchers who study the health, economics and demography of aging. It provides a research data base that can simultaneously support cross-sectional descriptions of the U.S. population over the age of fifty, longitudinal studies of a given cohort over a substantia period of time and research on cross-cohort trends. The HRS project creates a data system extending beyond the core survey data. One component of this extended data system consists of linkages to administrative data, including Social Security earnings and benefit records, Medicare utilization and diagnostic records, employer pension records, and the National Death Index. We plan to expand these linkages to include Medicaid records, links to Veteran's Administration data, and information on nursing home residents from the Minimum Data Set.

"9220287","Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, ?failure to thrive?) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images."
"9186548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim at investigating the molecular mechanisms of hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction of the endogenous antioxidant system of the thioredoxins (TrxS) in the diabetic retina. Our overall goal is to identify ways to rescue the activity of this critical regulator of cellular redox homeostasis in diabetes mellitus, thereby, preventing hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress (OxS) and chronic inflammatory processes. To date, hyperglycemia-induced loss of TrxS function has been attributed only to increased expression of the thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). However, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-rats) and human diabetic retinas, we have discovered that hyperglycemia promotes serine phosphorylation of TXNIP (TXNIP- SerP), nitration/inactivation of the thioredoxin reductase 1(TrxR1-NY) and deacetylation of thioredoxin 1(Trx1). These modifications are associated with decreased bioavailability of the reduced (active) form of Trx1, the operating unit of the system, and with TXNIP gain of function. We have also determined that TXNIP and Trx1 post-translational modifications, involve the activity of protein kinase C delta (PKC?) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), respectively, implicating for the first time HDAC6 in the pathogenesis of DR and disclosing a new function of PKC? in the diabetic retina. We have designed experiments aimed at validating our hypothesis that: in the diabetic retina, impaired function of TrxS results from TXNIP serine phosphorylation, TrxR1 nitration/ inactivation and Trx1 deacetylation. These modifications of the TrxS constituents will lead to impaired antioxidant ability, induction of inflammatory processes and progression to DR. We have designed experiments to be conducted in vitro on isolated retinal pericytes (RPC) and endothelial cells (REC) exposed to elevated glucose levels (HG) and osmotic controls. In vivo experiments will be conducted by using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-rats, a model of Type1 diabetes). Aim1. Test the hypothesis that PKC?-dependent TXNIP-SerP contributes to retinal OxS, inflammation and progression to DR. Aim2. Test the hypothesis that TrxR1-NY contributes to retinal OxS and progression to DR. Aim3. Test the hypothesis that HDAC6-mediated de-acetylation of Trx1 contributes to retinal OxS, inflammation and progression to DR."
"9378292","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cornea wounds can lead to scarring, hazing, and subsequent vision loss. Several biochemical signals, including extracellular nucleotides and growth factors play key roles in activation of wound healing programs. The discoveries of the molecular identities of wound induced signals prompted the development of therapies that aim to prolong the natural healing programs in order to minimize the danger of injury induced vision loss. However, these therapeutic approaches had only limited success. The lack of a detailed quantitative mechanistic understanding of the regulation of these paracrine signaling molecules prevents the critical assessment of current therapies and the development of the next generation of quantitative systems pharmacology therapeutic approaches. The goal of this work is to determine the regulatory mechanism that controls the spatio-temporal propagation of two key paracrine signaling molecules: ATP and HB-EGF. Each plays an essential role in the activation of wound healing programs. This proposal will capitalize on a novel microfluidics-based wounding platform we recently developed. The new device enables highly controlled wounding of epithelial monolayers without any fluid mixing and thereby generates real-time data of the spatio-temporal propagation of the Ca2+ and Erk pathways. We will use the new device in synergy with multiple computational approaches to dissect the paracrine signaling regulatory network that controls the propagation of wound induced signals. The specific aims are: (1) Elucidate the mechanism that controls the spread of initial ATP signals. (2) Dissect the mechanisms responsible for the spatial propagation of Erk pathway activation. (3) Determine the function of paracrine signals in reducing the noise in Erk pathway activation. In aims 1 and 2 we will construct and independently calibrate multi-scale tissue-level models that combine intercellular ATP and HB-EGF dynamics with intracellular the kinetics of Ca2+ and Erk pathway activation. The models will be used to test multiple hypotheses on the mechanism that controls the spatio-temporal propagation of ATP and HB-EGF signals to activate wound response signaling. In aim 3 we will use an information-theory approach to analyze test how the identified mechanisms contribute to the generation of a robust spatial distribution of Erk activation. The successful completion of these aims will close an important knowledge gap on the complex mechanism that regulates the activation of wound healing programs. The predictive mathematical models that we will construct and experimentally corroborate will provide an important tool in the design of future therapies that aim to augment existing wound healing programs to prevent vision loss due to corneal injury."
"9247642","PROJECT SUMMARY Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of bloodstream, lower respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in the United States. Demonstrating the broad tissue range and virulence properties of the pathogen, S. aureus also causes osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and a spectrum of toxin-mediated entities including staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, enterotoxin-induced gastrointestinal disease, and life-threatening desquamation caused by a family of epidermolytic toxins. Recent estimates suggest that S. aureus contributes to half a million infections per year in the United States alone, resulting in over 10,000 deaths. The annual economic burden of S. aureus infection reached $14.5 billion in 2003. To date, there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent S. aureus infection, and novel antimicrobial agents that successfully target this organism have been few. In the context of widespread disease that has been met with a paucity of highly effective, durable anti-infective strategies, it is imperative that we obtain a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of S. aureus pathogenesis. S. aureus alpha-hemolysin (Hla) is a pore-forming cytotoxin encoded in the genome and expressed by almost all S. aureus strains. Hla contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonia, primary and recurrent skin infection, and sepsis through its interaction with ADAM10, the toxin's eukaryotic receptor. Hla is a premier target of ongoing clinical vaccine and passive immunization studies. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive knowledge of how the Hla-ADAM10 complex injures a diverse array of cells and modulates tissue repair within the context of specific host tissue microenvironments, thereby enhancing our knowledge of disease progression host susceptibility. This knowledge will enable the rational translation of novel anti-toxin therapies to impact human disease. This proposal is based on four fundamental discoveries: 1) Through the use of cell-type specific ADAM10 knockout mice, we have isolated the effects of Hla on individual cells within specific tissues in well-defined disease states. 2) The actions of Hla are not merely a product of toxic pore-formation, but depend on toxin-mediated activation of ADAM10 and pathologic cleavage of native ADAM10 substrates. 3) We have demonstrated that the physiologic and pathologic manifestations of infection are a composite of Hla action on discrete cell populations, integrated in the tissue over time. 4) We have demonstrated that an anti-Hla antibody response is associated with protection against recurrent S. aureus infection in children. Through studies that reveal the precise mechanism by which the Hla-ADAM10 complex results in host cell and tissue injury, coupled with focused analysis of human susceptibility to Hla-mediated disease, we anticipate that these studies will enable refinement of clinical trials targeting Hla, and inform the approach to disease prevention and therapeutic intervention. Simultaneously, these studies will contribute more broadly to our understanding of bacterial pore forming cytotoxins."
"9277825","Abstract:  Zika infection during pregnancy is associated with fetal death and microcephaly. There is a desperate need for a maternal vaccine that can protect pregnant women and their babies from Zika. While rodents and other small animal models are suitable for many aspects of vaccine research, when it comes to vaccination during pregnancy, rabbits are the small animal model that accurately models the transfer of maternal antibodies developed after vaccination to offspring. Thus, the rabbit could be the only small animal model that can simultaneously test safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of maternal vaccines. While a 1950s study showed that Zika is immunogenic in rabbits, the effects of Zika infection during pregnancy is not yet known. Our goal is to characterize Zika infection in pregnant rabbits and determine if infection results in fetal pathology.  We hypothesize that pregnant rabbits are susceptible to Zika infection, and resulting fetal infection induces neurologic deficits and pathology. In Aim 1, we will determine if pregnant rabbits are susceptible to Zika infection when Zika is administered by a variety of routes that may model natural transmission of Zika in humans. Intravenous challenge will be used as a control, with intradermal challenge modelling mosquito transmission, intravaginal challenge modelling sexual transmission to women, and oral challenge modelling transmission by kissing or oral sex. We will determine if the virus is present in the mother's blood, urine, saliva, or breast milk and will also determine if the pregnant rabbit develops an antibody response to Zika. In Aim 2, we will follow the babies born to the Zika infected rabbits in Aim 1 to characterize fetal pathology after Zika exposure in utero. To determine if there is active infection of fetuses with Zika virus after exposure during pregnancy, we will determine if there is detectable viral RNA in stillborn or aborted fetuses and we will test placentas from live born offspring. We will then study the development of offspring to determine if there are any developmental deficits. All offspring will have a complete physical, neurologic, and histopathologic exam at 4-6 weeks of age to determine if there are neurologic defects or other Zika- associated pathology. This aim will allow us to characterize fetal associated pathology after maternal exposure to Zika virus in rabbits.  Rabbits are an ideal model for maternal vaccine development as they are one of only few species that models maternal: fetal immunology in humans. This grant will investigate their ability to model Zika infection in pregnant women and the resulting fetal pathology observed during the ongoing pandemic. Such knowledge would be very useful for elucidating the role of the rabbit in Zika pathogenesis research, and in the research and development of a maternal Zika vaccine to prevent the tragic effects of fetal exposure to Zika virus."
"9299372","Project Summary Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 cause millions of chronic infections. These viruses cause epithelial oral ?cold? sores and genital lesions, which recur lifelong due to reactivation from a latent viral reservoir in neurons. The epidemiology of genital herpes has undergone a significant transformation over the past two decades, with the emergence of HSV-1 as a leading cause of first-episode genital herpes. The rise of genital HSV-1 coincides with a decline in seroprevalence of HSV-1, particularly among youth, and with changing sexual behaviors (13, 23). This shift raises the possibility that HSV-1 may face new selective pressures and undergo genetic adaptation as it moves from the oral to the genital niche. We propose to conduct a genome- wide analysis of HSV-1 variation in human infections, to observe how the virus adapts to the human genital niche during the first year of infection, and to discern how the virus is affected by the laboratory culture that is required for further studies in vitro, or in vivo in animal models. These data will reveal the degree to which HSV-1 undergoes bottlenecks or develops new variations in humans or in culture. The experiments in this exploratory R21 proposal provide the foundation for a future R01 proposal aimed at investigating how HSV-1 genetic variations impact clinical disease outcomes in patients. Insights on viral genomic variation will be obtained using Illumina sequencing of longitudinal HSV-1 genital and oral shedding swabs, which are being collected as part of an ongoing clinical study, P01AI030731. In Aim 1, we will use sensitive enrichment and viral genome sequencing techniques to assess HSV-1 genome diversity directly from human shedding. We will compare HSV-1 genomes from genital and oral swabs, collected at primary infection and during any recurrences over the course of a year. These will provide insights on viral genetic diversity between individuals, as well as within-host diversity over the first year of infection. Since P01AI030731 includes sub-studies on mucosal and humoral immune responses during the first year of infection, this proposal will yield additional data on how viral antigen variation correlates with the epitopes detected in each person's immune repertoire. In Aim 2, we will address whether HSV-1 strains that are cultured in vitro accurately reflect the viral genomic diversity shed by infected humans. We will do this by comparing viral genomes derived from cultured stocks to the genomes derived from the matched swab samples in Aim 1. This will establish the foundation for future studies that utilize cultured HSV-1 strains for in vitro and in vivo animal studies of viral pathogenesis, antiviral drug discovery, and vaccine development."
"9193605","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The Panel Study of Income Dynamics is the most widely used dataset in the U.S. for studying how intergenerational processes contribute to individual well-being. This project designs 12 minutes of new content in two new modules-a Family Roster Module and a Family Transfers Module to be added to the ; 2013 PSID interview. These innovative modules will provides new, public-use data to understand the mechanisms by which economic advantage is transmitted across generations and makes the PSID the only long-term panel representative of the full U.S. population equipped to study life course and multigenerational exchanges of time, money and co-residence. The project has five objectives: First, we lead the design of new data modules that roster all living children and parents of the heads and spouses of PSID households, obtain basic socio-demographic information on each such relative and collect two types of transfers: a) recent time and money transfers between PSID Heads and Wives, their older parents, and their adult children and b) larger transfers made at any time in the past, including help with college expenses, first home purchase, and other transfers of wealth. Second, we use these data to analyze how families share resources, with a focus on the effects of wealth and unemployment shocks on transfers between family members. Third, we link a subsample of PSID children and parents with information on transfers collected in 1988 and in the new module in 2013 to: a) examine variation in giving/receiving across families at two points in time and b) assess whether children who received time or money assistance from parents earlier in life are more likely to give help to parents later in life. Fourth, we explore the relative importance of two forms of transfers that parents make to their adult children - investing in children's higher education and providing ; inter vivos wealth transfers - in generating well-documented intergenerational correlations in economic attainment. Finally, we use the information collected in the rostering of parents, parents-in-law, and children to explore the impact of attrition on the overall characteristics of the PSID sample, on the intergenerational correlations in attainment, and on estimates of intergenerational transfers of time and money."
"9379130","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): B-1 cells are murine B cells that are readily distinguishable from conventional B cells (B-2 cells), that preferentially localize in the peritonel cavity, are part of innate immunity, secrete natural antibodies in a T cell independent manner, and play important roles in the first line of defense against bacterial or viral infections, sepsis and atherosclerosis. Despite the importance of B-1 cells in host defense and homeostasis, their developmental origin is not clear. CD5+B-1a cells residing in the peritoneal cavity can be reconstituted by transplantation of fetal liver (FL) progenitors, but not by adult bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Thus B-1a cells are considered to be of fetal origin and the mechanisms that maintain B-1a cells in adult life without being replenished by adult HSCs have yet to be elucidated. The overall goal of the project is to confirm the contribution of HSC-independent embryonic B-1 progenitor cells into postnatal B-1 lineages and define the mechanisms that maintain B-1 cells throughout adult life.  We have reported that B-1 cells originate from hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) in the yolk sac (YS) prior to HSC emergence in the mouse embryo. We have also reported that B-1 progenitor cells are present in an HSC-deficient mouse model. Thus, we hypothesize that YS-derived (HSC independent) B-1a cells are maintained throughout perinatal and adult life. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will utilize a lineage tracing mouse model where one can mark HECs and their progeny at specific embryonic time point before HSC emergence by tamoxifen induction. We anticipate the ability to define the contribution of the embryonic-derived cells to adult B-1 cell pools in Aim 1. Mature B-1a cells display self-replenishing ability that is detectable by secondary transplantation. The molecular mechanisms that sustain this self-replenishing activity in B-1a cells are unknown. Bmi1 is a polycomb group protein that is critical for self-renewal of HSCs. We report that the self- replenishing capacity of Bmi1-/- B-1a cells is impaired, raising the hypothesis that Bmi1 plays an important role in B-1a cell self-renewal. We will elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which Bmi1 regulates B-1 cell self-renewal, identifying a novel candidate Bmi1 target gene in Aim 2. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop mouse ES culture system to produce functional transplantable mouse B-1 cells. We will compare ES-derived B-1 progenitor cell functions with YS/FL-derived B-1 progenitor cells. Our results will provide new insights into B-1 cell development and self-renewal ability and will provide a novel method to generate B-1 cells from mouse ES cells as a first step of potential cell therapy in the future."
"9192656","Project Summary/Abstract  The Principal Investigator?s (PI) goal is to be a scientist in an academic setting with a research program focused on understanding adolescent substance use and identifying key targets for prevention efforts. A comprehensive training plan was therefore constructed to systematically advance the PI?s training in: 1) developmentally-relevant risk factors, comorbidity, assessment tools, and sophisticated research related to social anxiety (SA) among youth; 2) developmentally-relevant risk factors, comorbidity, assessment tools, and sophisticated research related to marijuana use among youth; and 3) the development, implementation, analysis, and dissemination of prevention programs that target youth. Importantly, the proposed study is designed to complement the training program by helping the PI to refine relevant research skills while completing an initial test of factors related to adolescent marijuana use.  The proposed sample will include 120 youth (15-17 years) endorsing recent marijuana use. Among adults, SA is positively related to marijuana problems; however, no work has examined this among youth. To address this gap, the proposed study was designed to replicate findings with an adolescent sample in a controlled lab setting. Youth will be randomly assigned to either a peer rejection or neutral cue and then assessed on their degree of willingness to accept a series of simulated marijuana offers. Marijuana use problems, SA, and relevant risk factors will be assessed with continuous self-report measures and structured interviews at baseline. Together, SA and rejection are expected to positively relate to real-time marijuana use willingness and use problems. Marijuana use motives and history also will be examined as potential explanatory mechanisms by which SA and negative responding to rejection may lend to the development of problems.  The proposed project aligns with the strategic plan outlined by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 3 key ways. First, the aims of the research project are to gain a better understanding of risk for developing marijuana use problems before they occur through the dual examination of individual (e.g., SA) and contextual (e.g., peer rejection) factors in a controlled laboratory setting. Second, the novel application of this work to an adolescent sample ensures that the data from this project will be meaningful for prevention efforts- even if the specified hypotheses are not supported. Indeed, the findings stand to either replicate observations seen with adults or highlight features that differentiate younger, less-experienced users. As such, this study will lay the foundation for future work in this area that can lend to more targeted, and thus more effective, prevention programs. Finally, the project will serve as an important training opportunity for the PI through tailored training in the development of her independent research program targeting prevention-oriented substance use work among adolescents."
"9404676","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The immunologist of tomorrow must appreciate both basic and clinical immunology to effectively utilize modern tools of research in the pursuit of new knowledge about immune mediated and infectious diseases and their pathogenesis as well as for development of new vaccines and therapies against immune-mediated diseases. Training the scientist and the physician-scientist in immunology and its relationship to infectious diseases as well as to other related disciplines such as pathology, biochemistry, cell biology and biotechnology will be crucial for the future of immunological sciences. To facilitate the distribution of knowledge in the field of immunology, the Immunology Training Program goals are to provide fundamental and research training to 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral fellows with an immunology faculty of 20 preceptors. The program is unique in that it encompasses faculty from the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation as well as its strong focus on microbial as well as host immunology. The participating training faculty are particularly strong in the 4 subdisciplines emphasized in the Immunology Training Program, which include 1) Responses to Pathogens, 2) Lymphocyte Development and Signaling, 3) Inflammation, and 4) Autoimmunity. The faculty preceptors have interacted on the OUHSC campus for years, forming a network that is particularly suited to train a cohesive group of pre and postdoctoral fellows in molecular immunology. The program recruits students and fellows from national and international sources, has strong NIH funded research programs, and has new faculty and facilities, all of which foster an atmosphere of excellence in training. The predoctoral students are eligible for the training program after completion of their lab rotations and qualifying exam. The Immunology Training Program will provide in-depth enrichment in the 4 subdisciplines to the pre and postdoctoral trainees through immunology classes and retreats. Postdoctoral fellows are strongly encouraged to take coursework and to mentor predoctoral students to enhance their immunology experience. The Immunology Training Program advisory and selection committee selects the pre and postdoctoral trainees and acts in an advisory capacity. Since the beginning of the program September 1, 2001, the objectives of the program are being met to provide excellence in research, immunology course work, an immunology retreat, and an immunology journal club class for the trainees. The yearly interactive immunology retreat as well as the Immunology Journal Club class have been effective in bringing the pre and postdoctoral fellows together with the training faculty in an environment that fosters excellence. Our program has been and will continue to be important to prepare trainees for future careers in immunology."
"9198868","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensorimotor transformation is fundamental for survival. Neurons in many visuomotor structures in the oculomotor axis discharge an initial visual burst of activity to register the visual stimulus and later a motor burst to trigger a movement that redirects the visual axis to the object of interest. Given that such neurons project to the saccade generating circuitry in the brainstem, a long standing enigma of sensorimotor transformation is why the visual response is insufficient to trigger a movement while the second motor burst is. One leading theory states that the saccade is triggered when activity reaches a threshold. This view is unsatisfactory because the threshold level could be crossed by the visual burst also but without triggering a saccade. Another theory contends that movement onset occurs when variability in neural activity is reduced. Support for this hypothesis is based on variability measured across trials. This is not a feasible mechanism for neurons decoding their input spikes to decide when to trigger a saccade. Ideally, the decoding must be based on the structure of neural activity within a trial. We propose an innovative perspective - our central hypothesis - that saccade initiation occurs when an increase in firing rate is coupled with temporal stability in the population activity throughout the oculomotor neuraxis. More specifically, we suggest that the visual burst in all visuomotor elements is unstable and therefore cannot trigger a saccade, while the premotor burst is stable and initiates the movement when the firing rate crosses a threshold.  Temporal stability is defined by a metric that tracks similarty or consistency as a function of time within a normalized neural trajectory defined by a population of neurons recorded either simultaneously or serially. Preliminary data from superior colliculus and frontal eye field neurons recorded sequentially during the delayed saccade task indicate that firing rate is unstable during the transient visual response but remains stable during the premotor burst that precedes saccade onset. We propose to address the following emerging questions using a combination of electrophysiological and computational approaches: What are the dynamics of temporal stability profile when visual and motor bursts overlap or merge, such as during reactive and express saccades, respectively? Does temporal stability exhibit similar properties when analyzed over many neurons recorded simultaneously? Do insights on neural variability obtained from across trials (e.g., Fano factor, optimal subspace) and within trials (temporal stability) analyses complement each other? How would temporal stability be implemented in a generic downstream neuron? How can this decoder algorithm be incorporated in a circuit-level model of saccade control?"
"9207354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women in South Africa (SA) are experiencing the highest HIV prevalence (16-30%) and incidence (3 to 5%) rates in the world, with very high male to female HIV transmission rates (2 to 6%). Although sexual behaviors have been the focus of HIV prevention research, it is clear that these high rates cannot be explained by risk behaviors alone. Recent observational studies have identified that hormonal contraception (HC), and in particular injectable contraceptive (ICs) such as DMPA may increase the risk of HIV transmission in women and this risk is significantly higher in younger women (<20 years). Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2), has been shown to be associated with a significant increase in HIV infection in women. Given that ICs (DMPA and NET-EN) are the most commonly used contraception among young women in SA, it is critical we have more empirical data to understand the mechanism by which ICs modify the risk of HIV and HSV-2. We propose to conduct a prospective cohort study among 600 sexually active women aged 16 to 24 years based on current use of ICs or non-HCs (condoms, IUD) so as to assess: Aim 1: the impact of IC on incidence of HIV and HSV-2 and point prevalence of HPV and common bacterial STIs. Women will be tested for HIV every 3 months and samples for HSV-2, HPV and bacterial STIs will be collected quarterly, tested annually and all positive samples will be back-tested to ascertain the approximate time of infection. Aim 2: Through the use of computer assisted self-interviews, we will collect sensitive sexual behavior information from all women (N=600) during quarterly visits and assess impact of IC and associated risk behaviors. Aim 3: A subset of women (N=30), will be seen at weekly intervals for one menstrual cycle to assess changes in genital tract micro flora, and mucosal immunity associated with IC use as well as exposure to infections, controlling for changes in endogenous hormones. Discrete Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests will be used to estimate the incidence rates of HIV and HSV-2, stratified by contraceptive use. Cox regression models will be used to identify effects for fixed covariates at baseline (IC versus non-HC), and time-independent (demographics) or time-dependent (contraceptive exposure, changes in genital structure, immune cells, sexual behavior) covariates. Survival analyses will be used to assess the impact of IC on HIV progression (time to death, CD4 decline, etc.). Marginal structural modeling will be used for all recurrent and multiple events to account for the time-dependent confounding in our study. In South Africa, young sexually active women are at high risk for HIV and HSV-2 infection, as well as other common STIs, and a majority use ICs. These data will provide guidance on the safety and efficacy of ICs for women at risk for STIs and HIV, and assist in the development of new multi-purpose reproductive health technologies that combine reproductive health, HIV and STI prevention."

"9255693","Project Summary/Abstract Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect millions of people and burdens society with large socioeconomic costs. Despite the socioeconomic and health impact of alcohol dependence, there are only three treatments currently approved for AUDs, which are only modestly effective. Currently, the molecular mechanisms contributing to neuroadaptive changes that result in alcohol tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal are not fully understood. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from controlled drinking to alcohol dependence is crucial in order to identify novel drug targets to advance the treatment of AUDs. Recent evidence suggests that alcohol dysregulates pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the brain. Pharmacological or genetic manipulation of the TLR signaling pathway reduces alcohol intake and preference?suggesting that neuroimmune signaling could be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of AUDs. Therefore, the proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of an unexplored branch of the TLR signaling pathway (TRIF-dependent) and its role in alcohol abuse. The first aim will use mass spectrometry and phosphoproteomics to determine how alcohol alters neuroimmune kinase activity as well as the global kinome in brain. The second and third aim will use null mutants, viral-mediated gene manipulation and mouse behavioral models to test the functional role of TRIF-dependent signaling in regulation of ethanol consumption. Thus, the proposed studies were designed to investigate TRIF-dependent signaling as an untapped source of new targets for drug development and genetic study. This study will provide crucial new knowledge about an unexplored neuroimmune pathway and its role in alcohol addiction. Results from Aim 1 will determine global kinase dysregulation in alcohol use disorder that will facilitate development of new pharmacological targets. This study will also determine which signaling components of the TRIF-dependent neuroimmune signaling pathway are critical for regulation of ethanol consumption. By understanding how TRIF-dependent signaling can facilitate decreased alcohol consumption, results from this project will implicate interesting new pharmacological targets and facilitate the discovery of novel genes and pathways that might contribute to the initiation, maintenance, or progression of alcoholism. Furthermore, the results of this research may extend to other addictions and diseases that involve kinase dysregulation and neuroimmune signaling, such as ischemia, Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Thus, understanding common signaling pathways provides an opportunity for developing therapeutic agents that will work in the treatment of multiple conditions, thereby increasing the quality of life for individual patients.

Utilizing quantitative FI (qFI) concepts developed during the first funding period, and realized in the form of an intraoperative probe, concentrations of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) have been measured quantitatively in vivo in human brain tumors. These results are clinically profound because they indicate for the first time that diagnostically significant PpIX concentrations exist  brain tumors which are below the threshold of human visual detection - even in low grade glioma (LGG) - tumors previously found inaccessible with visual FI (vFI), despite the significant clinical impact to be gained from improving their completeness of surgical resection through FI technique. Our overall research plan for continuation outlines clinical and technical/ preclinical studies that will be pursued in parallel - a strategy that has proved to be successful during the current funding period and creates a framework for iterative exchange that informs the clinical and technical requirements for solving the resection challenges facing the surgeon. In the second funding phase of the project, we implement and evaluate preclinically technical advances (in Aim 1) designed to achieve wide-field quantitative FI (qFI) and wide-field depth-detected FI (dFI). We will also enroll patients into clinical studies of ALA-induced PpIX FI (in Ai 2) to generate the data required to determine the probability of tumor for a given quantitative value of PpIX concentration. These studies will set the stage for prospective clinical enrollments (in Aim 3) designed to evaluate the addition of qFI and dFI to visual fluorescence imaging (vFI) when surgical accuracy is evaluated intra- and post-operatively with conventional methods . We will realize the combination of qFI and dFI (in Aim 4) to quantitatively detect PpIX concentration at depth by incorporating spatial light modulation imaging in fluorescence as well as reflectance modes. These techniques will also be extended to emerging fluorophores with excitation/emission spectra covering near-infrared wavelengths, which may ultimately have more potential than PpIX, and to enable simultaneous quantitative imaging of concentrations of multiple fluorophores. By the end of the proposed funding period, we will have implemented and evaluated wide-field qFI and dFI techniques in human surgeries and expect to demonstrate that these innovations improve surgical outcomes when added to vFI in a prospective enrollment of patients with malignant glioma."
"9206901","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Stability in intimate relationships is of central concern to veterans and is crucial for their mentl health, recovery from illness, overall functioning, and quality of life. The VA is increasingly prioritizing support for intimate relationships through the promotion of recovery-based approaches that include partners and families. PTSD has a destructive effect on veteran's intimate relationships, leading to higher rates of relationship distress, problems with sexual function and intimacy, abuse, separation and divorce, and this is true for younger, as well as older, veterans. PTSD symptoms such as avoidance and numb disconnection, intrusive images and memories, and anger and irritability are incompatible with feelings of closeness and sexual intimacy. Sexuality is central to intimate relationships, self-esteem, and quality of life, yet thee are few studies of sexual dysfunction among veterans with PTSD, and none have been identified that take a biologically informed approach. Notably, the neuroendocrine processes activated in PTSD and sexual behavior are similar. The biological parallels between sexual arousal and activity and PTSD symptomatology may provide one basis for understanding problems with sexual intimacy and attachment. Sexual arousal mimics the physiological experience of fear, and once these associations have been forged it can be difficult to uncouple them. This grant builds upon a large literature on the neurochemistry and neuroendocrinology of PTSD and proposes the first in depth characterization of the problem of sexual dysfunction in veterans with PTSD. The proposed study employs a mixed-method, cross-sectional design to investigate biological and psychological correlates of sexual dysfunction in male OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans. Specifically, this investigation will assess distinct components of sexual dysfunction (e.g., lack of desire, problems with performance and consummation) and their associations with PTSD symptoms and severity and with endocrine markers, including catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) and glucocorticoid sensitivity, that are implicated in PTSD. One hundred male OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD who are currently in an intimate relationship will be studied. This study will also use qualitative interview data from 0 veterans to better characterize sexual dysfunction in PTSD. This investigation represents the first step in characterizing the psychobiology of sexual dysfunction in PTSD, and is highly clinically relevant for veterans. Understanding the psychological and biological underpinnings of PTSD related problems with intimacy and sex may help distinguish between avoidance of intimacy and inability to perform sexually, thereby directing treatment choice, contributing to the identification of clinically significant subtypes, and ultimately informing efforts to develop psychological and pharmacological interventions for sexual and relationship problems in PTSD. The information generated from this study will provide the necessary foundation for the development of a new intervention targeting sexual dysfunction in PTSD, to be pursued in a MERIT proposal by the end of the CDA period. Such an intervention has the potential to strengthen relationships and promote recovery from PTSD."
"9197315","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated ion channels have evolved to open and close in response to changes in the membrane potential and rapidly conduct ions selectively. The members of the family that longest eluded isolation were the voltage-gated proton channel, Hv1, and its relatively close relative, the voltage sensing phosphatase (VSP). Hv1 plays a central role in innate immunity and other physiological processes. The biological function of VSP is not known. This proposal focuses on 3 fundamental aspects to the function of these VSD proteins, which, despite their similarities, differ radically in their effectors: with Hv1 having is channel effector uniquely situated within its VSD, while VSP's effector is the only one so far to have its effector outside of the membrane, in this case on the internal side. Our aims for Hv1 are to elucidate its pore pathway, understand how it is gated, how the gating apparatus in one subunit influences that of the dimeric partner and elucidate the mechanism by which Hv1 detects the absolute transmembrane gradient of pH and uses it to regulate gating. Our aim for VSP is to understand how conformational sequences in the VSD induce conformational sequences in the enzyme domain to alter the choice of substrate. Our goal is to arrive at mechanistic molecular models of gating, cooperativity and modulation of the VSD by pH and modulation by the VSD of the effector. The proposed studies should provide insight into the function of VSDs across voltage-gated proteins and the new methods should be applicable to a range of other channels and receptors whose protein motions, subunit interactions and modulation by ligands are of interest. The proposed work is designed to elucidate the mechanism of function of the voltage-gated proton channel (which is fundamental to innate immunity, reproduction and epithelial transport, and appears to have a role in stroke and cancer) and its relative, the voltage sensing phosphatase. The approach employs several novel optical methods that should prove to be applicable to the study of a broad set of ion channels and receptors."
"9216858","Both exogenous (e.g., ionizing radiation) and endogenous (e.g., metabolic processes) factors are known to cause considerable DNA damage on a daily basis. Robust DNA repair mechanisms normally repair damage within minutes, but repair is not perfect. With each repair comes the risk of an error that could result in introduction of a DNA mutation contributing to increased risk of carcinogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of our program of research is that repeated exposures to daily psychological stresses may contribute to increased risk of cancer by repeatedly causing DNA damage. Support for a link between psychological stress and DNA damage comes from: 1) correlational studies in humans; 2) experimental stress studies in animals; and, 3) tissue culture studies demonstrating increased DNA damage after brief exposure to stress hormones, and prevention by specific neuroendocrine receptor blocking (e.g., with the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol). Critically lacking are experimental studies to establish that increases in DNA damage in humans can be caused by psychological stress and reduced by propranolol. The goal of the research described here is to address those gaps in our knowledge. A diverse sample of participants (50% women, 50% African American) will be exposed to a controlled laboratory social stress challenge (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST), which is the most highly validated, broadly effective, and widely used stressor in human biobehavioral research. Total DNA damage (primary study outcome) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected before and after exposure to the TSST will be assessed by single cell gel electrophoresis under alkaline conditions (the highly validated Comet assay) using a newly developed CometChip system. The involvement of beta- adrenergic pathways will be tested using an innovative ?Combined Propranolol/TSST Paradigm?, with one study group randomly assigned (double blind) to receive a single dose of a safe and effective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist 60 minutes prior to the TSST (Propranolol Group, n=80), while another will receive matching placebo (Placebo Group, n=120). Aim 1: To experimentally test the hypothesis that exposure to an acute psychological stress causes increased DNA damage in humans (Aim 1.1), while concurrently testing the hypothesis that these effects can be reduced by pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors (Aim 1.2). Aim 2: To investigate increases in blood levels of catecholamines as mediators of the effects of acute stress on DNA damage (primary hypothesis), as well as explore other potential mediators (e.g., cortisol). Aim 3: To examine key demographic (race, sex, age) and baseline biological variables (anti-oxidant activity, DNA repair capacity) as susceptibility/resiliency factors (moderators) of stress-induced DNA damage. The planned research will establish psychological stress as a cause of DNA damage in humans, providing critical support for new areas of research to explore: 1) effects of stress-induced DNA damage on cancer risk; 2) specific molecular mechanisms responsible; 3) more selective novel interventions to prevent such effects."
"9332614","PROJECT SUMMARY  Many chronic pain patients complain of abnormal sensitivity to multiple sensory modalities, including light, sound, and smell. The underlying neural basis remains a puzzle and these claims are often viewed with suspicion, since sensory acuity per se is not enhanced, nor is there amplified processing in primary sensory pathways. The central thesis of this proposal is that dysfunction of brainstem pain-modulating systems, already thought to contribute to pain in these conditions, is also likely to play a role in multisensory hypersensitivity. This hypothesis is based on our unexpected observation that a subset of pain-modulating neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the final output of an important brainstem pain-modulating system, respond to light. In three Specific Aims using single-cell recording approaches in rat, we will fully characterize the RVM response to light, generating stimulus-response functions and establishing the relevant spectrum. We will also determine whether photoresponsiveness of these neurons is enhanced in an animal model of migraine headache (where photosensitivity is well documented) or in a persistent inflammatory state. Finally, we will investigate ?top-down? modulation of photoresponsiveness from a higher brain structure known to contribute to stress-induced hyperalgesia and implicated in endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to mild stress. The present proposal brings together electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to determine how light engages pain-modulating systems, effectively converting a visual stimulus to a somatic sensation, producing discomfort and aversion. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of multisensory hypersensitivity, information critical to developing more appropriate treatments for migraine and other chronic pain disorders."

"9223010","Abstract Despite preventative measures, traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of death and disability in children. Minimal data exists comprehensively studying the incidence, demographics, and contextual factors that affect recovery. Major questions exist regarding the impact of post-injury disruptive behavioral disorders (DBD), which include attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). Recent evidence suggests that family and neighborhood context play an important role in recovery after TBI; however, this process is poorly understood. Studies have found an association between family functioning and outcomes following TBI but have not completely explained the relationship or determined if impaired family functioning precedes poor TBI outcomes. Neighborhood contexts are hypothesized to affect social conditions and opportunities, affecting recovery. Conversely, neighborhood concentration of poverty is negatively associated with health, including behavioral related sequelae such as ODD and CD. The proposed study is planned to provide an exploration of the contexts in which injuries take place in order to develop a more sophisticated, comprehensive framework to address the needs of children who have survived TBI. Using existing data from The Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI (ADAPT) Trial (target enrollment = 1,000), we will determine the incidence of DBD?s, which children are at risk for developing DBD?s, the impact of family, and the influence of service availability and neighborhood context. The aims of the proposal are to: 1) Conduct focus groups with community stakeholders to identify neighborhood level covariates. 2) Describe the epidemiology of DBD following TBI, and 3) Determine the relationship between family functioning and neighborhood factors on risk for DBD of children following TBI. The overarching goal of this R21 is two-fold: 1) to gain information on this important, understudied process, and 2) to develop this multidisciplinary group including community partners and stakeholders. This will allow us to submit a larger R01 to build upon the proposed work by more finely assessing DBD outcomes and measuring neighborhood influence."
"9209651","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a form of cellular stress that is experienced by our cells both under normal physiological conditions such as in professional secretory cells and disease states such as cancer, diabetes and neuro-degeneration. Upon facing ER stress, cells initially try to restore normal function by activating a conserved signaling pathway called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). However, if the stress is overwhelming and cells are not able to recover within a reasonable time frame, the UPR ultimately commits cells to programmed cell death. How cells make this life-or-death decision remains an exciting yet poorly understood phenomenon. Cancer cells exhibit high levels of ER stress due to their high rates of glucose metabolism and hypoxic conditions resulting in accumulation of under-glycosylated mis-folded proteins in the ER. The ability of cancer cells to adapt to high levels of ER stress and continue to survive has been correlated to their invasiveness/malignancy and chemo-resistance. Thus, to be able to design effective molecularly targeted therapeutic strategies, it is crucial to delineate the signaling mechanisms that endow cancer cells with a cyto-protective phenotype. In this proposal we aim to identify important proteins that play a decisive role in promoting cancer cell survival through ER stress. We will focus on a signaling protein called G?-interacting vesicle associated protein (GIV), which has been shown to be overexpressed and to promote survival and migratory signals in many types of cancer. Based on our preliminary data and other published work in the field, we hypothesize that GIV plays a crucial role in promotion of cyto- protective signals in cancer cells experiencing ER stress. To test our hypothesis, we will use a multitude of cutting-edge sophisticated biochemical, cellular, proteomic and molecular techniques to: (1) investigate the survival signals that GIV promotes during ER stress (2) identify and characterize ER-stress dependent protein-protein interactions mediated by GIV and generate a phospho-profile of GIV to understand the mechanism by which GIV gets activated during ER stress. Our results will potentially lead to important revelations as to how cancer cells gain a cytoprotective advantage during ER stress resulting in prolonged survival, and chemo-resistance. The successful completion of our proposal will advance the field in terms of enhancing our fundamental knowledge of a fascinating cell biological process as well as finding new and key targets for curbing cancer cell survival. In addition, our findings will also potentially shed light on molecular dissimilarities between the cellular response of cancer cells and that of the other diseases whose etiology involves ER stress-induced cell death."
"9225008","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tranexamic acid (TXA), a drug that stops bleeding, is the only drug treatment that improves survival in adults with serious bleeding after injuries. However, TXA has not been used routinely in children with traumatic bleeding because no studies have appropriately evaluated TXA for injured children. Such a study has the potential for significant impact in improving the lives of injured children and their families, if found to be successful. Our long-term objective is to evaluate the benefits and risks of TXA in severely injured children. We will achieve this by ultimately conducting two large-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trials of TXA use in severely injured children. One trial will evaluate TXA in children with severe injuries to the body (?torso injuries?, i.e., to the abdomen and chest) and the second trial will evaluate TXA in children with moderate-to- severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). However, conducting a clinical trial in critically ill children is challenging due to lower disease frequency and complex parent consent/child assent procedures. We therefore propose here to conduct a pilot study, designed similarly to the full-scale trials but with much smaller patient enrollment, to assess the feasibility of, and fill crucial information gaps for the two subsequent large-scale clinical trials. We will randomize injured children to one of three study arms: two different TXA doses or placebo. The specific aim of the proposed pilot study is to demonstrate the ability to efficiently identify and enroll children with hemorrhagic torso injuries or TBIs into a multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study evaluating these two doses of TXA and placebo. We will enroll 40 children who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria at 4 participating sites. To demonstrate the ability to collect outcome measures, we will collect the identical anticipated outcome measures for the subsequent clinical trials: total blood products transfused over the initial 48 hours of care (torso injury trial), and intracranial hemorrhage progression in first 24 hours and neurocognitive function at 6 months after randomization (TBI trial). We will also collect safety outcomes, specifically venothromboembolic events (i.e., blot clots in the blood vessels) and seizures within the initial 24 hours of study drug. Additional objectives of this pilot study are to: evaluate the ability to efficiently screen, identify, consent, randomize, and initiate the study intervention within 3 hours of injury, assess protocol adherence and variability of care in enrolled patients, and identify operational efficiencies with the potential to enhance the success of the subsequent trials."
"9398676","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adult nervous system must accomplish a vast variety of functions including processing environmental stimuli such as light, sounds, and odors, generating motion and learning, and regulating homeostasis. During development, neurons must wire into precise neural networks in order to drive these complex behaviors. Initially, neurons make grossly accurate connections and establish a coarse level of organization, and then these connections are refined in both number and strength based on neural activity. Activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for the developing brain to mature and have recently been implicated as a molecular basis for the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. The major goal of this proposal is to identify components of the molecular program by which activity refines developing neural circuits.  Research in the Shatz lab discovered a surprising role for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) proteins in activity-dependent refinement of neural networks. Observation of MHCI expression in neurons was unexpected because the brain had historically been considered an immunoprivileged environment and the well-established function of MHCI molecules is in the immune system where they are involved in the recognition of self versus foreign. The presence of MHCIs in neurons is additionally notable because in genome-wide association studies, polymorphisms in the MHC genomic cluster are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, and in fact the MHC locus has the strongest association with schizophrenia. The Shatz lab further revealed that two classical MHCI genes (H-2Db and H-2Kb) are regulated by activity and required for the synaptic pruning that refines initial connections in the developing visual system. However, there are more than 50 MHCI genes, and yet to date, only these two have been studied in brain.  I present here preliminary data that a non-classical MHCI, Qa-1, which has yet to be examined in the nervous system, is expressed by neurons in visual cortex. In the immune system, Qa-1 interacts with different receptors (CD94/NKG2s) than H-2Db and H-2Kb. I additionally present preliminary data that components of Qa- 1's cognate receptors, CD94/NKG2s, are also expressed by neurons. The central goal of this proposal is to use genetic, histological, electrophysiological, and biochemical techniques to elucidate functions of Qa-1 and its receptors in synaptic pruning and plasticity during development using the visual system as a model. I will specifically test the hypothesis that Qa-1 is a component of the pathway that executes activity-dependent changes in neural networks and that by interacting with different receptors than classical MHCIs, Qa-1 serves a distinct function in this developmental process. The long-term aim of this research is to contribute to our understanding of the molecular underpinnings for the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9235396","Parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma cause schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. There is no vaccine, and only a single drug (praziquantel) available for treatment and control. Many anthelmintics, likely including praziquantel, act on ion channels, membrane protein complexes that are essential for normal functioning of the neuromusculature and other tissues. However, few helminth ion channel families have been assessed for their properties and for their roles in parasite physiology. One such overlooked group of helminth ion channels is the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily. Members of the TRP channel family are widely diverse in their activation mechanisms and ion selectivity, but share a common core structure. They are critical to transducing sensory signals, responding to a wide range of external stimuli, and are also involved in other functions, such as regulating intracellular calcium and organellar ion homeostasis and trafficking. TRP channels also respond to endogenous agents, including those involved in inflammatory signaling. Our published and preliminary pharmacological and knockdown studies show that schistosome TRP channels can be targeted to impact normal neuromuscular and sensory function. More significantly, they appear to have novel pharmacological sensitivities. Specifically, our results are consistent with the schistosome TRPA channel (SmTRPA) having at least some of the pharmacological sensitivities of mammalian TRPV1 channels, particularly notable as there are no TRPV channels represented in schistosome genomes. Preliminary functional expression studies support this contention. We hypothesize that in schistosomes, SmTRPA fulfills some of the roles of missing TRPV channels. We also hypothesize that SmTRPA and perhaps other schistosome TRP channels regulate critical parasite-host interactions required for successful infection. This project will use parallel strategies to define the roles SmTRPA and other TRP channels play in schistosome biology, including parasite-host interactions, and assess SmTRPA channel function directly. Finally, we hypothesize that the schistosome TRP channel, SmTRPML, plays key roles in schistosome endolysosomal physiology that can impact autophagy and nutrient acquisition. Our studies will elucidate the biological roles and physiological properties of an almost entirely unexplored family of parasite ion channels, information which could in the future be used to provide novel candidate targets for new or repurposed antischistosomal agents. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Determine the role that SmTRPA and other TRP channels play in the schistosome life cycle, including in parasite-host interactions; 2) Use functional expression to test whether schistosome sensitivity to TRPV1 modulators is mediated specifically by SmTRPA; and 3) Elucidate the role of the schistosome TRPML channel in endolysosomal functions, including nutrient acquisition and autophagy."
"9223263","Project Summary  Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. On one hand, genomic instability of cancer cells promotes loss of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes. On the other hand, genomic instability renders cancer cells susceptible to radiation and chemotherapy. Recently, the concept of ?synthetic lethality? has been successfully used to exploit the genomic instability of cancer cells. For example, the DNA repair-defective BRCA1/2-deficient cells are highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. In this application, I propose a new synthetic lethal strategy to target cancer cells expressing APOBEC3A with inhibitors of the ATR checkpoint kinase. My proposed studies may reveal a key function of ATR in response to APOBEC3A-induced DNA damage. Developing a strategy to specifically kill APOBEC3A-expressing cancer cells will be a breakthrough in targeted cancer therapy.  My career goal is to obtain a research faculty position at a leading institute where I will dissect the mechanisms of APOBEC3A-causing genomic instability in cells. However, my successful transition to independence in this field would be significantly bolstered by augmenting my expertise in cell biology techniques with new training opportunities in mouse cancer models. It is with these acquired skills that I will be able to investigate whether ATR inhibitors can be used to specifically target cancer cells expressing APOBEC3A. The success of this project will be greatly enhanced by the outstanding collaborators that I have assembled to advise me throughout my transition to independence. In addition, the exceptional research environment available at MGH and the Harvard Medical School area has all of the necessary resources required for the proposed training and research studies. The K99/R00 award would provide me with the protected time needed for this advanced training and allow me to continue to foster my growth under the mentorship of Dr. Zou. I expect that the protected time provided by this award will allow me to elucidate the function of ATR in cells overexpressing APOCBEC3A and to determine whether ATR inhibitors (ATRi) can be used to promote synthetic lethality in cancer cells with high levels of APOBEC3A. In aim 1, I will elucidate how ATR inhibition leads to cell death in APOBEC3A expressing cells. In aim 2, I will determine what is the target of APOBEC3A in human cells. Finally in aim 3, I will investigate whether ATR inhibitors can be used to specifically target cancer cells expressing APOBEC3A. Despite my recent training in biochemistry and cell biology, I will need 1-2 additional years of training to establish myself as an independent investigator. Receipt of this award would not only allow me to expand my research plan, but also establish myself as a primary investigator in the field of cancer biology"
"9340738","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases caused by insufficient or abnormal blood vessel growth affect a wide range of tissues, and include heart and brain ischemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, and osteoporosis. At the heart of angiogenesis lies the inflammatory response, orchestrated primarily by macrophages. Changes in the behavior of macrophages have major effects on angiogenesis and vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds that are designed to replace damaged tissues. The proposed work has two major goals: 1) to define the relationship between macrophages and angiogenesis, and 2) to develop a novel biomaterial platform to control macrophage behavior in order to encourage vascularization by the body's own cells. In normal wound healing, macrophages first exhibit a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, and then switch to an alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Although angiogenesis is a part of normal wound healing, the relative contributions of M1 and M2 macrophages to angiogenesis are not well understood. M2 macrophages can also be subdivided into two different phenotypes, M2a and M2c, each with distinct but poorly understood effects on angiogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that M1 and M2 (both M2a and M2c) macrophages function synergistically and sequentially to promote the growth of new blood vessels. Co-culture experiments between polarized macrophages and endothelial cells will be used to investigate how their crosstalk affects both the M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages and the phenotypic changes in endothelial cells that lead to sprouting and stabilization of new blood vessels. A 3D model of angiogenesis that tracks the behavior of endothelial cells and pericytes over 5 days will be used to probe the effects of changing the timing, duration, and sequence of signals secreted by the different macrophage phenotypes. Finally, macrophage regulation of angiogenesis will be evaluated in vivo using novel immunomodulatory drug delivery systems designed to recapitulate the normal sequence of M1 and M2 macrophage activation. This project will investigate the mechanisms of macrophage regulation of successful blood vessel growth, which will enhance our understanding of how it goes awry in pathological conditions. In addition, this project will result in a novel and biomimetc approach to direct scaffold vascularization by controlling the actions of host macrophages."
"9385937","Project Summary Precise levels of the gene regulator Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) are known to be a key determinant for proper neurological development and function. The importance of balanced levels of MeCP2 is highlighted by the fact that a loss of MECP2 results in an Autism Spectrum Disorder known as Rett Syndrome; in contrast, duplication of MECP2 leads to a disorder known as MECP2 Duplication syndrome. While Rett Syndrome is an extensively well studied disease area, the molecular etiology of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome remains far less understood. This genetic neurodevelopmental disorder has a wide symptomology including stereotypy, hypotonia, severe cognitive impairments, seizures, and autism. Importantly, both of these disorders critically lack effective therapeutic treatment. Therefore, this research proposal has been designed to develop the candidate?s technical research skills that are necessary to conduct independent neuropharmacology research, while having a positive impact on the field of glutamate systems biology and neurological disorders. In rodent models of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome in which MeCP2 is overexpressed, increases in glutamatergic synapse formation in hippocampal neurons occur, as well as impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions in mice. Interestingly, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGlu3) has been shown to be involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive behaviors in mice, and furthermore, mGlu3 expression has been shown to correlate with MeCP2 expression levels in the brain. Therefore, an upregulation of mGlu3 may contribute to neurological impairments seen in MECP2 Duplication rodent models as well as patients. In support of this theory, we present preliminary data indicating significant increases in mGlu3 protein expression in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing MeCP2 as well as impairment in a form of synaptic plasticity known as long-term depression. It is hypothesized that MeCP2-overexpression causes increases in mGlu3 expression and function, which contribute to synaptic plasticity impairments and cognitive deficits observed in learning and memory paradigms. This will be directly tested by measuring mGlu3-induced second messenger signaling as well as mGlu3-mediated synaptic plasticity and cognitive phenotypes in an animal model of MECP2 Duplication syndrome. Taken together, these studies will elucidate new basic biology and physiology of mGlu3, while also identifying the therapeutic potential of mGlu3 modulation for MeCP2-related disorders."

"9316820","Summary  Our long-term goal is to develop a novel treatment for Tuberculosis (TB) which is one of the most devastating diseases worldwide, infecting ~1/3 of the global population and claiming more than ~1.5 million lives each year. The shortcomings of currently available TB drugs underscore the urgent need to discover novel compounds to effectively treat TB patients. The current ?short course? front-line regimen involves a cocktail of multiple drugs taken for 6-9 months. This protracted treatment stems from the difficulty of eradicating dormant populations of Mtb in various niches throughout the body. The emergence of Multidrug-Resistant (MDR-TB) and Extremely Drug Resistant (XDR-TB) strains of TB further complicates the control of this disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for potent drugs with novel modes of action capable of shortening the course of treatment and killing drug-resistant and dormant Mtb in vivo. To address this problem we will combine the chemical diversity of natural products (NP) and our capability to conduct whole-cell drug screening against Mtb under in vivo-like conditions to identify novel scaffolds to fuel the TB drug development pipeline. Encouraged by our discovery of numerous fungal NP active against both replicating and dormant Mtb in our screens of ~2500 fungal extracts, in Aim 1 we propose to characterize the potency and selectivity of active NP to identify high priority samples for deconvolution and identification of novel scaffolds with anti-TB activity. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that screening NP samples under in vivo- like conditions such as our in vitro dormancy model can reveal ?hit? compounds presumably acting on novel targets that are only essential, and thus vulnerable to inhibition, under stress conditions encountered in vivo. Aim 2 will focus on purifying the active components from the most potent and selective mixtures, determining their chemical structure, and conducting comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial activity and physicochemical properties. Potent and selective inhibitors of dormant, intracellular, and/or drug resistant Mtb that we identify in this project will serve as the basis for future hit-to-lead development of novel candidate therapeutics for TB."
"9190086","Project Summary/Abstract: RNAs play diverse roles in biology, but our ability to fully understand their cellular roles is limited by the lack of tools to study and manipulate RNA. Non-coding RNAs have emerged as key regulators in cellular biology and include both small interfering RNAs and micro-RNAs that regulate mRNA expression through Argonaute- dependent RNA-degradation and thousands of long-intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), which generally serve to modulate gene expression, epigenetic states, and post-transcriptional processes. The mammalian genome encodes tens of thousands of lincRNAs and while they have diverse regulatory roles in gene expression, especially in both the positive and negative directions in cancer, it is unknown whether lincRNAs play a significant role in cancer resistance. Although remarkable clinical effects are seen with the BRAF- inhibitor vemurafenib in melanoma, they nevertheless fail due to drug resistance. Genome-wide gain- and loss- of-function pooled screening have revealed many of the genes involved in vemurafenib resistance using in vitro cell line models of melanoma, but the role of lincRNAs in melanoma resistance is still unclear. While many RNA-targeting tools exist to study these processes, none are ideal. For instance, siRNAs suffer from poor specificity and are incapable of targeting nuclear RNAs, such as lincRNAs. Recently, we computationally discovered novel CRISPR-associated enzymes and identified a new family, C2c2, which had significant conservation of two HEPN endoribonuclease domains, suggesting the likely ability for C2c2 to cleave RNAs. I will combine biochemical and bacterial genetic techniques to functionally characterize C2c2, engineer the enzyme for mammalian applications, and use this tool for the interrogation of non-coding RNA mediators of resistance in melanoma.  In Aim 1, I will biochemically characterize C2c2 from Leptotrichia shahii and identify the key active residues for RNA cleavage. Validation of reprogrammable RNA targeting will be demonstrated both in vitro using purified protein and in vivo using E. coli. In Aim 2, I will screen 12 C2c2 orthologs to determine the most active RNA-targeting enzyme. I will then express human codon-optimized versions of the top orthologs in mammalian cells to demonstrate endogenous RNA cleavage and perform whole-transcriptome RNA- sequencing to evaluate the specificity of C2c2. In Aim 3, I will develop a genome-wide lincRNA library of C2c2 crRNAs and perform a knockdown screen in a melanoma cell line subjected to BRAF-inhibitor drug selection. I will validate the hits and demonstrate that they are capable of modulating sensitivity to BRAF-inhibitors.  This project will develop a reprogrammable RNA-targeting tool and investigate the roles of non-coding RNAs in melanoma resistance. The availability of RNA-targeting tool is useful for many applications and the understanding of non-coding interactions in melanoma resistance is essential for developing better therapies."
"9348504","Project Summary  Flow cytometry is an indispensable tool for interrogating the immune system in research, drug discovery and diagnostic applications. The platform has undergone tremendous expansion over the past decade and now, modern cytometers are able to analyze 10 to 40 parameters per single cell, for millions of cells per sample, and hundreds of samples per experiment. However, as the number of parameters, samples, and experiments increases, so too does the data analysis burden. Current flow cytometry software is unable to meet the needs of cutting-edge applications due to limitations in computational power and lack of advanced data visualization tools. In this proposal, we describe the further development of our cloud-based cytometry software that is built upon a proprietary distributed computing engine. Harnessing the power of elastic cloud computing, our solution can analyze data faster than all currently available applications, and can scale to handle even the most massive data sets. In this grant, we will further harden core features such as gating and compensation, implement data visualization tools that are directly connected to the raw data, and enable analysis across multiple experiments. The result of our work will be an end-to-end solution for advanced flow cytometry analysis, built upon a scalable, secure, and distributed cloud architecture that can meet the demands of current, as well as future, researchers."
"9259766","Project Summary/Abstract Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common, inherited disease affecting the world's population with a frequency of approximately 1:500. No approved treatment to slow or halt disease progression is currently available in the US. The disease progresses slowly to renal failure, typically in the 4-6th decades of life. However, for unknown reasons the rate of progression greatly varies from patient to patient even within the same family suggesting that environmental factors may affect disease progression. Recent results from animal studies suggest that renal insults are required - in addition to the gene mutation - for renal cysts to arise. However, rare forms of renal injury are unlikely to account for the constant pace of disease progression in humans.  Our results suggest that a much more prevalent form of sub-clinical renal insult is the trigger of renal cyst formation that determines the rate of progression in ADPKD: microcrystals that are sporadically lodged in renal tubule lumens. We show that deposition of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals in renal tubules leads to rapid activation of the mTOR and Src/STAT3 signaling pathways, both of which are also strongly activated in ADPKD. In addition, CaOx crystal deposition leads to rapid tubule diameter widening that can be blocked by mTOR inhibition. Our results suggest that tubule dilation is a purposeful, and previously unrecognized, protective mechanism that facilitates crystal excretion. After crystal clearance, tubule diameters return to normal within a week. However, in mice lacking PC1 - the protein affected in ADPKD - CaOx challenge leads to persistent tubule dilation that ?overshoots? to cystic progression. This suggests that PC1 is required to re- establish normal tubule diameters after insults. We hypothesize (1) that tubule dilation is an innate renal protective mechanism against tubular crystals; and (2) that this mechanism inadvertently acts as a trigger for tubule dilation leading to cyst formation in ADPKD. If correct - these ?ndings immediately open a new and highly feasible avenue for therapeutic intervention because well-established treatments for recurring nephrolithiasis (dietary changes, increased water intake, citrate) should also be effective in slowing the progression of ADPKD.  Using mouse and rat models of CaOx nephrolithiasis we will investigate tubule dilation and signaling pathway activation in response to crystal deposition and test whether citrate treatment prevents these effects (Aim 1). Using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic mouse models we will determine if tubule dilation is required for effective crystal clearance (Aim 2). Using conditional knockout mice for the ablation of cilia or PC1, respectively, we will determine if tubular crystal deposition acts as a trigger for cystogenesis (Aim 3). Using a mosaic PC1-KO mouse model and a rat model of PKD we will determine if crystal burden modulates disease severity in PKD."
"9310703","Project Summary/Abstract Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has increased in recent years, posing a significant threat to antibiotic therapy. ?-lactam antibiotics are the most often prescribed antibacterial agents. The most common mechanism of resistance is ?-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis, which renders the antibiotics ineffective. Because of the diverse range of substrate specificities of these enzymes, virtually all ?-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis. The design of new antibiotics that escape hydrolysis by the growing collection of ?-lactamase activities will be a challenge. It will be necessary to understand the catalytic mechanism and basis for substrate specificity of these enzymes. The objective of this application is to understand how amino acid sequence determines the structure, activity and evolution of class A ?-lactamases. The CTX-M ?-lactamases comprise a family of extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs) that efficiently hydrolyze the oxyimino-cephalosporin cefotaxime but not ceftazidime. Certain amino acid substitutions in resistant clinical isolates, however, have been associated with increased ceftazidime hydrolysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to understand the structural and biochemical basis for the hydrolysis of ceftotaxime by CTX-M enzymes as well as the altered catalytic activity observed in CTX-M variants. In addition, studies from the current funding period indicate that cooperative interactions between amino acid residues in and near the active site play an important role in determining CTX-M substrate specificity. How active site residues cooperate to catalyze reactions is an important question with regard to how enzymes function. It is well-established that certain active site residues work together, cooperatively, to achieve catalysis. However, the extent to which the active site functions as a highly cooperative, interconnected unit versus the extent to which it is modular is unknown. The extent of cooperativity between substitutions will be addressed systematically in Aim 2 using random mutagenesis of active site residues of CTX-M-14 in combination with deep sequencing of mutants selected for the ability to hydrolyze various ?-lactam antibiotics. Finally, KPC-2 ?-lactamase is able to hydrolyze nearly all ?-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems. It is not known, however, how KPC-2 is able to hydrolyze carbapenems while other class A ?-lactamases, although similar in structure to KPC-2, cannot. An unbiased genetic approach will be used to identify mutants specifically defective in carbapenem hydrolysis. This approach has the advantage of surveying for changes anywhere in the enzyme that decrease carbapenem hydrolysis. Detailed biochemical and structural characterization of the mutant enzymes will address the mechanism behind the unique catalytic properties of class A carbapenemases."
"9267352","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Asians are the fastest growing immigrant community in the United States and experience high rates of health disparities. South Asian children are at high risk for the two most common diseases of early childhood: caries and obesity. This application uses the Common Risk/Health Factor Approach (CR/HFA) to target risk factors for childhood caries and obesity. Our study, CHALO! (Child Health Action to Lower Oral Health and Obesity Risk) comes from the Hindi word that means Let's go!. CHALO is a multi-level intervention (see figure) that includes a randomized controlled trial of a home visit intervention, and a Knowledge Translation campaign. The primary focus is behavioral change in bottle/'sippy' cup use and dietary intake-- factors that are common to both caries and obesity. Unique cariogenic and obesogenic behaviors are also targeted. Secondary outcomes include caries incidence and growth. Research assessments when children are 6 (baseline), 12, and 18 months of age will include novel techniques for assessing feeding practices (i.e., iPad assisted 24 hour dietary recall) and caries presence and severity (i.e., intra-oral cameras) that were developed by our team. CHALO will be conducted in the metro NY/NJ area, home to a large low-income high risk South Asian community. An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 377 mothers of children 4-6 months old from New York City (n=3) and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in our primary care research network SAPPHIRE (SA Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research). The intervention includes: a) home visits with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up phone support; b) patient navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in South Asian communities and among professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in cross-cultural psychology, clinical trials, child nutrition, health education and caries. CHALO builds upon the team's prior and on-going funded trials of caries and obesity interventions in young children. Innovations include: use of CR/HFA to target twin child health disparities; under-studied South Asian immigrant sample; intervention at multiple levels of the Social-Ecological model; cutting edge measurement technologies; and social marketing and evaluation. If successful, the CR/HFA offers an efficient and potentially cost-effective means of improving child health in at-risk populations."
"9239881","Abstract  Immune checkpoint inhibitors like ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1) are revolutionizing cancer treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for developing new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no benefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is influenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic basis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor mutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually and technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to elucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our contribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint inhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and immunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive evidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. Should our work succeed, we envision substantial utility for similar studies for other cancers. Such an understanding will provide great insight into the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed precise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy."
"9406008","PROJECT SUMMARY  Antiviral drugs are a crucial countermeasure for influenza A virus (IAV), particularly in circumstances of increased IAV incidence or if a vaccine is unavailable (e.g., virulent H5N1 IAV). However, the emergence of IAV strains that are resistant to current antivirals1-6 (H5N1) underscores the need for new treatment strategies, particularly those that modify the host response. IAVs infect 5-20% of the US population with >200,000 hospitalizations and ~40,000 deaths annually. Morbidity and mortality are secondary to an intense systemic stress to the antiviral immune response particularly in those individuals with co-morbidities (i.e., chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases). Additionally, endemic IAV strains from other species (e.g., H5N1) can kill healthy individuals by a ?cytokine storm?. The emergence of pandemic strains is inevitable, as seen most recently with 2009 H1N1. Moreover, IAV?s ability to rapidly acquire increased virulence and efficient human-to- human transmission through genetic shift is a constant threat to the global population, and benign strains may rapidly evolve and cause severe morbidity and mortality. This application proposes to develop for use in patients a novel therapeutic gene knockdown strategy localized to respiratory epithelium by employing nanoplexes, an electrostatic complex of cationic polymers and anionic nucleic acids. Our preliminary findings have demonstrated that this antiviral therapy, inhibits IAV replication, decreases IAV induced lung injury and improves antibacterial host responses. This Phase I STTR application will optimize the fabrication and delivery of the nanoplexes and establish its in vitro efficacy (with respect to antiviral and IFN I stimulating activity) and toxicity. The subsequent Phase II STTR application will determine its in vivo efficacy and toxicity in mice and ferrets utilizing drug-resistant laboratory, epidemic, pandemic, and pathogenic strains."
"9237626","Project Summary/Abstract By providing real-time anatomic information to the neurosurgeon, stereotactic neuro-navigation has been shown to improve the extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar neuronavigation displays that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task- based fMRI depends on the patient's ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification and preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional taskbased fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation, which currently is the standard in pre-surgical planning and intraoperative mapping. Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Medtronic Corporation, the creator of the most widely used neuro- navigation system[s]. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package that will integrate rsfMRI analysis with extant anatomical surgical stereotactic navigation. The Specific Goals of this proposal are to 1) Integrate the MLP analytic methodology into the Medtronic StealthStation Navigation System, 2) Ensure the software is stable and the output is reliable, 3) Optimize the user interface for clinical applications. The expected outcome of this translation strategy will be an integrated navigation technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well-delineated localization outputs, an intraoperatively efficient user experience, and a technical flexibility that can scale to different health care environments. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with existing industry supplied clinical infrastructure. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon's understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enabling safer and more tailored approaches to improving outcomes."

"9240243","ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology."
"9098870","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diaphanous family of formin protein is important for nucleation and linear elongation and bundling of actin filaments, and operate downstream of p21 small GTPases of the Rho family. The roles of formins and related proteins during motility and invasion process of breast cancers are not clearly known, especially in relation to the downstream specificity of the RhoGTPase isoforms RhoA versus RhoC. Here, we will develop new fluorescent biosensors for Diaphanous family of formins pertinent to this important motility regulatory pathway, useful for molecular and cellular analysis of cancer cells during invasion. The current limitations to better understanding the molecular regulatory pathways controlled by formins including the Diaphanous related formins (DRF) that control and coordinate the motile mechanisms including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, protrusions, and invasive matrix degradation, are due to lack of sophisticated imaging technologies capable of specifically targeting these important signaling nodes in living cells. We will use these new biosensors in combination with our proven biosensors for the Rho GTPases to directly probe the mechanisms these mammalian Diaphanous formin mDia1 and mDia2 isoforms regulate during cancer invasion in invadopodia protrusions of metastatic mammary adenocarcinomas."
"9257574","PROJECT SUMMARY Bone is a preferential site of metastasis from prostate cancer (PCa). Age and obesity, conditions that increase adipocyte numbers in bone marrow, are risk factors for skeletal metastases from PCa. Marrow adipocytes are responsible for the secretion of a multitude of factors, such as lipids, cytokines, hormones, fatty acids, and glycerol, that have the propensity to influence neighboring cells. Our focus is on the interactions between adipocytes and tumor cells that have infiltrated the bone marrow. Specifically, we are examining how the secretion, transport, and uptake of adipocyte-supplied factors promote metastatic progression in bone. We have shown that PCa cells exposed to adipocytes undergo increased metabolic pressure towards glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation, a characteristic of the Warburg phenotype. We also demonstrated evidence of adipocyte-induced hypoxia signaling in tumor cells. Since it is well-established that both glycolysis and hypoxia can render tumor cells more aggressive and potentially more resistant to therapies, we hypothesize that adipocyte-supplied within the bone microenvironment cause a metabolic switch to glycolysis in PCa cells, leading to increased aggressiveness and survival of the metastatic tumor in the bone marrow niche.  We will test this hypothesis through the following two aims: 1) establish the contribution of adipocyte- supplied lipids to metabolic changes in tumor cells; and 2) determine the adipocyte-induced changes in the PCa cell fatty acyl lipidome and identify key lipid metabolites contributing to altered tumor metabolism and hypoxia. We will utilize in vitro and in vivo models of marrow adiposity in combination with lipidomics technology to examine metabolic effects of adipocyte-tumor cell interactions in bone. The main focus of this proposed project is to elucidate novel mechanisms behind chemoresistance and sustained survival of metastatic PCa tumors in bone and to illuminate therapeutic targets for this presently incurable metastatic disease."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged that residents of rural Appalachia experience among the nation's worst health and economic profiles, including disability and premature mortality stemming from elevated rates of heart disease and stroke, various cancers, diabetes, all of which are closely associated with suboptimal dietary intake, obesity, and overweight. Community members are particularly concerned about their children, who have among the highest rates of obesity, overweight, and suboptimal dietary intake in the nation. Eliminating these health disparities requires scientificaly informed community-engaged research to develop and evaluate innovative and sustainable programs and policies. For the proposed application, our community-research team will (1) use an innovative information technology CBPR method - Structured Public Involvement - to refine and tailor a package of pilot tested healthy eating interventions; (2) conduct and evaluate this package of interventions that were found to be feasible, culturally consonant, and promising during R24MD008018 and (3) build community capacity in social marketing, an innovative approach to enhance sustainability of the intervention. Our partners include the Community Farm Alliance, local school districts, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other community organizations. For the first aim, the innovative CBPR approach Structured Public Involvement will allow us to tailor the intervention while maintaining project fidelity. For the second aim, we will administer and evaluate three interrelated interventions to transform access to and intake of healthy foods for Appalachian children; (1) a school-based water campaign to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (2) healthy cooking classes to encourage healthy cooking on a budget; and (3).a farmer's market-based healthy summer feeding program. Finally, in Aim 3, we will administer a CBPR-oriented approach, social marketing, to enhance sustainability, a challenge for all behavioral interventions. Through the schools, we will train teachers and administrators to teach social marketing to students, who will be encouraged to develop marketing campaigns supporting healthy diets. All of these efforts will be developed, implemented, and evaluated in conjunction with our Community Advisory Boards. As one of our local stakeholders told us, If you really are what you eat, it's no wonder so many of us are unhealthy. By developing sustainable, evidence-based programming, we aim to transform consumption patterns and the eating environment so the next generation of rural residents can overcome pernicious health disparities."
"9414105","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Gram-negative enteric pathogens cause significant disease burden. To establish disease, many of these organisms translocate bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytosol. Shigella flexneri, the focus of this proposal, is a major caus of diarrheal illness, resulting in 165 million cases and 1.1 million deaths globally each year. S. flexneri translocates effectors using an apparatus known as the type III secretion system (T3SS), which is highly conserved among bacterial pathogens. Loss of the T3SS prevents virulence of Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and E. coli species, which demonstrates its importance for bacterial pathogenesis. Bacterial contact with the host cell surface activates the T3SS to deliver two different bacterial proteins to form the translocon pore in the host cell membrane. The translocon pore is required for subsequent T3SS-mediated translocation of effectors into the host cell cytosol. Bacterial contact with the host cell surface activates the T3SS, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for T3SS activation are unknown. To identify whether host factors contribute to T3SS activity, a genome-wide selection was performed. This selection identified a role for vimentin, an intermediate filament. Intermediate filaments are the least studied of the three major types of eukaryotic cytoskeletal filaments, and their role during bacterial pathogenesis is poorly understood. My preliminary data demonstrate that intermediate filaments interact with the C-terminus of the S. flexneri translocon pore protein IpaC. Intermediate filaments are not necessary for translocon pore formation, but are required for both efficient S. flexneri docking to host cells and for efficient bacterial effector translocation by T3SSs. The observation that translocon pore formation occurs without subsequent bacterial effector translocation in cells lacking intermediate filaments shows these processes can be dissociated, which allows a unique opportunity to study how bacterial docking impacts T3SS-mediated effector delivery. My overall hypothesis is that the interaction between intermediate filaments and IpaC alters the association of S. flexneri with the host cell so as to promote translocation of effectors. I propose to test aspects of this hypothesis with the following aims:  I) To assess the impact of IpaC interaction with intermediate filaments on downstream processes in  T3SS effector translocation.  (II) To characterize the effect of intermediate filament interactions with IpaC on processes associated with S. flexneri docking. This proposal will provide mechanistic insights into how intermediate filaments contribute both to docking by S. flexneri to host cells and translocation of effectors by its T3SS. Due to the highly conserved nature of the T3SS and its near ubiquitous requirement for the virulence of gram-negative enteric pathogens, the work proposed here is highly likely to have a broad impact on our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis."
"9309594","Project Summary: Hemorrhagic fever (HF) caused by Lassa virus (LASV) represents an important public health problem in its endemic regions of West Africa, and LASV poses also a credible biodefense threat. On the other hand, mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed arenavirus LCMV is a neglected human pathogen. of clinical significance. No FDA-licensed arenavirus vaccines exist and current anti-arenaviral therapy is limited to an off label use of ribavirin (Rib) that is only partially effective. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel anti-arenaviral therapeutics. We hypothesize that this task can be facilitated by identifying inhibitors of the arenavirus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) that directs virus RNA replication and gene transcription. The use of live LASV to identify candidate antiviral drugs is complicated by the requirement of BSL4 containment. To overcome this obstacle we have developed cell lines expressing LASV and LCMV functional vRNP where expression of reporter genes serve as accurate surrogates of vRNP activity. We propose to use these vRNP- expressing cell lines to develop virus free, cell-based assays suitable for HTS to identify inhibitors of LASV and LCMV vRNPs. For this, we will complete the following aims: Aim 1. To develop cell-based assays suitable for HTS to identify inhibitors of the activity of LASV and LCMV vRNP. We will use LASV and LCMV vRNP-expressing cell lines to develop cell-based assays (96-well format) suitable for HTS. Assay parameters will be optimized to be compatible with HTS: S/B ? 10, CV ? 10% and Z?- values > 0.5 based on Max and Min reporter gene signals corresponding to 0 and 250 M Rib, respectively. Assay miniaturization studies will be implemented to develop a 384-well format. Aim 2. To develop counter screen and secondary assays for hit validation. We will develop secondary assays, including cell-based infection with live LASV and LCMV to authenticate hits and rule out false positives including those related to toxicity, effects on Pol-II activity and interference with reporter gene activity. Aim 3. To perform a pilot screen using LASV and LCMV vRNP cell-based assays. We will work with the TSRI MSC to use the optimized 384-well format assays in pilot screens using the LOPAC, NIH Clinical Collection I and II, and Maybridge Diversity Set version 4 libraries. In addition, we will screen the high value Gilead nucleoside compound collection that has led to the discovery of inhibitors of viral polymerases that were developed into marketed antiviral drugs against HCV and HIV. Threshold levels for primary hit identification will be: ability to inhibit (? 50%) vRNP activity and lack of significant toxicity (> 70% cell viability). Candidate hits will be confirmed using the secondary and counter screen assays described in aim 2."

The mechanism of microbe inactivation is not well characterized, but the disruption of lipid membranes and mild oxidative damage appear to be involved. The process, which is also highly efficient against viruses, is considered to be very mild compared to other sterilization methods. Experimental evidence shows that damage to protein is limited, and that immunogenic epitopes can survive the process. In this project NovaSterilis will seek to optimize the supercritical CO2 sterilization process for broad and effective virucidal treatments while attempting to maintain the integrity of model proteins. The first goal is to fully validate the supercritical process against viruses as a method that could replace ?-radiations which fail at effective virus inactivation and damage sensitive products. The second goal will be to characterize and optimize the supercritical sterilization process for the sterilization of proteins. Proteins have become increasingly popular as vaccines, therapeutics, and in combination devices. Yet, their sterilization remains extremely challenging. In collaboration with the group of Bryce Chackerian at the University of New Mexico, and Dr. Stephen Eyles and Professor Igor Kaltashov at UMass-Amherst, the effect of supercritical sterilization on growth factors and recombinant vaccines will be studied with in vitro and in vivo functional assay, and will for the first time use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry to determine with great precision the effect of scCO2 itself or combined with a sterilant on the conformation and oxidation status of model proteins."
"9218187","Acute and chronic lung diseases remain the most life threatening causes of death and hospitalization in the pediatric population. Cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed to be the most frequent causes of lung failure in pediatric patients. Mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been used to bridge sick kids to transplant. These procedures can lead to poor post-transplant outcomes by their very restrictive nature on mobility. This project will develop a compact respiratory assist device for pediatric patients, the Pittsburgh Pediatric Ambulatory Lung (P-PAL) to replace ECMO as a bridge to transplant or recovery in kids with acute and chronic lung failure. The P-PAL is a wearable and fully integrated blood pump and gas exchange module that will be designed for implantation of inflow cannula and outflow cannula/grafts in the right atrium and pulmonary artery, respectively. The P-PAL will be designed for longer-term respiratory support (1-3 months before cartridge change-out) at 70- 90% of normal metabolic oxygenation requirements, while pumping blood from 1 to 2.5 Liters/min. The specific aims of project are 1) To modify the design and operational parameters of the P-PAL to meet requirements for blood pumping, gas exchange, priming volume, and form factor, 2) To build P-PAL prototypes along the design development pathway for bench characterization studies of pumping performance, gas exchange, and hemolysis, 3) To improve the hemocompatibility of the P-PAL by exploiting novel polymeric zwitterionic coatings that we have already begun to develop for our adult wearable assist lung, and 4) To perform acute and chronic studies in healthy lambs to demonstrate the in-vivo performance and hemocompatibility of the PAAL device and to study its interaction with the cardiopulmonary system."

"9275433","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus are the major risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, a deadly cancer whose incidence has increased more than 7-fold over the past three decades. For reasons that remain unclear, metaplastic Barrett's cells are predisposed to cancer progression. Although the precise molecular events underlying this malignant transformation are not known, chronic GERD appears to underlie the process, perhaps because GERD causes inflammation with oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage in Barrett's epithelial cells. The modern medical therapy of GERD is directed almost exclusively at decreasing gastric acid production with medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although the PPIs have been extremely effective for healing reflux esophagitis, these medications do not correct the underlying reflux diathesis, nor do they prevent bile reflux-induced oxidative DNA injury. This might explain why the frequency of esophageal adenocarci-noma continues to rise despite the widespread use of PPIs. Clearly, new medical treatments are needed to prevent bile reflux-induced oxidative stress and the malignant progression of Barrett's metaplasia.  Recent data suggest that esophageal adenocarcinomas develop as a consequence of GERD-induced oxidative genomic damage. Left unrepaired, oxidative DNA damage accumulates with subsequent cell cycles, leading to the genomic instability that is a strong predictor for cancer progression in Barrett's metaplasia. Maintenance of genomic integrity requires an appropriate cellular response to oxidative genomic injury, which is a key function of the p53 gene that is inactivated frequently during carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus. Oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage activate Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), a protein that transmits oxidative damage signals to p53 and p38 effector proteins. Data suggest that, in p53-deficient cells, ATM-induced activation of p38 is essential to cause G1 arrest, a process that prevents cells with damaged DNA from undergoing mitoses that would perpetuate oxidative DNA errors. Thus, agents that enhance this p38-dependent G1 checkpoint response might be used for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.  In both p53-intact and p53-deficent Barrett's cells, our preliminary data demonstrate that weakly acidic bile salts induce oxidative DNA damage, cause G1 arrest, and rapidly increase levels of APE-1 and XRCC1 (base excision repair [BER] proteins that correct oxidative damage). Weakly acidic bile salts increase phospho- p38 expression, which appears to be especially important for maintaining genomic integrity in Barrett's metaplasia, as evidenced by our finding that p38 inhibition abolishes the G1 arrest induced by weakly acidic bile salts. In addition, our preliminary data show that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a non-genotoxic, hydrophilic bile acid) hastens DNA repair in these cells. Those findings suggest a potential chemopreventive role for UDCA in patients with Barrett's esophagus. We hypothesize that, in metaplastic Barrett's epithelial cells, reflux-induced oxidative stress activates the p38 stress pathway to induce G1 arrest and enable repair of oxidative DNA damage, and that treatment with UDCA can enhance these response and repair processes. The aims of this study are: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms whereby oxidative stress caused by acid and bile salts activates p38 to regulate proteins that control the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint in Barrett's epithelial cells, and to determine if UDCA enhances these responses, 2) To elucidate the role of p38 in activating DNA BER proteins to repair acidic bile salt-induced oxidative DNA damage, and if UDCA enhances the efficiency of oxidative DNA damage repair in Barrett's epithelial cells, and 3) To determine the effects of bile acid-induced oxidative stres on phosphorylating p38 and other key proteins regulating the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint, and to determine if oral UDCA treatment enhances the expression of key BER proteins in biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia already collected from patients who completed our previously funded CSR&D Merit Review study."

The Program Project has three overarching aims: First, we will collect new data in four topic areas, each designed to enhance information in the PSID about: family context and wellbeing at critical junctures in the life course. New data collections include: 1) a new: listing (including basic demographic descriptors) of all children an parents of PSID respondents and their spouses/partners in core 2013 PSID. Recognizing the increasing complexity of families in America, the family roster will include biologic, adopted, and  step relationships; 2) a new module on family transfers to be collected in the core 2013 PSID interview that links to the family roster; 3) a new mixed mode (web/mail) module to capture retrospective childhood circumstances to be collected in 2014; and 4) a new supplement on disability, time use and wellbeing to be collected from PSID respondents aged 60 and older and their spouses/partners, which will support investigations into factors that buffer the negative effects of disability on wellbeing. Second, we will promote broader use of the PSID for aging-related science through a small grants program, several thematic conferences, the development of a set of online on-demand tutorials (or webinars), the enhancement of extract tools, and exhibitions at national conferences. Third, Projects will investigate pathways between childhood circumstances and adult health and socioeconomic outcomes; examine family transfers within a life course and intergenerational context; and provide a rich, national portrait of disability, tim use and well-being among older adults, identifying factors over the life course that buffer the negative consequences of disability on subjective wellbeing and exploring conditions under which giving time conveys positive wellbeing."

"9208051","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethanol (EtOH) consumption results in its metabolism to a toxic intermediate, acetaldehyde (AcH). This reactive metabolite is further metabolized to acetate by enzymes in the Aldh superfamily. During times of heavy alcohol consumption, such as during binge drinking episodes, AcH is not efficiently metabolized to acetate and AcH accumulates, leading to cellular damage and some symptoms of alcohol poisoning. While much of EtOH metabolism occurs in the liver, other cell types are increasingly being shown to metabolize EtOH and exhibit sensitivity to the effects of its metabolism. Stem cells are capable of metabolizing EtOH and many stem cell types express high levels of EtOH-metabolizing enzymes. Because of the carcinogenicity and teratogenicity of EtOH, stem cell metabolism is highly relevant to developmental diseases and cancer. Many of the genetic and bioenergetics circuits that typify adult stem cells are also present in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), making them a relevant model for studying the metabolic consequences of EtOH metabolism in stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms through which EtOH is metabolized in ESCs remain unclear. Compared to the adult liver, ESCs have different expression profiles of Aldh family members, with Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2 all hypothesized to play roles in EtOH metabolism in stem cells. Preliminary data from our laboratory has shown that Aldh1A2 transcripts are increased by administration of 1 M AcH and Aldh1A1 mRNA levels are decreased by 50 mM and 100 mM EtOH in ESCs. In addition, glycolysis substrates and precursors, and the acylcarnitine transporter SLC22A5 transcripts are increased following treatment of ESCs with EtOH, suggesting changes in energy metabolism. Consequently, we hypothesize that EtOH is metabolized by different Aldh family enzymes in ESCs compared to the adult liver, which leads to different metabolic phenotypes as a result of altered rates of AcH and acetate formation. We will address this hypothesis through a cell culture approach using shRNA technology and untargeted metabolomics. For Aim 1 I will determine which enzymes in the Aldh family metabolize AcH to acetate in ESCs. I will achieve this by knocking down expression of individual Aldh genes using shRNA against Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1A3, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2, and determining the ability of these enzymes to metabolize AcH to acetate once EtOH is added to the cells. In Aim 2 I will determine the metabolic signatures of ESCs following the addition of EtOH using an untargeted metabolomics approach. This will provide a high-throughput approach for identifying novel metabolites, cofactors, and pathways that contribute to EtOH actions in ESCs. Inhibition of Aldh activity using the Aldh inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde and by specific shRNA knockdown against individual Aldh family members shown to metabolize AcH will reveal pathways altered by the production of AcH from EtOH in ESCs. Completion of this project will increase our understanding of how stem cells metabolize EtOH and may provide insight into alleviation of EtOH-induced complications through dietary or pharmacological interventions."
"9392597","Title Understanding the Epigenetic Mechanisms Underlying Stress-related Neuropsychiatric Disorders Abstract Epidemiological studies provide mounting evidence supporting that environmental and experiential influences, such as stressful life events, interact with genetic variations and compound the risks for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD afflicts about 6.7% of the United States adults, but treatment options for MDD are limited and not effective. The objective of this proposal is to define the global epigenetic landscape associated with stress experience and assess the effect of locus-specific epigenetic changes on the manifestation of depression-like phenotypes. We propose to first establish sex-specific stress paradigms to apply in male and female mice. We will then take a genomic approach to identify the stress responsive epigenetic code in targeted neuronal cell types in the brain. Finally, we will modify and apply CRISPR/Cas9 technology to address the causal relationship between the identified epigenetic code to the expression of depression-like behaviors. With currently available state-of-the-art technologies and our newly developed, genetically modified mouse tools, we hope to gain an insight into the epigenetic mechanisms through which stress interacts with susceptibility genes and confers increased risk to MDD. Our proposed study will also allow greater understanding of the underlying causes of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders and provide the necessary foundation for improved diagnosis and intervention."
"9257819","Project Summary Type 2 diabetes (T2D) afflicts 9% of the global population and is projected to affect 30% by 2050 if current trends continue. Recent reviews by the National Toxicology Program and World Health Organization indicate that this rise in T2D cannot be attributed solely to the increasing rate of obesity. Exposure to obesogenic and/or diabetogenic chemicals, alone or in conjunction with other environmental and lifestyle factors, may play a contributing role. Numerous population studies have found an association between exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water and an increased incidence or prevalence of diabetes. These studies also indicate that metabolism of iAs (i.e. that facilitates clearance of iAs from the body) influences individual susceptibility to adverse effects of iAs exposure. Metabolism of iAs in humans occurs through enzymatic methylation, catalyzed by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT). Polymorphisms in AS3MT are associated with differences in iAs metabolism and with indicators of T2D. Methylation of iAs utilizes S-adenosylmethionine for methyl groups and folate is a dietary micronutrient that is required for SAM synthesis. Population studies find that high folate intake is associated with a more efficient iAs metabolism and decreased iAs toxicity. Thus, the efficiency of iAs metabolism, modifiable by polymorphisms in AS3MT or folate intake, may play an important role in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure. The proposed research will examine the role of iAs metabolism in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure, by studying As3mt-KO mice that cannot methylate iAs and restricting folate intake to decreased efficiency of iAs metabolism in wild-type mice. Additionally, this project will probe underlying mechanisms of iAs-associated diabetes, investigating effects on insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and promoter methylation of diabetes- associated genes. Preliminary studies found that As3mt-knockout mice, that do not methylate iAs, developed insulin resistance and obesity after exposure to moderate levels of iAs (~80-139 ppb) through laboratory diet. These data suggest that impaired iAs metabolism results in a diabetogenic phenotype. Thus, the specific aims of this project are to: 1. Compare the diabetogenic effects of low (~10 ppb) and moderate (~80-139 ppb) iAs exposures in As3mt-  knockout mice. 2. Characterize iAs metabolism and the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure in wild-type mice with restricted  folate intake. Data on the role of iAs metabolism in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure and underlying mechanisms will facilitate risk assessment of iAs-associated diabetes and will inform strategies for prevention or treatment (such as dietary supplementation) of this disease in susceptible populations."
"9231350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application seeks funds to conduct one more in-person follow-up of the Hispanic EPESE (Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly) during 2015-16. The baseline was originally conducted in 1993-94 when a representative sample of 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 and over residing in the Southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and California). At Wave 5 in 2004-05, a total of 1167 subjects then aged 75 and over were re-interview along with a new sample of 902 subjects also aged 75 and over drawn from the same region using similar procedures. The combined cohorts were followed up in 2007 (Wave 7, N=1542), 2010-11 (N=1078), and 2012-13 (Wave 8, N=744) when they were 82 and over. In 2010-11 we also interviewed 925 informants/caregivers of our subjects, two-thirds of whom were their adult children. We plan to re-interview the surviving subjects in 2015-16 and expect to have at least 500 aged 85 and over. We also plan to re-interview an informant/caregiver for each subject most of whom were interviewed in 2010-11. Thus in addition to following up our subjects to investigate predictors of mortality, disability, change in cognitive function, and institutionalizaion we plan to predict changes in caregiving arrangements over a five-year period. We are especially interested in how declines in the condition of the older subjects will be associated with changes in caregiving arrangements as well as the physical and psychological well-being of the caregiver. As in the 2010-11 contact we plan to contact the elderly subjects first and then their close family members we interviewed at that time. For deceased subjects we will obtain proxy interviews from close family members, most of whom are likely the caregivers we had interviewed. These reports will be confirmed with National Death Index (NDI) data as we have done throughout the study. Our study addresses a gap in the Mexican American family caregiver literature which has been mostly limited to small cross-sectional samples. As we have done in the past we will continue archiving our data with NACDA (National Archives of Computerized Data on Aging) and to encourage their use for doctoral dissertations, peer review publications and R03, R01, and other applications to NIA and other institutes by students and colleagues here at the University of Texas Medical Branch, the University of Texas at Austin, and at other institutions."
"9308278","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding how juvenile protective factors can influence heart disease in the elderly is of paramount importance. We have recently demonstrated that age-related cardiac hypertrophy can be reversed by exposure to a young circulatory environment, utilizing the experimental model of parabiosis. We identified the TGF-beta family member GDF11 as a circulating hormone, with increased levels of GDF11 in the blood of young mice compared to old mice. As described in this proposal, our findings are also relevant to humans, as low serum levels of GDF11 significantly predict increased mortality over the next 8 years in patients with coronary heart disease. The effect of GDF11 is not limited to the heart, as our newly published studies show that administration of GDF11 to old mice can restore skeletal muscle function. In addition, we have now published that GDF11 can improve angiogenesis in the brains of older mice, suggesting that the loss of GDF11 in older mice is an important factor in multiple tissues. These findings reveal that restoring circulating GDF11 in old mice toward youthful levels can reverse some of the effects of aging, and thus GDF11 may represent a juvenile protective factor. It is very plausible that there is an ongoing delicate balance that must be maintained between some of the TGF-beta signaling molecules and their antagonists. Follistatin like 3 (FSTL3) is a known TGF-beta family antagonist and since it lacks a heparin-binding domain, it is particularly interesting as a potential circulating inhibitor of GDF1. Thus exploration of the dynamic interplay between GDF11 and FSTL3 in the regulation of age-induced phenotypes such as cardiac hypertrophy could reveal important insights into this age-dependent hormonal system. Here we propose that increasing levels of FSTL3 in the circulatory system of young mice, which have higher levels of GDF11, can regulate cardiac hypertrophy (Aim 1). We also propose that increased FSTL3 can inhibit the beneficial effects of exogenous GDF11 (Aim 2). The proposed experiments are highly feasible and have the potential to provide understanding of the balance of GDF11 and FSTL3 in adult mammals that is critical to consideration of GDF11 as a juvenile protective factor. Our Aims are:  Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that increased circulating FSTL3 in young mice affects cardiac hypertrophy and gene expression. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that increasing levels of circulating FSTL3 regulates the response to GDF11 in the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy of old mice."
"9253641","ABSTRACT To combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, novel classes of antibiotics with new mechanisms of action are desperately required. Genome mining for novel natural products is quickly replacing traditional approaches to antibiotic discovery. Warp Drive Bio has sequenced over 135,000 actinomycete strain genomes from diverse sources worldwide, and our proprietary genomic database contains approximately ~3,500,000 secondary metabolite gene clusters. Importantly ~75% of cluster families identified in our database have yet to be reported in the literature. Our vast microbial genomics-based approach is innovative because it provides an unprecedented opportunity to discover entirely novel antibiotics with new mechanisms of action (MOAs). The focus of this project will be to identify, express, and test biosynthetic gene clusters encoding new classes of antibiotics with novel MOAs to combat current and future drug-resistant pathogens, by combing our vast genomics resources and innovative bioinformatics search with our validated genomes-to-drugs platform for natural products discovery. First, we will harness our extensive, complementary genomic resources to identify and clone 10 candidate neomorph antibiotic clusters. We term biosynthetic clusters that are novel as ?neomorphs,? and we have constructed a bioinformatic analysis pipeline of phylogenomic and chemoinformatic tools to assess novelty at the genetic and biosynthetic levels. We then will utilize our microbial genomic database to predict which neomorph clusters possess antibiotic activity, by searching for self-resistance genes within the neomorph cluster. Bacteria utilize a variety of self-resistance mechanisms to protect against the antibiotics they are actively producing, and this property can be exploited using genomic information. Our integrated bioinformatic analysis we will advance 10 candidate neomorph antibiotic clusters for expression and testing. A validated portfolio of synthetic biology techniques will be deployed for refactoring biosynthetic clusters to enhance the expression of clusters that are not expressed, or which are expressed at very low levels, to increase compound production. Finally we have developed a high throughput fermentation process, bioassay, and mass spectrometric infrastructure to analyze and identify neomorphs. Thus, by combing an innovative genomic search of novel biosynthetic clusters with embedded resistance genes, with our integrated genes-to-compound platform, we will identify, engineer, and screen candidate neomorph antibiotics to address the growing clinical need for new antibacterial agents with novel MOAs."
"9206098","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade positron emission tomography (PET) has changed the way disease is managed by providing a molecular imaging technique accessible to clinicians. Through PET FDG studies, tumors throughout the body can be located and characterized. PET, however, does not provide high resolution anatomical information. As a result, almost all clinical PET scans are now performed in conjunction with X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. Recently, there have been great efforts to combine MRI with PET to produce complementary molecular and anatomical data sets. MRI provides better soft tissue contrast and the potential for a wide variety of functional and spectroscopic information not available from CT. CT also typically accounts for over 50% of the radiation dose of a PET/CT scan. The approximately 28 mSv delivered by a PET/CT study can be a significant dose, especially for pediatric patients or cancer patients who require annual PET scans to check for recurrence. Producing PET detectors and electronics capable of operating in the presence of the MRI's strong magnetic and radio frequency (RF) fields has proven challenging. The strong MRI magnets can cause PET system to malfunction and the presence of PET electronics and conductive materials produces artifacts in MRI images. My project aims to take a novel approach to create an RF-transmissive PET ring. By adopting advanced technology from the field of optical telecommunications and also newly available silicon-based light-sensing technology, we hypothesize that we can transmit MRI radiofrequency (RF) signals through the PET system into the patient and PET signals out of the MRI bore while still preserving the image quality and accuracy of both MRI and PET. Optical fibers allow fast data transmission, are compact, insensitive to interference from MRI's static and RF fields, and do not require electrical  grounding. The fibers can be driven inside the MRI bore by compact non-magnetic VCSEL lasers designed for high speed telecommunications. This approach enables the PET to be inserted into any existing MRI system without requiring modifications to the latter. If successful,  this would greatly reduce the cost of achieving an integrated PET/MRI system, thereby making it more widely available. My goal is to build a ring of 16 PET detector modules with a custom RF receiver coil as a prototype system. If successful, my work could be the basis for a new powerful imaging tool."
"9228453","Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ?6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist."
"9385074","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to identify therapeutics that accelerate the recovery from acute organ failure. Cell injury and death induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), drugs, toxicants, and trauma lead to failure of many organs, including the kidney. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common consequence of these insults and a major mechanism of cell injury and death. The majority of research in the field of acute kidney injury (AKI) has focused on the events that initiate renal dysfunction, but therapeutic agents are lacking. This suggests that more successful therapies require the examination of new targets and a focus on accelerating recovery from AKI. We recently determined that mice subjected to bilateral renal I/R induced AKI and rats subjected to myoglobinuric AKI had elevated serum creatinine 24 h after injury which partially recovered over six days post- injury. Mitochondrial electron transport chain and ATP synthesis proteins were depleted 24 h after injury and did not recover over six days, revealing persistent disruption of mitochondrial function after AKI. Consequently, we propose that therapeutics that increase mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) will promote recovery from AKI. As part of our drug discovery program to identify drugs that induce MB we identified formoterol, a specific long- acting b2-adrenergic receptor agonist (b2-AR), was a potent and efficacious inducer of MB in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC). Formoterol is a FDA-approved drug used to treat asthma. Additional studies revealed that formoterol induced MB in the kidneys of mice at a low dose. However, the signaling pathway(s) responsible for formoterol-induced MB has not been elucidated. Finally, preliminary studies demonstrated that mice treated with formoterol 24 h after I/R, when renal dysfunction is established, accelerated recovery of [mitochondrial and] renal function. We hypothesize that formoterol induces MB through the b2-AR and that formoterol accelerates recovery of [mitochondrial and] renal function following I/R in mice. To address this hypothesis we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Elucidate the signaling pathway(s) of formoterol- induced MB in RPTC [and following oxidant injury in RPTC], 2) Determine efficacy, potency and mechanism of formoterol-induced MB in mice, and 3) Elucidate the effects of formoterol on the recovery of mitochondrial and renal function following renal I/R-induced AKI in vivo. Successful completion of these experiments will advance the field by 1) identifying the precise signaling pathway that induces MB through b2-AR, 2) demonstrating that stimulating the recovery of mitochondrial function results in the acceleration of recovery of renal function, and 3) providing a rapidly clinically translatable treatment for AKI."

The post-doctoral fellow will be using a unique model, the leopard gecko, for this project. There are two main benefits to using reptiles as opposed to the more typical model, the mouse. First, reptiles are amniotes and thus share a common ancestry with mammals. What we learn in reptiles is relevant for humans. Second, tooth replacement in reptiles is on-going, independent of wear or injury and is rapid (30-90 days) thus it is feasible to study the process in a lab setting. In contrast, mammals have at most two sets of teeth and usually the second generation continues to form well into the post-natal period. The first question to be addressed is what is the precise timing and pattern of tooth replacement in healthy adult reptiles? To answer these questions, the leopard gecko is used as the model. These animals are easy to handle and it is possible to adapt many dental procedures used for humans to their smaller mouths. Miniature, serial wax bites and ?CT scans will be taken over a 6 month period and measurements of when teeth are lost and replaced will be taken. The tooth replacement phenotypes will then be correlated with the expression of genes in the dental tissues. We are interested in finding genes that are periodically expressed along the length of the jaw since some of these may coordinate tooth spacing and timing of induction of replacement teeth. The second question to be addressed is what are the long term sequelae of disrupting the activity of the dental lamina on the patterns of tooth replacement? To answer this question, micro surgeries will be carried out in adult geckos including cutting of the dental lamina. The outcomes are predicted to be a change in the spacing or rate of tooth replacement that can be traced back to molecular changes in the dental epithelium. The third and final question to be asked is what are the molecular controls of tooth patterning and induction during embryonic initiation and adult replacement? The roles of two candidate molecules will be studied. These two pathways, called Wingless related (Wnt) and Notch were selected in part because mutations in Wnt increase or decrease tooth number in humans, and because Notch- Delta signalling is known to regulate cell fate decisions between adult stem cell renewal and differentiation along with its role in regulating developmental clock mechanisms. To mirror the human condition, to look for evidence of homeostatic switches regulating tooth renewal, activators or inhibitors of Wnt and Notch will be injected into eggs and the effects on tooth epithelial growth and patterning will be studied. The synergistic research partnership between the applicant/postdoctoral fellow and supervisor will one day lead to more natural ways to replace teeth lost to disease or injury."
"9384786","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelination of the central nervous system (CNS) by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is essential for the development and function of the CNS. Myelin develops in the CNS as OLs differentiate into the myelin-forming mature phenotype. The differentiation of OLs is under tight regulation, and its dysregulation causes neurological disorders and has been linked to neuropsychiatric diseases. Genetic studies have shown that Myrf is a key transcription factor for the development and life-long maintenance of myelin in the CNS. Recent studies have also demonstrated that Myrf is critical to the fine-tuning of myelin thickness and its plasticity that underlies learning in the adult stage. Despite these crucial role, it remains poorly understood how Myrf regulates transcription, and this significantly impedes the progress in this field. Using bioinformatics and experimental approaches, we recently made the breakthrough observations that Myrf is a membrane-bound transcription factor, and that Myrf may function as a homo-trimeric transcription factor. Membrane-bound transcription factors are generated as membrane proteins that, upon relevant stimuli, undergo proteolytic activation to release transcription factor domains from the membrane, with Notch being the most famous example. Our discovery fundamentally changes the paradigm for Myrf, providing a powerful framework to understand its functional mechanism. Building upon this discovery, Aim I will elucidate how Myrf is activated by proteolysis. The proteolytic activation of Myrf releases its N-terminal fragment from the membrane, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus for transcriptional regulation. Aim II will determine how the N-terminal fragment of Myrf interacts with DNA as a homo-trimer for transcription. Our computational and experimental analyses indicate that functional collaboration with other transcription factors is critical to the transcriptional activity of Myrf. Aim III will elucidate which transcription factors interact with yrf for coordinated differentiation of OLs. In sum, this study will elucidate the transcription mechanism of Myrf for OL differentiation and CNS myelination."
"9392768","?     DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): The integrated approach described in the UNM Center for Native Environmental Health Equity (Native EH Equity) will for the first time address, across multiple tribes, disparities in social determinants of health, and tribal cultural and traditional practices with the potential to provide resilience to reduce the effects of environmental disparities on the health of Native Americans. The Native EH Equity approach, also for the first time, provides an integrative understanding of the generalizability of risk and resilience factors across multiple tribes - Navajo Nation, Crow Nation, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST) - to improve both our understanding of these relationships, and our ability to develop and prioritize evidence-based risk reduction and prevention strategies. The focus of Native EH Equity will be to develop common data sets that for the first time will standardize our approach to assessing these variables across multiple tribes.  Achieving these goals requires a strong administrative structure to ensure consistency across all components of the Center, to ensure parallel data are collected from each of the partner tribes, and that data are managed in a structure that ensures integration and allows comparative analyses. The Administrative Core (AC) for Native EH Equity brings decades of experience working with Tribal communities, leadership, and agencies; of managing and analyzing large and complex datasets; of oversight of career development programs; of integrative analyses allowing replication of findings with multiple levels of data; and of successful translation of results to enhance understanding in communities, among researchers, to federal agencies, and to health care providers. The goal of the Administrative Core (AC) is to facilitate responsible management, resource allocation, integration and communication within the team; to foster successful career development for new investigators; to provide and manage pilot funding; and long-term to develop sustainable partnerships integrated within the institutional and tribal structures to ensure sustainability of research on Native Environmental Health Equity."
"9258236","Project Summary  Projections carrying somatosensory information converge upon several nuclei within the auditory system. While the exact function of these connections is unknown, they can contribute to and modify the pathological sound percepts present in tinnitus patients. Though current treatments attempt to exploit these pathways to ameliorate tinnitus symptoms, very little is known about the their anatomy and physiology. The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus is one such auditory structure that receives heavy input from both brainstem and cortical somatosensory nuclei. Though this structure has long been implicated in multisensory integration, the termination patterns of inputs to the lateral cortex are segregated into distinct streams: the somatosensory inputs target areas of high-density GAD67 staining, known as modules, while the auditory inputs terminate in extramodular areas. Given this mismatch between functional and anatomical data, the goal of this proposal is to reveal the circuitry and mechanisms underlying multisensory convergence in the lateral cortex. Two main hypotheses will be explored: 1) cells within modular and extramodular regions of the lateral cortex communicate with one another, potentially producing multisynaptic multisensory convergence, and 2) the dendrites of individual cells in modular or extramodular regions extend into the complementary region, thus receiving both auditory and somatosensory input. These hypotheses will be tested in brain slices from the GAD67-GFP mouse, in which modules can be visualized under blue light. Cells in modular and extramodular regions of the lateral cortex will be recorded from and potential presynaptic partners throughout the structure will be stimulated using laser photostimulation of caged glutamate. Inhibitory and excitatory input maps will be constructed to determine whether inputs for a given cell arise from modular areas, extramodular areas, or both. The degree of communication between cells in modular and extramodular areas will be quantified. To further explore the functional differences between modular and extramodular areas, the amount of spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory input to cells in both regions will be determined. To ascertain whether individual cells integrate both somatosensory and auditory information, somatosensory projections from the dorsal column nuclei will be pre-labeled with a red-shifted opsin, C1V1. This pathway will be stimulated with a green laser, and the auditory pathway from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus will be stimulated via laser uncaging with a UV laser. The synaptic properties of each pathway will be examined; if cells responding to both stimuli are found, the interstimulus interval will be systematically altered to determine the effect of timing on the bimodal response. The experiments outlined above will further characterize the somatosensory inputs and intrinsic circuitry of the lateral cortex, which could have important implications for both normal and pathological hearing. Furthermore, these experiments may reveal generalizable principles regarding integration of multisensory inputs at the level of a single cell."
"9193602","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions);  A cornerstone of the nation?s research infrastructure, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics is the most widely used dataset in the US for studying life course evolution and intergenerational transmission of health and socioeconomic status. Today's uncertain and volatile economy makes it even more important to understand the role of family context over the life course in shaping the health and economic status of the older population. Indeed, because of major differences in the health, economic, and family circumstances of the generations now approaching late life, important gaps remain in understanding the interplay among health, wealth, and family context. Because of its long, 40-plus year panel and unique genealogic design, the PSID is the ideal study to augment with family context information. This application proposes to design (in collaboration with Projects 2-4), collect, and disseminate through PSID's online Data Center, three new family-related data modules: 1. Family roster: An approximately 7 minute module in the 2013 main telephone interview that rosters all living children and parents, including step-relationships, and obtains basic information on each such relative. 2. Family transfers: An approximately 5 minute module added to the 2013 main telephone interview that assesses both short-term and life course family transfers. 3. Childhood context; An approximately 20 minute mixed mode (web/mail) module to be collected in 2014 that will directly interview both Heads and, if married/cohabitating. Wives about their childhood experiences, including aspects of their family life, friendship networks, and school experiences. The public availability of such data; coupled with the rich existing archive, will contribute in fresh ways to our understanding of health and wellbeing of older adults over the life course and across generations. In particular, they will substantially increase the value of the PSID archive for studying contemporary intergenerational processes and family ties; changes in transfers over the life course (since 1988); and how childhood circumstances link to adult health and economic wellbeing."
"9317789","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, is an important opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of chronic life-threatening lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa is naturally antibiotic resistant and infections with this bacterium are notoriously difficult to treat. About 70% of CF patients are infected with P. aeruginosa by age 18 and the mean life expectancy is less than 40 years. A better understanding of how this bacterium evolves to cause these chronic respiratory infections is needed.  Numerous phenotypic changes take place as P. aeruginosa transitions from the environment to causing life-shortening chronic CF lung infections. The emergence of isolates with a mucoid phenotype, due to the overproduction of the exopolysaccharide alginate is the most conspicuous; the isolation of mucoid strains is a prognosticator of clinical decline in these patients. Mucoid strains also have an additional less obvious polysaccharide alteration: these strains are generally lack lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen, a phenotype referred to as ?LPS-rough?. Interestingly, this same conversion to a mucoid, LPS-rough form is prominent in P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with non-CF chronic bronchiectasis. In rare mucoid strains that do express LPS O antigen, different lengths of LPS O antigen are expressed compared to non-mucoid LPS-smooth strains: while LPS isolated from non-mucoid strains includes both long and very long O antigen, LPS isolated from mucoid strains shows decreased expression of very long O antigen but the same expression of long O antigen, which we suggest represents a transition state between the initial- and chronic-infecting forms.  The goal of this 2-year Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant is to determine how mucoidy and loss of O antigen (as well as other genotypes) emerge during chronic colonization and how the bacteria and host respond to these infections. In Specific Aim 1, we will utilize the laboratory strain PAO1 and its mucoid derivative, PDO300, in a newly described murine model of chronic respiratory colonization and will follow the phenotypes and genotypes of the strains emerging and evolving during colonization as well as the bacterial and host response to infection. In Specific Aim 2, we will take a molecular approach to identify the genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling very long O antigen in a mucoid LPS-smooth strain and assess how alginate represses very long O antigen. The discovery of factors involved in the repression wzz2 (the gene which encodes the very long O antigen chain length regulator) will provide the relevant targets for therapeutic intervention. If we can inhibit the repression wzz2, this may set up a situation where the bacteria cannot maintain the mucoid phenotype and therefore would not be shielded from the innate host immune response or evolve into a chronic-colonizing form. The long-term goal of these studies will be to identify bacterial factors that can be targeted to inhibit chronic lung infection and host factors that can increase bacterial clearance and therefore improve the lives of CF patients."
"9195719","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study An Assessment of Liver Disease in HIV-infected and HIV/HBV co-infected Tanzanians aims to assess liver fibrosis in HIV/HBV co-infected as well as HIV and HBV mono- infected individuals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Despite the high burden of HIV/HBV co- infection in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there has been very little study of liver disease in HIV/HBV co-infected individuals in these settings. The safety and efficacy of HBV-active therapies has also yet to be determined. Africans with HIV/HBV may be at significantly greater risk of liver disease than co-infected individuals in developed countries because they are infected with HBV much longer than HIV and are frequently exposed to other competing risks of  liver injury. In this study, liver disease will be examined in HIV, HBV and HIV/HBV co-infected individuals before and after initiation of HBV-active therapies to determine the amount of liver disease at baseline and the effect of HBV-active therapies on liver disease progression. Liver disease will be assessed using two non-invasive serum markers of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fib-4. We will compare results of individuals with HIV and HBV mono-infection to those with HIV/HBV co-infection to determine whether the risk of liver disease is higher among co-infected individuals (in whom liver disease is known to be accelerated) and whether their liver disease is less responsive to therapy. Renal toxicity of the HBV-active antiretroviral tenofovir (TDF) in HIV/HBV co-infected individuals will also be assessed.  This proposal, one of the largest of its kind, is aimed to improve the current gap in understanding of liver disease in these vulnerable populations in SSA."
"9296707","Abstract BK potassium channels play important roles in physiological and disease processes, and are attractive drug targets for the treatment of a wide variety of human disorders throughout the body. Compounds that inhibit or activate BK channels (modulators) have been proposed to treat stroke, epilepsy, psychoses, pain, traumatic brain injury, hypokaleamic periodic paralysis, asthma, COPD, angina, arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, gastric hypermotility, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatitis, cancer (brain, bone, and prostate), rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma and diabetes. However, a challenge in realizing this therapeutic potential is that most BK channel modulators lack tissue specificity because the pore forming ?-subunit Slo1, which underlies most functional properties of the channel, is encoded by a single gene in all tissues. Our long-term goal is to develop potent tissue-specific modulators of human BK channels. Such compounds should induce little to no adverse effects in non-target tissue, and therefore could serve as effective therapeutics as well as important research tools for the study of BK channel function in selected organs. Properties in a modulator that are desirable in terms of tissue specificity include a dependence on accessory subunits that are expressed in a tissue dependent manner or a dependence on membrane voltage and intracellular calcium (Ca2+), since BK channels are activated by different combinations of these stimuli in different tissues. Using a novel high-throughput screen designed for the purpose we have identified nobiletin as a BK channel inhibitor with both of the above properties and a unique mechanism of action. Nobiletin inhibits BK channels composed of Slo1 alone or with the ?1 accessory subunit, in a voltage- and Ca2+- dependent manner, but fails to inhibit channels containing ?2 subunits. Moreover, nobiletin has known therapeutic effects on animal models of dementia, cancer and arthritis; but its primary molecular targets are poorly understood and it has never been identified as a BK channel modulator. The goals of the proposed research are to determine the state-dependence, subunit-selectivity, and mechanism of action of nobiletin. Accomplishing these goals will help define the potential tissue-specificity of nobiletin action and provide new insight into the mechanism and therapeutic action of this compound. Knowledge obtained from this study will also facilitate the design of future tissue-selective BK channel modulators. ."
"9408836","We request renewed funding to continue the documented success achieved by UAB's Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) in its first two funding cycles. Inaugurated with NIH funding in 2000, our NORC fosters multidisciplinary, collaborative basic clinical and translational nutrition and obesity research. Since it was first funded, the NORC's research base has grown substantially. At inception (2000), we had 60 members; this number increased 70% to 102 members in 2006 at our last renewal and another 31% to 134 members in 2011. In 2000, our members held as Pis 15 R01s or K-awards that were clearly related to nutrition or obesity; this number increased 93% to 29 such grants active in 2006 and another 17% to 34 (including ROD grants) active in 2011 (as of this writing). UAB's NORC has directly helped to recruit at least a dozen new and established obesity and nutrition investigators in the past funding cycle. Our publication output has steadily increased in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the world's literature on obesity and nutrition. The impact of NORC publications as judged by citation counts consistently exceeds the norm for peer-reviewed literature on obesity and nutrition. Our NORC leadership oversees two NIH-funded T32 training grants for obesity research, an industry-sponsored obesity training grant, and a series of national nutrition and obesity-related conferences. Our NORC funds at least four P/F studies per year, a Named New Investigator, and an extensive Enrichment Program. UAB provides our NORC over $700,000 annually to supplement the NIDDK P30 grant. The NORC Cores in Metabolism/Body Composition, Genomics, Animal Models, and Biostatistics have flourished, resulting in cost-effective research and enhanced access to cutting-edge technology that is heavily utilized by our members. Our primary theme is Obesity: Causes, Consequences, and Alleviation. Within this broad multidisciplinary theme, we are cultivating subdomains such as obesity among minorities and health disparities; obesity, caloric restriction, and aging;developmental and pediatric aspects; and mathematical/quantitative science approaches. Backed by exceptional institutional support and academic infrastructure, we request renewed funding to continue our contributions to this important area of research."
"9389651","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, each year accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (3.5 million diagnoses) and 12,980 deaths with annual treatment costs of at $2.5 billion. Early and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains a highly subjective skill, with existing diagnostic devices either offering limited positive predictie value or requiring highly specialized training. Mis-diagnoses results in missed skin cancers as well as large numbers of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies.  We have been developing a novel method and device for a fast and non-invasive detection of skin cancer based on measurements of the temporal dynamics of pressure-induced blood flow in the cutaneous tumors. The central hypothesis of proposed research is that the dynamics of blood flow in response to external mechanical pressure is different in cutaneous tumors as compared to benign nevi thus presenting a diagnostic opportunity. Multiple studies have shown that skin cancer is significantly more vascularized than normal skin or benign nevi while the morphology of tumor vascular network is highly irregular contributing to changes in vascular resistance to blood flow and highly elevated interstitial fluid pressure. The proposed method relies on measuring the spatially and temporally resolved light absorption in the cutaneous tumor tissue using an optical probe which also acts as pressure application device. The method enables to characterize both the amount of blood displaced under pressure and the dynamics of blood displacement and refill. Our preliminary data from a pilot clinical study show that both the volume and the rate of the pressure-induced blood flow are significantly higher in cutaneous cancer than in benign nevi. Here we propose (1) to design and build more advanced devices to perform more detailed investigation of pressure-induced dynamics in basal and squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma tumors; (2) to investigate instrument- and physiology-dependent factors that affect pressure-induced hemodynamics in tumor tissue and to improve our data analysis algorithms in order to optimize sensitivity and specificity of our device; and (3) to develop and test next generation optimized skin cancer detector.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop a simple-to-use and low-cost non-invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer  treatment costs."

Led by Drs. W. H. Wilson Tang and Randall C. Starting and joined by Drs. James Fang and Mark Dunlap as co-investigators, and taking advantage of the Cleveland Clinical and Translational Sciences Collaborative (CTSC) that recently integrated the research infrastructure our three institutions, our goal is to participate in the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network to test new hypotheses and therapies to advance the management of heart failure. In particular, we hope to expand our longstanding academic interest in developing strategies to alleviate cardio-renal compromise in congestive heart failure. Our proposed project serves as a mechanistic study to discern the possible role of renal sympathetic nerves in mediating cardiac and/or renal complications of the cardio-renal syndrome. Utilizing a novel, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) technique currently under investigation for treatment of refractory hypertension (Symplicity Catheter System), we test the hypothesis that in patients with hypertensive heart failure recently admitted for congestive heart failure that RSD may provide incremental improvement in neurohormonal profile, improve cardio-renal function, and facilitate symptomatic relief over usual care. Our consortium provides a unique opportunity to contribute to the overall Network with clinical trials expertise and leadership in heart failure to fulfill the scientific requirements, and the diverse and broad regional patient populations across a wide range of practice settings with proven abilities to recruit and fulfill the performance requirements, and to test a novel treatment approach to tackle one of the most challenging aspects of contemporary heart failure."
"9199193","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has an elaborate and dynamic architecture. This architecture is determined by multiple converging factors and forces including: membrane shaping proteins, dynamics on the cytoskeleton, and abundant contact sites that occur between the ER and other organelles. The result of this interplay is that the ER membrane is spread throughout the cytoplasm as a continuous membrane network made up of multiple functional and structural domains. How different domains can be generated and maintained within a continuous membrane bilayer is the focus of our work. To complement these questions, we also aim to understand the functions of different ER domains and the purpose of ER tubule dynamics.  I previously demonstrated that a class of abundant and highly conserved integral membrane shaping proteins, the reticulons, functions to stabilize the structure of peripheral ER tubules in eukaryotes9. However, little is known about how reticulon membrane shaping activities are regulated during ER dynamics. We hypothesize that reticulon oligomerization and/or reversible phosphorylation are two testable and reasonable possible mechanisms for regulating reticulon function. We are also studying how new ER tubules are generated by dynamics on microtubules. Towards this goal, we recently identified a new factor Rab10 that localizes to a dynamic domain at the leading edge of dynamic ER tubules8. Our next goal is to understand how Rab10 dynamic domains are formed and regulated. Finally, we have recently shown that the ER tubules circumscribe mitochondria at the site of mitochondrial division17. We aim to study the mechanisms and factors that drive ER contact and mitochondrial constriction and subsequent division at these positions."
"9196337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 3rd most commonly mutated gene in lung adenocarcinoma is the kinase LKB1 (STK11), where ~25,000 patients have this mutation. Patients that are co-mutated for LKB1 and KRAS have significantly shorter overall survival compared to either mutation alone and have no effective targeted therapies. In a genetically engineered Kras mouse model, co-mutation of Lkb1 is sufficient to promote metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, and primary tumors and metastases show aberrant activation of both EMT and adhesion signaling. In agreement with these data, we have published three reports that LKB1 regulates lung cancer motility and when present, restrict the activity of a key adhesion signaling molecule, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Moreover, our preliminary data show that Lkb1-deficient tumor cells invade as a collective pack in vivo, and in doing so, remodel the collagen ECM of the tumor microenvironment, a phenomenon that is dependent on the activity of FAK in vitro. These metastatic tumors from the mouse model show aberrant FAK activation within collective invasion packs of the primary tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that LKB1-mutant cells use EMT to initially invade through the basement membrane, which is followed by defective FAK-based adhesion signaling that allows cells to navigate the collagen microenvironment during metastasis. To test this, we will take a multi-model approach that combines the power of Drosophila and mouse genetics, and our large clinically annotated human lung adenocarcinoma tumor bank to i) test the mechanism and signaling pathway used by Lkb1-mutant cells to traverse the basement membrane, ii) determine whether altered adhesion signaling drives in vivo cell escape through collagen remodeling, and iii) determine whether LKB1-mutant human lung adenocarcinoma exhibits altered adhesion signaling that correlates with collagen remodeling and predicts poor outcome. We propose that this comprehensive approach can overcome the shortcomings of traditional in vitro systems and address our goal of defining the biological consequences of LKB1 mutations in lung cancer patients."
"9240762","Cardiovascular disease is a devastating disorder that has a major impact on length and quality of life. According to the CDC, approximately 27 million Americans carry the diagnosis of heart disease. The number of heart and vascular procedures (balloon angioplasties and vascular grafts) that will be performed in 2030 is ex- pected to be nearly twice the number performed in 2010. Similar increases will occur in the veteran population  When a blood vessel is treated with angioplasty, the endothelial cells (EC) are removed. The cells must migrate from the edge of the injury into the area of injury to heal it. If healing is delayed, the chance of restenosis is increased. Lipid oxidation products accumulate in atherosclerotic arteries and at regions of injury, cause cellular dysfunction, and inhibit EC migration in vitro and in vivo. Limited re-endothelialization contributes to thrombogenicity, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and restenosis.  Oxidized lipids cause an inappropriate increase in intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) through canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels, specifically TRPC6. Activation of TRPC6 by causes an increase in [Ca2+]i that results in activation of TRPC5 and a prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i. The increased [Ca2+]i activates calpains that break down cytoskeletal proteins inhibiting EC migration. Studies in TRPC6-/- mice provide compelling evidence of the importance of this cascade in vivo. Re-endothelialization of injured carotid arteries is dramatically reduced in wild-type (WT) mice on a high fat diet compared with chow- fed mice, but in TRPC6-/- mice, hypercholesterolemia does not inhibit re-endothelialization of the injury.  Considerable effort has been directed at identifying a TRPC6 inhibitor without success. Lipid oxidation products induce TRPC6 externalization by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which generates PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate). PIP3 is anchored in the cell membrane and binds to TRPC6, which promotes TRPC6 translocation to the cell membrane and leads to increased [Ca2+]i. We hypothesize that inhibition of PI3K can block the activation of TRPC6 channels by lipid oxidation products and restore EC migra- tion in vitro and promote EC healing of arterial injuries in vivo. To test this, we will 1) identify the PI3K iso- form(s) essential for TRPC6 activation, 2) investigate the effectiveness of isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors to re- store EC healing of arterial injuries in hypercholesterolemic animals, and 3) investigate the mechanism through which PIP3 interacts with TRPC6 to promote TRPC6 translocation to the membrane and activation to identify a more specific method of TRPC6 inhibition. The long-term scientific goal is to improve the outcome of ther- apeutic vascular interventions promoting endothelial surfacing of angioplasty sites, stents, and vascular grafts.  In terms of a research career development, my short-term research goal is to develop a foundation in a focused research area that I can expand over the course of my career and which will serve as a complement to my clinical practice. My knowledge of vascular wall biology will increase through seminars and I will expand my experience in cellular molecular biology laboratory techniques over the course of the award, including protein extraction and analysis, small-inhibitory RNA transfection, and site directed mutagenesis. Over the course of the award, I will gain additional experience in biostatistics, scientific and grant writing, laboratory management and leadership, and mentoring. I will also continue to develop the critical thinking skills necessary for successful research plans.  My primary long-term career goal is to transition to an independent investigator and compete for VA Merit Review and NIH funding. My long-term research goal is to more clearly define the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species and the activation of TRPC channels inhibit endothelial cell healing. With progress in this area, mechanism-based treatment regimens can be developed, transitioned into clinical trials, and ultimately be carried into clinical practice to improve the long-term outcomes following vascular intervention."
"9381494","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-translational modification of the ?-amino group of proteins has been documented for many decades. However, these modifications are little studied and thought to be constitutive, with few regulatory roles. Recent data from our laboratory challenges these beliefs. We have identified two novel N-terminal modifying enzymes, NRMT1 and NRMT2, and shown that many of their targets are known disease-related proteins (including Retinoblastoma, SET, Tau, ?-catenin, and ataxin- 3). We have constructed the first viable knockout mouse for any N-terminal PTM (NRMT1-/-), which has severe developmental defects. We have also identified the first protein, MYL9, which can be either N-terminally methylated or N-terminally acetylated. According to these data, we aim to demonstrate that N-terminal post- translational modifications are dynamic, serve distinct functional roles, and control many pathways regulating human development and disease. Specific Aim #1 will use our newly generated NRMT1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts to determine the functional differences between N-terminal mono- and trimethylation. Specific Aim #2 will use a combination of biochemical assays and mass spectrometry to show for the first time that N-terminal methylation and N-terminal acetylation are interchangeable and differentially regulate protein function. Specific Aim #3 will use a combination of isothermal calorimetry, protein arrays, and SILAC mass spectrometry to determine if N-terminal monomethylation, trimethylation, and acetylation promote different binding partners. These experiments will begin to place N-terminal post-translational modifications in their relevant signaling pathways and reveal how their misregulation leads to developmental defects and tumor formation. Successful completion of these aims will initiate a new field of protein regulation and identify novel regulatory mechanisms for many cellular pathways known to impact human health."
"9386339","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 4,000 adolescents and young adults, ages 15-24, commit suicide each year. Moreover, an even greater number of youth make non-lethal suicide attempts (estimated at 100-200 suicide attempts for each completed suicide), often preceded by severe suicidal ideation (SI). Many risk factors for suicide have been identified in previous research. Child maltreatment, particularly child sexual and physical abuse, is robustly associated with SI in adolescence. Despite the consistency of this association, we know surprisingly little about mechanisms that may help explain why some maltreated individuals go on to contemplate suicide while others do not. Increased emotional reactivity and impaired regulation are associated with increased risk of SI. Emerging research suggests that child maltreatment influences emotional reactivity and regulation. Thus, one potential mechanism may be through neural systems involved in emotion regulation. The primary aim of this proposal is to examine the effects of child maltreatment on the neural systems involved in emotion regulation and associated SI. Specifically, this proposal will examine the effects of child  maltreatment on amygdala activation (reactivity) when participants view negative (vs neutral) stimuli. Similarly, this proposal will examine ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during trials when participants are asked to down-regulate their emotional response (regulation) (Hypothesis 1). Next, this study will examine the associations between amygdala reactivity and vmPFC activation and SI (Hypothesis 2). Finally, this study will examine these neural systems as potential mediators of the association between child adversity and SI (Hypothesis 3). Participants will be drawn from a larger, primary R01 grant and employs multiple methods to answer study questions. These include neuroimaging, self- and parent-report, clinical interview, and psychophysiological measures. The sample size will include 100 youth, 50 with a history of child maltreatment and 50 matched controls. Exploratory analyses will examine whether or not these neural systems are specific to SI, or may also be associated with other forms of self-injury, including nonsuicidal self-injury and suicide attempts. The results of this study will contribute to developmental models of adolescent emotion regulation, and also will yield information to improve the identification of SI risk among youth. Training as part of this award includes developmental cognitive neuroscience (including neuroimaging), developmental psychopathology, and advanced statistical approaches to developmental data."
"9363215","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatic insulin resistance due to obesity is central to the pathogenesis of common disorders including non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This research proposal addresses the unanswered question of whether membrane phospholipid composition regulates hepatic insulin sensitivity. Our long-term goal is to understand mechanistic relationships between membrane phospholipids and metabolic regulation, particularly where they present therapeutic opportunities. The objective of this research is to understand a fundamental new hepatocellular mechanism for the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis. The central hypothesis is that, under physiological conditions, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP) functions as an intracellular sensor of membrane phospholipid composition that limits insulin signaling by binding thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). In the setting of overnutrition and obesity, we postulate that PC-TP-mediated activation of Them2 promotes hepatic insulin resistance due to overproduction of saturated free fatty acids, which in turn promote endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The rationale is that the mechanisms of PC-TP-mediated metabolic regulation should yield new insights into hepatic insulin resistance. Guided by extensive preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the mechanisms by which PC-TP and Them2 regulate insulin signaling; 2) To ascertain the pathogenic roles of PC-TP and Them2 in ER stress; and 3) To define roles of phosphatidylcholines in the activation of Them2 and TSC2 by PC-TP. In Aim 1, a newly developed small molecule inhibitor of PC-TP, as well as Pctp-/- and Them2-/- mice and cultured hepatocytes will be used to examine whether a complex of PC-TP and Them2 limits insulin signaling and thereby promotes hepatic glucose production and triglyceride synthesis under fasting conditions. Aim 2 will utilize high fat fed Pct-/- and Them2-/- mice, as well as leptin-deficient ob/ob mice to establish the pathogenic roles of PC-TP and Them2 in ER stress. Mice, cultured hepatocytes and Hepa 1-6 mouse hepatoma cells will be used to evaluate whether PC-TP, via the activity of Them2, exacerbates free fatty acid-induced depletion of calcium from the ER lumen. In Aim 3, complementary approaches will be used to examine whether nutritional status influences the molecular species of phosphatidylcholines bound to PC-TP and whether the bound phosphatidylcholines regulate PC-TP's interactions with Them2 and TSC2. Phosphatidylcholine-dependent interactions will be quantified by pulldown assays, surface plasmon resonance, and the activities of Them2 and TSC2, as well as by a mammalian two-hybrid assay system. Overall, this proposal will elucidate mechanisms of PC-TP-mediated regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity, which are significant because hepatic phosphatidylcholine composition varies in health and disease. These studies are expected to identify new therapeutic targets for the management of hepatic insulin resistance and related disorders."
"9405735","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food and nutrition insecurity (F&NI) are inextricably linked to the HIV epidemic, and their relationship is bidirec-tional. Although we have some understanding of the mechanisms by which HIV acquisition and disease pro-gression lead to F&NI, the mechanisms by which F&NI increase the likelihood of HIV acquisition and disease progression have only recently begun to be investigated. Strikingly, the mechanisms by which F&NI affect the health of HIV+ pregnant women and their infants have not been investigated to date. However, preliminary data suggest that F&NI reduce antiretroviral adherence, gestational weight gain, and the duration of exclusive breastfeeding, all of which have consequences for the health of the mother and child, including vertical trans-mission. Therefore, the scientific objectie of this K01 application is to elucidate the mechanisms by which F&NI have deleterious effects on the health of HIV+ mothers and their infants. My central hypothesis is that F&NI are detrimental to the health of HIV+ pregnant women and their infants via nutritional, disease, and psy-chosocial pathways. This hypothesis will be tested with 3 specific aims: (1) to describe and assess F&NI and associated modifiable determinants among HIV+ pregnant and lactating women in Kenya, (2) to characterize the magnitude and pathways by which F&NI impact maternal and infant health among a cohort of HIV+ preg-nant women in Kenya, (3) develop a plan for a multi-level intervention to reduce F&NI to improve health of HIV+ mothers and their children. The qualitative research (for Aims 1 and 3) and cohort study (for Aim 2) will leverage resources at Family AIDS Care and Education Services, an HIV care and treatment program in Nyanza province, Kenya, the primary study site for several of my K01 mentors. My training in medical anthro- pology and international nutrition will serve me well, but I need additional mentorship and training in 1) as- sessment of F&NI among mothers and infants, 2) statistical analysis of complex longitudinal data sets 3) the management of HIV and HIV-associated diseases in low-resource settings, 4) assessment of psychosocial well-being and childhood development, and 5) the design, implementation, and evaluation of multi-level inter- ventions. This training will further my long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator with qualitative and quantitative expertise in the design and implementation of efficacious, culturally acceptable in- terventions that reduce morbidity and mortality of mothers and young children. The training and research are significant because F&NI is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV+ pregnant women are disproportion- ately affected by it, and there are a number of potentially serious health consequences for women and their infants. A better understanding of how F&NI is deleterious will provide knowledge to design more effective in- terventions to improve the health of HIV+ mothers and their HIV-exposed infants. This innovative research will generate novel data to test theoretically driven hypotheses about the pathways by which F&NI may impact the health of HIV-infected mothers and their infants."
"9306103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many physiological events, such as heart beat and muscle contraction, are orchestrated by the cellular concentrations of certain ions, which flow in and out of the cell through designated structures on the cell membrane called ion channels. Dysregulation of ion channel/flux is clinically linked to many diseases. The human bestrophin-1 (hBest1) is a chloride (Cl-) conducting channel highly expressed in eyes. So far, over 120 distinct mutations of hBest1 have been identified to associate with multiple kinds of eye diseases that cause vision loss. Although many hBest1 disease-causing mutants have been documented as defective Cl- channels, how this defect pathologically results in eye disorders remains elusive. Moreover, it is largely unclear how the Cl- channel function of hBest1 is regulated/activated. Therefore, it is of both biological and biomedical significance to thoroughly understand the structure and function of hBest1.  The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the working mechanisms of hBest1 by crystallography and electrophysiology from the structural and functional aspects, respectively. Importantly, a recently obtained structure model of a bacterial bestrophin homolog (KpBest, from Klebsiella pneumoniae) provides novel clues and a structural basis for the research aims in this proposal. To be specific, in Aim 1, the two putative ion permeation gates on bestrophins, as suggested by the KpBest structure model, will be examined in both KpBest and hBest1; in Aim 2, the hypothesis that ATP directly interacts and activates bestrophins will be tested by co-crystallizing ATP and KpBest, and further functionally examined with both KpBest and hBest1; in Aim 3, the crystal structure of eukaryotic bestrophin(s) and/or hBest1 will be obtained using the KpBest structure as a search model.  During the K99 phase (Aim 1, and parts of Aims 2 and 3), I will be mentored by Dr. Wayne Hendrickson, a leader in the field of protein crystallography. This work will shed new light on how disease-causing hBest1 mutations influence the structure and function of the channel to contribute to eye diseases, and provide valuable insight for structure-based specific channel activator/inhibitor design in the future."
"9385588","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project concerns human B cells that produce antibodies binding specifically to phosphorylated tau, a molecule found in the pathogenic neurofibrillary tangles that characterize Alzheimer's Disease. The background for this work lies in the observation that in normal, healthy individuals, antibody is produced against pathogenic microorganisms and autologous antigens in the absence of infection or immunization, termed natural antibodies. Targets for natural antibodies include molecules implicated in neurodegenerative diseases as well as bacterial surface antigens. In mice natural antibodies are produced primarily by the small B1 cell population, and the nature of these B cells and the antibodies they produce change with advancing age. In keeping with this, treatment of mice with Alzheimer's-like disease by passive transfer of exogenous anti-tau antibodies depletes abnormal tau and improves behavioral measures. These findings suggest that natural anti-tau antibodies in healthy individuals could play a role in resisting AD. In preliminary studies we have identified human B cells that bind different phosphorylated tau peptides. Here we will test the hypothesis that certain human B cells that specifically recognize phosphorylated tau are lost with advancing age thereby producing enhanced susceptibility to tau-generated pathology and in turn providing a rationale for therapy with exogenous anti-tau Ab. We will determine the population(s) of B cells that bind phospho-tau, identify the changes in ptau-binding B cells that occur with age and disease, and elucidate the nature of antibodies that tau-binding B cells produce. We will examine samples obtained from healthy young controls, AD patients, and healthy old controls that are age/gender-matched to AD patients. We will focus on 3 aims: 1) We will determine the B cell population that binds key peptides containing phosphorylated residues found in pathological PHF tau, and we will determine which phosphopeptides are bound; 2) We will elucidate changes that occur in phospho-tau-binding B cells with age and with disease, to identify losses that may be related to AD pathology; and, 3) We will examine the nature of antibodies produced by phospho-tau-binding B cells using single cell sorting and immunoglobulin amplification followed by sequence analysis, and expression cloning followed by repertoire assessment. The results of this work will reveal the nature of B cells that produce ptau-binding Ab in normal individuals and most importantly, will determine whether these B cells are lost with advancing age. This work is likely to provide important information regarding the interface between the immune system and AD, to provide a conceptual basis for treatment of patients with anti-phospho-tau antibody, and to indicate which antibodies directed against which phosphorylated residues are missing in aged or diseased individuals for which corresponding exogenous Abs may be helpful."
"9263163","PROJECT SUMMARY Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder associated with a heterogeneous phenotype that includes social, linguistic, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Anecdotal reports and selected research results suggest that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in motor coordination, especially when interacting with dynamic objects, like catching a ball. Yet, these challenges are not included in the diagnostic criteria. Motivated by a theory recently developed by members of this collaborative team, the overarching hypothesis guiding this project is that individuals with ASD have impairment in prediction when interacting with moving objects and events. Using motor skills that involve interaction with a ball as a first test bed for analysis, three sets of experiments aim to quantify predictive impairments. In addition, fast actions such as ball interception require feedforward control, which relies on internal prediction of limb movements. To test predictive impairments three sets of experiments manipulate time for prediction and coordinative challenges. Aim-1 examines naturalistic catching of a ball using 3D motion capture and electromyography to quantify predictive features of the complex task in ASD and neuro-typical children. Manual catching is compared to catching with a funnel that eliminates hand and finger coordination for the catch. Aim-2 examines ball interaction in a virtual set-up that affords controlled manipulation of the time window for prediction, while simplifying the coordination challenges for the hand movement. Confining ball and hand movements to one dimension, tasks will comprise kinematic and dynamic interception of a ball, the latter requiring prediction of the ball trajectory before and after contact. Computationally advanced metrics of hand movements, postural adjustments and eye kinematics relative to the ball will rigorously test the hypothesis of predictive impairment in autism. Aim-3 tests postural control and uni- and bimanual reaching to assess more elementary motor abilities, such as postural sway, reaction, movement time, and smoothness of hand movements. Potential impairments in these elementary movements will be entered as covariates in the statistical analyses. Both the theoretical framework and the rigorous experimental testing are innovative and promote a hypothesis-driven and unifying understanding of the heterogeneous profile of autism spectrum disorder. The investigator team combines Dr. Sternad's long- standing expertise in computational motor neuroscience at Northeastern University with Dr. Sinha's experience in computational neuroscience of visual cognition and autism, supported by Dr. Kjelgaard at Massachusetts General Hospital with long-standing expertise in autism. Given the safety risks to children with ASD acting in a world of dynamically evolving events, searching for the underpinnings of this pervasive impairment holds great significance. Better understanding of the disorder is relevant for making environments not only safer for autistic children and adults, but also for designing early biomarkers and interventions that address the underlying neuro-cognitive issue, i.e. prediction, and not merely the manifestations of the heterogeneous phenotype."
"9257127","PROJECT SUMMARY According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, insufficient sleep is an epidemic that poses significant clinical and economic impacts. Poor sleep can be caused by impaired sleep homeostasis which regulates sleep need as a function of prior wakefulness. Therefore, determining the cellular basis of sleep homeostasis is necessary to understand underlying causes of abnormal sleep. The biological substrates of sleep homeostasis are incompletely understood, but glial astrocytes may play a central role. Astrocytes are found throughout the brain and modulate compensatory responses to sleep loss. Because astroglial chemical signaling is mediated by changes in intracellular calcium, I hypothesize that astroglial intracellular calcium dynamics contribute to the accumulation and discharge of sleep need. I will test this hypothesis in two Aims: 1) Characterize astroglial calcium dynamics in spontaneous sleep and in response to sleep deprivation; 2) Determine the extent to which astroglial calcium signaling contributes to sleep homeostasis. Intracellular calcium activity in astroglial somata and processes will be measured in vivo with a head-mounted epifluorescent microscope and two-photon microscopy in unanesthetized mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f selectively in astrocytes. Astroglial calcium dynamics will be simultaneously recorded with sleep-wake behavior, as determined by electroencephalography and electromyography, under physiological conditions, in response to sleep deprivation, and following genetic depletion of astroglial intracellular calcium stores. These studies will be the first to describe astroglial calcium activity in conjunction with electroencephalographic determination of arousal state. The results of these experiments will provide new, mechanistic insights into astroglial mediation of sleep homeostasis."
"9242478","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal describes a comprehensive five-year training program designed to foster the development of Dr. Bryan D. Kraft, M.D. (Principal Investigator) into an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Kraft completed his residency in Internal Medicine and fellowship in Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Duke University Medical Center where he is now a Medical Instructor. Dr. Kraft?s long term goal is to develop novel therapeutic approaches to the resolution of acute lung injury (ALI) in critically-ill patients. Dr. Kraft?s research focus is mechanisms of lung repair following bacterial pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide despite the use of antibiotics. In pursuit of his goal, Dr. Kraft has worked for four years using murine and nonhuman primate (NHP) pneumonia models under the mentorship of his sponsor, Dr. Claude Piantadosi, an expert in ALI and mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. Dr. Piantadosi has a record of successfully mentoring more than 40 junior investigators. The career development program proposed by Dr. Kraft incorporates laboratory training, formal didactics, attendance at scientific conferences, and an advisory committee composed of experts in S-nitrosothiol (SNO) biology and mitochondrial signaling mechanisms. During his Fellowship training, it became apparent that a critical cellular program for lung repair following ALI is mitochondrial biogenesis, the generation of new mitochondrial mass. Preliminary studies presented in this proposal indicate that mitochondrial biogenesis can be activated in lung alveolar type II epithelial (AT2) cells, the progenitor cells of the alveolar region, by pharmacologically augmenting the levels of total lung SNOs. SNO proteins have undergone S-nitrosylation, a post-translational modification whereby NO is transferred to the sulfur moieties of cysteine thiols. Preliminary data indicate that a potential mechanism for these findings is S-nitrosylation (and therefore inactivation) of the protein phosphatases PTEN and PHLPP that de-phosphorylate (de-activate) Akt1, a protein kinase activator of the transcriptional network for mitochondrial biogenesis. The central hypotheses of the proposal are that 1) SNOs activate mitochondrial biogenesis in AT2 cells via phosphatase inhibition leading to increased Akt1 phosphorylation and activation of key downstream repair genes; and 2) SNO-mediated induction of mitochondrial biogenesis will accelerate lung repair following bacterial pneumonia. These hypotheses will be tested with the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine if S-nitrosylation of (a) PTEN and/or (b) PHLPP activate Akt1 and mitochondrial biogenesis in lung AT2 cells; and 2) Determine if pharmacologic SNO augmentation can accelerate resolution of ALI following murine S. aureus pneumonia. This work is expected to yield important insight into why endogenous mechanisms may not be sufficient to resolve severe pneumonia with ALI as well as novel regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis that could be pharmacologically exploited to accelerate pneumonia resolution."
"9259602","Project Summary  Millions of Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders, which often result in other co-morbid conditions such as depression and obesity. Understanding the molecular mechanism of sleep will help us treat sleep disorders. Sleep researchers have found that 20 of the 70 human genes that encode neuropeptides have been implicated in sleep regulation. Yet little is known about how these neuropeptides interact with neural circuits to regulate sleep. I hypothesize that sleep results from the collective action of multiple neuropeptides. Neuropeptides are genetically encoded neuromodulators that can integrate environmental stimuli such as hunger and then coordinately regulate behavior by exciting or inhibiting target neurons to induce behavioral states. The evolutionary importance of neuropeptides is demonstrated by the high level of conservation of many neuropeptides from humans to worms. Genes encoding neuropeptides have been shown to play a key regulatory role in the modulation of sleep, and my proposal will determine how these neuropeptides act on a simple aversive neural circuit during sleep.  I will approach these complicated questions about sleep using the genetically tractable and simple nervous system (302 neurons) of C. elegans. I will take advantage of the well-studied nervous system of C. elegans and evaluate how the sensory system is modulated by neuropeptides during sleep. There are 122 neuropeptide encoding genes in C. elegans, and my previous work found a number of specific neuropeptides that regulate sleep in C. elegans. This investigation will elucidate the function of two classes of neuropeptides: RFamides, recently shown to regulate sleep across metazoan phylums, and Tachykinin, a neuropeptide implicated in vertebrate sleep. My project will apply the next generation of neurobiology techniques, such as optogenetics and multi-neuron imaging, to control and record the activity of neural circuits during sleep. Optogenetics uses light-activated channels and pumps to activate and inhibit individual neurons. Multi-neuron imaging techniques for visualization of nervous systems activity in vivo, has provided neuroscientists a window from which they can visualize the activity of a nervous system. I plan to combine the study of neuromodulation with optogenetics and multi-neuron imaging in the context of sleep. My previous experiments suggest that sleep results from the collective action of multiple neuropeptides. I hypothesize that these neuropeptides act at distinct cellular sites. I hope to provide the first complete model that describes how neuromodulators regulate an aversive neural circuit during sleep, which will have major evolutionary implications for the neuropeptidergic regulation of sensory depression in vertebrates."
"9300195","Optimizing inter-microbial antagonisms to control Clostridium difficile infection The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection, which is commonly attributed to exposure to pathogenic C.difficile strains following the administration of antibiotics, has exhibited a steady rise worldwide. Recent studies suggest that clostridial infection can be controlled through promoting antagonistic inter-strain interactions on toxigenic C.difficile by non-toxigenic C.difficile and other polymicrobial strains. In order to optimize polymicrobial co-cultures for enhanced antagonistic interactions on toxigenic C.difficile strains, there is a need for means to rapidly screen for the particular microflora combinations that inhibit the colonization ability of toxigenic C.difficile strains. Since adhesion assays are time consuming, we propose the utilization of cell wall capacitance measurements as a means to rapidly screen for S-layer alterations within toxigenic C.difficile that inhibit its intestinal colonization ability. Based on this, a set of in vitro screening and in vivo validation studies are proposed for optimizing microflora towards reducing Clostridium difficile infection."
"9198747","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the AIDS epidemic has matured a disproportionate number of new infections are occurring in the Southeastern US. As such, the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort is expanding to include a new site in the Southeast to make the cohort more representative. Alabama and Mississippi are located in the heart of the Deep South and have some of the highest rates of new HIV cases annually, especially among minority women. Barriers to access to care are among the worst in the US, and the prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and health care disparities most pronounced. Therefore, establishing a new WIHS site in this area of the country will provide the opportunity to assess the 'new' epidemic of AIDS as it is emerging today. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has a rich tradition of AIDS research, dating back to the mid-1980s. As the epidemic has matured, UAB scientists have established expertise in the socio-behavioral factors that propagate the epidemic, including barriers to testing, linkage to care, retention in care, and stigma. UAB scientists have emerged as leaders in innovative cohort research that evaluate the long term outcomes and comparative effectiveness of regimens via multisite cohort studies (e.g., CNICS, NA-ACCORD, ART-CC, and FRAM). By creating a linkage to the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as a subunit partner, we take full advantage of their years of expertise in HIV clinical care, outreach, and cohort research. Collectively, we represent an ideal addition for WIHS both in terms of scientific expertise and representation of the current HIV epidemic in the US. The Specific Aims for our new WIHS site are: 1. To assess psychosocial barriers to HIV prevention behaviors, testing, linkage to care, and retention in care among recently diagnosed women in the Deep South. 2. To evaluate the influence of hormonal contraception and body fat mass on immune hyperactivation and accelerated immunosenescence in HIV-1 infected women. 3. To determine the interplay between co-existing HPV subspecies and the vaginal microbiome in creating conditions favorable to the expression of cervical dysplasia and malignancy 4. To explore changes in the gut microbiome ('dysbiosis') occurring as a consequence of chronic HIV infection and its treatment. 5. To elucidate nutritional, host genetic, metabolic, and cultural factors that are contributing to the rapid emergence of obesity as a highly prevalent condition among HIV infected women 6. To recruit and retain a cohort of 300 women, half of whom are HIV seropositive and half well-matched HIV-negative controls, who are strategically selected to enable the conduct of the research projects proposed above while simultaneously meeting the needs of the WIHS cohort."

"9208055","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the U.S., more than 23 000 people die as a result of antibiotic resistant infections (CDC 2014). To combat the growing spread of resistances to conventional antibiotics, new antibiotic development will be essential. Gene regulation by small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that act by base-pairing with mRNAs is an ideal target for such antibiotics, since sRNAs control cell growth, adaptability, and virulence processes in a wide variety of bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive pathogens. The long-term goal is to identify new antibiotic targets by understanding the mechanisms and proteins involved in sRNA-mediated gene regulation. Preliminary results indicate that the protein RNase PH has a previously unrealized role in regulating sRNAs. The objective of this research proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which RNase PH interacts with sRNAs to protect them from degradation, using Escherichia coli as a model system. This project will test the hypothesis that RNase PH selectively regulates sRNA degradation by interacting with sRNA 3' terminal regions to block binding and degradation by other RNases. Aim I will test the hypothesis that RNase PH protects both free and mRNA-bound sRNAs from degradation by preventing the binding of competing RNases. The effect of RNase PH on the stability of free and mRNA-bound sRNAs will be examined. Then the ability of RNase PH to protect against sRNA degradation by specific RNases will be tested, and its global impact on sRNA abundance and cellular fitness will also be examined. Aim II will test the hypothesis that RNase PH binds, but does not degrade, the Rho-independent terminators at the 3' termini of the sRNAs it protects. The sRNAs that directly bind to RNase PH will be isolated and sequenced to assess their integrity. The contributions of different sRNA features to stabilization by RNase PH will be examined through chimeric sRNA constructs and stability assays, and the sRNA-binding residues of RNase PH will be identified through mutagenesis, genetic screening, and stability assays. At its conclusion, this project is expected to (Aim I) demonstrate the scope and role of sRNA stabilization by RNase PH, as well as (Aim II) provide a mechanistic understanding of the features of sRNAs and RNase PH that enable this protection to occur. Understanding this novel role of RNase PH will inform the future development of new therapeutics effective against sRNA- mediated gene regulation."
"9242551","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This CDA-2 application proposes a novel research project and rigorous training plan to provide Aliza Wingo, M.D., M.Sc. with a cutting-edge training in molecular genetics. Dr. Wingo proposes to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of trauma-related resilience. Conceptually, resilience is resistance to adverse psychological sequelae despite exposure to stressful or traumatic experiences. It has a substantial genetic basis with heritability ranging from 38% to 71%, suggesting that genetic studies are likely to identify important causes of this trait. Her proposal has three specific aims. First, she will perform a GWAS of resilience in 8000 civilian subjects, whose phenotypes and genotypes are being gathered by the Grady Trauma Project, funded by NIMH and directed by her primary mentor. Resilience will be examined both as a dichotomous and quantitative phenotype. Next, she will replicate the significant findings from this GWAS in 950 veterans. It is her hypothesis that the resilient markers identified in the civilian population are also associated with resilience in the veteran population. Finally, she wil directly sequence the loci that are associated with resilience in at least 30 veterans to identify rare causal genetic variants of resilience. Results from this project will further our understandin of the genetic basis of resilience, which in turn informs efforts in enhancing protective factors o finding novel treatments or prevention strategies for major depression, PTSD, or substance use disorders, some of the most common and disabling trauma-related psychopathology in U.S. veterans. For training goals, Dr. Wingo aims to acquire a strong foundation in population genetics, learn sophisticated analytical techniques for association mapping of complex phenotypes using genome-wide and imputation genotype data, and develop knowledge and expertise on next-generation sequencing study design and data analysis. To achieve these training goals, Dr. Wingo will attend courses on genetics and statistics, receive structured mentorship from her multidisciplinary mentoring team, and conduct the proposed project. Dr. Wingo has a strong multidisciplinary mentoring team, consisting of Kerry Ressler, M.D., Ph.D. (Molecular Biology, Genetics, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry), Bekh Bradley, Ph.D. (Psychology), Michael Epstein, Ph.D. (Statistical Genetics), and Timothy Read, Ph.D. (Human Genetics). The Human Genetics Department at Emory University, where most of Dr. Wingo's genetic training takes place, ranks in the top 10 genetic departments in the country and provides a strong training environment. Dr. Wingo's long-term goal is to capitalize on her multi-faceted understanding of psychiatric phenotypes as a psychiatrist, strong foundation in epidemiology and clinical research acquired through her Master of Science in Clinical Research, and the proposed cutting-edge genetic training to be a physician-scientist at the interface of psychiatry and genetics. She hopes to become an independent investigator and contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of resilience and other psychiatric disorders."

"9218968","Project Summary/Abstract Most populations harbor enormous numbers of low-frequency recessive alleles, rarely exposed as homozygotes, creating great statistical challenges for efforts to understand their effects. The problem calls for an experimentally tractable model of segregating recessive variation. The model should include rare alleles shifted to more tractable frequencies, completely sequenced genomes, and highly replicable diploid genotypes that vary in the location and extent of their homozygosity. This proposal answers that call by dissecting the genetic basis of deleterious recessive variation in a sample of genomes extracted from a natural population of Caenorhabditis sp. 29, obligate outcrossing nematodes closely related to the hermaphroditic laboratory model C. elegans. These nematodes share with C. elegans exceptional virtues for genetic study, including a compact genome, a short generation time, high fecundity, and the capacity for cryopreservation. Unlike C. elegans, this species harbors a substantial load of segregating recessive variation. The aims of this proposal involve the creation of a permanent resource for mapping the deleterious recessive alleles, the phenotyping of reproductive fitness across a range of homozygosities, and the construction of predictive models that connect the phenotypic effects of homozygosity to specific molecular features of the segregating alleles. A more precise molecular characterization of low-frequency recessive alleles will be of great value in inferring genetic risk from sequence-defined variants. It will be particularly valuable in individual phenotypic prediction, a key goal for genetic medicine."
"9403963","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal 5-year survival rate of < 5%. Current systemic standard chemotherapies provide marginal benefits to the patient, only prolonging survival for few weeks. Hence, developing novel preventive strategies for PC assume increase importance, with the development of novel chemopreventive agents being the most critical component. We propose to study two novel agents [phospho-valproic acid (P-V) and phospho-aspirin (P-A)], as a new drug combination for PC prevention. Recently, we showed that P-V strongly inhibits PC growth in multiple preclinical models of PC (up to 97% reduction compared to controls. P-V is safe, as shown by genotoxicity and animal toxicity studies, and mitochondrial STAT3 is its key molecular target. On the other hand, P-A is a strong inhibitor of EGFR activation and reduces PC xenograft growth by 78% compared to control. Remarkably, when given in combination, P-A and P-V prevented the development of pancreatic carcinoma by 95% (p<0.01) in mice with activated Kras. Objective/Hypothesis: Our overall goal is to develop an effective drug combination for the chemoprevention of PC. Particular emphasis is placed on the involvement of mitochondrial STAT3 and EGFR signaling, which are essential for pancreatic carcinogenesis and are targeted by P-V and P-A. Our hypothesis is that the P- V/P-A combination is efficient in PC prevention, acting synergistically on the mitochondrial STAT3 and EGFR pathways. Specific Aims: We will pursue the following aims: Aim #1: To evaluate the safety, metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the P-V/P-A combination in preclinical models of PC; Aim #2: To determine the efficacy of the P-V/P-A combination in preclinical models of PC; Aim #3: To determine the mechanism of action of the P- V/P-A combination in vitro and in vivo. Study design: Our studies will involve the evaluation of the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the novel drug combination in multiple distinct, yet complementary, preclinical models of PC and the assessment of the mechanism of action of this novel drug combination. Cancer relevance: At the completion of these studies, we expect to have determined key pharmacological parameters of a promising novel drug combination against PC. Given the lack of effective agents against PC, we believe that the proposed work holds the promise of a significant advance in this area."
"9242307","Project Summary Ion channels are well recognized as important therapeutic targets because they play a crucial role in controlling a very wide spectrum of physiological processes. Human genetic studies identified a number of mutations in the renal ion channels leading to renal pathophysiology and abnormal changes in blood pressure. Understanding the basic mechanisms of ion channel regulation in the kidney and how alterations of such regulatory networks lead to water and electrolyte imbalance is fundamentally important for understanding of the development of hypertension and designing new strategies for treating this devastating and costly disease. The PI's research group has made key contributions in revealing specific mechanisms controlling several ion channels in the kidney and their contribution to the development of hypertension. Given the strong historical precedent that exists for discovering and commercializing successful drugs that modulate the activity of sodium, calcium, or potassium channels, and considering the critical role of renal ion channels in the control of blood pressure, new generations of therapeutic agents are expected to result from targeting ion channels in the kidney. The central tenet of this proposal is that several types of transporters, specifically ENaC, Kcnj10/Kcn16, Trpc6, and Clcn6, work either individually or in complex, interdependent combinations to delicately modulate the pressure natriuresis relationship and control blood pressure, respectively. The channels listed above were selected because either human mutations were reported in genes encoding these channels, or they were identified by Genome Wide Association Studies as genes associated with blood pressure control. Genomic modulation of channels and their regulators will be performed in the Dahl Salt- Sensitive (SS) rat, a well characterized and established model, which shares many features with salt-sensitive hypertension in humans. SS rat has been an enormously useful model as it is naturally occurring and recapitulates the major phenotypes found in hypertensive African Americans. Importantly, the SS model has been amenable to robust, cutting-edge genetic approaches to successfully create multiple mutant models, which will be used in this study. Considering the availability of these unique genetic rat models and novel approaches developed in my laboratory, I will be able to systematically study critical changes in corresponding ion transport mechanisms and downstream signaling pathways in the setting of salt-induced hypertension. The overall goal of this R35 proposal is to understand the impact of specific human gene variations on ion channel function and contribute to our understanding of the role of renal ion channels in normal and pathophysiological control of blood pressure."
"9316079","Project Summary Multiple large-scale epidemiological studies reveal the lack of etiological understanding in approximately 30% of patients across various types of liver diseases, including acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given an intrinsic progression mode among these diseases, there has long been suspected for the existence of additional hepatotropic viruses. Using a newly developed method, named template-dependent multiple displacement amplification (tdMDA) that eliminates amplification artifacts, Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics tools, we have performed a virome analysis in serum samples (0.5 mL per samples) from 10 patients with acute liver failure (ALF). These patients had no etiological factors identified in spite of exhaustive examination by the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG), an ongoing NIH-sponsored large clinical trial. Our vriome analysis and subsequent experiments have identified a 536-bp unknown sequence, named Fragment M, which has no analogy to any nucleotide sequences in all databases currently available, including the NCBI reference genome database, the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database and the datasets from the human microbiome project (HMP) and marine microbial genome and seawater shotgun sequencing. It contains a coding region with the motif similar to the conserved domains GdpP (c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase) and PRK14538 (putative bifunctional signaling protein/50S ribosomal protein L9), sharing approximately 39% amino acid identity with bacterial poly (A) polymerase. Fragment M was RNA in nature and solely detected in 15% of ALF patients with unknown etiology (3/20) but not in ALF patients with known etiologies (0/20) or healthy blood donors (0/20). Taken together, these exciting data support that Fragment M is a viral candidate in ALF patients with unknown etiology. Based on this discovery, the current proposal is going to explore its full genome characterization as well as evolutionary relatedness to known viruses (Aim 1). Causal link with ALF will be validated through a series of experiment (Aim 2), including hepatotropic estimation, infection dynamics and comparative detection rates of the candidate virus among three populations, ALF patients with (n=81) or without explicit etiologies (n=200) and healthy blood donors (n=81). Thus, the proposed studies have the best opportunity for the unveiling of the mystery in liver diseases, unrecognized viral pathogens beyond hepatitis A through E."
"9203055","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     The goals of this project are to apply genetic approaches to resolve the biology of kidney malformations. Kidney and urinary tract malformations account for up to 50% of pediatric end-stage kidney failure worldwide. They are highly heterogeneous in manifestation and outcome, and the biological basis of these disorders is poorly understood, limiting the development of optimal diagnostic and prognostic tools to improve clinical management. During the last funding cycle, we achieved considerable progress in resolving the genetic architecture and biology of kidney malformations. We found that pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) are a common (10.5% of the cohort) and overlooked cause of kidney malformations. Applying exome sequencing, we defined a new syndrome caused by mutations in Dual Serine-threonine and Tyrosine Kinase (DSTYK) in 2.3% of children with urinary tract malformations. Altogether, our studies suggest that point mutations or CNV disorders can explain 25-30% of congenital kidney defects and provide many novel opportunities for clinical and basic investigations.  Here, we now propose to extend these studies in a large cohort of patients with kidney malformations. In aim 1, we will develop a comprehensive map of genomic structural variants contributing to kidney malformations and define candidate genes. In aim 2, we will define additional candidate genes for kidney malformations via analysis of exome data from 100 index cases from multiplex families and 50 trios derived from sporadic cases. In aim, we will comprehensively model variants in zebrafish and confirm novel genes for kidney malformation by screening for independent mutations in the full cohort using Molecular Inversion Probe resequencing. Finally we will perform genotype/phenotype correlations to aid in the characterization and workup for patients with kidney malformations."
"9404640","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early life stress (ELS), including abuse, neglect, and loss, is associated with dramatic increases in lifelong risk for the development of mental and physical health difficulties. The mechanisms through which ELS confers risk for these negative outcomes, however, are not well understood. Stressful life experiences activate the stress response systems, and high levels of stress have been linked to telomere shortening, an epigenetic marker of aging. Thus, shorter telomere length may be one mechanism through which ELS leads to negative health outcomes later in life. In the proposed study we will examine the association of ELS with a measure of cellular aging, as well as with measures of mental and physical health during childhood. More specifically, we will examine in a large sample of pre-pubertal boys and girls the association between ELS and telomere length, as well as rate of telomere attrition across the pubertal period as a function of early experiences of stress. We will  also examine the link between ELS and irritability, a common characteristic of several psychiatric disorders, that has been associated with more severe and chronic forms of mental health difficulties. In addition, we also will examine the association between ELS and physical health, given that global measures of health in childhood are likely to precede the onset of specific diseases of aging in adulthood. Finally, we will examine the degree to which variability in telomere length explains increased irritability and physical health problems in individuals with  a history of ELS, in order to test a potential mechanism by which early adverse experiences result in maladaptive outcomes. The results of this study will not only increase our understanding of the relations among ELS, telomere length, and health outcomes, but will also provide insight into a markers of cellular aging longitudinally during the important developmental period of adolescence, a stage of increased risk for the onset of mental health difficulties following ELS. Thus, we anticipate that the current study will contribute to our understanding both of models of the onset of psychopathology following ELS and of mechanisms by which ELS confers heightened risk for negative health outcomes. Findings from the proposed study will increase our knowledge of biological responses to stress and will provide insight into the onset and progression of disease following early adversity."
"9256818","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) telomere maintenance mechanism is an area of active research, particularly in non-epithelial cancers where ALT is commonly found (e.g. gliomas, sarcomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). For many of these cancers the prognosis is poor and therapeutic options are limited. Encouraging results from a recent pre-clinical study show a pharmacological inhibitor of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) protein, ATR, exhibits selective toxicity against osteosarcoma and glioblastoma cancer cells that utilize the ALT pathway for telomere maintenance, instead of up-regulating the enzyme, telomerase. Less appreciated and under- investigated are adenocarcinomas that employ the ALT pathway. We hypothesize that ALT-positive adenocarcinomas share molecular features with ALT-positive cancers of non-epithelial origin, and that these similarities will result in a comparable sensitivity to ATR inhibition.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to study ALT in adenocarcinomas, using prostate cancer cell lines as an initial in vitro model system, to investigate whether similar strategies of pharmacologically inhibiting DDR proteins, such as ATR, in ALT-positive adenocarcinomas will also show efficacy. In Aim 1, we will generate and validate the first adenocarcinoma cell lines that employ ALT. Our laboratory previously discovered a strong correlation between ALT-positive tumors and somatic inactivating mutations in either the ATRX and DAXX genes. To date, no prostate cancer cell line has been identified that displays the ALT phenotype. Using the CRISPR cas9 genome editing technique, we will create isogenic prostate cancer cell lines with inactivating mutations in ATRX or DAXX genes. In Aim 2, we will characterize the molecular features underlying the ALT process in prostate cancer cells by comparing the telomerase-positive/ALT-negative parental lines for differences in the relative expression of telomerase components, telomerase activity, nuclear architecture, and activity levels of homology-directed recombination, which is thought to be crucial to the ALT pathway. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the response of ALT-positive prostate cancer cells to DDR inhibition. Preliminary evidence shows a dramatically activated DDR in ALT-positive cells, suggesting that an increase in the level of DNA damage or a reduction in repair capacity in these already stressed cells may be sufficient to induce apoptosis. DDR proteins will be inhibited using RNA interference strategies, as well as existing pharmacological inhibitors in ALT-positive prostate cancer cell lines. The research findings of the proposed study will have real biological and therapeutic value by increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ALT in adenocarcinomas, and by determining if this unique molecular subset of carcinomas is susceptible to enhanced killing by inhibiting DDR proteins."
"9244265","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Critical gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of ovarian primordial follicles. Primordial follicle activation, the first step of an elaborate process (follicular maturation) that culminates in egg release (ovulation), is the metered process by which primordial follicles are selected from the reserve pool into the growing follicle pool. We have shown that 1) the forkhead transcription factor Foxo3 is a molecular switch that functions within oocytes to actively regulate this process throughout life; 2) the ?on/off? state of Foxo3 depends on its nuclear vs. cytoplasmic localization and phosphorylation status; and 3) the state of this switch is controlled by the PI3K/Pten-Akt signalling pathway. Here we propose to expand upon this previous work to establish the identify of the putative receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that regulates this process and thus the utilization of the primordial follicle supply during life. Based on preliminary data and efforts, we propose to rigorously test via genetic means the hypothesis that Kit serves as the key RTK regulating this fundamental reproductive process. These studies will depend upon two novel and complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function alleles of Kit we developed specifically for this purpose. These studies will provide a unique opportunity to fill a critical knowledge gap relating to primary ovarian insufficiency and create new genetic model systems for the study of primordial follicle activation and early menopause syndromes."
"9258357","Project Summary Breast tumors are often identified based on their apparent hardness compared to normal breast tissue, and in breast cancer patients an increase in tissue rigidity is often correlated with an increase in metastasis. When human mammary epithelial cells are grown in 3D culture with the matrix stiffness of breast tumors, they develop a more malignant phenotype. The link between increased tissue rigidity and invasion and metastasis at the molecular level is not well understood. Previous research from the Yang lab has shown that the transcription factor Twist1 is a key regulator of metastasis through its ability to induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a developmental program also used by cancer cells to invade and metastasize. The Yang lab discovered that upon an increase in matrix stiffness, Twist1 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Under low matrix stiffness, Twist1 is bound to its cytoplasmic anchor GTPase activating protein binding protein 2 (G3BP2). This interaction is controlled by phosphorylation of tyrosine 107 on Twist1 (Y107), which in turn releases Twist1 from G3BP2 to enter the nucleus. Initial studies to identify the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation event identified a tyrosine kinase that caused Twist1 nuclear accumulation at low matrix stiffness, suggesting that this candidate kinase is required for cytoplasmic localization of Twist1 at low stiffness. Therefore, I hypothesize that this candidate kinase controls Twist1 subcellular localization in response to changes in matrix stiffness via the Twist1 mechanoregulation pathway. To test this hypothesis I plan to 1-2) Determine the role that this candidate plays in this mechanotransduction pathway; 3) determine the role of this candidate kinase in Twist1 dependent invasion and metastasis in vivo."
"9355420","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Emerging evidence suggests the heuristic model that both HIV/AIDS and several forms of drug abuse affect the brain via free radical damage involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS, producing oxidative stress) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO, resulting in nitrosative stress). For example, both HIV- associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and methamphetamine appear to produce neuronal damage via oxidative and nitrosative stress (Cadet and Krasnova, 2007). However, the cellular and molecular targets of this free radical stress remain largely unknown. These unknown protein targets are a major challenge for the field and need to be identified in order to develop both Biomarkers of disease and to allow screening for new therapies to prevent corruption of these targets by free radical stress. Here, I propose an innovative approach using newly emerging Mass Spectrometry (MS) techniques to identify the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins resulting from such nitrosative- and oxidative-induced redox stress and hence identify new protein targets affected by AIDS and drug abuse. Heretofore, it has not been possible to identify the full range of proteins undergoing PTMs due to nitrosative and oxidative stress, but new MS techniques should allow this identification. These newly identified target proteins are expected to serve as Biomarkers of the disease process and also should allow us to direct future therapeutic intervention by discovering new pathogenic pathways."
"9198564","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is the coordinated process by which an action potential triggers cell contraction. It is initiated in specialized regions (called dyads) where the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) comes into close apposition to the sarcolemma of cardiac myocytes. Previous work has led to the formulation of a model in which the fidelity and strength of EC coupling is critically dependent on the formation of stable dyads where membrane Ca2+ channels activate ryanodine receptors. However, contrary to this view, new evidence obtained by our team shows that the network and junctional SR are highly dynamic. The goal of my project is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SR motility in ventricular myocytes and discover how these mechanics alter EC coupling in these cells. To do this, we developed a novel strategy to monitor jSR motility in living, acutely dissociated adult ventricular myocytes using viral constructs that allow us to visualize movements of parts of the myocyte that have never been seen in live myocytes before. Our preliminary data are consistent with a model in which the reproducibility of EC coupling results from the activation of a temporally averaged number of SR Ca2+ release units forming and dissolving SR-sarcolemmal junctions. This model represents a departure from long-standing models of Ca2+ signaling in which the T-tubule sarcolemma-SR junction is thought to be static. We will investigate the mechanisms controlling as well as the biogenesis of SR mobility as well as its implications under physiological and pathological conditions. We will test the hypothesis that the SR of adult ventricular myocytes is a dynamic structure capable of forming and dissolving dyads. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the jSR contribute to aberrant Ca2+ signaling seen in myocardial infarction.   By elucidating the role of the SR in normal physiology, we will likely uncover a new potential mechanism by which the cell regulates Ca2+ signaling. Studying how the mechanisms controlling SR motility are dysregulated will aid in the understanding of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other diseases with SR and T-tubule remodeling such as muscular dystrophy. Our expectation is that by providing a mechanism to SR biogenesis and dynamicity, we can discover ways to manipulate the SR to improve disease outcomes."

"9218810","Myocarditis may be caused by a viral infection of the heart which may lead to a more chronic heart disease often referred to as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Myocarditis may lead to heart failure or a weakened heart muscle requiring a heart transplant for survival. We have discovered a new myocarditis phenotype which correlates with disease progression, non-recovery, and heart failure in human myocarditis and we have linked it to innate and adaptive immune responses against cardiac myosin. Human cardiac myosin (HCM) we found to be a novel damage associated molecular pattern or DAMP which interacts with TLR2 and stimulates human CD14+ monocytes. The specific aims proposed will be a significant step forward in understanding human myocarditis and may identify genes and pathways involved in disease progression. We expect to identify predictors of myocarditis progression to heart failure and non-recovery and to identify potential therapeutic interventions which can be instituted before inflammation leads to disease progression. While most studies of myocarditis/DCM are in animal models, our project proposes innovative translational research in a longitudinal study of a human myocarditis cohort to: Aim 1) Determine blood and heart biopsy immunophenotypes of human myocarditis and identify novel upregulated genes and pathways which associate with heart failure in myocarditis phenotypes by identification of the pro-fibrotic transcriptome of CD4+ T cells in human myocarditis vs normal controls by RNAseq analysis; Aim 2) Identify T cell epitopes of HCM in human myocarditis using state of the art HLA-epitope discovery combined with traditional T cell epitope mapping of T cell clones using our human cardiac myosin peptide libraries; Aim 3) Identify the upregulated genes and transcriptome of pro-fibrotic CD14+ monocyte responses against HCM toll like receptor ligands that may lead to identification of pro-fibrotic and novel genes involved in progression of myocarditis. RNAseq analysis of purified cell types such as CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells will provide insight into novel genes and pathways involved in pathogenesis so that future experiments can investigate these new pathways. We expect that our studies using state of the art epitope discovery utilizing mass spec to identify eluted human HLA bound peptides of HCM combined with more traditional epitope mapping using T cell clones and ELISPOT will reveal epitopes and potential targets for immunotherapy. The RNAseq is expected to reveal genes and pathways showing the critical role of monocytes and human cardiac myosin in controlling myocarditis not previously recognized in humans. Most importantly, the phenotypes and upregulated gene pathways will be correlated with outcomes such as heart function and fibrosis in our myocarditis/DCM cohort. The proposed studies in humans will establish myocarditis immunophenotypes (T cell and monocyte) which control outcomes in myocarditis/DCM and correlate individual phenotype with potential therapeutic options to prevent risk of disease progression and heart failure."
"9197671","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity in a young child can not only result in short-term social, psychological, and health effects but also increases the probability to obesity later n life with many possible accompanying chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Both animal and human studies unequivocally show that perturbations during critical early periods of development can have a life-long, sometimes irreversible, adverse impact on markers of metabolic disease like adiposity and insulin resistance. Obesity's multi-factorial etiology along with developmental processes makes the links between early life factors and childhood obesity a complex system requiring a multi-disciplinary systems approach. Although the potential mechanism is not completely clear, epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role. Our work has shown considerable individual variability of DNA methylation patterns detectable at birth and dynamic in the first two years of life; and that maternal prepregnancy BMI is associated with offspring DNA methylation alterations at birth relevant to chronic disease. However, no study has traced pathways from early life factors through epigenetic changes at birth and early childhood to the development of childhood obesity and related phenotypes among urban low- income African American and Hispanic children who have been disproportionally affected by the obesity epidemic. The first aim of this application is to identify early life risk and protective factors for obesity development. We will investigate a comprehensive array of prenatal and birth to 24-month factors in the development of obesity by leveraging the extensive existing databases and ongoing follow-up of 3,000 Boston Birth Cohort (BBC) children from birth to age 10 years. We will pay particular attention to those potentially important factors that require further study. The second aim is to explore the mediating effect of the epigenome between early life factors and childhood obesity, using existing genome-wide DNA methylation data measured at birth and age 2 years (discovery sample); and replicate important findings by pyrosequencing in an independent sample. The third aim is to develop a Virtual Birth Cohort (VBC) systems dynamics model to represent and help better understand the complex system connecting early life factors with subsequent childhood obesity and determine the key modifiable factors that will most impact the subsequent development of childhood obesity; and test the intervention effects if modifying these factors to different degrees under a variety of scenarios. This highly innovative and efficient approach integrates real data from the BBC and then incorporates into a computational simulation model to better understand early life determinants of childhood obesity and epigenetic mechanisms. The VBC also will allow us to explore how findings from the BBC may apply to other locations and circumstances, thus helping generalize our findings. The impact of this project lies in the potential to inform new and sustainable strategies to reduce the burden of childhood obesity during the most critical developmental windows and among the most vulnerable segments of the US population."
"9346798","ABSTRACT  There is a critical need to discover and develop safe and effective antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug- resistant bacterial infections. Each year approximately 1.5 million patients in the US get hospital acquired infections (HAIs), with a mortality rate of ~6%. Nearly 70% of the bacteria causing HAIs are resistant to at least one commonly used antibiotic. Natural products (NPs) and their derivatives represent ~50% of FDA approved small molecule drugs over the past 5 decades including many important antibiotics. The traditional NP activity- guided fractionation approach is labor intensive and time-consuming, and often leads to rediscovery of known compounds or unwanted nuisance compounds. Genome-mining, using state of the art bioinformatic sequence analysis, can identify and evaluate the novelty of NP gene clusters early in the discovery process and is quickly replacing the traditional approach. Warp Drive Bio has sequenced the genomes of over 135,000 actinomycete strains from diverse sources worldwide to generate a proprietary genomic database that contains approximately ~3.5 million NP biosynthetic gene clusters. Importantly ~75% of cluster families identified in our database have yet to be reported in the literature. We have identified ~200 biosynthetic ?-lactams (BLs) gene clusters predicted to encode for synthesis of novel BL structures, thus providing an unprecedented opportunity to discover BLs possessing new antimicrobial activities. We have also developed synthetic biology tools to turn on the biosynthetic gene clusters which otherwise might be expressed at levels below the detection limit or not expressed at all.  In addition, we have initiated development of a novel, BL specific, and sensitive mass spectrometer (MS) based ligand-binding assay for discovery of novel BLs. During our initial experiments, we observed a complex formed between a penicillin binding protein (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PBP3) and various BL ligands, and between a ?-lactamase (E. coli TEM1) and carbapenems. However, in some experiments the assay sensitivity was decreased significantly due to impurities in the crude extracts and catalytic activity of ?-lactamases. In this Phase I application, we aim to improve assay sensitivity using various chromatographic separation methods prior the LC-MS analysis, and by utilization of mutant ?-lactamases defective in deacylation activity. Mutant TEM1(E166N), CTX-M15 (E166N) and KPC2 (E166N) can covalently interact with BLs at the catalytic serine residue but will not efficiently hydrolyze the ring opened BLs, allowing the acyl-protein adduct to be captured yielding increased LC-MS detection sensitivity. This improved LC-MS ligand binding assay (using PBPs and ?- lactamase) should enable the rapid mass-based detection and identification of new BLs in crude extracts, thus increasing the likelihood of success for discovery of novel compounds/bio-activities encoded by specific BL gene clusters."
"9184549","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 50% of the patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed at the metastatic stage, which is doomed with a poor outcome and limited treatment options. The demonstrated a survival advantage of two weeks, which subsequently led to FDA approval of this agent for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. However, due to the small overall survival benefit, high cost, and increased risk of toxicity, the use of erlotinib in unselected pancreatic cancer is limited. Establishing predictive biomarkers that allow better selection of patients who will most likely benefit from the addition of erlotinib to the treatment of pancreatic cancer is in urgent need. KRAS mutation status represents a proven predictive biomarker for the benefit of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy, such as erlotinib, in metastatic colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. KRAS mutation is seen in approximately 75% of pancreatic cancer patients. However, determination of the mutational status for pancreatic cancers is infrequent due to the difficulties in accessing the pancreas. The recently developed technology in mutation detection in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a quantitative measure of tumor mutational load and may serve as a surrogate predictive biomarker for tumor response. Preliminary data utilizing small pancreatic tumor datasets or cfDNA samples has suggested the predictive nature of KRAS for anti-EGFR therapy within pancreatic cancer patients, but the results are inconclusive due to the small sample size. In a pilot study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using plasma cfDNA for KRAS mutation detection in patients with pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we have gained access to the biospecimen collected by the only phase III study on erlotinib in pancreatic cancer with biospecimen collection. In the current project, we will examine the KRAS mutation status in plasma cfDNA of 378 patients enrolled in the PA.3 study using digital PCR method and demonstrate whether KRAS mutation status will represent a predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Findings of this study will demonstrate 1) the utility of using plasma cfDNA as a means to determine the KRAS mutational status of a patient with pancreatic cancer and 2) the predictive value of KRAS mutation status in patient response to anti-EGFR therapy in pancreatic cancer. Such information will enable and empower future molecularly directed patient selection for personalized cancer treatment."

"9373849","Project Summary Well-Child Care (WCC) visits for child preventive health care during the first three years of life are critical because they may be the only opportunity before a child reaches preschool to identify and address important social, developmental, behavioral, and health issues that could have significant impact and long-lasting effects on children's lives as adults. Unfortunately, this opportunity is often missed for children in low-income communities. The structure of WCC in the U.S. cannot support the vast array of WCC needs of these vulnerable children and their families. Key structural problems include (a) reliance on physicians for basic, routine preventive care services, (b) limitation to a 15-minute face-to-face clinician-directed well-visit for the wide array of education and guidance services needed, and (c) lack of a systematic, patient-driven method for visit customization to meet families' needs. These structural problems contribute to the wide variations in processes of care and preventive care outcomes, resulting in poorer quality of WCC and perhaps worse health outcomes. We previously used a rigorous, structured community-based participatory approach guided by key WCC stakeholders and expert panel methods to develop and test a new, innovative model of WCC delivery to meet the needs of children in low-income communities: Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (PARENT). PARENT is a team-based approach to care using a health educator (?Parent Coach?) to provide the bulk of WCC services, address specific needs faced by families in low-income communities, and decrease reliance on the clinician as the primary provider of WCC services. In an initial pilot randomized controlled trial of PARENT among 251 low-income families in two urban area pediatric practices, we found strong and consistent intervention effects on the quality of preventive care provided to families, and on reducing emergency department (ED) utilization. A larger trial of PARENT with multiple clinics is needed to position PARENT as an evidence-based, financially sustainable model for WCC delivery that can be implemented by practices and clinics nationwide. In a clinic-randomized controlled trial of PARENT, we will examine parent-reported quality of care and healthcare utilization (e.g., ED utilization), conduct a cost analysis, and use direct observations to assess changes in physician time allocation with Parent Coach-led well-visits. The study will be conducted in partnership with 12 clinics and their health plan payers, and address the following Specific Aims: Aim #1: Measure the effect of PARENT on receipt of nationally-recommended WCC services and parent experiences of care. Aim #2: Determine the effects of PARENT on WCC, urgent care, and ED utilization, and on net costs. Aim #3: Examine the effect of PARENT on physician time allocation for WCC and urgent care visits. Aim #4: Assess the effect of PARENT on parent-focused outcomes in an exploratory analysis."
"9235656","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The long-term goal of this project is to identify the molecular components underlying the heritability of ethanol's effect on germ cells. Germ cells are the bridge between generations and their integrity is paramount to the health and viability of all organisms. As such, the dysregulation of germ cells function significantly contributes to infertility and is also the leading cause of birth defects and infant deaths in the United States. Remarkably, although there is a clear contribution of ethanol to the etiology of human germ cell errors, its mechanisms of action, especially at embryonic stages of germ cell differentiation, have remained elusive.  One largely under-explored area of ethanol's effect is the perturbation of germ cells' epigenome. This is particularly significant as (1) ethanol has been shown to strongly impact the epigenome of diverse somatic cell types and (2) embryonic germ cells are vulnerable to epigenetic-modifiers as they undergo an extensive remodeling of their chromatin which includes genome-wide demethylation and the establishment of a complex pattern of histone modifications. The failure to properly regulate these histone marks leads to spurious repetitive element expression, germ cell death and infertility. Furthermore, preliminary evidence gathered in the powerful genetic model system C. elegans indicates that exposure to ethanol leads to a heritable desilencing of normally repressed chromatin in germ cells.  Here, we propose to leverage two complementary germ cell models, the nematode C. elegans and in vitro generated mouse germ cells, to elucidate the molecular nature of ethanol's epigenetic alterations. We will achieve this goal by first demonstrating the sensitivity of germ cells to physiological ethanol concentrations elicited from direct or ancestral exposure. We will then thoroughly characterize the epimutations arising from ethanol exposure on stem cell- derived mouse primordial germ cells at the time of their epigenetic remodeling.  We expect this research to provide a much-needed comprehensive examination of the epigenetic changed that are correlated with a particular sensitivity of early germ cells to ethanol."
"9358934","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting millions of people worldwide. Antidepressant drugs are widely used, but 50% of depressed patients receiving these medications will relapse, and 30% are drug resistant. Thus, new targets for antidepressants are needed. Converging evidence indicates an important role for depression-associated changes in hippocampal circuitry. For example, depressed humans and animal models of depression have smaller hippocampi, and decreased activity-dependent genes and processes, like hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis. Notably, antidepressant drugs and non-pharmacological treatments like electroconvulsive treatment ameliorate these changes. From such work, a new framework for discovery of novel antidepressants has emerged: find treatments that recalibrate depression-linked dysfunctional neural circuits and behavior. Indeed, other approaches to stimulate neural circuits - such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) - can reverse depression-related symptoms and neuropathology, particularly in the hippocampus. Strikingly, in the context of depression, DBS has only been targeted to non-hippocampal brain regions. DBS of the main hippocampal input - the entorhinal cortex (Ent) via the perforant path (PP) - has proven physiologically beneficial in other contexts: it enhances memory in humans and memory and DG neurogenesis in laboratory animals. However, it remains unknown if stimulation of the PP will produce antidepressant-like behaviors. For this exploratory and developmental R21 project, we will test the hypothesis that controlled activation of PP to DG is antidepressive. This hypothesis emerges from our pilot data showing: a) stress and depression are linked to greater PP levels of TRIP8b, a brain-specific auxiliary subunit of HCN channels; b) germline knockout of TRIP8b - which is antidepressive - increases DG neurogenesis; and c) PP disinhibition (de-repression of Ent neuronal excitability via knockdown of TRIP8b) increases DG neurogenesis and is antidepressive. We also provide d) feasibility data that we can chemogenetically-stimulate DG via PP activation. Based on these data, we will: Aim 1: Determine whether molecular-based PP disinhibition promotes antidepressive behavior using viral-mediated KD of TRIP8b in the PP and a battery of depression-linked and cognitive behaviors; and Aim 2: Determine whether chemogenetic stimulation of PP activity drives antidepressive behavior using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to mediate neuronal activity and behavior. While the aims proposed here involve considerable risk, they are logical and highly feasible given the large amount of pilot data and the published ability of PP stimulation to improve hippocampal cognitive function. This project is in an early and conceptual stage, and has focused, behavioral outcomes, making it ideal for the R21 mechanism. Even if the hypothesis is incorrect, the experimental design ensures that the collected data will advance our knowledge of brain circuits contributing to affect and cognition."
"9392605","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental cues associated with rewards like food can acquire motivational value themselves, resulting in the initiation of reward-seeking behaviors upon subsequent cue presentations. These goal-directed behaviors are not acquired through incremental trial-and-error learning, but arise from an interaction between current states and learned associations. A key example is salt appetite. Rats that have learned to associate a cue with an aversively concentrated salt taste will respond to the cue and seek out salt if they are sodium-depleted, even before salt has ever been experienced as positive. Little is known about how cues and goals can acquire value in such a drastic manner before a prediction error can occur (i.e., when salt is first tasted in a sodium-deprived state). The proposed research will investigate the neural circuitry of adaptive salt-seeking behavior using this striking phenomenon as a model. Previous work has shown that neurons of the ventral pallidum (VP), which is bidirectionally connected to other reward circuit regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), activate to salt-paired cues and salt itself following sodium deprivation in a similar manner to sucrose-paired cues and sucrose. Although these VP neural dynamics correlate with the behaviorally-relevant shifts in the value of cues and rewards, it is unknown whether VP dynamics are necessary for salt-seeking behavior, nor how NAc and dopamine inputs to VP regulate its activity and the valuation of cues. The proposed studies will use optogenetic tools, new viral vectors, and transgenic TH-Cre rats to investigate the effects of temporarily inhibiting VP (Aim 1), the NAc-VP pathway (Aim 2), and dopaminergic VTA inputs to NAc or VP (Aim 3) on adaptive salt-seeking behavior and salt reward following sodium deprivation. In addition, Aims 2 and 3 include simultaneous tetrode recordings of VP (Aim 2) and NAc or VP (Aim 3) to uncover how patterns of activity related to goal seeking arise. The proposed studies will provide fresh insight into the neural mechanisms of adaptive goal-seeking behaviors, and could substantially update our understanding of disorders of reward dysfunction including depression, obesity, and compulsive behaviors. These disorders are characterized by hypo- or hyper-reactivity to cues and motivational problems, and are thought to involve VTA-NAc-VP dysfunction. Moreover, such problems often arise as immediate changes in motivation due to a change in state, such as stress or drug priming, a feature not easily explained by current incremental learning and prediction-error models. By applying new techniques and behavioral paradigms to study mechanisms of how such immediate changes in goal-seeking occur in the brain, the work carries great potential for updating our understanding of how disorders of the reward system arise."
"9211289","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the HIV epidemic moves into its third decade it is increasingly a disease of older women who have age-related co-morbidities, and concomitant prolonged exposure to the virus, to ART, and to the metabolic consequences of both infection and therapy. The WIHS in general, and the Brooklyn site in particular, are ideally suited to address the most salient questions related to an aging female cohort. We propose three projects that capture important aspects of the HIV epidemic in aging women. Each project contains specific studies with their own sets of aims and hypotheses. Project 1 focuses on neurocognition, metabolic, and vascular factors in HIV and includes three studies: 1. Adipose tissue, genetic susceptibility, and neurocognition; 2. The HIV-Neuroimaging Initiative; 3. Vascular factors and neurocognition. Project 2 focuses on aging biomarkers in HIV and includes two studies: 1. Frailty-Physical, functional and neurocognitive aspects of aging; 2. Reproductive aging and telomeres. Project 3 focuses on behaviors and implementation science approaches to understanding and promoting successful aging in HIV. It includes three studies: 1. Life course transitions and care engagement; 2. An intervention to increase adherence among women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse; 3. An intervention to enhance smoking cessation. The Brooklyn site, the largest WIHS site, has an exceptional record in cohort retention as well as participation in WIHS leadership and substudies. We further energize our activities for WIHS-V by expanding our cadre of co-investigators and biostatisticians to include those with expertise matched to the aforementioned projects and studies. Dr. Minkoff, who has been chair of the WIHS EC for over a decade, will be joined in a dual-PI leadership role by Dr. Deborah Gustafson, a neuroepidemiologist who has worked with aging cohorts in Sweden and Argentina. Among the many new collaborators are Dr. David Keefe, Chair of OB/GYN at NYU and one of the nation's leaders in reproductive aging, and Dr. Richard Havlik who has served at the NIH in research related to aging. We will also collaborate with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, led by Dr. Michael Weiner. These and other new investigators will join an array of established site investigators, including Dr. Tracey Wilson who heads the WIHS behavioral working group, Dr. Howard Crystal, a neurologist who has a WIHS-linked R01 and many others, to assure the scientific productivity of the site. We have also established a biostatistical core, with members whose expertise corresponds to our project needs, including Drs. Lanza and Yang (Penn State) and Dr. Wilson (SUNY) for analysis of the behavioral projects; Drs. Gustafson (SUNY), Nalls (Molecular Genetics Section, NIA, NIH), Donahue (UCSD) and Weedon (SUNY) for neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic analyses; and Dr. Wu (Penn State) for telomere analysis. Given our exemplary track record to date, in conjunction with an innovative fusion of new and seasoned investigators, and an invigorated statistical core, we look forward to a continued productive relationship with our colleagues in WIHS."
"9343281","PROJECT SUMMARY Depression rates skyrocket in adolescence, and adolescent-onset depression is associated with increased risk for depression, substance use, suicide, and work-related disability in adulthood. Consistent with NIH objectives of identifying the biobehavioral causes and prospective trajectories of mental disorders, it is imperative that we identify mechanisms that increase individuals' risk for depression. The long-term goal of this study is to identify the pathways linking early risk factors with adolescent-onset depression; this research will provide a foundation for identification of at-risk youth and the development of interventions to prevent the onset or progression of depression. Depression is a mood disorder characterized by high negative affect and/or low positive affect. Extensive research has examined the high negative affect component of depression, articulating how stress, loss, and dysregulation in the negative valence system (NVS) predict adolescent depression. Much less research has examined the low positive affect component of depression, although low positive affect (e.g. anhedonia) is uniquely associated with additional impairment, poor treatment response, and suicidality above and beyond negative affect. The current study will identify pathways linking dysregulation in the positive valence system (PVS) with depressive disorders in adolescence. We hypothesize that youth with trait reward insensitivity, low trait positive affect, and/or deficits in the regulation of positive affect will have difficulty generating and maintaining positive affect when faced with rewarding or positive events. We further hypothesize that these abnormalities will prospectively predict depressive symptoms and disorders in adolescence, and that the effects may be specific to the anhedonia symptoms of depression. Finally, we also hypothesize that these deficits in the positive valence system will be predicted by stress exposure and deficits in the negative valence system (NVS). Study hypotheses will be examined both cross- sectionally and prospectively with assessments at baseline, 4-months, 8-months, and 12-months. An unselected community sample of youth and parents will be invited to participate in the Time 1 laboratory visit during which youth will complete induced reward and stress paradigms before, during, and after which physiological reactivity, state positive and negative affect, and state emotion regulation will be assessed. Following the lab visit, youth will complete a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol in which the occurrence of positive and negative life events and youths' affective and cognitive responses to these life events will be randomly sampled in the youths' natural environment in real time. Youth and parents will report on depressive symptoms and diagnoses and stress exposure at baseline, 4-months, 8-months, and 12-months. This prospective design will allow us to test if trait dysregulation in the PVS at baseline predicts state affective and cognitive responses to positive life events during the EMA study, and if these in turn mediate the effects of PVS dysregulation on depressive symptoms over time (Aim 1). We will also be able to examine if stress exposure and NVS dysregulation predict PVS dysregulation (Aim 2)."
"9333578","Pathogenic retroviral infections occur in a wide variety of metazoans often with devastating consequences. Stable integration of the retroviral cDNA genome into the host chromosome is absolutely required for a productive infection. Integration is catalyzed by the retrovirus-encoded integrase (IN), which forms a multimeric complex with the two viral cDNA long terminal repeat (LTR) ends (termed an intasome). The IN protein removes two 3'-nucleotides and catalyzes end joining (strand transfer) of the resulting recessed 3'- hydroxyls across the major groove of the target DNA separated by 4-6 bp. While decades of biochemical and cellular studies have catalogued many of the details associated with retroviral integration, the dynamic processes associated with genomic target identification, integration and intasome disassembly are largely unknown. The non-pathogenic prototype foamy virus (PFV) is a member of the Spumaretrovirinae; one of the two subfamilies of the Retroviridae family. It forms a tetramer IN complex with similar structure and drug sensitivity to the pathogenic human lentivirus HIV-1, an Orthoretrovirinae subfamily member. Unlike HIV-1 IN, the PFV IN may be easily purified and reconstituted with viral cDNA into an extremely active intasome in vitro that appears to retain comparable integration properties to cellular integration events. Moreover, the PFV IN inner and outer subunits of the tetramer complex may be manipulated separately to examine IN mutations and domain functions that are impossible with other retroviruses. For these reasons PFV IN is an unsurpassed biophysical model for retrovirus integration analysis. Using single molecule imaging analysis we recently demonstrated that the PFV intasome catalyzes the two strand transfer events near simultaneously (470 msec). Visualizing PFV intasomes on a linear target DNA suggested that the vast majority of IN-mediated target search events were nonproductive. Together these observations suggested that target site-selection limited retroviral integration. Preliminary studies presented in this application suggest that integration into model chromatin substrates is substantially more efficient while the search process appears significantly different than on naked DNA. Moreover, the strategic deletion of PFV IN domains appears to enhance its catalytic efficiency. These observations prompt several key questions: How does PFV intasome structure collaborate in target identification and integration? How does the PFV intasome disassemble following integration? How does the PFV intasome target chromatin? We propose to utilize innovative single molecule-imaging techniques to visualize the PFV integration process in real time with the following Specific Aims: 1.) detail the target site selection process of the PFV Intasome, 2.) examine the dynamics of PFV IN protein and viral cDNA following integration, and 3.) determine the influence of defined chromatin on PFV intasome dynamics and target site selection. These studies are designed to interrogate the animated processes associated with PFV integration to provide a quantitative biophysical foundation for retroviral intasome progressions."
"9258020","ABSTRACT  Kidney cancer is one of the ten most common cancers in the US and accounts for over 100,000 deaths each year. Over 80% of kidney cancers are classified as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and insight as to how this disease develops is scarce. One characteristic of ccRCC is the overexpression of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 4-like 2 (NDUFA4L2), which is overexpressed in over 90% of ccRCC patients. Additionally, NDUFA4L2 is necessary for cell proliferation and survival, therefore indicating its importance in the development of ccRCC. However, the function of NDUFA4L2 has yet to be elucidated. Previous studies have shown that NDUFA4L2 plays a role in the switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, a metabolic shift that is observed in ccRCC. Additional studies suggested that NDUFA4L2 may be implicated in the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity. However, this proposed function has yet to be investigated in ccRCC. Functional studies on NDUFA4L2 in vivo are lacking due to the prenatal lethality of NDUFA4L2 knockout mice. The Gudas lab has generated a TRAnsgenic Cancer of the Kidney (TRACK) murine model in which NDUFA4L2 is overexpressed. Additionally, this novel murine model recapitulates the human ccRCC disease, as demonstrated by genome- wide profiling of the TRACK kidneys. Previous collaborative work between the Gudas lab and the Heller lab showed that mesoscale nanoparticles (MNPs) localize in the mouse kidneys up to 25 times more than they do in other organs. Furthermore, these MNPs localized more in the ?clear? cells, or lipid-filled cells, of the TRACK kidneys relative to normal proximal tubule cells. Consequently, these MNPs present a novel method of delivering drugs, therapeutics, or other investigative tools to the site of disease in the renal carcinogenesis murine model. We therefore aim to utilize this innovative approach to investigate the function of NDUFA4L2 in ccRCC. Through the utilization of the TRACK mouse model and the kidney-targeting MNPs, we will: 1) elucidate the role of NDUFA4L2 on mitochondrial function, and 2) determine the knockdown efficacy of siNDUFA4L2-encapsulating MNPs in TRACK mice. In order to investigate the mitochondrial function of NDUFA4L2, we will analyze mitochondrial function, ATP production, ROS levels, and complex I activity in cultured human ccRCC cells and TRACK mice. MNPs encapsulating siRNA specific for NDUFA4L2 will then be injected into TRACK mice to investigate whether NDUFA4L2 knockdown can be successfully achieved using this novel method. The proposed studies will delineate the functions of NDUFA4L2 in ccRCC and elucidate a possible delivery method of NDUFA4L2 knockdown specific to the kidneys. Findings from this proposal will provide critical insight into the underlying processes of ccRCC and present potential therapeutic strategies."
"9396495","Abstract  Innate immunity is an ancient defense response that evolved with the earliest metazoan creatures, and is the first line of defense against microbial infection. These responses rely on the immediate recognition of microbes by germline-encoded receptors, and drive the production of numerous chemical, biological, and cellular responses to defend against infection. In the face of constant microbial assault, innate immunity is essential for the survival of nearly all multicellular organisms. On the other hand, over-exuberant or inappropriate innate immune responses are the underlying cause of morbidity and mortality associated with many infectious, autoimmune, and autoinflammatory diseases. Thus, a thorough mechanistic understanding of innate immunity has many potential applications in the development of the next generation of therapeutics. This proposal uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model for the study of innate immunity. Flies offer many advantages for the study of innate immunity, including experimental tractability and a model system without the complexity of the adaptive immune response. The Drosophila immune response is an excellent model for vector insect species, and discoveries made in flies are being translated into new approaches to control vector-borne diseases. Furthermore, many aspects of the innate immune responses are highly conserved with mammals, and discoveries made in flies can be translated into important, paradigm shifting, findings in mammals. Particularly relevant for this proposal is the conserved NF-?B signaling pathway that drives the immediate response to infection, in both insects and mammals.  In Drosophila, systemic microbial infections are recognized by two distinct NF-?B signaling pathways, the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways. Both of these pathways are triggered by microbial cell walls and drive the production of antimicrobial peptides and other immuno-protective molecules. In particular, the Imd pathway is triggered by DAP-type peptidoglycan from the cell wall of certain bacteria. The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand in molecular detail the mechanisms used by the Imd pathway to trigger effective immune responses. The specific aims of this proposal address the molecular mechanisms involved in peptidoglycan recognition and Imd signal transduction. Aim1 probes the function of amyloid fibrils formed by both the peptidoglycan receptors and key adapter proteins in this pathway. Aim 2 is focused on the ubiquitin dynamics that temporally regulate the Imd pathway, involving both activating K63-chains and response-limiting K48-polyubiquitination. Aim 3 involves the characterization of a new family of transporters involved in delivering peptidoglycan fragments, e.g. muramyl-dipeptide and tracheal cytotoxin, to cytosolic innate immune receptors, in flies and mammals."
"9244375","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) maintains epithelial function by acting as an ion channel at the apical surface of epithelial cells, and governs the formation of mucus and its clearance. Genetic mutations of CFTR cause CF, and these mutations also contribute to other airway diseases by altering host defense. We have helped discover that CFTR dysfunction also can be acquired in the absence of congenital mutations, contributing to the pathogenesis of the chronic bronchitis phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To this aim, this Research Program will make decisive advancements in elucidating the pathogenesis of airway diseases linked to genetic and acquired CFTR dysfunction, and will apply this knowledge to develop new tools for their diagnosis and treatment. The Program will encompass two focus areas critical to the mission of the NHLBI. The first will tackle fundamental questions surrounding mucus clearance, using CF as the model. We will implement in vivo ?OCT imaging, a technique we co-invented that provides an unprecedented view of the functional microanatomy of the airway surface; perform innovative techniques to probe airway mucus; and use a novel CF rat that exhibits delayed mucus clearance and an inherit defect in host defense that develops over time to 1) illuminate mechanisms governing the formation of mucus and its clearance, 2) develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting abnormal mucus itself, and 3) establish mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to chronic bacterial infection and novel strategies for bacterial eradication. In the second focus area, we will study the role of these pathways in chronic bronchitis, a prevalent disorder that lacks treatments that reverse its natural history. We will determine 1) the impact of acquired CFTR dysfunction in ferrets, the first animal model of chronic bronchitis, 2) mechanisms of mucus stasis in the human COPD airway (and contrast with CF), 3) whether acquired CFTR dysfunction increases susceptibility to chronic bacterial infection or respiratory exacerbations in COPD ferrets, and 4) test novel therapies for chronic bronchitis, including advancing CFTR potentiators for this indication. There will be significant synergy between these studies, which will not only employ cutting-edge techniques and animal models but also take advantage of our recognized expertise in leading first-in-class human investigation into CFTR-directed therapies. Noting Dr. Rowe's consistent track record of successes; the innovative, one-of-a-kind capabilities of his laboratory; and the immediate feasibility of proposed objectives, this Program promises to transform the field and uncover treatments that offer momentous improvements to duration and quality of life."
"9198189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is an ideal system to target for safe and effective pharmacological modulation of vascular factors centrally involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Specifically, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may positively alter neuropathological markers of AD including Amyloid beta and Tau. ARBs also alter vascular function and inflammation, cerebral perfusion, and endothelial dysfunction. Patients with mild cognitive impairment may harbor AD-signature biomarkers (MCI- AD) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which offers a golden window of opportunity for drug testing in the earliest clinical stages of AD. The use of a CSF biomarker-driven clinical trial is an important approach in AD research and may address prior failures in AD drug development. It improves diagnostic accuracy and identifies patients at the verge of conversion to clinical AD. Both factors improve efficiency of phase II trials and decrease the risk of failed Phase III transition. Further, exploring the potential benefit of promising existing drug (i.e. repurposing) such as ARBs shortens the time to provide urgently needed management options for this devastating illness. Biomarkers of peripheral and central vascular function may be important surrogate markers to test the effectiveness of candesartan as a novel treatment for AD, specifically to evaluate hypothesized mechanisms of action and to validate target engagement. We plan to incorporate a set of neuro- vascular biomarkers (Tau, Amyloid ? imaging, perfusion, hippocampal volume, and vascular function) in this phase II study to identify the ideal surrogate endpoint for a larger trial of candesartan in MCI-AD. Therefore, we are proposing to conduct a 1-year PHASE II double-blind randomized clinical trial using candesartan in 40 non-hypertensive individuals with MCI-AD who have CSF AD signature profiles. Our over-arching hypothesis is that in individuals with MCI-AD, treatment with candesartan is safe and is associated with improved neuronal and vascular AD-related biomarkers This pilot study will (i) test the feasibility of conducting a biomarker-driven clinical trial in MCI-AD, (ii) assess the safety of candesartan in non-hypertensive individuals with MCI-AD, and (iii) aid us in the selection of the surrogate endpoint (s) from the included set of neuro- and vascular biomarkers for an ARB trial. Participants will be recruited from the greater Atlanta area and evaluated at the clinical site of the Emory Alzheimer's disease research center (ADRC). Evaluations will include lumbar puncture, neuroimaging, non-invasive vascular assessments, and circulating cellular and protein inflammatory measures. These data will guide a future PHASE III trial."
"9238131","There is a profound need for evidence-based interventions that promote tobacco control on a large scale, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In India in 2010 alone, tobacco use accounted for over 1 million deaths. The overall goal of this study is to identify effective strategies for broad-based implementation of evidence-based tobacco control interventions that can be embedded in existing organizational infrastructures and accommodate the realities of low-resource settings. This study builds on an intervention for school teachers, called the Tobacco-Free Teachers/Tobacco-Free Society (TFT-TFS) program, shown to be efficacious in increasing tobacco use cessation and tobacco policy implementation in a cluster randomized controlled trial in the Bihar School Teachers' Study (BSTS). Teachers in India are an important channel for promoting tobacco control, given their roles as community leaders and role models. The next logical step in this research, which is our objective here, to develop the knowledge, products and processes needed to take this intervention to scale and disseminate it through readily accessible and sustainable channels. We will test an implementation model for building capacity within education departments to support and deliver this program within schools, using the existing infrastructure for curriculum training in state education departments. Within each state in India, schools are organized within clusters, and cluster coordinators are responsible for directly training principals about curriculum issues. We will build the capacity of cluster coordinators to train and support principals to implement the TFT-TFS program in their schools. Our central research question is: Will this evidence-based intervention be successfully adopted, implemented and sustained through existing channels using this implementation process? Accordingly, our specific aims are to: (1) determine the extent to which this implementation model meets acceptable rates of program adoption, implementation, reach and maintenance of the TFT-TFS program among schools in the Indian state of Bihar; (2) determine program effectiveness in increasing tobacco use cessation and implementation of tobacco control policies in schools; (3) determine the feasibility of building the capacity of cluster coordinators to train and support principals in program implementation and maintenance in schools, and for the Department of Education to sustain the program; and (4) determine the direct financial costs of program implementation and maintenance. This study uses a non- inferiority design to test the primary hypothesis that program adoption, implementation, and reach will not be inferior to the high standards demonstrated in BSTS; and assesses program effectiveness in improving tobacco use cessation and increasing policy implementation using a cluster randomized design. This research is innovative because it systematically examines the process of scaling up one of the first evidence-based approaches to tobacco use cessation among adults in India. This study is significant because it is expect to improve understanding of implementation processes needed for taking evidence-based interventions to scale."
"9406560","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clefting of the lip and/or palate (CL/P) is the most common facial birth defect. This disruption of normal facial structure can lead to difficulties wit necessary functions such as breathing, feeding, and speech development. Clinical manifestations of CL/P are highly variable, indicating that the disorder is likely caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. There is currently great interest in identifying the environmental factors that interact with genetic susceptibility to effect clinical presentation of CL/P, as further understanding of these factors could lead to important new treatments and interventions. Maternal nutrition is both a known influence on craniofacial development and an ideal target for future interventions. This project will investigate how genotype and vitamin A levels in the maternal diet interact to influence midfacial development and CL/P susceptibility and severity. In the first aim of this project, a mouse model allowing precise control over bioavailable levels of vitamin A will be used to assess the impact of mild and moderate maternal vitamin A deficiency (VAD) on facial phenotype. Using deformable morphology analysis, difference in phenotypes will be quantified and are expected to reveal a graded degree of change in facial morphology corresponding to the degree of maternal VAD. The second aim of this project will use mouse models allowing dietary control of vitamin A and/or CL/P sensitivity to investigate the impact of mild and moderate maternal VAD and maternal vitamin A supplementation on CL/P severity and frequency. Severity of phenotypes will be quantified using deformable morphology methods. The results are expected to show an increase in cleft severity and frequency corresponding to the degree of maternal VAD and a protective effect associated with vitamin A supplementation. This work will further the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and environmental modulators contributing to CL/P susceptibility and sensitivity which will help identify optimal treatment and preventative strategies."
"9224559","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal describes a rigorous training program leading to the career development of Dr. Andrew Wang as an independent physician scientist. The principal investigator is a physician scientist with a PhD in Immunobiology who recently completed clinical fellowship training in Rheumatology. His career goal is to become an independent investigator studying tissue tolerance to inflammation. He proposes to expand his training in inflammation biology through an intensive training research experience under the mentorship of Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov, a pioneer and world leader with unparalleled intellectual and technical insight into tackling the complex biology of inflammation. In addition to intellectual grooming and hands-on training in Dr. Medzhitov's lab, a proposed rigorous series of didactic coursework and a carefully selected advisory committee comprised of physician-scientists with a broad range of expertise related to this project and with extensive experience in successfully fostering physician-scientist careers will equip him with the necessary skills to become a successful independent investigator. The research objective of this proposal is to understand how glucose metabolism regulates tissue tolerance to different types of inflammation. Preliminary data for this proposal reveals that nutritional supplementation enhances lethality in the Listeria model of bacterial sepsis while it protects against lethality in the flu model of viral sepsis. The causative component of food was determined to be glucose. Lethality was independent of the extent of systemic inflammation or pathogen burden. Findings were recapitulated in sterile models of bacterial and viral sepsis where therapeutic blockade of glucose metabolism with 2-deoxy glucose in the lipopolysaccharide model of bacterial sepsis lead to protection from mortality while therapeutic blockade of glucose metabolism in a Poly I:C model of viral sepsis lead to enhanced mortality, independent of the degree of inflammation. We hypothesized that different types of inflammation induced different metabolic states in order to coordinate appropriate activation of cytoprotective responses necessary for tissue protection from inflammatory damage. This proposal examines the role of ketone biology in mediating protection to bacterial inflammation and the role of the interferon alpha-mediated glucose-dependent unfolded protein response in viral inflammation. This proposal serves as a training vehicle for Dr. Andrew Wang to become an expert in inflammation, metabolic control, and tissue response to inflammation so that he can apply his expertise to the field of rheumatic diseases."

In humans, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, compared to time spent awake, is associated with enhanced memory retention and the stabilization of memory representations across hippocampal-cortical networks.  Specific physiological mechanisms during post-encoding sleep are thought to support such memory stabilization:  slow wave activity or slow oscillations, which coordinate and synchronize large-scale neural activity during NREM sleep, and the reactivation of hippocampal activity patterns representative of prior experience (`reactivation') during wide-spread hippocampal-cortical network interactions.  A functional role of slow waves for the retention of recent memories has been shown in humans, and robust evidence for memory- related hippocampal reactivation and associated hippocampal network interactions has been shown during NREM sleep in rodents.  However, it is unclear from prior work 1):  which brain regions are critically necessary for the generation of slow waves that support successful NREM memory consolidation, with prior work indicating a predominance of slow wave density and origin over medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and 2):  whether mechanisms of hippocampal reactivation and large-scale network interactions support human NREM memory consolidation, as little prior work has tested evidence for hippocampal reactivation and associated network interactions in the human brain.  By combining TMS with high-density EEG and EEG-fMRI measurements of NREM brain activity, this proposal seeks to remedy these gaps by 1):  testing the causal contribution of mPFC integrity to slow wave activity generation and associated NREM sleep memory consolidation, and by 2):  testing whether hippocampal-dependent learning results in robust evidence for hippocampal reactivation and large-scale network interactions during subsequent NREM sleep, and whether NREM hippocampal activity measures are functionally predictive of memory consolidation success (memory retention and neural stabilization across hippocampal-cortical networks).  In sum, this work aims to study the underlying brain regions and neural mechanisms that critically contribute to long-term memory retention during sleep in humans.  This proposal will improve our understanding of basic memory mechanisms that may underlie memory deficits in psychiatric and neurological disease states, which often express co-morbid impairments in memory and sleep abnormalities.  Moreover, this work will elucidate the functional significance of sleep loss associated with several neurological disorders and will aid in the successful development of therapeutics to ameliorate memory deficits by targeting modifiable aspects of sleep physiology."
"9230782","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral training fellowship serves two overarching goals: 1) To enhance my quantitative and qualitative research methods skills toward applying for and obtaining a mixed methods R01grant; and 2) To apply and refine my public health training by conducting a dissertation research project to understand the effect of the changing food environment on obesity in a historically low-socioeconomic status (SES) community of color undergoing gentrification. Background: Since the late 1990s, the neighborhood of Central Harlem in New York City has been undergoing dramatic transformation as characterized by gentrification, a mixture of divestment and redevelopment. These changes influence the food environment (i.e. grocery outlets, restaurants, street vendors, and farmers' markets) and, with it, residents' food-related practices and health. Given the high rates of nutrition-related conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in Harlem, any transformation in its food environment raises the need for investigation. The overarching question of my dissertation is: How does the changing food environment in Harlem, a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, affect residents' risk for obesity mediated by food-related dispositions and practices? Aims: The specific aims are to: 1) Examine changes in Central Harlem's food environment during 1990-2010 by analyzing the NETS database; 2) Examine whether longitudinal changes in the food practices of mothers and children are associated with changes in weight measurements and risk for obesity using the Columbia Center of Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) cohort data; 2a) Compare changes in the weights of mothers and children who have remained in Central Harlem and those who have moved from the neighborhood; 3) Use ethnographic methods (including participant observation, and in-depth interviews with a sub-set of CCCEH participants) and key informant interviews to explore ongoing changes in Harlem's food environment, and how these changes affect food practices and dispositions, thus corroborating and expanding upon the quantitative findings under Aims 1 and 2; and 4) Integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings and thus develop a provisional conceptual framework to understand the effects of gentrification on obesity as mediated by food practices and dispositions. Methods: Consistent with my training objectives, the study will apply an ethnographic and sociological framework of habitus to examine the relationship between gentrification, habitus and obesity prevalence among residents of a historically resource poor neighborhood. Specifically, I will conduct a mixed methods explanatory sequential design including three phases: 1) secondary longitudinal data analyses of the National Establishments Time-Series database and CCCEH mother-child pairs; 2) qualitative data collection and analysis by employing an ethnography of Harlem's food environment and interview with 15- 20 key informants and 45 CCCEH participants; and 3) integration of findings to develop a provisional conceptual framework that illustrates the effect o gentrification on obesity as mediated by food habitus."
"9404092","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite immense efforts in behavioral interventions to promote safer sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to be a pandemic worldwide. Unfortunately, there are no effective vaccines or microbicides for the majority of STIs. A pathogen-specific, safe, effective and discreet vaginal microbicide that does not require daily or sex-associated dosing would provide a powerful prevention tool addressing the current gap in behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Among different classes of microbicide candidates currently in clinical and pre-clinical development, human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) delivered locally to mucosal surfaces offer exceptional promise combining safety, effectiveness and unparalleled specificity. Adding further to the promise of mAb, the Lai and Cone Labs recently discovered a novel antibody function in mucus - IgGs that trap individual pathogens in mucus - and have pioneered a technology enhancing the use of mAb in mucosal secretions based on carefully-tuned affinity between IgG-Fc and mucins, which will be exclusively licensed to Mucommune. We have shown that engineered mAb can trap Herpes viruses in human cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) with 10-fold greater potency than protection by neutralization. More importantly, trapping viruses in mucus with vaginally-dosed mAb can directly block vaginal Herpes transmission in vivo in the absence of other immune protective functions. The Lai Lab has since advanced this technology by showing that specific mAb trap not only viral but also highly motile bacterial pathogens, and that pathogen trapping can occur in lung and GI mucus secretions, underscoring the universal nature of this novel IgG-mucin function and the broad applicability of the Mucommune technology. In this Phase I STTR, we will build upon our work to demonstrate that pathogen-trapping mAb, when formulated into sustained release polymeric capsules, will remain sufficiently stable upon long term exposure to human mucus secretions and retain its pathogen-trapping function (i.e. both pathogen- and mucin- binding) when released into CVM over a 35 day period. In Aim 1, we will encapsulate pathogen-trapping mAb into polymeric capsules prepared from 3D printing, and characterize the integrity of the mAb before/after loading and after release from the polymeric capsules. In Aim 2, we will incubate mAb-loaded capsules with human CVM, and measure the stability and pathogen trapping potency of encapsulated and released mAb in CVM. Successful completion of these studies will lead to a Phase II proposal, where the overall goal will be to develop a shelf-stable vaginal ring with embedded polymeric capsules that slowly release a cocktail of mAb, providing effective protection against a broad spectrum of STIs with convenient, once a month application. By enabling enhanced mAb function in mucus secretions, we expect Mucommune will help pave the way for improved, molecularly-targeted therapies and prophylaxis against a broad spectrum of pathogens and microbes across all major mucosal surfaces."
"9333895","Summary This proposal is focused on characterizing the innate antiviral immune response of Drosophila. In particular, the response to infection with a DNA virus, Invertebrate Iridescent Virus 6, will be characterized. In preliminary studies,IIV-6 infection was found to induce the robust expression of a group of JAK-STAT responsive genes known as the Turandots, or Tot, genes. The eight Tot genes encode of a family of rapidly-evolving, small, secreted proteins with no known functions. Viral-induced Tot expression requires viral replication, p38b MAPK signaling, and JAK-STAT activation. Additionally, the Unpaired (UPD) cytokines, which are the only known JAK-STAT ligands, distantly related to mammalian IL-6, are up-regulated after DNA virus infection in a p38b-dependent manner. In vivo, both the p38b and JAK-STAT pathways are required for survival from DNA virus infection. Together, this data suggests that viral infection leads to p38b activation and the subsequent production of the secreted Unpaired cytokines. UPDs, in turn, activate JAK-STAT signaling to induce Tot gene expression and other target genes.  In addition, we have found that DNA virus-infected cells produce soluble factors that protect naive cells from viral infection. This antiviral activity interferes with infection of both DNA and RNA viruses. Thus, DNA virus infection induces a broad antiviral state in Drosophila cells. Given the the inducible expression and antimicrobial peptide-like characteristics of the Tots, these ?ndings lead us to hypothesize that virus-induced Turandot proteins function as secreted antivirals. Aim 1 explores the potential of the Tots as antiviral peptides, while Aim 2 proposes an unbiased approach to characterize and identify the soluble antiviral activity induced by DNA virus infection. Altogether, this project will probe the molecular mechanism of Tot gene induction and characterize the DNA virus-induced antiviral state."
"9275674","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research."
"9317863","RIPK1 and RIPK3, two homologous Ser/Thr kinases, originally attracted major interest as mediators of regulated necrotic cell death, termed necroptosis, under a wide range of pathologic settings, including ischemia- reperfusion injuries, autoimmune conditions and CNS pathologies. Necroptosis can be induced in vitro in macrophage cells following activation of TLR4 receptor by its ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell membranes of gram negative bacteria. Importantly, sensing of LPS by TLR4 is also well established to lead to the induction of inflammatory responses, which are an important component of innate immunity. Our recently published data identifies a new necroptosis-independent function of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in mediating TLR4- induced inflammatory gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Our studies further delineate downstream signaling cascades controlling RIPK-dependent production of inflammatory molecules, including TNFa and IFNb. In particular, we show Erk1/2 and TBK1/IKKe represent key effectors serving to promote inflammatory gene expression downstream from RIPK1/RIPK3. In addition, our data reveal a putative role for another TLR-induced inflammatory kinase TAK1 in the control of RIPK1 signaling in macrophages. Overall, these data reveal new roles of RIPK1/RIPK3 kinases in controlling TLR4-induced responses. However, the molecular mechanisms connecting RIPK1/RIPK3 to other players in this regulation remain largely unknown. Our new preliminary data reveal that detergent-insoluble RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome complexes, which form in response to TLR4 activation, may act to recruit and directly activate Erk1/2 and TBK1/IKKe. We also report new phosphorylation sites on RIPK1, which may be targeted by TAK1. Extending on these data, our research plan encompasses further in-depth characterization of the necrosome composition aimed at revealing its pro-inflammatory components, and evaluation of the phosphorylation changes in the known RIPK1/RIPK3 pathway components to define connections between necrosome-associated kinases. In sum, our work will elucidate mechanisms of RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent inflammation, which are just beginning to emerge and are highly relevant for both the physiologic and pathologic functions of these kinases. !"
