"9198577","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart defects occur in approximately 40,000 infants in the US each year and are a major cause of infant death. The Bench to Bassinet Program (B2B) was launched by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to accelerate pediatric cardiovascular translational research from discovery to early translational testing to clinical testing. Components of the B2B program include the Cardiovascular Development Consortium (CvDC), Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC). The objectives of the CvDC are to generate and disseminate comprehensive data about molecular networks and pathways that regulate cardiovascular development. Objectives of the PCGC are to identify genetic causes of human congenital heart disease and to relate genetic variants present in the congenital heart disease patient population to clinical outcomes. The consortia interact with each other, and with the NHLBI Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) to efficiently translate results from basic science to clinical research, and to provide clinical input on pressin needs for basic research. The Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) provides the infrastructure to enhance collaborations among the consortia and to identify and facilitate the translational research process for the most important pediatric cardiovascular clinical care problems. The ACC will drive standards that are required for data integration and sharing, leading to reproducibility of results. Our proposed ACC to support the CvDC and PCGC is a unique, integrated combination of world-leading pediatric cardiovascular and neurocognitive clinical/translational research expertise, advanced infrastructure, outstanding institutional support, and state-of-the-art technology. We believe these strengths to be critical for an ACC to successfully partner with the B2B program and NHLBI in leading the coordination of knowledge and data for this important pediatric cardiovascular research effort. Synopsis Research for patients with congenital heart disease requires a cooperative and coordinated effort among research programs to efficiently translate results from basic science to clinical research, and to provide clinical input on pressing needs for basic research. Our proposed ACC to support the CvDC and PCGC is a unique, integrated combination of world-leading pediatric cardiovascular and neurocognitive clinical/translational research expertise, advanced infrastructure, outstanding institutional support, and state-of-the-art technology."

"9199442","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lymphatic system plays the major role in tissue fluid homeostasis by draining the interstitial fluid back to the circulation. Lymphedema, caused by lymphatic malformation or obstruction, is often associated with radiation and surgery; however effective treatments that address the underlying molecular pathology are not available to date. We have recently reported that 9-cis retinoic acid (RA) can activate cell proliferation, migration and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), stimulate lymphangiogenesis in vivo, and ameliorate secondary lymphedema by promoting lymphatic regeneration in a mouse model. These pro-lymphangiogenic features of 9-cisRA, however, are quite unexpected, because RAs have been known for their anti-proliferative effects on many cell types, including blood vascular endothelial cells (BECs); where RAs have been shown to suppress BEC proliferation, and RA-deficient mouse embryos display hyper-proliferation of BECs. In this proposal, therefore, we aim to address two main questions (1) what is the molecular mechanism underlying RA-induced lymphangiogenesis, and (2) how can RAs selectively induce lymphangiogenesis, while concurrently suppressing angiogenesis. Our preliminary studies revealed that RAs may regulate Notch pathway to promote lymphatic sprouting, suggesting novel crosstalk between the two important morphogenic signals, and also that Prox1, the master regulator of lymphatic differentiation and development, can physically and functionally interact with a RA-binding nuclear receptor RXR in a RA- controlled manner. Furthermore, LECs predominantly express FABP4 as a cytoplasmic RA-carrier, and PPAR? as a dimerization partner of RXR, which is known to promote cell proliferation in response to RAs, whereas BECs selectively express CRABP-II and RAR?, a molecular pairing that induces cell growth arrest in response to RAs. Together, we propose working hypotheses addressing our two main questions that (1) RAs stimulate lymphatic sprouting by modulating Notch pathway genes through regulation of the interactions of Prox1 and RXR in LECs and (2) the predominant expression of FABP4 and PPAR? in LECs converts RA from an anti-proliferative signal to a pro-growth cue in LECs. Here, we aim to validate these working hypotheses by studying the role of RAs in promoting lymphangiogenesis through RXR? and PPAR? (Aim1), mechanism underlying the opposing effects of RAs on angiogenesis vs. lymphangiogenesis (Aim 2), and RA-controlled physical and functional interactions between Prox1 and RXR? (Aim 3). Together, our studies will not only provide important information on how Prox1 functions as the master regulator of lymphatic development by functioning as a nuclear receptor coregulator, but also define the molecular mechanism underlying RA-mediated selective promotion of lymphangiogenesis. In the long run, our study will help lay an essential experimental foundation to repurpose RAs as potential therapeutic agents for lymphatic circulation insufficiency."
"9256639","This is a pre-doctoral fellowship application to support an MD/PhD candidate's training to become a physician-scientist dedicated to the study and treatment of neurological disorders. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are thin-walled, dilated, vascular lesions that occur primarily in the brain and spinal cord, causing a variety of neurological symptoms and stroke. CCM disease is caused by loss of function mutations in three non-homologous adaptor proteins: CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2 (OSM), and CCM3 (PDCD10), forming a heterotrimeric ?CCM complex?. Evidence from mouse and patient studies strongly suggest that the CCM complex is specifically required in endothelial cells to prevent disease. This complex interacts with MEKK3 (MAP3K3) through direct binding between CCM2 and MEKK3. We have demonstrated, in a mouse model of CCM disease, that the CCM complex negatively regulates MEKK3 signaling in endothelial cells. In the disease state, disruption of the CCM complex results in gain of MEKK3 signaling and pathologic over-expression of KLF2 and KLF4 (KLF2/4) transcription factors. From genetic rescue experiments in mice and corroborating human disease studies, it is clear that this endothelial MEKK3?KLF2/4 pathway is required for the development of CCMs. The proposed studies will investigate downstream and upstream pathways of MEKK3?KLF2/4 signaling in the context of CCM disease with the overarching goal of identifying translational opportunities for the benefit of patients. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that CCMs arise from the KLF2/4- driven, over-secretion of ADAMTS metalloproteases that undermine the extracellular matrix of the vasculature. This will be done using genetic rescue and sufficiency strategies in the CCM disease mouse model. Previous studies have shown Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling to activate the MEKK3 pathway. Moreover, TLR4 polymorphisms are strongly associated with CCM disease severity in humans. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in CCM disease using pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of the CCM disease mouse model."
"9389097","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult stem cells are required for tissue homeostasis and repair in response to damage. Nutrient availability, stress, age, infection, and other physiological changes affect the number and function of stem cells. For example, nutrient-dependent pathways act within the Drosophila ovary to regulate germline stem cells (GSCs), such that their numbers and proliferation are higher on yeast-rich versus -poor diets. Further, multiple endocrine organs likely communicate their nutritional status to other organs (such as the ovary) to influence the behavior and function of adult stem cell lineages. For example, our laboratory showed that reduced amino acid sensing within adipocytes (which co-exist with hepatocyte-like oenocytes in a nutrient-sensitive, endocrine organ termed fat body) contributes to the decrease in GSC number on a poor diet. The rise of obesity and associated diseases including cancers underscores the need for understanding how adipocytes regulate the function of other tissues within the body; however, the mechanisms whereby adipocytes influence adult stem cells in other organs remain underexplored. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are transcription factors that can act in diet dependent pathways to control stem cell lineages and metabolism. Obesity is a risk factor for cancer and obesity-related changes in adipose tissue and NR signaling are linked to this risk. NRs are commonly mutated in cancers, making these proteins potential targets for drug discovery. NRs also function within the ovarian stem cell lineages to regulate many processes. For example, the heterodimeric receptor composed of the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (Usp) controls GSC maintenance and division, and differentiation of their GSC daughters. Ecdysone-induced protein 78C (E78) is required for establishment of proper GSC number and follicle viability, whereas Ecdysone-induced protein 75B (E75) is required for vitellogenesis. NR signaling within the larval fat body also controls developmental and metabolic processes. The mechanisms whereby NR signaling in adult adipocytes influences the GSC lineage, however, remain largely underexplored. We have evidence to suggest that NR signaling within adult adipocytes may relay nutritional information to the ovary. A previous proteomic analysis in our lab revealed that the levels of three nuclear receptors (Svp, HNF4, and HR4) are altered in adipocytes within 12 hours of dietary changes. Further, my preliminary results show that inhibition of Svp activity or ecdysone signaling in adult  adipocytes reduces GSC numbers. Based on these data, I hypothesize that NR signaling within adult adipocytes leads to changes in key downstream factors to modulate the GSC lineage. I will test this hypothesis by determining how ecdysone signaling in adult adipocytes regulates GSCs and their progeny (Aim 1) and by identifying additional NRs that regulate GSCs in response to diet (Aim 2)."
"9296158","We propose to renew funding for the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry  (IMS) at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN. The previous funding cycle has been  extremely successful in both advancing IMS technology and applying it to cutting edge biological projects. In  this renewal, we seek to advance the technology to provide next generation capabilities that will encompass  sub-micron spatial resolution, ultra-high sensitivity, and ease of use tools that will be made available to the  non-expert investigator. This proposal contains two overarching aims. First, it proposes to pioneer novel  instrument technologies, sample preparation devices and methods, and data analysis/image informatics  solutions. The latter is a critical need for current research grade IMS instrumentation, and it will be essential for  next-generation instruments.. Second, this proposal seeks to simplify the entire imaging process that currently  requires expertise and significant time to get high quality, meaningful results. Achievement of these global  aims is important to bring this technology into the biological and clinical laboratory.   The proposed Technology Research & Development (TRD) program will provide performance  improvements that will meet many of the current needs of the user community. Specific TRD advancements  will focus on maximizing instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution. We will also develop specialty reagents  and methodologies designed to enhance sensitivity, molecular specificity, and preserve the location of  biomolecules during sample preparation and analysis. We propose to develop a next generation imaging mass  spectrometer for routine use that is capable of achieving 500 nm spatial resolution at high sensitivity.  Additionally, we will develop software capable of co-registering and viewing imaging data from multiple  modalities such as IMS and microscopy through an image fusion process. Finally, we will develop new  advanced bio-computational algorithms to mine imaging data for molecular patterns and to normalize images  from large datasets. These developing advanced technologies will be focused on important driving biomedical  projects (DBPs) in infectious disease, eye disease, diabetes, and cancer.   Important activities of the Resource include: selected collaborations with investigators who have NIH  sponsored research projects that would significantly benefit from the developing IMS technology. This includes  high spatial resolution imaging, high mass resolving power instrumentation and advanced data analysis and  informatics capabilities. Training and dissemination of the technology will continue to be accomplished through  a yearly on-site four day training course termed AIMS (Advanced Imaging Mass Spectrometry). In addition,  training and dissemination will occur through hosting individual visiting investigators, students, and fellows, and  through publication of the research outcomes for both the technology and its applications, and from individual  invited research lectures presented by the faculty of the Resource."
"9393090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of HIV-1 latency and eradication at the interface between virology and immunology. The candidate is currently an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate's previous research and clinical experience and integrates the two distinct domains of expertise represented by her mentor team of Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes and Dr. Marcus Altfeld. The proposed experiments and didactic work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross-disciplinary skills that will enable her transitin to independence as a physician scientist working in the field of HIV eradication. Despite remarkable advances in the medical management of HIV-1 infection, the epidemic continues to present clinical, social and economic challenges on a global scale. Strategies to interrupt and contain the epidemic are urgently needed. The recent description of isolated cases of functional cure of HIV-1 infection has turned attention to the possibility of virus eradication to achieve thi goal. The feasibility of this approach depends on both the development of targeted agents for HIV-1 latency reversal and on the successful elimination of cells harboring reactivating virus. This proposal focuses on the latter question, with the goal of developing a novel approach to enhance immune clearance of the HIV-1 reservoir. In place of the traditional focus on epitope or antigen specific adaptive immune responses, this proposal seeks to use the innate immune natural killer (NK) cell population to rapidly identify generic signals of stress and infection on reservoir cells through the NKG2D receptor. To enhance this system of detection, the studies proposed will also test the efficacy of blocking the HIV-1 protein Nef to abrogate its immune evasion functions. Specific aims of this proposal include 1) to define both the kinetics of expression NKG2D ligands on CD4 T cells after disruption of HIV-1 latency and the signals responsible for initial expression, 2) to enhance expression of NKG2D ligands through inhibition of HIV-1 Nef, and identify the required domain(s) of Nef and 3) to demonstrate that sustained NKG2D ligand expression after latency reversal and inhibition of Nef leads to enhanced NK cell effector function. Positive results from these studies would provide the foundation for early clinical trials of a combined strategy of latency reversal and Nef blockade."
"9198767","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long?term goal of the Marsh?Armstrong laboratory is to discover biological processes that may someday become treatment targets in Glaucoma. Recently, we discovered that a large fraction of mitochondria are not degraded by the retinal ganglion cells themselves, but rather passed onto astrocytes for degradation. This unusual mode of transcellular degradation of mitochondria, or transmitophagy, occurs more at the optic nerve head than anywhere else in the nervous system. Since the optic nerve head is the likely site of injury in Glaucoma, and a possible site of injury in other optic atrophies that re due to specific deficits in mitochondria, we propose that the degradation of mitochondria at the optic nerve head may be the Achilles' heel of retinal ganglion cells, making them vulnerable to various diseases that manifest as sectorial loss of axons. In the current grant, we propose to test several predictions of this hypothesis. First, we propose to determine whether in rodent models of induced severe mitochondrial impairment, dominant optic atropy and glaucoma, the axonal mitochondria are more susceptible than the mitochondria that are in the soma. Second, we propose to delineate the molecular machinery at the optic nerve head that is responsible for the degradation of axonal mitochondria, and to show that it is indeed critical for the maintenance of healthy retinal ganglion cells. Thirdly, we will determine whether a glaucoma gene, Optineurin, which has been recently shown by others to be involved in mitochondria degradation, acts specifically at the optic nerve head to facilitate the degradation of damaged axonal mitochondria. To test what is admittedly a bold hypothesis, we have developed several new tools that will be applicable to other studies relating to the basic biology of mitochondria, and of how mitochondria are affected in varied diseases. Should the experiments demonstrate that the proposed hypothesis is largely correct, it would represent a significant departure from current views of how glaucomatous axonal loss occurs, and this would have important implications as to how glaucoma might one day be diagnosed and treated. Even if the hypothesis is proven incorrect by the experiments, it will still yield invaluable insight into the biology and pathology of retinal ganglion cells."
"9130933","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Heart disease, stroke, and limb loss continue to be a leading cause of U.S. mortality and morbidity. Despite advances in the surgical treatments for these pathologies, the long-term success of these interventions remains limited. Prior strategies aimed at improving the durability of vein grafts have focused largely on reductionist strategies and used linear models to describe the physical and biologic components of vascular disease progression. In order to advance our understanding of such complex phenomena, it is necessary to integrate different types of data and use quantitative models to predict behavior and outcomes.  OVERALL HYPOTHESIS: A specific, finite set of shear-regulated genes are critical to controlling pathologic vein graft adaptation. Using the integration of multiscale modeling and experimental techniques, these genes can be identified and manipulated in vivo to improve vein graft durability. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Identify those model parameters that are most critical for accelerated loss of the vein graft lumen. Approach: Using a stochastic optimization algorithm to evaluate our in silico model of vein graft adaptation, a large-scale simulation is use to define the minimum parameter set, and correspondingly the core biologic processes, that lead to reduced intimal thickening and enhanced outward remodeling. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Create a dynamic gene regulatory network, which when integrated with an agent-based model of vascular adaptation, identifies the subset of genes that have the most significant impact on reducing intimal hyperplasia and preserving vein graft lumen. Approach: Transcriptional profiling of vein graft samples is used to create a gene regulatory network. Through a systematic evaluation of this network, highly interconnected genes are identified, specifically identifying those genes that when deleted lead to substantial changes in global gene expression. This subset of genes is explored using an agent-based model of vein graft adaptation to identify a set of key hub genes that when deleted result in significant improvements in lumen preservation. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Validate the model prediction and explore combinations of key hub genes that provide the most critical impact on the biologic processes that are central to pathologic vein graft adaptation. Approach: Employing a high throughput, cell culture system and an siRNA inhibition strategy, the effect of key hub gene deletion on cell proliferation, apoptosis, matrix production, protease activation and cell motility will be evaluated. The most promising genes, either alone or in combination, will move into Aim 4 for in vivo testing. SPECIFIC AIM 4: Identify the optimum combination of genes that will move forward into a large animal validation model and translated into a therapeutic tool to improve vein graft survival. Approach: Packaging a lentivirus delivery vehicle with a siRNA construct, we will utilize a rabbit vein bypass graft mode to evaluate the in vivo performance of the most promising gene sets that have been vetted through Aim 1 through 3, assessing their impact on reducing intimal hyperplasia and preserving vein graft lumen."
"9389091","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathogenic species of mycobacteria and corynebacteria possess a thick and impermeable cell wall that helps these organisms evade detection and treatment by denying drug and probe molecules access to their cytoplasm. A distinctive feature of this barrier is an additional hydrophobic outer membrane composed of mycolic acids, which are covalently bound to an arabinogalactan (AG) polysaccharide that provides a link to the cell surface peptidoglycan. Efforts to identify weaknesses in these outer defenses would benefit greatly from a more complete understanding of how its components are assembled and maintained throughout the life cycle of the organisms. This project aims to develop chemical tools that specifically target and exploit the extracellular mycolyltransferase enzymes Ag85A-C, which mediate the covalent attachment of mycolic acids to the cell wall AG. First, we will detail a strategy to covalently label the cell wall mycolyl-arabinogalactan (mAG) complex with fluorophores to enable the visualization of mAG biosynthesis in real time. Our approach involves the design and synthesis of mimics of the endogenous mycolyl donor trehalose monomycolate (TMM), which carry fluorophore-conjugated mycolic acids. These substrates will be added to living bacteria, where we will evaluate their recognition by Ag85 and the incorporation of their fluorescent cargo into the growing cell wall. We anticipate that this robust labeling strategy will allow the localization and dynamics of cell wall assembly to be studied in unprecedented detail. Finally, we describe an approach to develop an Ag85-triggered turn-on fluorescent probe designed to fluoresce specifically in the presence of low concentrations of mycobacteria. We envisage that such a chemical tool would facilitate the early detection of pathogenic mycobacteria."
"9287287","IgG is the predominant circulating Ig class in most mammals. Both mouse and man have 4 IgG isotypes, which differ in ability to induce effector mechanisms. Murine IgG1 activates complement poorly, has the shortest IgG hinge region (which may limit immune complex (IC) formation) and binds to only 1 stimulatory Fc? receptor (Fc?R). Human IgG4 has similar characteristics to mouse IgG1 and should have even less ability to form ICs because it spontaneously forms univalent, bispecific molecules. These observations raise the question of why mouse IgG1 and human IgG4 evolved, despite their likely reduced ability to damage pathogens. We hypothesized that these isotypes provide a selective advantage by limiting host-damaging responses and studied this by comparing development of antibody (Ab)-mediated disorders in ?1-sufficient and deficient mice. Our results support our hypothesis: ?1-sufficient mice are not damaged by immunization with a potent antigen, while identically immunized ?1-deficient mice die from complement- and Fc?R-independent obstruction of glomerular capillaries by large ICs. IgG1 Abs suppress large IC formation and do so more potently than IgG2a or IgG2b, which have longer hinge regions. ?1-deficient mice also develop 2 complement- and Fc?R-dependent disorders, collagen induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, more frequently and more severely than ?1-sufficient mice on the same genetic background.  Three important questions are suggested by these observations: (1) do differences in hinge region length fully explain the greater ability of IgG1 than other IgG isotypes to disrupt formation of large ICs; (2) are our observations with mouse IgG isotypes human-relevant; and (3) can mouse IgG1 ameliorate an established Ab-mediated disease. These questions will be addressed by the following specific aims:  1. Determine whether short hinge region length promotes the ability of mouse IgG to suppress Ab- mediated disease. We will swap mouse IgG1 and IgG2b hinge regions and minimize and maximize IgG1 hinge region length and use the chimeric monoclonal Abs produced to study whether a short hinge region limits disease severity in complement-independent and complement-dependent disease models.  2. Determine whether our observations with mouse IgG isotypes are human-relevant. Chimeric anti-TNP mAbs that have human ?1, ?2, ?3 or ?4 constant regions, as well as an anti-TNP mAb that has a mutated human ?4 constant region that prevents formation of univalent, bispecific Ab molecules, will be produced and compared for ability to disrupt IC production in vitro and prevent IC kidney disease in vivo.  3. Determine whether an Ab isotype that is relatively poor at inducing effector functions can suppress an established Ab-mediated disorder. Studies will be performed with active and passive mouse models of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, a complement- and Fc?R-dependent blistering skin disease caused by Abs to collagen type VII (Col7), to determine whether IgG1 anti-Col7 Abs can cause established disease to regress.  "
"9387759","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this Pathway to Independence Career Development Proposal are to request support for training to develop expertise in experimental models of ovarian cancer while addressing a fundamental gap in knowledge that could have a significant impact on the treatment of ovarian cancer patients. K99/R00 support during this transitional phase of my career will be integral to my successful development as an independent investigator at a top-tier research institute or university. The training plan outlined herein will take advantage of the extensive resources available at The Wistar Institute and neighboring University of Pennsylvania, as well as key senior personnel with track records of scientific excellence to serve as mentors, co-mentors, and collaborators. The scientific portion of this proposal focuses on experimentally and mechanistically determining the role of nucleotide metabolism in the early events in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis and whether this pathway can be targeted alone or in combination with platinum-based therapeutics to suppress chemoresistant cancer stem cells and obtain a sustained therapeutic response. The proposed studies are based on my previous findings that the rate-limiting protein in nucleotide synthesis, ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2), is downregulated during oncogene-induced senescence, and an increase in nucleotides can overcome this tumor suppressive growth arrest. Additionally, RRM2 expression is highly increased in human EOC specimens and correlates with worse overall survival. I have published that knockdown or inhibition of RRM2 can decrease EOC cell growth via induction of senescence. My preliminary data show that knockdown of RRM2 can decrease aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity, which is a marker of putative ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs). Therefore, in line with these data I will explore two overarching scientific aims: 1) to determine whether nucleotide metabolism is increased in the early events in EOC tumorigenesis using a disease-relevant KRAS/MYC model; and 2) elucidate whether inhibition of nucleotide metabolism is synergistic with platinum treatment through a suppression of CSCs. The completion of the scientific aims of this proposal will develop my research skills in experimental models of EOC while also developing the rationale for clinical trials to obtain a sustained therapeutic response to platinum."

"9389153","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Najjar, Sonia, M Insulin resistance is the common factor among metabolic diseases that include obesity, type 2 diabetes and steatohepatitis. Hyperinsulinemia is an early indicator of insulin resistance. Although in many instances hyperinsulinemia reflects impaired insulin response, considerable data support the alternative view that hyperinsulinemia causes insulin resistance. Studies supported by this grant have pioneered the biochemical, physiological, and genetic identification of a CEACAM1-dependent signaling pathway that regulates hepatic insulin clearance. We have shown that CEACAM1 regulates peripheral insulin action by promoting hepatic insulin clearance. Using mice with liver-specific inactivation or global null mutation of Ceacam1, we have shown that impairment of insulin extraction causes chronic hyperinsulinemia and leads to insulin resistance by down-regulating insulin receptors and promoting de novo lipogenesis in liver. Based on preliminary data that underscore the central role of CEACAM1 in pathways regulating insulin action, lipid synthesis, and inflammation, we now expand our work to investigate the cause-effect relationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in the context of diet-induced obesity. We show that loss of hepatic CEACAM1 is associated with human and rodent obesity, and is an early correlate of diet-induced obesity in mice. Thus, feeding mice a high-fat diet reduces hepatic CEACAM1 levels by > 50% to cause hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Conversely, Ceacam1 overexpression in liver protects mice against insulin resistance and visceral obesity. This suggests that hyperinsulinemia plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. We now propose to test the hypothesis that reduction in hepatic CEACAM1 underlies the causative role of hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced insulin resistance. To this end, we will in Aim 1, investigate whether preventing hyperinsulinemia curbs diet-induced insulin resistance in a model of hepatic Ceacam1 gain-of-function, and we will systematically dissect which aspect of the metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hepatosteatosis, and inflammation) is prevented by the sustained expression of CEACAM1. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism by which free fatty acids acting through PPAR??cause transcriptional repression of Ceacam1. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether abolishing Ceacam1 regulation by PPAR? preserves CEACAM1 expression, and protects against diet-induced insulin resistance. We will generate knock-in mice in which the PPAR? response element in the Ceacam1 promoter has been mutated, and test whether this genetic manipulation confers protection against insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet. This should provide a critical test of the causative effect of hyperinsulinemia on insulin resistance, and identify CEACAM1 as a tractable drug target for the development of medications to combat altered metabolic conditions.

"9392827","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The accumulation of DNA damage can lead to the introduction of genetic mutations and an increase in genomic instability. Genomic instability is associated with several human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that non-coding RNA pathways contribute to maintaining genome stability. One such non-coding RNA pathway is the PIWI/piRNA pathway. The PIWI family of proteins is a subfamily of Argonaute proteins and is involved in the biogenesis of small non-coding RNAs termed piRNAs (Piwi interacting RNAs) in a Dicer independent fashion. The PIWI/piRNA pathway is known to suppress gene expression through posttranscriptional and epigenetic modifications. Recently the PIWI/piRNA pathway has been implicated in helping to maintain genome integrity. Specifically, Drosophila that lack PIWI proteins shows increased DNA damage and an activated meiotic checkpoint during oogenesis. The work defined in Aim 1 of this proposal will characterize the type of DNA damage and genomic instability that occurs in PIWI deficient Drosophila at the basepair resolution using novel deep-sequencing based techniques. In Aim 2, the mechanism used by PIWI proteins to help maintain genome stability will be determined, with a focus on how the PIWI-piRNA pathway interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint mechanism to ensure genome integrity."
"9197312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is the key plasma membrane protein that mediates I- transport in the thyroid and other tissues. In the thyroid, I- transport is the first step in the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. NIS couples the inward translocation of I- against its electrochemical gradient to the inward transport of Na+ down its electrochemical gradient. NIS activity is electrogenic, with a 2 Na+:1 I- stoichiometry. By contrast, we have shown that NIS transports perrhenate (ReO4-) and the environmental pollutant perchlorate (ClO4-) electroneutrally. For over 65 years, NIS-mediated radiotherapy has been the most successful targeted internal radiation cancer treatment available, as administered in thyroid cancer post-thyroidectomy. Since we cloned it, NIS has been ectopically expressed by gene transfer in extra-thyroidal cancers, rendering them susceptible to radioiodide treatment. The study of NIS is of considerable basic and medical interest. We have gained significant insights into structure/function relations in NIS by studying congenital I- transport defect-causing NIS mutations found in patients: in particular, we correctly predicted that NIS would have the same fold as the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT and the other proteins in its family. The recognition of this similarity enabled us to build a NIS homology model based on the structure of another bacterial protein with the same fold, vSGLT. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using our homology model have accurately predicted which residues play crucial roles in NIS function, substrate specificity, kinetics, and stoichiometry. All this characterizatio of NIS at the molecular level has allowed us to propose a mechanism for I- transport by NIS. In this project, we will test our hypothesis about the transport mechanism. We will bring to this task a battery of biophysical approaches combining whole cell-based biochemical experiments with studies using purified NIS [scintillation proximity assays (SPA) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)] and computational analysis, including statistical thermodynamics (ST) and MD simulations. We will also test specific hypotheses about the role of individual residues in the transport cycle. We have made considerable progress in addressing the fundamental question of how NIS can efficiently accumulate I- given the extremely low (sub-µM) I- concentrations in the extracellular fluids, which are much lower than the expected Kd of a protein for a halide: we have determined that binding of the first ion (either Na+ or I-) increases the affinity of NIS for he other ion by a factor of ~10. The following crucially important Specific Aims will be pursued: 1. What is the affinity of purified NIS for each of the transported ions in the presence of varying concentrations of the other ions? What is the effect of binding to one site on the ion affinities o the other sites? 2. What are the affinities of NIS in the inwardly open conformation for the ions i transports? 3. Which residues coordinate Na+ at the Na2 site and/or participate in the pathway that releases Na+ into the cytosol? 4. Which residues coordinate Na+ at the Na1 site, and how do they determine the change in Na+/ReO4- stoichiometry brought about by single amino acid substitutions?"

"9295104","PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this research is to identify direct substrates of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr protein kinases PknA and PknB. These kinases are essential both for M. tuberculosis viability in vitro and during infection. Together with the success of kinase inhibitors as clinically useful drugs in other settings, their essentiality makes PknA and PknB potentially valuable targets for new antituberculosis drugs. A large number of phosphoproteins have been identified in M. tuberculosis; for relatively few of these, however, is the cognate kinase that phosphorylates the protein known. This research aims to address this knowledge gap.  This research proposal has two Aims. The first aim makes use of modified kinase proteins together with ATP analogs that are specifically utilized by the modified kinases. These reagents are used to specifically label proteins that are substrates of either PknA or PknB. Labeled proteins can then be covalently captured, purified and identified by mass spectrometry. Proteins identified in this process that are not present in control assays are high probability direct substrates of the kinase of interest. The second aim makes use of strains in which the kinase of interest, PknA, PknB or both PknA and PknB are depleted. The total phosphoproteomes of these kinase-depleted strains, as well as control strains expressing native levels of the kinases, are then analyzed using optimized methods for phosphoprotein enrichment and mass spectrometry-based quantification. Phosphopeptides absent or significantly decreased in the kinase- depleted strain compared to the control strain are candidate substrates of the kinase that is depleted. Combining the results of the two aims of this research will identify substrates of PknA and PknB. These data will provide new insights into regulatory functions of these kinases and provide the basis to investigate the mechanisms by which phosphorylation of substrate proteins affects their function in the M. tuberculosis cell."
"9245391","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite making up only 2% of the US population, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 67% of new HIV infections in 2014, and incidence rates among adolescent MSM are alarmingly high in some areas. One potential barrier to the effectiveness of biomedical HIV prevention interventions among MSM is the physiologic efficiency of HIV transmission across the rectal mucosa, where approximately 70% of infections are thought to occur among MSM, as compared to vaginal or penile transmission. However, the majority of HIV mucosal transmission research has concentrated on vaginal transmission in women and non-human primates, which is then extrapolated and applied to understanding the mechanisms of rectal transmission among MSM. The rectal mucosa, with its single layer of columnar epithelium, is theoretically more prone to mechanical trauma during sexual intercourse than the vagina or penis, and exposure to semen during coitus causes a pro- inflammatory cascade in the female genital tract that may have similar effects in the rectum. In our preliminary data with 41 adult HIV-negative MSM aged 18-45, we show a distinct innate and adaptive pro-inflammatory immune response to condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI) in the rectal mucosa, and that the diversity and composition of the rectal mucosal microbiota differ between adult MSM who engage in CRAI versus men who do not engage in anal intercourse (AI) with MSM engaging in CRAI being enriched for the family Prevotellaceae. In this application, we propose to expand our previous studies to examine how factors such as age and episodic, frequent, consensual sexual activity can influence rectal transmission, and to determine whether the mucosal inflammation associated with CRAI leads to delayed mucosal healing after injury. In Aim 1, we will compare the rectal mucosal immune milieu between adolescent MSM with recent anal sex debut, adult MSM who have engaged in CRAI for > 5 years, and men who do not engage in AI with state of the art flow cytometry, RNA-Seq, and microbiota sequencing assays and examine the ex vivo impact on HIV susceptibility with rectal explant challenge experiments. In Aim 2, we will tease out the effects of rectal mucosal trauma due to episodic anal intercourse with and without semen exposure in a cohort of adult MSM engaging in CRAI. Finally, in aim 3, we will examine whether adult MSM who engage in CRAI exhibit delayed rectal mucosal healing after experimentally induced injury with rectal biopsy during high resolution anoscopy with follow-up digital imaging. We will build upon our successful translational mucosal immunology program with a highly successful clinical research and retention infrastructure that was designed to understand factors that may influence rectal transmission among MSM. A better understanding of rectal HIV transmission among MSM will contribute valuable information to the development of biomedical HIV prevention interventions, including an HIV vaccine."
"9414313","PROJECT SUMMARY  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most devastating cancer-related diseases in the United States. Historically, it was thought these pancreatic tumors arose from the ductal compartment of the tissue based on the morphology of the tumor cells. Recently, this school of thought has been re-evaluated and resounding evidence now points at the acinar cell as the cell of origin. Upon injury, or oncogenic insult, acinar cells undergo a process of acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM). In the context of tissue injury, such as pancreatitis, ADM is an adaptive response as there is rapid repair of the tissue following cessation of the injury stimulus, a process we have labeled as ?Adaptive? ADM. Interestingly, in the presence of oncogenic signals, such as mutant Kras*, ADM does not recover and instead progresses into precancerous lesions ? the most common being pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). This progression of ADM under oncogenic stimulus we have labeled as ?Oncogenic? ADM. This proposal will examine the underlying mechanism of how ADM progresses to PanIN in the presence of Kras*, as well as investigate the difference between ?Adaptive? and ?Oncogenic? ADM. Our group has recently identified the paired-related homeobox1 (Prrx1) transcription factor as a potentially important player in ADM. We have previously shown that Prrx1 expression increases during pancreatitis, and that Prrx1 directly interacts with Sox9, a ductal gene important in the formation of ADM and progression to PanIN. Therefore, we hypothesize up-regulation of Prrx1 following pancreatic injury (pancreatitis) results in the maintenance of ADM and allows for subsequent transformation by oncogenic Kras*, thereby promoting pancreatic tumorigenesis. We will test this hypothesis through two interrelated Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the requirement of Prrx1 for the formation and maintenance of ADM and PanIN lesions following pancreatic injury. We will use tissue-specific knockout of Prrx1 (Ptf1aCre;Prrx1f/f) in vivo to determine the requirement of Prrx1 in the formation and maintenance of ADM following caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Additionally, we will knockout Prrx1 in the context of inducible oncogenic Kras* signaling (iKras*;Prrx1f/f). With this model, we can address whether Prrx1 is required for PanIN formation and whether ADM cells lacking Prrx1 are more resistant to transformation by Kras*. Aim 2 will investigate the regulation of ?Adaptive? and ?Oncogenic? ADM. Using 2D and 3D in vitro assays and tissue from Aim1, we will investigate the mechanisms of Prrx1 regulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or oncogenic Kras* during ?Adaptive? and ?Oncogenic? ADM, respectively. Furthermore, we will take an unbiased approach to identify additional regulation of ?Adaptive? and ?Oncogenic? ADM by isolating ADM cells from iKras* animals following pancreatitis and performing RNAseq to examine differential gene expression. Taken together, these studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying ADM and elucidate what promotes the initiation of pancreatic tumorigenesis instead of tissue recovery."
"9388781","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retrovirus HIV, the etiological agent of the global AIDS epidemic, has been a major health concern since its discovery in 1981. Currently, the most successful treatment regimen is the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which combines three or four of the current 26 FDA-approved HIV drugs in treatment. Half of these drugs target the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme that is essential for viral replication. Among the RT inhibitors, five are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) which bind to an allosteric pocket of RT. NNRTIs can inhibit the polymerase function by themselves, or synergistically with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that bind to the active site of the enzyme. Currently, NNRTIs are always combined with NRTIs in HAART to maximize synergy and efficacy. Although HAART has been successful in extending the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals, several limitations to this treatment regimen exist, including solubility of individual drug, long-term toxic side effects and drug resistance. Therefore, the long term goal of this research is to develop safer, next generation therapeutics with improved pharmacological properties (PK/PD) and solubility that can overcome resistant variants. Using computational approaches, we have previously developed novel NNRTIs that have very potent antiviral activity (best EC50 = 530 pM) against HIV-1 as well as resistant variants of HIV-1 with common RT mutations. Moreover, our compounds exhibit much lower cytotoxicity and higher solubility than the FDA-approved second generation NNRTIs etravirine and rilpivirine. In order to further develop these compounds into useful therapeutics, binding affinity and association/dissociation rates will be determined using pre-steady state kinetics. Moreover, RT- inhibitor interactions will be elucidated with x-ray crystallography to provide a platform for rational drug design. Furthermore, antiviral activity of novel NNRTIs developed in our lab will be measured using cell-based assays, and changes in potency when combined with current FDA-approved NRTIs will be examined to find the combination that displays the highest synergistic effect. Finally, the molecular mechanism of NRTI-NNRTI synergy will be investigated by solving a quaternary RT:DNA:NRTI:NNRTI structure. Overall, this research will allow us to develop more potent NNRTIs with improved pharmacological properties, and identify the optimal combination of NNRTI and NRTI for combination therapy that should lower treatment failure rate and delay development of resistance."
"9254889","Project Summary The identification of cancer metastases to the bony vertebral column obligates the treating clinician to make a surgical decision. If the spine is deemed unstable and at risk for fracture, then the patient will undergo a major spinal operation, and will often spend much of their remaining life recuperating from it. Vertebral body metastasis is sometimes treated with corpectomy of the affected vertebral body and adjacent intervertebral discs, creating a non-contained skeletal defect needing anterior column spinal reconstruction and posterior instrumentation. Reconstructive techniques requiring both an anterior surgical exposure (reconstruction of affected vertebra) and a posterior exposure (instrumentation of the spine) are quite invasive for these patients, while a posterior-only surgical approach requires small implants for anterior spinal column reconstruction. Intervertebral expandable titanium cages, although effective for this reconstruction, are expensive, and can represent the dominant cost for the reconstructive spinal procedure. In addition, they are often too large to insert safely from the posterior surgical approach. Thus, a critical need exists to provide these frail patients with a lower surgical burden while at the same time improving their quality of life. This research proposal aims to address a critical issue involved in the care of patients with metastatic spine defects. The goals of this proposal are to develop a novel expandable biomaterial system that can be delivered via a posterior-only surgical approach, would provide rigidity and stability to the spine, and would be much more cost effective than current expandable metal cages"
"9387766","PROJECT SUMMARY  Quinonoid compounds are important building blocks in organic synthesis, and their diverse array of biological activity makes them attractive as potential drug candidates. However, asymmetric transformations of quinones have largely been limited to Diels?Alder cycloadditions. While the photochemistry of quinones has been extensively studied, efforts to render these reactions asymmetric have been unsuccessful. Photocycloadditions of quinones are of particular interest because they provide molecular scaffolds that are distinct from those accessible using traditional thermal chemistry. The development of asymmetric photocycloadditions of quinones will enable chemists to access medicinally relevant molecules and important synthetic intermediates for use in drug discovery. This proposal aims to accomplish this goal using visible light sensitization with transition metal photocatalysts. The ability to use visible light to effect triplet sensitization provides a practical, safer alternative to traditional photochemical methods, which require specialized photoreactors for the use of high energy UV light. The successful development of this methodology will enable organic chemists to synthesize enantioenriched quinone derivatives without using specialized equipment, greatly broadening accessibility. This methodology will provide a straightforward synthesis of biologically relevant structural motifs that were previously difficult to access, thereby offering opportunities for pharmaceutical development in unexplored chemical space."
"9243108","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a term for periods during sleep when breathing is blocked or impeded, is a highly prevalent medical condition, increases with obesity and diabetes, and affects 9-18% of the adult U.S. population. OSA occurs because of recurrent upper airway collapse during sleep leading to reductions in airflow with cyclic changes in body oxygen, and results in a state of chronic intermittent hypoxia. Many essential processes, such as production of red blood cells, energy regulation, and formation of new blood vessels, are regulated by hypoxia. OSA is an exceedingly common problem that has been linked to high blood pressure, diabetes, poor memory and heart attacks. Hypoxia leads to up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIF-1 and HIF-2 were discovered as a result of studies of erythropoietin (EPO), the key hormone that stimulates erythroid progenitors and regulates the production of erythrocytes, the subject of the PI's previous VA support.  This application is designed to gain novel insights into the contribution of HIFs, which regulate erythropoiesis, to the pathophysiology of OSA. The PI of this proposal has been intrigued that, in contrast to other hypoxic conditions, his major clinical/academic focus of polycythemia/erythrocytosis is not a common feature of OSA. During prolonged hypoxia, HIFs mediate an increase in erythropoiesis, leading to an increased red blood cell (RBC) mass. Upon return to normoxia, the increased RBC mass is abruptly overcorrected by the preferential destruction, i.e., hemolysis, of hypoxia-formed young RBCs, a phenomenon termed neocytolysis. We created a novel mouse model of neocytolysis and used this model to show that neocytolysis is mediated by excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased mitochondria in RBCs, and increased micro RNA miR-21 which down-regulates catalase.  We also obtained preliminary data suggesting that neocytolysis is the main mechanism preventing polycythemia in patients with OSA. We observed that erythrocytes and reticulocytes of OSA patients have reduced catalase transcripts and activity, along with increased miR-21, and that these levels normalize with CPAP treatment. We also observed that in uncorrected OSA, increased mitochondrial mass and levels of ROS are found not only in reticulocytes and mature RBCs, but also in other blood cells such as platelets, T-cells, B- cells, granulocytes, and mononuclear cells. With CPAP treatment, mitochondrial ROS decrease and mitochondrial mass normalizes.  To accomplish our research goals outlined in this research proposal, we will elucidate OSA changes in HIF-regulated pathways using peripheral blood cells to confirm our preliminary findings that neocytolysis occurs secondary to chronic intermittent hypoxia in most OSA patients. We will determine the metabolic consequences of chronic intermittent versus sustained hypoxia in a mouse model of neocytolysis and assess the effect(s) of pharmacological manipulation of HIFs. We will evaluate the effects of carbon monoxide (CO), which is increased by hemolysis, on the activity of the carotid body (CB). The CB is the key sensor of arterial blood oxygen. Hypoxia increases neural signals from the CB which, through chemosensory reflexes, controls breathing and blood pressure, a principal adaptation to hypoxia. Enhanced CB chemosensory reflexes play a substantial role in OSA pathophysiology. Emerging evidence suggests that hypoxic sensing by the CB involves blood oxygen-dependent interplay between CO generation by heme oxygenase-2 and hydrogen sulfide synthesis by cystathionine-?-lyase. We will evaluate, using an exhaled CO end-tidal breath analyzer, whether increased CO produced by hemolyzed RBC in OSA influences CB sensing and ensuing chemosensory reflexes."
"9197914","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular mechanisms underlying blood development and disorders are of great interest and importance from the perspective of understanding normal function and leukemia. Drosophila has long served as a genetic model for many developmental processes, but its usefulness as a hematopoietic model has only recently been appreciated. The mechanisms that maintain blood stem cells in Drosophila show remarkable conservation in strategy of development and function with mammalian systems. This study utilizes powerful genetic tools and reagents available for the Drosophila model system to understand how local and global signals affect blood cell development. In particular, we will analyze blood cell differentiation within the fruit fly blood-producing organ to assess how cell cycle, cell differentiation, and organ morphology are influenced during normal development as well as in the presence of stressful environmental stimuli. This proposal consists of three major aims. Aim 1 describes experiments aimed at mapping the organismal connection between defects in CO2 reception and blood cell maturation. In Aim 2 we propose to fully characterize the cell cycle profile of blood progenitors and we will uncover the signaling pathways regulating proteins controlling cell cycle progression. Finally, in Aim 3, we will identify and characterize te effects of tumor growth in epithelial tissue on blood cell development in the mesoderm derived hematopoietic organ. The role of tumor burden on the blood/immune system is of great importance to human cancer and injury, and Drosophila provides an ideal model for understanding the mechanisms in detail. Overall, the research we propose will lead to critical insights into how blood cells are influenced by external and internal stimuli, the mechanisms of which are likely to be conserved in humans. The PI will be involved in mentoring and supervision of the work that will involve the training of 4 postdoctoral fellows and 1 graduate student. Additionally, the laboratory traditionally trains a large number of undergraduates in research. The typical undergraduate spends 2-3 years in the laboratory; postdocs, 5 years and graduate students 5-6 years. The main scientific disciplines our research encompasses include developmental biology and genetics. All graduate and postdoctoral researchers involved are extremely knowledgeable in these two fields, and the more experienced members of the lab will pass along this familiarity to newer members."

"9296157","We propose to renew funding for the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry  (IMS) at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN. The previous funding cycle has been  extremely successful in both advancing IMS technology and applying it to cutting edge biological projects. In  this renewal, we seek to advance the technology to provide next generation capabilities that will encompass  sub-micron spatial resolution, ultra-high sensitivity, and ease of use tools that will be made available to the  non-expert investigator. This proposal contains two overarching aims. First, it proposes to pioneer novel  instrument technologies, sample preparation devices and methods, and data analysis/image informatics  solutions. The latter is a critical need for current research grade IMS instrumentation, and it will be essential for  next-generation instruments.. Second, this proposal seeks to simplify the entire imaging process that currently  requires expertise and significant time to get high quality, meaningful results. Achievement of these global  aims is important to bring this technology into the biological and clinical laboratory.   The proposed Technology Research & Development (TRD) program will provide performance  improvements that will meet many of the current needs of the user community. Specific TRD advancements  will focus on maximizing instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution. We will also develop specialty reagents  and methodologies designed to enhance sensitivity, molecular specificity, and preserve the location of  biomolecules during sample preparation and analysis. We propose to develop a next generation imaging mass  spectrometer for routine use that is capable of achieving 500 nm spatial resolution at high sensitivity.  Additionally, we will develop software capable of co-registering and viewing imaging data from multiple  modalities such as IMS and microscopy through an image fusion process. Finally, we will develop new  advanced bio-computational algorithms to mine imaging data for molecular patterns and to normalize images  from large datasets. These developing advanced technologies will be focused on important driving biomedical  projects (DBPs) in infectious disease, eye disease, diabetes, and cancer.   Important activities of the Resource include: selected collaborations with investigators who have NIH  sponsored research projects that would significantly benefit from the developing IMS technology. This includes  high spatial resolution imaging, high mass resolving power instrumentation and advanced data analysis and  informatics capabilities. Training and dissemination of the technology will continue to be accomplished through  a yearly on-site four day training course termed AIMS (Advanced Imaging Mass Spectrometry). In addition,  training and dissemination will occur through hosting individual visiting investigators, students, and fellows, and  through publication of the research outcomes for both the technology and its applications, and from individual  invited research lectures presented by the faculty of the Resource."
"9387117","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Warfarin (Coumadin), a vitamin K antagonist, is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. It is also notorious as one of the most unpredictable and dangerous drugs in current medical practice. The observed 20- fold range in optimal dose can be partially attributed to genetics and diet: for example, polymorphisms in genes linked to vitamin K recycling and warfarin metabolism, including CYP3A4, can change warfarin pharmacokinetics and function. Also, altered intake of leafy vegetables rich in phylloquinone, the plant-based form of vitamin K, can override the effects of the drug. Despite extensive studies with respect to these factors, nearly half of observed warfarin dose variation still remains unexplained. Notably, molecular characterization of vitamin K in the liver reveals that only 10% is the plant-based form: the remainder carries the chemical signature of bacterial biosynthesis. How the unique microbial communities (microbiota) that each of us harbors in the gastrointestinal tract influence variability in response to warfarin or other drugs is not understood. Solutions to these challenges could lead to safer and more effective warfarin therapy. Unlike polymorphisms in our human genomes, gut microbial communities can be rapidly modified and therefore both the drug and the patient (via their microbiota) could be attuned for maximum therapeutic benefit. This application presents a plan to identify the specific microbial mechanisms that determine warfarin response. I have established a system to measure warfarin function in gnotobiotic mice, whose microbiota can be precisely manipulated. I have discovered that mice lacking gut microbes exhibit profound hyper-responsiveness to warfarin, consistent with a role for microbiota-derived vitamin K in this process. However, I also discovered altered regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), including the murine homolog of human CYP3A4 (Cyp3a11). Colonization of germfree mice with complete gut microbial communities normalizes warfarin function and DME expression. In Aim 1, this system will be used to determine the impact of interpersonal variation in microbiota-derived vitamin K on warfarin function. In Aim 2, I will define how gut microbial regulation of host DME gene expression impacts warfarin metabolism and function. Successful completion of these aims will address critical questions to explain frequent and dangerous adverse reactions to a widely used drug. Such an understanding could open the door to new approaches for optimizing warfarin dosing or gut community composition for safer pharmacology. Further, these studies will highlight host-microbiota interactions that could influence the function of other vitamin-K dependent processes and drugs."
"9388402","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterocycles are ubiquitous in pharmaceutical compounds, natural products, and other bioactive compounds. For this reason, new methods for their preparation are sought after by researchers. A notable catalytic reaction for the preparation  of heterocycles is palladium-catalyzed carbonylation. This reaction uses carbon monoxide as a C1 source for the heterocycle. Many palladium-catalyzed carbonylation reactions have (pseudo)halide functionality built into the substrate to improve the regioselectivity of the reaction. However, this halide functionality is often installed into the substrate using waste-generating and time-consuming manipulations. An attractive alternative to this so-called classical carbonylation reaction is the palladium-catalyzed aerobic oxidative C-H carbonylation reaction. Under these conditions, a (pseudo)halide in the substrate is replaced with a C-H bond, and an oxidant is used to attain catalytic turnover. Directed aerobic oxidative C-H carbonylation is attractive because the only byproduct of the reaction is water, O2 can be used as the terminal oxidant, and heterocycle products can be synthesized with excellent regiocontrol. However, many published directed oxidative carbonylation reactions use stoichiometric amounts of cooxidants such as copper(II), silver(I), and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) to achieve efficient catalytic turnover, and high loadings of palladium (10 mol%) are typical. These conditions prevent oxidative C-H carbonylation reactions from being applied on an industrial process scale. Ideally, the loading of cooxidants could be reduced to a cocatalytic level, and the loading of palladium could be reduced to the single digits or less mol%. The chemistry proposed herein constitutes a detailed study of the reaction mechanism of a published oxidative C-H carbonylation reaction using innovative techniques such as operando high-pressure NMR spectroscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The development of high-pressure NMR spectroscopic instrumentation will also be a portion of this project. Additionally, a published reaction that prescribes two equivalents of BQ for aerobic oxidative carbonylation to afford bioactive 3,4-dihydro-?-carbolin-1-ones is targeted for further development by lowering the palladium loading as well as the BQ loading to a cocatalytic level. The substrate scope for this reaction is also targeted for expansion including bioactive targets. Moreover, a new reaction is proposed: The palladium-catalyzed aerobic oxidative C-H carbonylation of 2-ester substituted E-ethenylanilines to 4-quinolone-3-carboxylate esters, which are privileged scaffolds in FDA-approved antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (a.k.a. Levaquin(r)). The proposed substrate scope of this reaction includes bioactive targets such as approved antibiotics."
"9232367","Project Summary Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the fastest growing form of heart failure, is almost exclusively found in older persons, particularly women, and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. The primary chronic symptom in HFpEF patients is severe exercise intolerance measured objectively as decreased peak exercise oxygen uptake (peak VO2). By convention, the majority of work to date has focused on central (cardiac) limitations, however drug therapies targeting cardiac function do not improve peak VO2 or survival in HFpEF patients. We first reported that older HFpEF patients have multiple skeletal muscle abnormalities (i.e. decreased skeletal muscle size, reduced oxidative capacity and capillary-to-fiber ratio), which result in increased anaerobic metabolism during exercise. Accumulation of anaerobic metabolites within the exercising muscles is known to activate skeletal muscle afferent fibers (called metaboreceptors), that elicit a reflex-mediated increase in efferent muscle sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) nerve activity (MSNA). We propose a novel paradigm of exercise intolerance in older HFpEF patients whereby skeletal muscle abnormalities lead to overactivation of the muscle metaboreflex and MSNA mediated vasoconstriction that limits delivery of oxygenated blood to the active muscles. Further, exercise training mediated improvements in skeletal muscle function will alleviate the metaboreflex, thereby reducing MSNA and improve oxygen delivery to the contracting muscles. To test this novel paradigm, we will first perform an initial cross-sectional comparison of older (?60 years) HFpEF patients with age and sex-matched healthy controls, and then enter the patients into a randomized, controlled, single blind, trial of exercise training to test the following hypothesis: 1) that MSNA is elevated in older HFpEF patients compared to healthy controls, and is associated with reduced peak VO2; and 2) Exercise training will attenuate MSNA compared to attention control, and will correlate with improved peak VO2. In the cross- sectional comparison, we will perform the first ever direct measures of MSNA, using peroneal nerve microneurography, during dynamic exercise and post-exercise muscle ischemia (a metaboreflex stimuli) in HFpEF patients. The HFpEF patients will then be randomly assigned to a 16-week trial of supervised exercise training or attention control. Given the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance and mechanisms for improvement with exercise training is poorly understood, and no medications have been proven effective, our results have the potential to shift paradigms, and have a major impact on the management of older patients with HFpEF, while achieving the AREA mandate to expose students to meritorious research, and strengthen the research environment at the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, at the University of Texas at Arlington."
"9323699","Heme is a central molecule in the biology of life. Its unique chemical properties make it a versatile co-factor in many biological reactions. Heme is also an important source of iron for bacteria. In this regard, bacteria use surface proteins to import host heme and then break the heme ring to release the iron. This latter reaction is catalyzed by proteins termed heme degrading enzymes (HDEs). Because of their iron-liberating properties and the importance of iron in bacterial physiology, HDEs have emerged as critical during the infection of mammalian hosts.  The sporulating bacterium B. anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax disease and a weapon of bioterrorism. This Gram-positive rod grows to extraordinary levels in vertebrate hosts and thus serves as a model for iron uptake. Previous work with this pathogen uncovered an elegant system of surface and secreted hemophores that import host heme. The biological consequences of heme import in terms of the lifecycle of this pathogen have not been determined. Preliminary data presented here suggests B. anthracis encodes three distinct HDEs, all of which break down heme. This finding raises the interesting question as to why B. anthracis would require three seemingly redundant HDEs.  It is proposed here that each HDE may be important during different phases of a developing B. anthracis infection. In Aim 1, an inhalational model of infection, the most serious clinical form, is used to determine the contribution of each HDE to anthrax disease. In Aim 2, the functional role of each HDE is probed in three important host niches: protection from host killing by alveolar macrophages, the detoxification of excess heme, and the utilization of iron from host hemoglobin in blood. These studies will determine if HDEs are anti-anthrax targets and where in the bacillus infection cycle they function."
"9199092","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical goal in heart research is to elucidate the mechanisms that promote clinically significant atherosclerosis and then use this knowledge to design novel therapies. We believe it is essential to couple new concepts with new drug delivery strategies, and we have thus formed a unique multi?PI team with complementary expertise in atherosclerosis and nanomedicine. The overarching concept is that plaque progression represents a pathologic process called defective inflammation resolution. The nanomedicine theme is based on the concept that encapsulation of biologics inside biodegradable, targeted polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) protects the cargo until it is delivered to atheromata and then facilitates controlled release of the biologic. We have demonstrated this principle using a peptide mediator of resolution called Ac2?26. To move closer to human translation, we now propose iterative NP optimization, in?depth mechanistic studies, and application to another type of biologic. The overarching hypothesis is that clinically translatable polymeric NPs packaged with various types of resolution mediators will, via specific molecular mechanisms related to cellular processes of resolution, prevent advanced plaque progression.  In Aim 1, we will iteratively optimize and evaluate collagen IV (Col IV) ? targeted NPs for effective delivery of Ac2?26 to atherosclerotic plaques.  Modifications to NP size, charge, loading capacity, and targeting properties will be carried out to increase delivery of bioactive Ac2?26 to atherosclerotic lesions in a manner that optimizes prevention of plaque progression.  In Aim 2, we will elucidate athero?protective mechanisms of Ac2?26 NPs focusing on oxidative stress, collagen formation, defective efferocytosis, and inflammation. In Aim 3, we will explore the molecular?cellular  mechanisms of the pro?resolving protective effects of IL?10 in advanced atherosclerosis using athero? targeted IL?10 NPs, which will be optimized for controlled release kinetics, optimal bioactivity, and  efficacy.  At the conclusion of this project, we hope t have elucidated mechanistic links between inflammation resolution and atherosclerosis while simultaneously developing nanomedicines capable of blocking plaque progress in high?risk humans.  RELEVANCE: Atherothrombotic vascular disease is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, with global spread predicted for the future. Important mechanistic and therapeutic gaps exist in combatting this disease.  This proposal will study mechanisms that promote atherosclerosis progression in a manner that is highly translatable to human therapy through the use of nanomedicine."
"9392350","PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies."
"9413644","The Neurobiology of Disease Workshop (NDW) provides basic scientists and trainees with an in-depth introduction to neurological disorders. It is organized as a day-long workshop held the Friday before the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting. The overall goal of the Workshop is to introduce the world of neurological disease to the basic scientist, with the expectation that whatever their interest or expertise in the nervous system, they may bring extraordinary new questions, ideas and even solutions to problems in the field. Reflecting the dynamic and rapidly advancing state of neuroscience research, the topic of each NDW is identified only one year in advance. Although the specific topics change each year, the Workshop?s agenda format remains consistent. The core of the Workshop begins with a patient presentation. Growing less common in clinical departments, and certainly unique to a basic science workshop, is the patient presentation that begins the day-long NDW program. This is a live interview performed by an experienced clinician in front of the entire audience. Not only are patients presented, but in applicable cases, family members of the patient also attend the Workshop. Often the family members are asked to describe how the disease has affected their own lives, helping neuroscientists in training see the human side of diseases of the nervous system. The patient presentation is followed by multiple lectures that cover the essential clinical and basic science information necessary to understand the disease or disorder. The set of lectures includes neuropathology (where relevant), the anatomy of the systems involved, neurochemical and physiological correlates, current treatments, and other related information. The faculty members, chosen for their expertise in the field, present the core information, which lasts approximately three to four hours. As detailed above, a patient is presented by a senior clinician early in the Workshop schedule, and time is allotted for the audience to ask questions of the patient or the clinician. Following the patient and core lecture presentations, Workshop participants form breakout groups, each led by a team of two faculty members, for a period of extended discussions. The total time for each discussion group is 1.5 hours and these sessions are designed to stimulate participant thinking and speculation about the disease and to inform them of the research already underway."
"9369509","ABSTRACT  Entry of Ebolavirus (EBOV) into host cells is mediated by its sole glycoprotein, known as GP. The GP and its associated EBOV entry events possess many unusual features that provide novel insights into our fundamental understanding of viral entry. In this R21 project, we aim to elucidate how the newly identified cellular restriction factors, known as interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, especially IFITM2, potently and specifically inhibit EBOV entry, and in doing so, aid the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Aim 1: Establish a single virus fusion assay for EBOV and dissect the stages of membrane fusion inhibited by IFITM2. We will take advantage of the fact that EBOV GP can be efficiently incorporated into its virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by the VP40 matrix protein, and develop a single virus imaging and fusion system to determine how IFITM2 inhibits EBOV fusion in endolysosomes. Aim 2: Elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which IFITM2 specifically inhibits EBOV GP-mediated entry. We will test the central hypothesis that IFITM2 profoundly inhibits EBOV entry by disturbing the triggering capability and/or the cholesterol transport activity of its intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). A series of biochemical and novel fluorescence lipid labeling techniques will be used to assess the effect of IFITM2 on cholesterol content, membrane fluidity, and conformational changes of EBOV GP. EBOV is a highly pathogenic filovirus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans, with a fatality rate of up to 90%. Results from the proposed studies will provide critical novel insight into how IFITM2 restricts EBOV GP-mediated membrane fusion and entry, as well as advance our understanding of the general mechanism of IFITMs that block viral entry."
"9111480","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 10-20% of children globally are affected by a mental health problem. Child mental health has been identified as a priority within the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMRO). Following consultations with international and regional experts and stakeholders, WHO EMRO developed an evidence-based manualised School Mental Health Intervention (EMRO SMHI), endorsed by all member countries, including Pakistan, where the federal and provincial health departments have made plans for phased national implementation at scale. A number of implementation challenges identified by stakeholders at a WHO EMRO consultation have to be addressed to achieve these plans, including sustainable delivery of quality training and supervision at scale; routine monitoring of outcomes; mechanisms for ensuring programme quality; and intervention adaptation for delivery in diverse regional settings. We will conduct research in Pakistan embedded within national implementation of the EMRO SMHI to address these challenges, applying scalable technological and social innovations developed and feasibility-tested in Pakistan. This builds upon many years' experience of successfully delivering similar programs in resource- poor and challenging community-based settings in this region of Pakistan. Capacity building will be embedded within the project with focus on child mental health. This will involve strengthening the capacity of targeted cohorts of researchers and policy makers in 4 EMRO countries (Pakistan, Iran, Jordan, and Egypt) to: 1) Develop skills in generating, applying and effectively disseminating research to aid implementation of  school-based interventions for child mental health; and 2) To understand, interpret and apply science-based methods and information to develop child mental  health policies and plans; 3) Use their skills to build the child mental health research and policy capacity of their countries and the  region as a whole. The research component, consisting of two stages, will be embedded within Pakistan's phased scale-up implementation of the EMRO SMHI. Research will be conducted in Pakistan, in sites with an established research infrastructure, sub-districts Kallar Syedan and Gujar Khan, in the Province of Punjab. The research team will partner with the Pakistan Health Ministry and the WCC-IoP to both study and assist its scale-up plans by integrating our technological and social innovation. We will begin our work by engaging stakeholders to develop a comprehensive theory of change to both guide scale-up and support testable hypotheses about the structures, collaborations, and knowledge most important to the process of scaling innovations. In the next stage the research team will work with the WCC-IoP to conduct hybrid effectiveness-implementation research comparing two methods of implementing the EMRO SMHI. Using mixed methods, we will compare conventional training, supervision, service delivery and program monitoring with the use of a tablet-based technology-assisted platform that integrates these essential functions. The platform uses readily-adaptable video and audio modules to provide a structure for cascading personalised knowledge and skill instruction to teachers, so they can in turn apply universal and targeted strategies to address mental health problems with children and their families. We hypothesise that use of the platform will lead to improvements in both clinical and implementation outcomes."
"9208639","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R25-proposal, entitled Short-Term Research Education Program to Increase Diversity in Health-Related Research, will focus the considerable strengths and diversity of multi-departmental and institutional research dealing with vascular biology at Vanderbilt University and Meharry Medical College into a coherent framework for introducing research design and methods. Stipends for 10 undergraduate students will be available. The undergraduate students will be recruited from across the country and from those groups of individuals described in the R25 initiative. Every effort will be made to have these students participate in the program for two consecutive summers.

"9189591","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Numerous events can lead to bacterial infections of the skeletal system, including musculoskeletal injuries, especially open fractures and orthopaedic procedures, such as implants or bone grafts. Open fractures (associated with overlying skin and soft tissue injuries) often result in exposure of injured tissue and fractured bone to contaminating microorganisms, leading to infection more often than closed fractures. Surgical procedures, especially those involving implants or bone grafts, expose these same tissues to contamination. Bacterial contamination is often further complicated by compromised local vasculature and formation of bacterial biofilm in wound tissues and in the devices used for stabilization and post-surgical repair. All of these factors can contribute to severe negative treatment outcomes, including increased morbidity, extended length of treatment, and higher cost. Degradable and non-degradable local antibiotic delivery systems are often used to supplement traditional regimens of systemic antibiotic administration and surgical debridement. While these systems can achieve high concentrations of antibiotics at the injury site, each has associated problems such as poor degradability, incomplete site coverage, or inadequate release profiles. To address the critical need for improved methods of targeted antimicrobial delivery, we will build on our previous research to develop and test an injectable paste with sponge aggregates, using a degradable composite material derived from the natural biomaterial chitosan. This tunable composite paste will be engineered to deliver point-of-care, clinician-selected antibiotics and to provide full coverage in complex wound areas and irregularly shaped biomaterials, e.g., fixation devices. We hypothesize that the injectable, antibiotic-loaded chitosan composite paste will locally deliver levels of antibiotics that effectively eliminate contaminating microorganisms and prevent biofilm formation in traumatic wounds. After in vitro evaluations of elution, degradation, bactericidal, and anti-biofilm and physical properties of the paste and a preliminary animal model in vivo biocompatibility study, two established infected animal models with increasing complexity will be used to functionally assess the paste composite with antibiotics (selected for Gram + and Gram - coverage. The new composite paste system will also be compared to the traditional local delivery systems, polymethyl-methacrylate beads and calcium sulfate. We will tailor our tunable and degradable composite paste delivery system to meet clinical needs for preventing infections in complex musculoskeletal trauma."
"9315402","Cryptosporidiosis is an enteric infection caused by several species of Cryptosporidium parasites. In developing nations, the infection is one of the most common causes of persistent infant diarrhea. No effective drugs or vaccines are available to control cryptosporidiosis. We have found that the composition of the intestinal bacterial microbiota (microbiome) changes in response to C. parvum infection. We have also observed the opposite effect, which suggests that a perturbed (dysbiotic) enteric microbiota can favor parasite proliferation. This proposal focuses on unexplored interactions between Cryptosporidium parvum and the intestinal ecosystem. Specifically, we will investigate to what extent the perturbation of the intestinal microbiota with different antibiotics affects proliferation of C. parvum. In analogy to the increased susceptibility of patients treated long-term with antibiotics to Clostridium difficile, we hypothesize that the severity of cryptosporidiosis is impacted by the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa or microbial communities in the gut. This hypothesis will be tested with two Specific Aims: Aim 1. The native gut microbiota of mice will be perturbed with a diverse set of antibiotics which do not inhibit C. parvum directly and are not toxic to mice. The proliferation of C. parvum in mice treated with different antibiotics will be measured and 16S amplicon sequencing will be used to quantify the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in the gut. This approach will identify bacterial taxa that positively or negatively correlate in abundance with severity of cryptosporidiosis across all antibiotic treatments. Aim 2. We will investigate whether there is a causal relationship between the abundance of certain bacterial taxa identified in Aim 1 and C. parvum proliferation. To this aim we will transplant dysbiotic fecal microbiota into germ-free mice. Transplant recipients will be infected with C. parvum and the severity of the infection quantified. Transplant and passive transfer experiments will enable us to assess whether any change in the severity of cryptosporidiosis is directly mediated by the intestinal ecosystem.  Significance and future research: This research will advance our understanding of the interaction between the gut microbiota and Cryptosporidium parasites. The long-term goal is to test the feasibility of controlling cryptosporidiosis by manipulating the intestinal microbiota using pro- and prebiotics. By identifying bacterial taxa and bacterial communities which influence parasite proliferation, the proposed research will enable future work on the development of low-cost pre- and probiotics to mitigate persistent infection with Cryptosporidium parasites. This approach is novel and is important to pursue because so far traditional drug and vaccine development strategies have failed to identify effective treatments and vaccines against cryptosporidiosis."
"9245165","ABSTRACT Globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent females are at highest risk for HIV. In this region, there are also high levels of gender-based violence and a cultural preference for dry sex. Young women in Southern Africa become sexually active at around 15 years of age similar to those in the US9 and UK10. Adolescence is associated with significant changes in hormone levels, resulting in changes in cervical anatomy that could put them at risk for HIV. Vaginal insertion practices (VIPs) are common in women in sub-Saharan Africa. These VIPs [including intravaginal use of cloth or paper, insertion of products to dry/tighten the vagina and intravaginal cleansing with soap were associated with increased risk for HIV infection5. In four different studies conducted in South Africa, VIP prevalence ranged from 17.9% to 90.1%, depending on the population studied, with the predominant practices being intravaginal washing with soap, cloth or tissue paper for cleansing5. Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women20 This study will evaluate the hypothesis that in adolescent women, sexual immaturity, use of vaginal products and gender-based violence increase genital inflammation, damage the mucosa, alter the vaginal flora, which influences genital HIV target cell availability. To address this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims using two cohorts of HIV-negative SA adolescents in regions differentially at risk for HIV infection and with differing cultural norms for vaginal product use. We propose to enroll 300 adolescent females (aged 14-19 years) and 100 adult women (aged 25-35) and cluster them according to VIP use: (1) nothing (control); (2) using cloth or paper to wipe out the vagina; (3) intravaginal cleansing with soap; (4) intravaginal cleaning with household cleaners; or (5) products to dry/tighten vagina. Information about exposure to gender-based violence will be collected through the questionnaire. At baseline, examination of the cervix; vaginal vaginal flora, and imunity will be assessed. All women will be followed longitudinally for two consecutive sexual exposures. Women will be evaluated at baseline, <48 hours following sex (trauma visit), and at 7 days (wound healing). Comparing each subject to their own baseline, to the control arm, and to adult women, and building on adolescent trial experience at both clinical sites involved are strengths of this study design. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To examine anatomical and immunological characteristics of the adolescent state that may contribute to higher inflammation in the reproductive tract, hence HIV risk 2. To compare inflammatory responses to VIPs and sexual violence in adolescent females and older women The study outlined here may uncover why African adolescents are so disproportionately affected by HIV and has the potential to dramatically influence public health messaging about VIPs and sexual violence to adolescents in developing countries."
"9204831","More than 1/3 of the world?s population is anemic, making the process of erythropoiesis central to human health and disease. The maturation of a committed erythroid progenitor to a functional erythrocyte is characterized by a global decline in transcription and progressive chromatin condensation that ultimately culminates in enucleation. Although these processes occur in parallel, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate them are unknown. We hypothesize that Setd8 is a critical regulator of mammalian erythropoiesis that functions to coordinate the fundamental processes of transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation. Setd8 is the sole enzyme in mammals capable of mono-methylating H4K20 (H4K20me1), and is expressed at significantly higher levels in CD71+ erythroid cells than in any other cell- or tissue-type. In addition, Setd8 has functions that are independent of its methyltransferase activity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of Setd8 in the regulation of mammalian erythropoiesis. Data from our laboratory demonstrates that conditional erythroid Setd8 deletion results in severe defects in primitive erythropoiesis, with visible anemia at E9.5 and death from anemia by ~E12.5. Erythroblasts from these embryos fail to undergo the typical semi-synchronous maturation observed in erythroblasts from control embryos and have a profound defect in nuclear condensation. The goal of Aim 1 is to delineate the function of Setd8 during mammalian erythropoiesis. In Aim 1, in vivo analyses of conditional Setd8 disruption will be coupled with knockdown of Setd8 in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to gain a comprehensive understanding of the function of Setd8 in mammalian erythropoiesis. Preliminary data from our laboratory further demonstrates that Setd8 functions as a transcriptional repressor in erythroid cells, and that the Gata2 locus is a direct Setd8 target. Knockdown of Setd8 leads to increased Gata2 expression, with loss of H4K20me1 and increased H4Acetylation in the Gata2 locus. Although Gata2 is a key regulator of erythroid differentiation, Gata2 overexpression alone does not account for the severity of the Setd8 phenotype, especially the profound impairment in nuclear condensation. The Condensin II complex recognizes H4K20me1 and mediates both transcriptional repression and higher order chromatin condensation. Interestingly, Setd8 and a member of the Condensin II complex co-occupy key regulatory regions of the Gata2 locus. The goal of Aim 2 is to delineate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of Setd8 in erythropoiesis. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms by which Setd8 regulates key erythroid loci, and the degree to which the Setd8-H4K20me1-Condensin II pathway mediates transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation in erythroid cells. Taken together, the studies in this proposal will delineate the function of a novel regulator of erythropoiesis and provide critical insights into pathways involved in both inherited and acquired human disease."
"9241075","U.S. military veterans are more frequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) than the general population, and individuals with PTSD often self-medicate with alcohol in amounts that worsen health outcomes (e.g., pain), leading to a huge health and financial burden in the United States. Pain is highly co-morbid with PTSD and AUD, but strategies are not adequate for treating individuals living with two or more of these diagnoses, and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well defined. The ultimate goal of the work proposed here is to improve Veteran health and quality of life by guiding therapeutic strategies that reduce pain in individuals with PTSD and/or AUD. This project falls within the scope of the V.A. Office of Research and Development Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development (BLR&D) Service goal to fund preclinical biomedical and behavioral studies of disorders important for Veteran health. More specifically, this innovative and clinically relevant application proposes work that will examine the neurobiological mechanisms of increased pain sensitivity in individuals that have endured traumatic stress or are dependent on alcohol. This work has clear potential to lead to significant advances in health care for Veterans. This application proposes the use of rodent models to examine the role of brain melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) signaling in hyperalgesia/allodynia in individuals that are alcohol-dependent or have been traumatically stressed. We will use behavioral pharmacology techniques to test the therapeutic potential of intra-nasally delivered MC4R antagonists for reducing pain, relative to systemic morphine (the clinical gold standard). We will also use optogenetics and molecular biology techniques to identify the brain circuitry that mediates hyperalgesia/allodynia induced by alcohol dependence and traumatic stress, as well as the circuitry that mediates pain reduction by MC4R antagonists. This question is timely and important because PTSD and AUD are highly co-morbid with each other and with pain disorders, and alcohol is often used as a self-medication strategy to reduce PTSD symptoms and pain. The overall goals of the proposed work are to 1) test the translational potential of intra-nasal delivery of melanocortin receptor drugs for reducing pain in individuals with PTSD and AUD, and 2) identify the brain circuitry that mediates higher pain sensitivity after alcohol dependence or traumatic stress, as well as the circuitry that mediates pain reduction by melanocortin receptor drugs."
"9190384","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new black box warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop intelligent NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

Our proposed studies will focus on the investigation and optimization of technologies that enable the synthesis of core structural and stereochemical subunits prevalent in many bioactive, polycyclic natural products. The processes that we develop will find utility in the synthesis of a variety of structures for which there is currently no efficient synthetic roadmap. Importantly, the methods presented in this application will be useful outside of the contexts described herein and will arm practitioners of synthetic chemistry (in academic, government, and industrial laboratories) with a new set of important tools to access enantioenriched and functionally diverse chemical building blocks for synthesis. The research proposed in this grant application is focused on a) the development of new iridium- and palladium-catalyzed stereoselective alkylation reactions that produce densely substituted building blocks for synthesis, b) the development of palladium- catalyzed conjugate addition processes, c) the utilization of these novel methods for the synthesis of fused, spiro, and bridged ring system arrays, and d) the implementation of these new tactics in the syntheses of multiple natural and non-natural bioactive small molecules. Specifically, we outline approaches to isopalhinine A, the yuccaols A-E, and the abietane diterpenoids. These molecules are not only important from a biological standpoint, they also serve as a testing ground for our new technologies. As a consequence of this approach, we will have access to a) novel, medicinally relevant structures, b) a general platform for their synthesis, and c) new synthetic methodology that will impact a host of diverse applications."
"9388268","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Internal olefins are present in a large number of biologically active compounds including therapeutics that are used for a diverse range of clinical applications. They also serve as useful building blocks for more complex molecules. Internal olefins can exist as either the E or Z-stereoisomer. The geometry of the olefin directly impacts the overall conformation of the molecule and, therefore, the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the molecule. As a result, methods to selectively synthesis the E or Z-stereoisomer are of great importance. Recent developments in olefin metathesis have revealed catalysts capable of selectively synthesizing the Z-stereoisomer. However, current olefin metathesis catalysts typically rely on the reversible nature of the metathesis reaction to selectively form th thermodynamically favorable E-stereoisomer. This substrate-controlled approach is often unpredictable, and many examples exist where the thermodynamic preference of the product is small leading to a mixture of E and Z-stereoisomers that are difficult to separate. To date, olefin  metathesis catalysts capable of selectively synthesize the (E)-olefin under kinetic control remain elusive.       This proposal outlines a detailed, systematic approach for the development and application of kinetically E-selective olefin metathesis catalysts. Guided by a promising preliminary result, initial investigations will focus on ring-opening cross metathesis (ROCM). Strategic changes will be made to the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand of the NHC-ruthenium carbene complex to determine the relationship between catalyst structure and E- selectivity. These studies will be aided by computational studies geared towards understanding the origin of the E-selectivity. Once promising E-selective catalysts have been identified, they will be tested against a series of substrates known to undergo ROCM with low E-selectivity. This investigation should differentiate between catalyst structures and enhance our understanding of the factors that control E-selectivity. Finally, the insights gained from the ROCM studies will be applied to designing catalysts to achieve E-selective cross metathesis and macrocyclic ring-closing metathesis."
"9195141","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury-responsive coding genes are recognized as a major cornerstone in wound healing. As much as 97% of human DNA does not encode for protein and has been called junk. microRNAs (miRs) represent a class of non-coding (nc) genes that can not only be no longer regarded as junk but they represent a key regulatory mechanism that control the functionality of large sets of coding target genes. miRs themselves do not encode protein but the function of one-third of the coding human genome is regulated by miRs. miRs are evolutionarily conserved, approximately 22-nucleotide single-stranded RNAs that post-transcriptionally silences genes by inducing mRNA degradation or by inhibiting translation. Thus, miR biology connects mRNA to their biological function. Yet, information on the significance of miRs in wound healing is scanty. In 2008, our group reported the first work on how miRs may regulate wound angiogenesis and has since then actively published in the field of miRs and wound healing. This proposal builds on our recent published observation that wound-responsive repression of cutaneous miR-200b turns on wound angiogenesis which is de-regulated during diabetes mellitus. Endothelial cells of patients with adult onset (type-2) diabetes feature elevated miR-200b. Consistent findings were noted in diabetic mice. These data lead us to question the mechanism of how miR-200b accumulates in the setting of diabetic wounds (AIM1) and how the resultant miR-200b-dependent downstream pathways mitigate wound angiogenesis (AIMS 2&3). The following 3 aims are proposed: AIM 1 Investigate the molecular mechanisms causing aberrant induction of endothelial miR-200b in diabetic wounds. 1.1 Loss of GATA2 induces endothelial miR-200b expression; 1.2 Diabetic wound-associated p53 activation supports endothelial miR-200b expression. AIM 2 Determine the significance of elevated endothelial miR-200b in disruption of VEGF signaling. 2.1 Aberrant induction of endothelial miR-200b blocks VEGF expression in diabetic wounds. 2.2 Loss of diabetic wound-site endothelial VEGFR1 is caused by high miR-200b. 2.3 miR-200b silences diabetic wound-site CAGE and impairs VEGF signaling. AIM 3 Establish the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated miR-200b in impairing endothelial cell turnover and impaired angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. 3.1 miR-200b-ZEB1 signaling enhances endothelial apoptosis in diabetic wound-edge. 3.2 High endothelial miR-200b in diabetic wound-edge tissue drives endothelial apoptosis via a Bcl-2 dependent mechanism. 3.3 miR-200b silences CXCL1 and IL-8 and impairs endothelial cell proliferation in diabetic wounds causing impaired angiogenesis."
"9258774","The overall goal of this proposal is to study the role of methyl-lysine signaling by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor in the epigenetic control of gene transcription during memory formation. Specifically, it will investigate whether the NF-kB p65 subunit acts as an initiator of epigenetic mechanisms through its recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a-like protein (GLP), mediator of the histone 3 lysine 9 di-methyl mark (H3K9me2). The first specific aim will test the hypothesis that the lysine methyltransferase SETD6 regulates monomethylation of p65 at lysine 310 (p65K310me1) and H3K9me2 changes in the hippocampus during memory consolidation, and will characterize these changes. The second specific aim will test whether p65K310me1 promotes recruitment of GLP, thereby mediating H3K9me2 changes in the hippocampus during memory consolidation. The rationale for these investigations stems from recent studies in which SETD6 was shown to mediate p65K310me1, thereby promoting recruitment of GLP and subsequent H3K9me2. However, this mechanism has only been demonstrated in vitro, in the context of immune cells. Whether this occurs in the brain in response to learning, or is critical for memory consolidation is currently unknown. Similarly, whether p65 methylation mediates an epigenetic program of transcriptional control with behavioral consequences has not yet been investigated. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that p65K310me1 increases during memory consolidation. Furthermore, we have shown that p65 interacts with SETD6 in the rat hippocampus and that knockdown of SETD6 in the dorsal hippocampus results in impaired fear memory consolidation. Building on these findings, we will use Western blot analysis, chromatin and co- immunoprecipitation to measure p65K310me1, p65-GLP interaction, and H3K9me2 changes following knockdown and overexpression of SETD6 in vivo. Next, we will mimic p65K310me1 using plasmids to induce expression of constitutively-methylated p65K310. Finally, we will use ChIP-Seq to interrogate H3K9me2 changes across the genome following SETD6 knockdown during memory consolidation and identify memory- critical genes to explain our behavioral findings. Relevance to public health: Granted that many cognitive disorders feature changes in the epigenetic control of gene expression and that NF-?B plays a known role in the epigenetic pathophysiology of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease, the proposed experiments will begin to establish the mechanisms by which transcription factors initiate epigenetic changes in the brain. Moreover, these studies may identify new therapeutic strategies to mitigate cognitive symptoms of psychiatric conditions related to traumatic memories, such as post-traumatic stress disorders, phobias, and depression."
"9405335","In 1927, Norris described individuals with low blood pressure (BP) as persons who lacked stamina, tired easily, complained of cold extremities and showed an inability to do prolonged mental or physical work; he was quoted as saying; they are not exactly ill; yet they are rarely well. 1 However, several more recent papers have challenged the notion that low BP is a health concern, and even suggest that hypotension is the ideal normal BP.2, 3 Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) above T5 are reported to struggle with chronic hypotension,4-11 episodic orthostatic hypotension (OH) 12-16 and post-prandial hypotension.17 In fact, we recently reported that, over the course of a typical 24-hour day, the incidence of hypotension was as high as 70% in those with cervical lesions.18 In addition our unpublished data suggest that the incidence of hypotension is 2.5 fold increased in veterans with SCI compared to age-matched veterans without SCI. However, chronic hypotension is often not clinically addressed because the vast majority of hypotensive individuals remain asymptomatic. That said there evidence in the general medical literature supporting associations between asymptomatic hypotension, cognitive deficits, adverse changes in mood and quality of life (QOL). Compared to normotensive age-matched controls, otherwise healthy subjects with chronic asymptomatic hypotension are reported to have slowed cognitive speed, 19 fewer word recall, 20 decreased accuracy of response,21 limited attention,20 prolonged reaction times,19, 21, 22 and reduced memory and concentration capacity. 21, 22 In addition, several papers have reported findings suggesting significant associations between chronic hypotension and increased incidence of depression,23-30 anxiety,25, 26 unexplained tiredness,24, 31 and poor perception of well being.32 Although many hypotensive individuals with chronic SCI remain asymptomatic and do not raise clinical suspicion warranting intervention, we believe, and have demonstrated that asymptomatic chronic hypotension has adverse cognitive consequences.33-35 It must be appreciated that the superimposition of cognitive impairment on the physical, social and emotional limitations already experienced by many individuals with SCI may severely impact autonomy and social independence thereby diminishing QOL.36, 37 There is compelling evidence in the general medical literature suggesting that elevation in systemic BP, following midodrine hydrochloride administration, increases resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and improves CBF responses to cognitive testing resulting in better test performance in healthy individuals with chronic hypotension. 38, 39 Because it is believed that the etiology of hypotension in the SCI population is the result of adrenergic insufficiency, midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is considered a first line treatment, 40-42 and we have demonstrated significant increases in systemic BP in hypotensive individuals with SCI.43, 44 However, in general, data describing the BP effect of midodrine have been collected in small samples of hypotensive subjects with SCI during laboratory observations,44, 45 the benefit of sustained elevation in systemic BP on CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL has not been rigorously studied in the SCI population. Data generated in this pilot project will be used to power a large-scale clinical trial to determine the clinical benefit of sustained increases in BP on CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL in persons with SCI."

"9201301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infectious diseases represent a global concern for public health in the 21st century. Furthermore, human, livestock, and wildlife health are tightly linked because many of the most impactful human diseases are vector-borne or zoonotic (i.e., involve at least one nonhuman host). Thus, a deep understanding of parasite spread among wildlife hosts could enhance predictions and management of human risk of infection. My proposed research addresses this critical issue by focusing on a major human parasite, Schistosoma mansoni, which cycles between humans and snails (Biomphalaria spp.). The central goal of my proposal is to build and test new theory to predict the production of Schistosoma cercariae (the free-living stage which infects humans) by dynamic snail populations. The density of Schistosoma cercariae in aquatic habitats is a major determinant of human exposure risk. Thus, our work could help mitigate a central problem in global public health.  Individual-level traits like host susceptibility and parasite reproduction drive populatio-level disease dynamics. However, snails and schistosomes are not uniform entities that exist in constant environments. Instead, their traits can vary dramatically and the environment is heterogeneous. Thus, integrating the intrinsic traits of hosts and parasites (e.g., body size and underlying physiology) with the influence of external factors (e.g., resource availability and population density) could greatly enhance predictions of human infection risk.  Overall, my project tests the hypothesis that (algal) resource availability and the size-structure of snail populations powerfully determine the production of Schistosoma cercariae by snail populations. We will use experiments and mathematical models to link body size and resource availability to several key traits of snails and, ultimately, population dynamics of schistosomes. First, we will construct and test metabolic theory that aims to predict how cercarial production by infected snails depends sensitively on time, host body size, and resource availability. Second, snail risk of infection by schistosomes depends sensitively on body size. We will test a size-explicit framework to enhance predictions of snail infections by focusing on the two key processes that drive transmission: exposure to parasites and susceptibility to infection given exposure. Third, we will combine these models to produce a highly detailed, yet parsimonious agent-based model for the dynamics of Schistosoma in snail populations. We will then test the predictive power of this model under more natural conditions using a mesocosm experiment in which we track snail infections and the density of Schistosoma cercariae through time. Ultimately, this approach enables us to rigorously test our central hypothesis that snail size and resource availability drive schistosome dynamics and human risk at the population level. Moreover, this work initiates a highly integrative and novel perspective on the ecological dynamics of a major human parasite and its intermediate host. Consequently, this project could significantly contribute to both fundamental research on host - parasite interactions and an important applied problem in global human health."

"9221047","Project Abstract  Many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and autism, are associated with disrupted sleep. Disrupted sleep may contribute to negative cognitive symptoms, as sleep is crucial for maintaining and restoring healthy brain function. In particular, the slow (0.1-1 Hz) oscillations characteristic of deep sleep are thought to play essential roles in the restorative functions of sleep, and these oscillations have complex spatial properties that may be important for their effects on cognition. However, determining how slow oscillations influence brain function has been challenging due to our current inability to measure slow oscillations with spatial precision throughout the whole brain.  This project exploits the recent development of accelerated multi-slice imaging methods to measure fast (>0.2 Hz) fMRI signals. This work is centered around an innovative use of accelerated fMRI with simultaneous EEG to directly measure slow oscillation dynamics throughout the human brain simultaneously, and use this information to create the first whole-brain maps of slow oscillations. We will first optimize imaging and analysis methods for localizing slow oscillations. We will then test a hypothesis for how slow oscillations affect cognitive function: namely, that spatially localized slow oscillations in cortex and thalamus lead to reorganized information transfer across cortical networks, and thereby influence cognitive function.  The candidate has expertise in systems neuroscience of arousal regulation, anesthesia pharmacology, electrophysiology, and signal processing, providing a strong foundation for conducting this advanced imaging study of sleep states. The K99 will provide necessary training in 1) functional and anatomical MRI; 2) simultaneous EEG-fMRI during sleep; and 3) human sleep neurophysiology. The research will take place at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center, a highly collaborative environment equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for neuroimaging. The primary mentor Prof. Bruce Rosen will provide mentorship in neuroimaging and in transitioning to an independent position. In addition, the co-mentor Prof. Robert Stickgold will provide training in sleep neurophysiology, as well as exposure to clinical contexts of how sleep is affected in psychiatric disorders, and how disrupted sleep can contribute to cognitive deficits. Additional advice from Dr. Jonathan Polimeni and Dr. Jeff Duyn on imaging and analysis techniques will ensure high-level training in these methodological approaches. This methodological and scientific training will enable the candidate both to successfully complete these aims and to develop an independent research program focused on the systems neuroscience of sleep and arousal regulation, how sleep circuits and sleep-modulating pharmaceutical agents influence cortical function, and how sleep deficits lead to disrupted cognition. The results of this research will contribute to improved methods for imaging dynamics in the human brain, and shed light on the effects of sleep deprivation, which have significant negative effects both on the general population and particularly in patients with psychiatric disorders."
"9389324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learning and memory are fundamental components of how animals and humans navigate their world and adjust to environmental changes. These changes can include social interactions, which have particular importance for social animals, including humans. However, the neural basis of social learning is poorly understood. In order to uncover the specific neurochemicals and even individual neurons responsible for this memory, a tractable model system is necessary. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a premier genetic model organism with a large molecular genetic toolkit and has proven successful in establishing the molecules, brain regions, and in some cases individual neurons, responsible for conditioned memory. Indeed serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine have all be associated with various types of learning and memory. In anatomical studies, brain regions including the mushroom bodies, central complex, and lateral horn are important for learning and memory. The approach taken in this proposal is to apply these techniques to fruit fly fighting and the establishment of dominance relationships, which can serve as a social model of learning. Males fight over food and mates often forming dominance relationships. Following even a single fight, losers are likely to lose subsequent fights and fight at lower intensity against familiar than unfamiliar opponents, thus developing a loser mentality. Previous work has shown that the loser mentality persists for at least 24 hours, but the duration of this memory and whether it has a protein synthesis requirement remain unknown. Furthermore, the neurons responsible for consolidation of this memory have not been identified. This system represents an ideal one to test whether serotonin or small groups of serotonergic neurons are responsible for memory consolidation in the loser mentality. Further studies will address whether dopaminergic or octopaminergic neurons affect learning and memory. To accomplish these goals three specific aims are proposed: (1) to characterize the type of memory involved in the formation of the loser mentality using behavioral tests, pharmacology, and genetic drivers; (2) to test whether serotonin modulation affects memory consolidation using a combinatorial genetic approach; and (3) to identify and manipulate restricted populations of serotonergic or other aminergic neurons that modulate memory consolidation using intersectional genetics. If specific neurons are identified that are responsible for memory consolidation, potential synaptic connectivity can begin to be identified using a split gfp (GRASP, GFP Reconstruction Across Synaptic Partners). The proposed research has the potential to identify the specific neurons and neurochemicals responsible for the consolidation of memory in a loser mentality. Furthermore, this work will advance fruit fly aggression as a novel model for understanding socially-induced learning and identifying the neural basis of behavior."
"9235273","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR; ErbB1) is widely expressed in the kidney in both glomeruli and tubules. Our previous studies have elucidated a dichotomous role for EGFR activation in kidney injury, with regulated activation following acute kidney injury (AKI) serving as an important and necessary step for recovery but with persistent and dysregulated activation mediating progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury in progressive kidney diseases. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR activation can be an effective therapeutic intervention in experimental models of chronic kidney disease. Translating this insight into human disease is complicated by known skin side effects of current EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or receptor antibodies. However, given its potential biological relevance, mechanisms to inactivate the EGFR pathway still hold great promise as a therapeutic option, especially if more selective targeting of downstream signaling pathways can be achieved. The mechanisms of EGFR activation in response to acute or chronic kidney injury remain incompletely understood and may involve both ligand- dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, although recent studies have identified novel mechanisms for augmenting or inhibiting EGFR membrane localization and activation, whether these mechanisms play a role in kidney injury is unknown. The mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying progressive glomerulopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis secondary to aberrant EGFR signaling in chronic disease have not be elucidated, nor is is It known whether the same mechanisms mediate EGFR-dependent recovery from AKI. Thus, our overall goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR-mediated effects in both acute and chronic kidney disease in order to identify more selective therapeutic targets. To accomplish this goal, we propose three specific aims:1) Determine the mechanisms by which EGFR is activated in response to acute or chronic kidney injury. In this aim we will examine both ligand-dependent and ligand- independent mechanisms of EGFR activation in AKI and CKD; 2) determine the mechanisms by which EGFR mediates kidney fibrosis in chronic kidney injury. We will determine the role of EGFR in TGF-ß production and myofibroblast induction and the role of aberrant YAP/TAZ signaling in EGFR- mediated renal fibrosis; and 3) Determine the mechanisms by which EGFR activation inhibits autophagy. We wil determine the mechanism(s) by which EGFR activation inhibits AMP kinase activity and inhibits autophagy in diabetic nephropathy."
"9327833","PROJECT SUMMARY With a national prevalence estimate of 3.9 per 100,000 people, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common disabling neuromuscular diseases among adults in the United States. Eighty-five percent of persons with ALS demonstrate swallowing impairment (dysphagia) over the course of the disease (Carpenter, McDonald, & Howard, 1978; Chen & Garrett, 2005). Despite the significant impact that the loss of swallowing function has in persons with ALS ( Fattori et al., 2006) for a variety of reasons, including the variability of , disease progression from person to person, the inconsistency of symptom onset, and the lack of sensitivity to small amounts of change found in currently used outcome measures, predicting symptom progression over the course of the disease is difficult (Rutkove et al., 2007). As a result, clinical management of dysphagia in this population is a significant challenge. Therefore, there is a great need for research directed at improving biomarkers of swallowing decline. In the proposed research, we will investigate the relation between anatomic and biomechanic markers of the tongue and changes in swallow physiology, swallow severity, and swallow safety in persons with ALS. In AIM 1, we will correlate anatomic measures of the tongue using electrical impedance myography (EIM) with measures of swallow physiology, severity, and safety. Additionally, we will use electrical impedance myography (EIM) to determine whether changes in lingual muscle tissue health are present in persons with ALS who are pre-symptomatic of bulbar impairment. Prior research on EIM, as well as preliminary data in our lab, suggests that lingual EIM will be sensitive to the disease process prior to symptom onset and over the course of the disease process. In Aim 2, we will correlate biomechanic measures of the tongue (speed, range of motion, and coordination) during the swallow with measures of swallow physiology, swallow severity, and swallow safety. Our preliminary data suggests that lingual range of motion during the swallow is highly correlated with swallow function. The overall goal of the proposed research is to improve biomarkers of swallow impairment, which will significantly improve clinical management of dysphagia for persons with ALS. Results of this research will allow for improved prognostic capabilities and improved ability to implement physiologically based therapeutic techniques aimed at prolonging swallow function."
"9389625","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Massive reorganizations of zinc have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of human physiologic activities. Recently, it was discovered that intracellular and extracellular zinc fluxes are vital to successful mammalian oocyte development and occur both pre- and post-fertilization. However, there is little understanding of the molecular  mechanisms behind the zinc-dependent switching events that dictate oocyte maturation. Without this knowledge, the biomedical community lacks the ability to assess what makes a good egg and develop potential reproductive therapies. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the cellular needs for zinc by tracking its accumulation and localization during oocyte maturation. I hypothesize that variation in intracellular zinc content during maturation drives cell cycle progression by fulfilling the metal requirement of key Zn-proteins in the maturation process. These proteins include vital Zn-containing enzymes needed to catalyze certain cellular processes as well as zinc-receptor proteins where the presence or absence of their metal cofactor serves as a regulatory switch. This hypothesis will be addressed by employing radioactive zinc tracers to track and quantify Zn2+ accumulation and redistribution. In addition, these studies will elucidate the physiological significance of the efflux event at fertilization known as the zinc spark. Lastly, changes in zinc metalloproteome will be characterized using radioactive zinc tracers in conjunction with native electrophoresis to reveal which Zn-proteins are activated during oocyte maturation. The data obtained from this study will serve as a framework for establishing a novel Zn-dependent mechanism that dictates cell cycle progression in the oocyte, thus providing new means for assessing oocyte health. Insights gained from this research project will be applicable to other zinc-dependent physiologies as well. This award will support a broad array of multi-disciplinary training activities and experienc with the goal of providing robust preparation for a tenure-track position in a Research I university. Training activities will increase key competencies in the areas of scientific communication, mentoring, lab management, in addition to broadening technical skills."
"9184522","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In post-natal or adult dermal wound healing, fibroblasts mechanically sense (mechanosense) rigidity and tension that develop in granulation tissue and differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts generate large contractile forces that excessively contract and remodel the ECM resulting in scarring and fibrosis. In contrast, injured skin in the mammalian fetus heals scarlessly without myofibroblast involvement suggesting that smaller cellular forces contribute to regenerative repair. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that fetal fibroblasts have unique characteristics that may contribute to scarless healing including altered responses to ECM rigidity and defective signaling pathways. However, it remains unclear why fetal fibroblasts retain this distinct phenotype and exhibit differential responses to environmental factors such as ECM rigidity that induce myofibroblast differentiation in adult fibroblasts. Therefore, our overall hypothesis is that fetal fibroblasts d not become myofibroblasts in response to physiologic biomechanical rigidities. We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: (1) to test the specific hypothesis that fetal fibroblasts have intrinsically altered mechanosensing which leads to ineffective myofibroblast differentiation, (2) to determine how matrix composition influences myofibroblast differentiation since adult and fetal wound healing are characterized by different types of collagen, and (3) to use a sequencing approach to identify molecular differences in fetal fibroblast gene expression that can be used to target myofibroblast differentiation in adult fibroblasts. We are taking an innovative approach by utilizing the mechanical phenotype of fetal fibroblasts as a model for understanding regenerative repair since these cells appear to lack the ability to produce larger cellular forces in response to matrix rigidity which contribute to myofibroblast differentiation an fibrotic healing. We will test our novel concept by using synthetic substrates that mimic the different mechanical stages of wound healing that progressively induce myofibroblast differentiation to isolate the effects of physiologic rigidities and different ECM components. Overall, our goal is to delineate the underlying molecular and physical mechanisms by which fetal fibroblasts differentially mechanosense ECM rigidity by quantifying cellular biomechanical properties relevant to dermal tissue repair. Furthermore, our research plan is designed to uncover potential molecular targets for novel treatment strategies for dermal scarring and fibrosis in post-natal wound healing. These studies are of particular clinical importance since no acceptable anti-fibrotic therapies currently exist and dermal scarring and fibrosis costs billions f dollars of year in medical care and management. In addition, the expected outcomes of our proposed studies are relevant to other fibrosis-related pathologies as well as to the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."
"9197672","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women are disproportionately affected by stroke and many of the strongest risk factors for ischemic stroke in women are associated with altered metabolism. However, exactly how these metabolic alterations directly impact the pathophysiology of stroke is unclear. Metabolomic techniques measure a full profile of small-molecule metabolites, providing a comprehensive picture of an individual's metabolic status. Although preliminary results for cardiovascular disease are promising, no prospective studies for stroke have been conducted. In this application, we propose to evaluate the associations of individual metabolite and metabolomic profiles with subsequent ischemic stroke among women in the Nurses' Health Study I and Nurses' Health Study II, ongoing longitudinal prospective cohort studies. The proposed investigations will use archived fasting blood specimens in concert with detailed behavioral, medical and lifestyle variables. A validated, state-of- the-art metabolomic platform will characterize over 300 metabolites by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, as well as provide untargeted data. Utilizing a nested case-control design, a two-phase analysis will be conducted with a discovery cohort of 400 stroke cases and their matched controls and a validation cohort of 300 stroke cases/controls to identify and validate novel metabolite and metabolomic profiles associated with incident ischemic stroke in women. Replication in two external cohorts will also be performed. Exploratory analyses will compare the metabolite profiles by subtype of ischemic stroke. Discovery of novel metabolic pathways not previously known to be involved in the pathogenesis of stroke could ultimately lead to new approaches for prevention in the general population and further reduction in morbidity and mortality from stroke."

"9409046","Project Summary  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder associated with increased suicide risk, educational dropout, unemployment, relationship instability, and the development of other psychiatric disorders. An estimated 3 billion dollars are lost in workforce productivity each year to this disorder. The majority of individuals in the US will experience a traumatic event in their lifetime, yet not all develop PTSD. There is evidence that genetic and epigenetic factors account for 30 ? 70% of these individual differences, but the mechanisms by which they exert this influence are not well understood. In the long run, understanding these mechanisms will greatly inform both how to identify those at risk for certain clusters of PTSD symptoms, and how to tailor individual treatments for the best recovery outcomes.  Previous research has identified negative alterations in mood and cognition, specifically negative alterations in self-cognitions (e.g., shame, perceived worthlessness, incompetence) as a strong predictor of PTSD risk, status, and severity. Negative self-processing is associated with alterations in the neural correlates of self-referential processing (e.g., midline cortical structures) and autobiographical memory systems (e.g., medial temporal lobe structures, MTL). Negative self-cognitions are also associated with altered stress response physiology in the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis system. Previous research in the training lab has identified a candidate gene, FKBP5, that is involved in the modulation of HPA axis function and MTL memory systems. Polymorphisms in FKBP5 are also associated with increased risk for PTSD. Additionally, the DNA methylation status of promoters involved in HPA axis regulation, including those for both FKBP5 and the glucocorticoid receptor gene, NR3C1, is known to be associated with PTSD treatment outcome and response.  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging approaches, the present research aims to examine the relationship between traumatic experience and the neural mechanisms of negative self-referential processing, and determine how this relationship changes during PTSD extinction. Also, this proposal aims to better understand how the epigenetic profile of both FKBP5 and NR3C1 predicts, and perhaps changes, in response to recovery from PTSD (and negative self-cognitions) along with its neural correlates. This understanding will help identify individuals who will respond most optimally to a specific empirically based PTSD treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy, while further connecting genetic biomarkers of risk with neural intermediate phenotypes underlying PTSD symptomatology."

The current research proposal will explore the hypothesis that insulin resistance contributes to decreased food consumption reward signaling, thereby increasing vulnerability to overeat and impairing weight loss. In most obese individuals, insulin signaling is impaired (insulin resistance). Preclinical animal studies suggest that insulin resistance in brain regions important for reward contribute to overeating. This proposal aims to test these hypotheses in humans and to determine if these characteristics are pertinent to clinical outcomes (food intake and weight loss). In humans increased body mass index (BMI) and weight gain occur with decreased food consumption-induced neural activation (consummatory reward) in the caudate of the dorsal striatum. It has been speculated that diminished consummatory reward causes overeating and prevents weight loss; however, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Further, mechanisms for impaired food consumption-induced neural activation in obesity have not been investigated.  The primary research outcomes of the proposed study are: 1) insulin sensitivity determined by the gold standard hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, 2) food consumption-induced neural activation in the caudate as determined by blood-oxygen dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) scanning, 3) caloric intake at a buffet meal, and 4) weight loss during a weight loss intervention and 6 months after completing the intervention. We will enroll 55 obese Veterans, 40 who are insulin resistant and 15 who are insulin sensitive. The groups will be stratified by gender and be similar in age and BMI. All will complete baseline assessment of outcomes. After this, the insulin resistant obese will be randomized to: 1) lose 5-10% of total body weight (TBW) over 4-6 months or 2) maintain current body weight for 4-6months before completing the post assessment of outcomes. Participants will return 6 months after completion of their respective intervention for a weight measurement.  This approach will permit us to explore 3 aims: 1) determine whether weight loss-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity occur with improved (increased) food consumption-induced neural activation and whether neural activation predicts long term (6 month) weight loss, 2) determine whether insulin sensitive obese have greater neural activation to food consumption compared to insulin resistant obese, and 3) determine if food consumption-induced neural activation predicts food intake at a buffet meal. Secondary measures of the study include whole brain activation analyses, neuroendocrine hormone measurement at the time of imaging, psychometric measures including eating behaviors and personality characteristics, and measures of reward sensitivity. A comprehensive career development plan is provided, designed to prepare the applicant for independence through mentorship and training activities. This award provides the applicant the time and resources to build a career as an independent VA clinical investigator focusing on the neuroendocrine mechanisms that perpetuate human obesity."
"9415556","ABSTRACT The adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells has produced remarkable clinical results in patients with viral disease. However, broader implementation of this therapy has been limited by the (i) prohibitive production costs, (ii) complexity of manufacture, (iii) prolonged time for preparation and product release, and (iv) the requirement for individualized, patient-specific products. Over the past 6 years we have systematically addressed these problems: we simplified and refined our manufacturing technology, removed biohazardous components and employed a new cell expansion platform using a gas permeable culture device which promotes the proliferation and survival of large cell numbers in a GMP-compliant closed system with minimal technician intervention. Finally, we have established the clinical benefit associated with the infusion of partially HLA matched virus-specific T cells that are prospectively generated and banked, making them available for immediate ?off the shelf? use.  Thus, with the purpose of moving beyond highly specialized academic centers we established a Baylor College of Medicine-affiliated company called ViraCyte with the goal of commercializing ?off the shelf? virus- specific T cells. Our product - Viralym-A - is a bank of T cell lines with specificity for Adenovirus, which, in immunocompromised individuals, is responsible for a wide range of severe clinical syndromes including pneumonia, hemorrhagic cystitis, nephritis, colitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis, resulting in death in 18-26% of patients. Our therapy is intended for the treatment of drug-resistant infections/disease, a condition that afflicts less than 200,000 persons in the United States and for which there is no standard of care. Thus, in the current application we will test the safety and potential for anti-viral activity of Viralym-A in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Success of this application will lay the foundation for a Phase IIb study to confirm the efficacy of ?off the shelf? Viralym-A cells and facilitate market approval, thereby moving T cell therapy for Adenovirus into the public domain as a standard of care."
"9223753","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder ranks among the most significant causes of mortality and disability in the world. Recent data from our group and others highlight that impairments in reward and loss learning are central to depression, have distinct neural substrates, and improve with successful treatment. Together, these findings suggest an urgent need to delineate the relationships among neurobehavioral reward and loss learning impairments and depression. Equally important, these insights suggest novel targets for intervention such that manipulating the neurobehavioral substrates of reward and loss learning may facilitate symptom change in depression. To address these issues, we use functional neuroimaging and a quantitative reinforcement learning framework to i) systematically characterize the neural and behavioral substrates that attend reward- and loss- learning impairments in depression (Aim 1), and ii) assess the degree to which these impairments respond to two methods of training that directly target reward and loss learning from different angles (Aims 2 and 3). In Aims 2 and 3, we capitalize on extant data from our group and others showing that explicit and covert task modifications, respectively, lead to adaptive neural and behavioral learning changes in controls. Here we extend this work to individuals with depression and test the broad hypotheses that i) that depression may be characterized by distinct neurobehavioral impairments in reward- and loss- learning, and ii) these deficits may be normalized through targeted behavioral training. Recent advances in computational model-based analyses of reinforcement learning provide a robust neuromechanistic framework within which to delineate the nature and trajectory of the suggested reward- and loss- learning impairments and their amelioration."
"9233220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project explores the development, implementation, and evaluation of a smartphone-/ tablet -based network of village-based, custom-trained, layperson mHealth workers who use simple-to-operate, network-integrated software regularly to report presumptive and medically diagnosed cases of a single illustrative chronic disease: Nodding Syndrome . The long-term goal is to develop a sustainable, inexpensive, monitored, real-time `population-based medical e-geography' and case-based electronic medical record system with which to identify disease hotspots and to mount, as appropriate, rapid diagnosis and treatment , enhanced community education, epidemiological research and long-term health planning. Creation of a cadre of village-based lay mHealth operators who are attracted to a future health-related career (thereby increasing healthcare capacity) is a second long-term goal. Research will be carried out in a rural region of post-conflict northern Uganda where poor nutrition and infectious disease ravage the health of impoverished villagers. Research focus is placed exclusively on Nodding Syndrome (NS), an easily recognizable, chronic, non-communicable childhood disorder of unknown etiology characterized by behavioral changes, including head nodding triggered by eating and other sensory stimuli, retardation of physical and mental development, convulsions and, if untreated, early death.Our pilot study has revealed inordinately long delays (~4 years on average, which we aim to reduce >10-fold) between the time when abnormal behavior (absences, head nodding, and/or convulsions) is first noted by caregivers and medical diagnosis. While treatment is not part of this research proposal, we have shown that appropriate pharmaceutical, nutritional, physical, and educational intervention in a fit-for-purpose facility can dramatically advance the growth and development of affected children, markedly reduce their seizure frequency, and improve cognitive status and learning capacity. We will test whether village-based lay mHealth workers can accurately detect new NS cases, speed their medical diagnosis to activate treatment, and help populate the beginnings of a regional electronic medical record system in Uganda that has been developed, piloted and adopted in neighboring Kenya. Aged 18-25 years, the mHealth workers will reside in the villages they survey and weekly transmit information relating to NS. Electronic tablets will be also be used to collect, enter and download health history into ZidiTM, a DHIS2 integrated central management healthcare information system that has been adopted by the neighboring country of Kenya. Data on NS cases received from mHealth workers and via ZidiTM will be integrated, used to map the disease across the catchment area, and shared with government health authorities. The impact of this program on mHealth workers, medical students, and community health personnel will be evaluated to assess whether a lay-operator mHealth network has utility on a broader scale."
"9417111","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Developmental Science (CDS) requests continued support for five predoctoral (two-year program) and five postdoctoral (two-year program) positions associated with its vibrant and accomplished training program, the Carolina Consortium on Human Development (CCHD; T32-HD007376). Located in the rich intellectual environment of central North Carolina, the program brings together a world-class faculty who come from four major research universities (UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke University, North Carolina State University, and UNC-Greensboro) and who span psychology, neuroscience, public health, nursing, education, psychiatry, sociology, public policy, and methodology. The 47 faculty mentors include leaders in the study of children's and adolescent's health and well-being with a strong record of research productivity, grant funding, and training. The program is based on the premise that training in Developmental Science provides a vitally important transdisciplinary model and an associated language for understanding a broad array of health outcomes (e.g., health-risk behaviors, obesity, self-regulation, resilience to early trauma and stress, cognitive functioning). Core principles of Developmental Science now permeate all major perspectives on health and well-being. These principles include, for example, the study of developmental processes (a) as occurring through multilevel, interacting causal fields ranging from culture to biology; (b) as embedded in temporal patterns across levels of analysis as reflected in the study of transitions, trajectories and plasticity; and (c) as incluing on-going bidirectional influences across levels of analysis. The CCHD program is distinctive in its focus on the articulation of these principles and their operationalization in empirical health research. The resulting structured-yet-flexible program is uniquely designed to provide training in core competency areas as well as individually tailored domains. In addition to common elements (i.e., the CCHD proseminar series, research apprenticeships with faculty mentors, and professional and research skill development workshops), trainees select from an extensive menu of tailored experiences that are specific to their training goals as identified through an Individualized Development Plan. We continue to monitor and refine our training program through an extensive evaluation process that involves trainees, mentors, and a national Advisory Board. A total of 54 predoctoral and 29 postdoctoral trainees participated in the program during the last reporting period. The trainees have obtained excellent academic and research positions, have published actively in the research literature, and have shown early success in obtaining grant funding. This track record confirms the effectiveness of the program. The over-arching goal of the CCHD is to give a foundation in Developmental Science to the next generation of scholars as they prepare for innovative and productive research careers. Our trainees speak the language of sophisticated transdisciplinary teams that have the power to transform the scientific study of the origins, natural history, and consequences of health."
"9295353","Project Summary: Systemic listeriosis is one of the most deadly foodborne bacterial diseases in North America, as evidenced by recent outbreaks caused by contaminated cantaloupes (2011; 21% mortality) and cold cuts (2008; 39% mortality). After Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) spread to the brain, it is difficult to eradicate the infection, and many patients die even while receiving aggressive antibiotic treatment. Two different types of brain infections are observed in humans: a diffuse meningitis/meningoencephalitis typically seen in the elderly and other immune-compromised individuals; and a more focal infection localized in the brainstem (rhombencephalitis) that occurs in otherwise healthy adults. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that meningitis occurs via hematogenous spread, primarily due to a failure of the immune system to limit overwhelming growth of Lm in peripheral tissues, while rhombencephalitis occurs when neurotropic strains of Lm invade cranial nerves and spread to the brain by axonal migration. Progress in understanding brain infections has been limited by the lack of an appropriate small animal model to study the two proposed routes of dissemination, and by the technical limitation that very few bacteria are needed to cause symptomatic disease in the brain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, bacterial colonization patterns in the brain (focal vs. diffuse) will be identified in mice given food contaminated with either neurotropic Lm (human rhombencephalitis and sheep brain isolates) or non-neurotropic Lm (veterinary strains isolated from the liver). In Aim 2, an innovative approach will define the pathway used by neurovirulent Lm to disseminate to the brain. Lm will be engineered to secrete Cre recombinase during intracellular growth, and then used to infect mice with a ?floxed? GFP gene, allowing for permanent identification of all cells in the body that harbored intracellular Lm during any point of the infection. A key strength of this proposal is the interdisciplinary approach resulting from a collaboration between microbiologists in the D?Orazio lab with extensive expertise in manipulating Lm and studying host responses to infection, and neuroscientists in the Gensel lab, who have the expertise to perform high resolution imaging of the nerves and brainstems of mice. Working together, this group will advance the field by revealing how Lm disseminate to the brain following natural foodborne transmission, and will develop a set of tools that may be used in future studies to identify the features of neurotropic Lm strains that promote brain infection."
"9205273","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the OUHSC Baboon Research Resource is to provide resources that support biomedical and behavioral research requiring the baboon as the animal model. A vital part of this mission is the production of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) baboons. Unique in the world, the OUHSC SPF baboon program is poised to provide an indispensable nonhuman primate resource for biomedical research. The goal of this program is to complete development of an active, self-supporting breeding colony of baboons that are free of all five known baboon herpes viruses, four retroviruses, as well as a number of additional viruses and parasites. The developing program is already providing some SPF baboons to NIH-funded biomedical research programs, but cannot meet the demand for these unique animals. To complete development of this national resource we will recruit an additional 150 infants over five years into the SPF program. The genetic diversity of the colony will be assessed and monitored to maximize its genetic diversity. During this final phase of colony development, we will continue to provide 20-30 SPF baboons per year to NIH-funded research programs. To keep the colony outbred genetic testing will be performed and evaluated. Several research projects will also be supported by this program with the aim of improving the resource. The long term objective is for the SPF baboon colony to be a stable, self-sustaining breeding colony that produces ~100 SPF baboons/year for use in NIH-funded biomedical research."
"9296159","We propose to renew funding for the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry  (IMS) at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN. The previous funding cycle has been  extremely successful in both advancing IMS technology and applying it to cutting edge biological projects. In  this renewal, we seek to advance the technology to provide next generation capabilities that will encompass  sub-micron spatial resolution, ultra-high sensitivity, and ease of use tools that will be made available to the  non-expert investigator. This proposal contains two overarching aims. First, it proposes to pioneer novel  instrument technologies, sample preparation devices and methods, and data analysis/image informatics  solutions. The latter is a critical need for current research grade IMS instrumentation, and it will be essential for  next-generation instruments.. Second, this proposal seeks to simplify the entire imaging process that currently  requires expertise and significant time to get high quality, meaningful results. Achievement of these global  aims is important to bring this technology into the biological and clinical laboratory.   The proposed Technology Research & Development (TRD) program will provide performance  improvements that will meet many of the current needs of the user community. Specific TRD advancements  will focus on maximizing instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution. We will also develop specialty reagents  and methodologies designed to enhance sensitivity, molecular specificity, and preserve the location of  biomolecules during sample preparation and analysis. We propose to develop a next generation imaging mass  spectrometer for routine use that is capable of achieving 500 nm spatial resolution at high sensitivity.  Additionally, we will develop software capable of co-registering and viewing imaging data from multiple  modalities such as IMS and microscopy through an image fusion process. Finally, we will develop new  advanced bio-computational algorithms to mine imaging data for molecular patterns and to normalize images  from large datasets. These developing advanced technologies will be focused on important driving biomedical  projects (DBPs) in infectious disease, eye disease, diabetes, and cancer.   Important activities of the Resource include: selected collaborations with investigators who have NIH  sponsored research projects that would significantly benefit from the developing IMS technology. This includes  high spatial resolution imaging, high mass resolving power instrumentation and advanced data analysis and  informatics capabilities. Training and dissemination of the technology will continue to be accomplished through  a yearly on-site four day training course termed AIMS (Advanced Imaging Mass Spectrometry). In addition,  training and dissemination will occur through hosting individual visiting investigators, students, and fellows, and  through publication of the research outcomes for both the technology and its applications, and from individual  invited research lectures presented by the faculty of the Resource."
"9411905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Interdisciplinary Training Program in Immunology (ITP) at the University of Virginia (UVA) provides comprehensive support for predoctoral and post-doctoral trainees. It is grounded in a group of 30 outstanding mentors, whose research programs are based in immunology, but with an orientation towards infectious disease, cancer, development, vascular biology, or neuroscience. The mentors are drawn from 8 University Departments and 7 Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine. They create a rich intellectual research environment where trainees are exposed to ideas of range of scientific disciplines and cutting edge technologies necessary for productive research careers in Immunology. Trainees and mentors are brought into contact through their involvement in activities supported by the ITP, including courses, seminars, Research-In- Progress presentations, and advisory committees. The structure of the ITP allows us to overcome traditional departmental barriers by maintaining cross-disciplinary interest in trainee activities and through monitoring and oversight of trainee performance and progress. Recent modifications in the organization and support of graduate training at the UVA School of Medicine have solidified institutional support for this interdisciplinary approach, while at the same time increasing the visibility of immunology as a Research Discipline to enhance our ability to attract outstanding applicants. The structure and activities of the UVA ITP are also designed to bridge the gap between basic and clinical science. The mentors include a strong cohort of translational scientists who look to move work in animal models into patient settings. Also, elements in the curriculum and in trainee-related activities expose PhD-based graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to clinical problems through active engagement with clinical faculty. Conversely, we support an MD postdoctoral fellow, with the explicit intent to educate physician-scientists in cutting edge approaches to address questions in human immunology at a basic level. Over the last 20 years, the UVA ITP has recruited an outstanding group of both pre- and postdoctoral trainees, including a strong cohort of trainees from disadvantaged groups, and has propelled them towards productive careers as research scientists. To continue this record of achievement, we request support for the same positions as in the previous funding period: 5 predoctoral trainees selected from a group of highly qualified first year graduate students who have already been highly scrutinized during initial recruitment into our umbrella Biomedical Sciences (BIMS) graduate program; 2 PhD-level postdoctoral trainees, selected based on the excellence of their graduate student work, and who we prepare for a career in biomedical research and education; and 1 physician-scientist trainee, highly dedicated to a career in academic medicine, chosen from board-eligible or board certified MD or MD-PhD fellows in UVA clinical departments, who we engage in specialized postdoctoral training and prepared for a career in translational research."
"9326372","The Ohio State University created the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) to catalyze research teams and facilitate innovation through creation of an environment that fosters translation of knowledge to improve human health. The Center will accomplish four specific aims: 1) Build on the unique and diverse strengths of our institution to create an integrated academic home for innovative, team-oriented clinical and translational science; 2) Enhance and nurture the career development of highly trained investigators, with an emphasis on innovation and transdisciplinary science; 3) Integrate and enhance an administrative infrastructure to optimize the efficient conduct of the highest quality, generalizable clinical and translational science that is relevant to the community setting; 4) Develop, enhance and integrate a portfolio of outstanding shared resources in support of transformative clinical and translational research. The CCTS will continue to focus on integrating the traditional biomedical research process (basic scientific discovery with translation to the bedside to dissemination into the community for improved patient outcomes) with a public health model (surveillance to prevention to response). By incorporating this bi-directional model in the creation of a robust translational science infrastructure, the OSU CCTS will foster both the traditional discovery to best practice paradigm as well as taking advantage of the insight garnered from our foundation of excellence in clinical care to stimulate basic discovery and clinical research inquiry. The vision and specific aims will be achieved through an integrated model of governance and partnership, home, and leadership for clinical and translational research spanning NCH and OSU; focused pilot funding initiatives for new team development within an innovation ecosystem; unique educational and training architecture which integrates acquisition of core competencies in research methodology, interpretation of results, implementation of findings, design thinking, team leadership skills and business acumen with rigorous discipline-specific laboratory (bench, clinical or community) training; and a clinical and translational science infrastructure that is cohesive, innovative and adaptable and more effective than the services that currently exist in order to ensure provision of the full range of disease-agnostic scientific resources needed to traverse the continuum of research from T1-4. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The Center for Clinical and Translational Science will improve human health by bringing the benefits of science more quickly into patient care."
"9240811","Veterans have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than the general population. Cardiovascular disease risk is caused by environmental and heritable factors. The broad goal of our research is to understand how these factors interact to determine overall disease risk. In current funding period of this award we studied how heritable variants of the PLPP3 gene encoding lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) associate with heritable coronary artery disease risk. We showed that disease risk associated loci within the final intron of the gene decrease expression of the gene in blood and vascular cells and that PLPP3 deficiency in mice results in accelerated atherosclerosis. Our findings support the concept that PLPP3 functions as an ?atherosclerosis suppressor? gene and that heritable variants that decrease expression of the gene promote heart disease risk. LPP3 is an integral membrane cell surface enzyme that can dephosphorylate and inactivate bioactive lipid mediators. One of these LPP3 substrates, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acts on multiple blood and vascular cells to promote inflammation and cardiovascular disease progression. In mice, genetic or pharmacological targeting of LPA modulates atherosclerosis. In our mouse studies, LPP3 deficiency was associated with increased levels of LPA in the blood and vascular tissues. These results support our overarching hypothesis that dephosphorylation and inactivation of LPA underlies the normally protective effect of LPP3 on cardiovascular disease focusing attention on the sources of bioactive LPA in the blood and vasculature. In preliminary studies we found that circulating levels of LPA are very sensitive to diet in mice and humans. This diet sensitive pool of LPA is largely associated with atherogenic lipoproteins that are formed in the intestine from dietary fats and lipids (chylomocrons and their remnants) or are made in the liver (low density lipoproteins). LPA in blood plasma can be made from lysoglycerophospholipids by autotaxin (ATX) which is a secreted lysophospholipase D enzyme supporting the hypothesis that exogenous and endogenous sources of circulating LPA come from lysophospholipids that are formed in the intestine or the liver. LPA is also an intermediate in the synthesis of triglycerides by the intestine and liver so, since this process is coupled to the generation of these atherogenic lipoproteins it is also possible that plasma LPA is generated de novo. The first aim of this proposal will test these competing hypotheses directly by using stable isotope tracers and mass spectrometry studies in mice and humans to directly identify precursors of circulating LPA. The mouse studies will allow us to use genetic and pharmacological approaches to selectively manipulate ATX, LPP3 and the formation and clearance of intestinal and hepatic derived lipoproteins. Atherogenic lipoproteins elicit signaling responses in blood and vascular cell types that underlie the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease by promoting permeability of vascular endothelium, phenotypic modulation and proliferation/migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and the classical macrophage foam cell response. The second aim of the proposal will test the hypothesis that the LPA content of these lipoproteins is a determinant of these responses. LPA is present in atherosclerotic blood vessels and release of LPA may contribute to platelet activation and thrombosis during plaque rupture. The final aim of this proposal will use state of the art mass spectrometry based imaging to test the hypothesis that atheroma associated LPA accumulates progressively as a result of lipoprotein extravasation during the development of atherosclerosis. Together, these studies will build on the research accomplished during the present funding period by providing important new information about the impact of diet on a bioactive lipid signaling pathway that is now strongly implicated in heritable cardiovascular disease risk. This research could inform strategies to mitigate cardiovascular disease risk through dietary interventions that decrease atherogenic lipoprotein associated LPA and will further underscore the value of pharmacological targeting of LPA metabolism and signaling to mitigate cardiovascular disease risk."
"9405748","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This T32 Institutional Training grant, now named The Stuart T. Hauser Research Training Program in Biological and Social Psychiatry, is entering its 33rd year of a very successful post-doctoral training program for MDs, PhDs, and MD/PhDs. Drs. Hauser and McCarley provided leadership for this program from its inception and Dr. Shenton, a former trainee of the program, joined as a Co-Director 18 years ago. When Dr. Hauser passed away in July 2008, Dr. Shenton became the PI and Dr. McCarley stayed on as Co-Director. Dr. Gail Musen joined as the third Co-Director. We now plan to continue what is an intentionally broad program, but one that fits well with NIMH's mission to transform our understanding of mental illnesses and to pave the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. The rationale for this program is quite clear - to train the most diverse and outstanding young investigators, and to equip them with the tools and knowledge needed to succeed in developing their own research careers in the area of biological and/or social psychiatry so as to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent and possibly cure mental illness. We also agree with NIMH's mission that to meet these goals we need to foster innovative thinking and to make sure there is an array of novel scientific perspectives, which are used to further discovery in the evolvin science of brain, behavior, and experience. In fact one of the top priorities at NIMH, and one of our own, is to develop new and use existing physiological and computational models to understand the biological functions of genes, gene products, cells, and brain circuits in normal and abnormal mental function. The program is intensive, interdisciplinary (e.g., areas of neuroscience, development, neuroimaging, genetics), and has as its cornerstone a weekly 1.5-hour seminar that includes a 3-month grants module to demystify and to teach the grant process. Trainees also present their work, and there is a topic of general interest selected, where outside speakers are invited. A further goal is for trainees to work with outstanding preceptors in their chosen area to develop further their expertise, and to ensure that they receive the best training possible to compete in what has become a difficult arena to support individual initiated investigator research. There are 41 such preceptors, across multiple research areas and sites, who help to evaluate candidates and who serve as preceptors (14 new preceptors). Trainees devote two years with the goal that at the end of this time they will be ready to conduct their own independent research, or join established clinical research teams as junior colleagues. Over the past 4 years trainees have received 2 NIMH K01 awards, 1 NIMH K08 award, 7 NARSAD awards, and numerous other awards, thus attesting to the high productivity of our trainees. All trainees fill out a needs assessment form upon entering the program and then relevant courses within the Harvard University complex, and the Harvard Catalyst, are reviewed to help fill in any gaps needed for the trainee to meet their research goals. We also attend to recruiting underrepresented individuals. In the last 4 years we have 16% underrepresented minorities and 1 disabled individual (5%)."

The home for the Training Program will be the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) which is a P30 Environmental Health Sciences Core Center funded by NIEHS.  The CEET is a Translational Environmental Health Sciences Center with a focus on major societal disease that affects the Philadelphia area: including but not limited to lung and airway disease, and reproductive, endocrinology, and developmental disorders (including the developmental basis of adult disease). Additionally, there is a strong emphasis on disease mechanism involving oxidative stress and gene-environment interactions. Pre-doctoral fellows, 2 per year, will be supported for three years bringing the steady state to 6 pre-doctoral fellows. Postdoctoral fellows preferably one Ph.D. and one M.D. will be appointed per year and will be supported for two years bringing the steady state to 4 postdoctoral fellows.  Pre-doctoral fellows will be recruited to the investigators' umbrella program Biomedical Graduate Studies will be eligible to apply to the Certificate Program in Environmental Health Sciences which is a unique 2 year curriculum consisting of didactic course work and three rotations, one of which must be either a community-based research or population-based research rotation so that hands on training in environmental/molecular epidemiology is provided.  Pre-doctoral fellows will be appointed to the Training Grant (TG) after completion of the first year of the Certificate Program.  The training Program is distinct from the Certificate Program.  All pre-doctoral fellows must take the Certificate Program but not all students in the Certificate Program will be supported by the Training Program. Those supported by the Training Program are expected to conduct thesis work in environmental health science that will be dual mentored by a basic and clinical scientist preceptor and will take additional course work in translational research training.  Basic scientist postdoctoral fellows wishing to pursue clinical research on a disease of environmental etiology and clinician scientists wishing to pursue basic research on molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to such disease will be appointed for up to two years. They will also be dual mentored. Postdoctoral fellows will be required to take at least four courses available to the Training Program pre-doctoral fellows to supplement their knowledge base. Postdoctoral fellows will also receive additional mentoring through the Career Development Core of the CEET.  This Training Program provides the format for cross-fertilization and will provide a new cadre of environmental health scientist who may be equally well at home with the basic and clinical science of a problem.  Trainees will be equipped to deal with environmental exposures, how they relate to disease and how their findings may be translated at the patient-, community- and public health- levels."
"9259124","Project Abstract Circadian clocks drive the 24-hour oscillations in gene expression and behavior that allow an organism to anticipate the day/night cycle, and its disruption has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. However, our understanding of conditions where the clock fails remains poor, making it crucial to understand how clocks keep accurate timing over a range of physiological conditions. To function effectively, the clock must maintain a consistent period despite being composed of stochastic biochemical reactions. How does the cell achieve noise-free behavior despite being composed of noisy building blocks, and does molecular noise stemming from limited molecular copy number in the cell impose a significant physical constraint on clock robustness? To answer these questions, I will utilize the circadian clock in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, in which core clock behavior is generated post-translationally entirely by three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, allowing for a direct investigation of the effect of molecular noise on clock function by manipulating Kai protein copy numbers in vivo. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that molecular noise constitutes an important physical constraint on the biochemical robustness of circadian clocks, and that reduction of Kai protein copy number will lead to a loss in accuracy of clock timing that ultimately imposes a fitness penalty on the cell. I have engineered a strain of S. elongatus in which Kai protein copy number is tunable, and I have demonstrated with time lapse microscopy that clock noise increases as Kai copy number is reduced. In my first aim, I will investigate the possibility of cell division as a mechanism explaining the observed increase in noise. In my second aim, I will develop a stochastic model of the Kai system that can predict oscillatory performance as a function of Kai protein copy number. Lastly, by measuring single-cell growth rates on the microscope, I will assess whether noisy rhythms induced by low Kai copy number reduce cellular fitness due to more frequent mistiming between the cell and the environment. These three approaches together will elucidate basic principles of the relationship between noise suppression and molecular copy numbers within the cell."
"9388900","PROJECT SUMMARY Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to human health. It is quickly becoming evident that current research efforts are unable to keep pace with the rate at which bacteria evolve inactivation mechanisms to last- resort antibiotics. The core structures of many of these last-resort compounds are small, flat, structurally sparse heterocycles amenable to rapid diversification by chemical semi-synthesis. However, recent major campaigns aimed at improving resistance have yielded only a small number of FDA-approved antibacterials derived from these molecules. Structurally-rich antibiotics, like vancomycin and pleuromutilin, have comparatively vast chemical and structural space that remains essentially unexplored. In particular, nearly 1200 derivatives of pleuromutilin have been synthesized since its discovery in 1951, but due to the sheer structural complexity of pleuromutilin, the majority of derivatives are semi-synthetic congeners of the glycolic acid side-chain. Much effort has been devoted to a total chemical synthesis of pleuromutilin, but only one such synthesis exists. The 34 linear steps required to prepare pleuromutuilin is both infeasible for large-scale production and does not allow for the rapid synthesis of congeners designed to probe fundamental questions regarding the metabolic degradation and biological activity of this important antibiotic. We propose the first highly convergent total chemical synthesis of pleuromutilin, in which two rapidly prepared building blocks are united by a regio- and stereospecific nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling at a late stage in the synthesis. A second key step leverages our expertise in organosamarium-mediated reductive cyclizations to forge a hindered carbon-carbon bond and establish three stereocenters. Taken together, these strategies will enable expedient access to pleuromutilin, allow for a much broader diversity of studies on the core carbon skeleton, facilitate derivatization efforts aimed at the much-needed development of new antibiotics, and contribute knowledge to the chemistry and biology of pleuromutilin."
"9385267","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory information about the external world reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus. For each sensory system a `primary' thalamic nucleus transmits information from the periphery to primary sensory cortices, and a `higher-order' thalamic nucleus further links distinct cortical areas via reciprocal connections with primary and associational cortices. Here, our overall goal is obtain a better understanding of how higher-order thalamic nuclei contribute to sensory processing. We will accomplish this by utilizing a well-characterized and genetically tractable model system, the mouse whisker- barrel system. In mice, the posteromedial (POm) thalamic nucleus is the higher-order thalamic nucleus for the somatosensory system and links primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with motor cortex other associational cortices through a `cortico-thalamo-cortical' pathway. This pathway is thought to play a direct role in sensorimotor behaviors, however its function has never directly been tested in an awake behaving animal. In this proposal, using a combination of electrophysiological recordings, optogenetics, and behavioral paradigms our objective is to determine whether POm is required for the perception of somatosensory stimuli during basic whisker-dependent behavioral tasks. We hypothesize that POm neurons may preferentially respond to somatosensory stimuli that are behaviorally salient to the animal, making it necessary for even simple somatosensory tasks. This may be due to a role in attention, as opposed being involved strictly in stimulus representation, and could serve to enhance cortical activity to behaviorally relevant stimuli."
"9197895","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a renewal of the New England, New York and Quebec Regional Clinical Center of the NHLBI Heart Failure Research Network, under the direction of Dr. Martin LeWinter of the University of Vermont and Fletcher Allen Health Care (UVM/FAHC). With this application we propose a new leadership structure, a multiple PI/PD partnership with Tufts Medical Center (Tufts MC) under the direction of Dr. Marvin Konstam, and a major expansion of the RCC. We believe that this expansion will markedly enhance both our scientific contribution to the Network and our enrollment capabilities. As our clinical trial, we propose to study the effects of ranolazine in patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). About 50% of HF patients have a normal EF. There are currently no evidence-based treatments for HFNEF. We have published in vitro studies using excitable left ventricular (LV) myocardial strips obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting which show that the presence of concentric LV hypertrophy (LVH), which is common in patients with HFNEF, is associated with the appearance of increasing diastolic tension at abnormally low stimulation frequencies. We have also shown that the anti-anginal drug ranolazine, which inhibits the late sarcolemmal Na current, normalizes this rate-dependent diastolic dysfunction. Accordingly, we propose a 24 week randomized trial of ranolazine versus placebo in patients with HFNEF and LVH to test the hypothesis that ranolazine improves exercise performance, assessed as peak V02 during either treadmill or cycle exercise. Secondary outcome variables include results of a symptom questionnaire, submaximal exercise performance, and changes in LV mass, diastolic function, and serum biomarkers of neurohumoral activation. A positive result of this trial would lay the foundation for a larger, mor definitive trial of ranolazine in treating the very difficult problem of HFNEF.     RELEVANCE (See instructions): HF has become a problem of major proportions over the last two decades. Important strides have been made in improving functional capacity and survival in HF with reduced ejection fraction. However, progress in the approximately 50% of patients with normal ejection fraction has been disappointing. The proposed trial, along with expansion of our RCC, has the potential to positively impact this major clinical problem."
"9385475","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many viruses use non-coding RNA elements to manipulate cellular machinery for effective infection and replication. Less frequently, elements are found in the coding region of a viral RNA. An example is the competitive inhibitor RNA (ciRNA) within the coding region of the C3 protease of group C enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus and poliovirus. This RNA 303 nucleotides element competitively inhibits RNase L, an RNase that becomes activated by the presence of double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm. Once activated, RNase L rapidly degrades RNA and thus is a powerful antiviral enzyme. The ciRNA can serve to inhibit this enzyme, and this suggests there is strong selective pressure to maintain the ciRNA sequence to depress the antiviral response and facilitate successful infection. Understanding the detailed molecular events that occur during infection is important for the development of new therapies against poliovirus and coxsackievirus infection. These molecular event could also be important for a novel therapy were coxsackievirus A21 is in clinical trials as a therapy against melanoma, breast, and prostate cancers. The molecular, biophysical, and in vivo features of the ciRNA that inhibits RNase L are unknown; understanding the interactions between RNase L and ciRNA is important in understanding how an RNA is able to directly inhibit an enzyme that is made to ensure its destruction. Aim one of this proposal is t test the hypothesis that ciRNA folds into a unique structure when it binds making it able to inhibi RNAse L's ribonuclease activity, determine the binding interface between RNase L and ciRNA, and determine the molecular mechanism of inhibition within the ciRNA and RNase L complex by elucidating the structural interactions. To determine the features of this complex, I will characterize the importance of different secondary structural regions by chemical footprint probing, binding assays, and functional assays with wild-type and mutant forms of ciRNA with RNase L. Due the size of this complex I will focus on to characterize the structural relationship of the RNase L-ciRNA complex by X-ray crystallography. A structure of a complex between ciRNA and RNase L would illuminate whether inhibition is the result of encapsulating the active site, inducing a conformational change in the active site geometry of R Nase L directly, or another mechanism. The second aim of this proposal is to track the localization of RNase L and ciRNA during infection. I plan to use cell culture of monocytes, epithelial, and cancer cells and infect these cells with poliovirus and coxsackievirus strains to demonstrate the biological significance of the RNase L-ciRNA complex. RNase L and ciRNA will be fluorescently labeled track their movements during to invention to better understand their role within infection. The cell lines listed are being genetically edited by the CRIPR-Cas9 system to make GPF tagged RNase L and RNA FISH experiments will be used to track the ciRNA element. The combination of these experiments will allow to determine when and where RNase L and ciRNA co-localize."
"9243632","Cardiovascular disorders (CVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD) and congenital hear diseases (CHD) are the leading causes of death in the United States. Despite strong contribution of genetic factors to CVD, very little is known about the underlying genetic causes of these diseases. We have embarked on high throughput sequencing and high throughput in vivo characterization of genes underlying CVD in outlier kindreds and in offsprings of consanguineous unions. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and state of the art analytic approaches, from linkage to gene set enrichment analysis, we have identified independent mutations that underlie CAD, metabolic syndrome and diverse CHD. Our success in identification of disease genes is in part due to access to unique disease populations across the world and the support of Yale Center for Mendelian Genomics. While we have devised inventive approaches for novel gene discovery, the distinctive feature of our laboratory is in pursuing the characterization of disease genes in vivo and its success in identifying novel disease pathways and targets for drug development. We have established high throughput techniques in the lab for functional characterization of identified human mutations in vitro and in vivo by employing novel gene editing techniques. Most recently, we have begun to investigate the epigenetic effects of aging, diet and physical activity on disease pathogenesis in human and animal models. Most notably, we have taken a step further and have initiated collaborative efforts with the industry in order to screen and characterize small molecules that can target identified disease pathways in order to rescue cardiovascular and metabolic traits. Our highly cited published work is an attest for the quality and the promising nature of the results we generate in the lab."
"9212693","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project, Neuropathology of CTE and Late Effects of TBI: Toward In-Vivo Diagnostics is a multi- center and multi-disciplinary study designed to dramatically increase our understanding of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other late effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a major public health concern in the US, as the current prevalence of TBI in the US is unprecedented. Some TBI survivors experience particularly poor outcomes as they age; these include accelerated cognitive and health decline, dementia, and in some cases, CTE. CTE is thought to be a tauopathy but has been described only in convenience samples of people with repetitive head trauma. CTE is incompletely described in individuals with mild, moderate and severe TBI. The population incidence and prevalence, risk factors, and causal role of multifocal tauopathy on associated symptoms are unknown. Overlapping clinical features, postmortem pathologies and patterns of involvement exist in TBI, CTE, and Alzheimer's disease pose challenges to accurate diagnosis. Premortem diagnosis of CTE is currently impossible. The neuropathological consequences of single mild or moderate-severe TBI and its relationship with CTE and known dementias are unclear. The proposed project will leverage extensive resources from an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study of brain aging (Adult Changes in Thought; ACT, n=2,305) which includes excellent medical, behavioral, and genetic characterization of a cohort (20% of whom have a history of mild-moderate TBI) in addition to state-of-the-art neuropathology workup upon death. Neuropathological study of TBI effects can begin immediately in the existing ACT autopsy sample (n=489, 20% with TBI exposure). Additional cohorts of TBI- exposed individuals will come from the Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai (n=150 individuals with moderate-severe TBI), the University of Texas Southwestern (n=50 retired boxers with repetitive TBI exposure), and the National Football League (n=76 retired players with repetitive TBI exposure). All participants in the proposed study (ACT and other sites) will undergo uniform harmonized neurobehavioral assessment (chosen to maximize correspondence with existing large-scale TBI and dementia studies), MRI scan, and genomic analysis. Those individuals who expire during the course of the study will undergo ex-vivo neuroimaging and extensive neuropathological exam using state-of-the-art techniques (such as Histelide) designed to quantify tau and A? in whole brain specimens. Only by examining postmortem pathology in a sample of individuals with varying levels of TBI exposure who are well characterized during life (as proposed herein) can postmortem pathology facilitate identification of in-vivo biomarkers that can act as diagnostic tools. This project represents the most systematic and scientifically rigorous effort to date to develop a more complete understanding of the long-term clinical and neuropathological sequelae of single and multiple TBI."
"9198022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the strongest clinical associations with autoantibodies directed to components of the Ro/La ribonucleoprotein complex is the development of congenital heart block (CHB) in an offspring, an alarming prospect facing 2% of primigravid mothers with these reactivities. The risk of CHB is 10-fold higher in subsequent pregnancies of women who have previously had an affected child. No preventive therapies have been successful and complete block has never been reversed. Experimental evidence supports a role of Toll-like receptor signaling in the pathogenesis of CHB. Since hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) inhibits this implicated pathway, two studies were initiated: 1) a case control study that demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease in HCQ-exposed fetuses of anti-Ro antibody-positive women with SLE, and 2) a historical cohort study in which the recurrence rate of CHB was decreased by 70%. Based on these encouraging bench-to-bedside results, an open label prospective study using Simon's 2-Stage approach was initiated via a pilot R03 with the hypothesis that HCQ significantly reduces the recurrence rate of CHB. Exploiting Simon's 2-Stage design, the goal was to complete enrollment of 19 mothers in Stage I whose previous pregnancies were complicated by CHB with the intent of an R01 application should fewer than 3 recurrent cases occur. As of February 2014 with 32 pregnancies enrolled, 23 completed (19 on no potentially confounding medications) and 2 beyond the 26th week (vulnerability rare >26 weeks), only one case of complete block occurred. These data support commencement of Stage II. Accordingly, Specific Aim 1 is to complete Stage II of the open label Phase II trial, entitled Preventive Approach To Congenital Heart Block with Hydroxychloroquine (PATCH), in pregnant women who have had a previous CHB child. The protocol remains identical, with HCQ initiated by 10 weeks gestation. Serial echocardiograms and evaluation of maternal and cord blood biomarkers (HCQ levels, IFN? signatures, autoantibody titers) address maternal compliance, pathobiology and efficacy. Over 5 years, up to 35 subjects will be enrolled (to assure no potentially confounding medications). Study governance remains at NYU. An IND has been maintained. Ultimately, HCQ will be considered efficacious if <6 cases occur among a total of 54 subjects. A positive result will likely change the management of all anti-Ro positive women who have had a previous child with CHB and illustrate the importance of translational science. A potential prevention would justify screening all pregnant women with anti-Ro antibodies, particularly relevant since the majority of mothers of affected children are themselves totally asymptomatic. Specific Aim 2 addresses the ophthalmologic safety of HCQ exposure during pregnancy. Despite the rarity of safety issues reported in over 300 children whose mothers were treated with varied doses of HCQ for rheumatic disease during pregnancy, concerns remain since HCQ interferes with lysosomal metabolism and thus may be damaging to retinal neurons. Data on retinal development in children age 5 and controls (matched for race and gestational age at birth) obtained by optical coherence tomography are expected to provide further reassurances regarding the safety of HCQ exposure during pregnancy."
"9388897","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of new tools for early disease detection and diagnosis is essential to improving public health and lowering healthcare costs. Semiconductor nanocrystals, also known as quantum dots, display optical properties that give them enormous potential in the fields of fluorescence imaging, biosensing, and diagnostics. To advance the effectiveness of nanocrystals in these applications, however, the range of their physical properties must be broadened to include: 1) tuning of fluorescence emission and increased lifetimes 2) sensitivity to electric or magnetic fields and 3) suppression of blinking. One current approach has been the incorporation of metal impurities in the crystal lattice, or doping.  Doped nanocrystals comprise a relatively unexplored field, although in recent years nanocrystals with Mn2+, Cu2+, and lanthanide dopants have been studied for their unique optical and magnetic properties. Controlling the amount and location of dopant incorporation within the nanocrystal is important for controlling these new physical properties. Unfortunately, this level o synthetic control has been challenging to achieve, and the mechanisms of dopant incorporation in nanocrystals are still not completely understood.  The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop new synthetic methods for doped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals with improved control over dopant density and distribution. Specifically, this proposal describes the design and synthesis of mixed metal carboxylate-supported multinuclear zinc clusters with coordinated oxometallate ligands as soluble single-source precursors of doped ZnO nanocrystals. The synthesis of these clusters affords the opportunity to study solution-state cluster degradation and aggregation of multinuclear zinc complexes that may serve as intermediates for nucleation clusters. A second aspect of this research plan is to develop a novel approach for the synthesis of doped nanocrystals based upon in situ reduction of oxometallate anions during ZnO lattice growth. With this approach, different nucleation and growth dynamics will be observed that may afford novel and spectroscopically unique nanostructures. These results will allow the design of different types of doped nanocrystals that target specific optical and magnetic properties. The broad, long-term goal of the proposed project is to provide access to these materials to expand the chemical toolkit available for biomedical applications."
"9198059","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent definition of the circadian molecular oscillator has permitted identification of the critical pacemaker neurons underlying circadian timekeeping. That information now presents the possibility to re- examine fundamental questions regarding the cellular basis for circadian regulation of behavior. We are interested in the molecules and signaling mechanisms by which circadian pacemaker neurons transmit information from the clock to the brain and body. A major focus of our studies concerns transmitter signaling by pacemaker neurons. Genetic evidence indicates the neuropeptide PDF (Pigment Dispersing Factor) is a principal circadian transmitter in Drosophila. Our working hypothesis is that PDF is an important synchronizing agent within the pacemaker network. In the previous research cycle, we studied where the receptor for PDF (PDF-R) is expressed, we developed realtime imaging methods to study its activation in vivo, and screened for kinases and phosphatases that participate in its signaling pathways. Those outcomes helped establish a foundation for a cycle of studies we now propose - to analyze PDF-R signal transduction mechanisms and consequences on neuronal activity.  PDF-R is a Class B peptide GPCR - that category includes receptors for the mammalian PACAP and VIP peptides. We will pursue two specific aims related to PDF receptor signaling. First, we will analyze the composition of the PDF-R signalosomes, starting with the identification of associated adenylate cyclases. The signalosomes are different for different pacemakers - their molecular definition will greatly advance our understanding of circadian physiology. Second, we will determine how PDF-R signaling and its inactivation are controlled by internalization, via endocytotsis - preliminary genetic evidence suggests this is a key step in proper PDF-R signaling. Finally, in Aim 3, we will exploit novel imaging technology (called OCPI) for fast, realtime measures of neuronal activity in all 150 Drosophila brain pacemakers - once per minute, for up to 24 hours. When performed with genetic and pharmacological manipulations of PDF, this will permit us to relate PDF-R signaling data to normal pacemaker physiology.  Biological timekeeping is essential for numerous homeostatic physiological events. Challenges to these mechanisms (from shift-work schedules or seasonal change) cause disruptions severe enough to include clinical conditions. Our studies focus on evolutionarily-conserved molecular mechanisms of circadian clock output and will identify leads for better therapeutic interventions to redress such conditions."
"9195061","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia meeting entitled Autophagy Network Integration in Health and Disease, organized by Drs. Ivan Dikic, Anna Katharina Simon and J. Wade Harper. The meeting will be held in Copper Mountain, Colorado from February 12-16, 2017. Autophagy is a quality control mechanism that plays an important role in health and disease, including cancer, infection, inflammation and neurodegeneration. The core autophagy machinery has been identified and studied in detail. In addition, integration and cross-talk with other cellular pathways is becoming clearer, providing a rationale for why autophagy is linked to so many diverse (patho)physiological functions. It is becoming obvious that autophagy pathways implicated in chronic inflammation and infection also contribute to the development of cancer. Future challenges are focused on integrative structural, molecular and system approaches that are able to provide a much more refined understanding of autophagy regulatory networks. This meeting will highlight basic molecular and network insights in the autophagy system that are critical in life processes and multiple disease areas, and will examine the prospects for therapeutic targeting of the autophagy system. The meeting will bring together a variety of investigators exploring different facets of autophagy, and their interactions will expand our knowledge of fundamental autophagic mechanisms in different physiological and pathological settings."
"9296162","Bacterial pathogens are rapidly gaining resistance to antimicrobial therapeutics undermining the ability of modern medicine to treat such infections [1,2]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 2 million people in the United States become infected with drug-resistant bacteria annually, causing at least 23,000 deaths [3]. In light of such reports, the need to identify and study novel targets for antimicrobial intervention using emerging analytical technologies is paramount for the future successful treatment of infectious diseases. One potential target for antimicrobial therapeutics involves transition metal homeostasis at the pathogen-host interface [4,5]. Metals are an essential component of biological function for all cells. It is estimated that 30-45% of all enzymes utilize a transition metal cofactor to enhance catalysis and reactivity [6,7]. Therefore, bacterial pathogens proliferating within a host must obtain metals to survive and grow, causing disease. In response, hosts seek to sequester these elements from pathogens, a process known as nutritional immunity [4,8]. With a more detailed understanding of host mechanisms of metal sequestration and bacterial mechanisms of metal scavenging, novel therapeutic targets can be discovered. S. aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that commensally colonizes the anterior nares of an estimated 25% of the human population [9]. To cause disease, S. aureus breaches the initial site of infection and enters the bloodstream where it can cause infectious lesions on virtually any organ [10]. A hallmark of these purulent infectious foci, called abscesses, is the recruitment of host immune cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, which generate oxidative stress in an attempt to kill the pathogen [11,12]. Abscess formation has been studied extensively using histologically methods [10,13,14]; however, a molecular understanding of organ-specific heterogeneity of bacterial virulence factor expression and host response is not yet understood."
"9233309","Abstract:  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a chronic disease that predictably leads to colorectal cancer if left untreated. Clinical trials have shown that COXIBs (selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors), a subclass of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that were originally developed to treat arthritis, effectively reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer in FAP patients. However, this class of drugs cannot be used clinically to treat FAP due to their severe systemic side effects including unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac thrombus. Drug companies have had to withdraw the chemopreventive indication of approved COXIBs (i.e., celecoxib) from the market due to these serious side effects. In this application, we propose to develop recycled colon bioavailable (r-CB) drugs to localize the active COXIBs in the colon by targeting enterohepatic circulation (EHC) via structure modification, resulting in low systemic drug exposure and high colonic drug exposure, thereby reducing the systemic side effects without sacrificing their efficacy. In the preliminary study, we have synthesized a few compounds and identified one (GS1) that is a potent COX-2 inhibitor undergoing efficient EHC. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that COX-2 inhibitor GS1 can effectively prevent or slow down the process of colon carcinogenesis with low systemic exposure in animal models relevant to FAP. Our long-term goal is to develop highly active r-CB COXIBs for the prevention of colorectal cancer that have limited or no systemic side effects in FAP patients. To prove the feasibility of r-CB drugs, we will: (1) evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy and systemic exposure of GS1 using the Pirc rat model (Aim 1); and (2) identify the transporter(s) facilitating EHC and evaluate the impact of EHC on the drug distribution using cell culture and/or animal models (Aim 2). The successful completion of this project will allow us to demonstrate that r-CB drugs that are only bioavailable in the colon can be created. This would enable selective treatment or prevention of the colonic cancer without severe systemic side effects. In addition, this project will allow us to generate preliminary data for the preparation of an R01-level proposal. It is expected that the research community will use this approach to develop drugs for the treatment of other colonic diseases; especially those related to COX-2- mediated colon carcinogenesis."
"9393199","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A substantial body of literature supports linkages between osteogenic and angiogenic signals both in vitro and in vivo, but little is known about how their spatial and temporal coordination impacts the differentiation of adult stromal/stem cells (ASC) and bone regeneration. This study explores the coordination of angiogenic and osteogenic signals utilizing two techniques, recently described by our labs; i) the production ASCs sheets that can be stacked to generate quasi three- dimensional (3-D) structures and ii) the photo-controlled differentiation of ASCs through tightly regulated miRNA mimic delivery. The combination of these techniques will allow the induction of spatiotemporal gradients of angiogenic and osteogenic factors in a 3-D model to study how the timing and magnitude of differentiation cues impact ASC cell fate in the complex fracture site environment. Thus, our overall goal for this project is the development of an in vitro, quasi 3-D model of ASC osteogenesis to establish the effect of spatiotemporally modulated osteogenic and angiogenic cues and correlation of these results in a nude mouse calvarial defect model. As noted above we have developed a method of ASC cell sheet production utilizing a thermally reversible methylcellulose hydrogel polymer and automated cell manipulation system enabling the development of quasi 3-D structures to serve as model tissues. We have also demonstrated a light activated Plasmonic Gene Delivery system (PGDs), which serves as a convenient inducible gene delivery vehicle. When combined with miRNA mimics, miR-148b and miR-132, PGDs have been demonstrated to induce de novo osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation in human adipose derived ASCs, respectively. Combining both these methods will allow the induction of spatiotemporal differentiation gradients within the quasi 3-D ASC sheets and improve our understanding of the interplay of osteogenic and angiogenic factors in ASC based bone repair. The hypothesis will be tested in the following three Aims: Aim 1 will assess the impact on cell sheet stacking on ASC viability and differentiation. ASC cell sheets will be stacked into 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 layers and cultured for up to 28 days to determine the impact on ASC viability, proliferation and differentiation potential. Aim 2 will assess the impact of temporally and spatialy varying the light activation of PGDs with osteogenic and angiogenic miRNA mimics on the osteogenesis and angiogenesis of ASCs within the quasi 3-D stem cells sheets. In aim 3 we will correlate in vitro results with in vivo in a 12-week nude mouse calvarial defect model. Optimal 3-D stack sizes and spatiotemporal induction conditions determined in Aim 1&2 will be tested in the repair of a calvarial defect in a CD-1 nude mouse. Animals will be euthanized at 1,6 and 12 weeks post-surgery and undergo histological, x-ray and ?CT evaluation for bone formation and vascularization of the defect site. The successful conduct of the project will provide a greater understanding of how spatiotemporally coordinated expression of osteo- and angiogenic factors impact ASC differentiation into bone and additionally, this research will lead to improved stromal/stem cell based therapies for critical sized bone defect repair."
"9378681","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) is a genetic mimicker of viral infections of the central nervous system, with persistent cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, elevated CSF alpha interferon (IFNa), CSF neopterin / biopterin and intracranial calcifications. The immune basis of this heritable disorder was solidified by the identification of mutations in a series of genes associated with genome surveillance, integrity and damage repair (TREX1, RNASEH2A/B/C, SAMHD1, ADAR1). These appear to result in the aberrant accumulation of RNA: DNA hybrids and other immunogenic nucleic acid structures within the cell. This suggests that the initial step in disease pathogenesis is caused by accumulation of immune-stimulatory retrotransposable elements driven by the LINE-1 encoded reverse transcriptase. Murine data, in which treatment with reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) substantially reduced mortality in an AGS model, suggests it may be possible to interrupt the production of these immunostimulatory nucleic acids by targeting host reverse transcription. We hypothesize that the AGS phenotype is caused by accumulation of retroelement derived transcripts, resulting in an immune response, which can be interrupted by reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI). We seek to bridge the gap between current knowledge, generated using mouse models, and our long term goal of effective therapy. The propose research will explore the contribution of endogenous retroelements to disease by, Aim 1, exploring broader retroelement type and accumulation in AGS cells of different genotype. A pilot trial, Aim 2, will provide evidence of safety and proof of principle for treatment of AGS, a devastating, untreatable orphan disease, using RTI, an established group of pharmacologic agents. Additionally, Aim 3, we will define the phenotype of immune activation in AGS to clarify the downstream effect of retroelement accumulation on innate immunity and for use as potential biomarkers in future clinical trials."
"9404183","Understanding how cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their tissue microenvironment (mechanosense) would enhance our ability to control stem cell differentiation, enabling advances in regenerative medicine, and to develop drugs to disrupt tumor metastasis, the cause of the vast majority of cancer deaths. Despite the importance of extracellular matrix stiffness in controlling cell fate and behavior, the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanosensing remain unknown. Cells interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through focal adhesions and associated stress fibers, actin-rich structures which enable a cell to pull on its surroundings via myosin II motor protein mediated contractility. Focal adhesions contain more than 150 different proteins, forming a highly complex interaction network whose composition changes dramatically in response to contractile forces which are modulated by the stiffness of a cell's environment. The proposed studies will dissect a primary mechanism underlying this compositional remodeling: how dozens of proteins containing motifs known as LIM domains are recruited to focal adhesions and stress fibers when they are under tension. Although the role of most LIM proteins in focal adhesions and stress fibers has not been well characterized, substantial cytological evidence suggests that one family member, the protein zyxin, accumulates at sites where the actin cytoskeleton is deformed or damaged in a LIM domain-dependent manner. I therefore hypothesize that myosin motor activity, which is known to distort actin cytoskeletons in vitro, generates binding sites for LIM domains in cells when contractility is high on stiff ECMs. This proposal builds upon an innovative application of electron tomography, which I previously adapted to quantify the distributions of single molecules in reconstructed three-dimensional maps of heterogeneous networks of interacting proteins. I will employ this technology to characterize the distortions which myosin motor activity generates in reconstituted cytoskeletal networks. This will reveal for the first time the structural consequences of a physiological force generator on the actin cytoskeleton in molecular detail. I will then uncover which of these distortions act as binding sites for LIM domains using zyxin as a model, and how the interaction is formed. Finally, I will stringently establish which LIM proteins are mechanosensitively recruited to focal adhesions and stress fibers in cells, and how they also recognize deformed cytoskeletal structures. Developing pharmacological inhibitors of force-dependent LIM protein accumulation, a key aspect of a cell's mechanosensitive response to its microenvironment, will be accelerated by identifying and establishing the structural details of the interaction between force-sensitive LIM domains and their receptors on the actin cytoskeleton. My studies will also provide insight into how the prevalence of modular LIM domains in the focal adhesion and stress fiber protein-protein interaction network enables a large-scale mechanosensitive response by the alteration of a single class of interactions."
"9121058","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood maltreatment trauma is an important public health problem because it can result in posttraumatic psychopathology, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociation, along with other chronic illnesses. However, posttraumatic stress symptomatology is often missed or misdiagnosed in children, and there is poor consensus about diagnostic taxonomies for abuse-related posttraumatic stress. In addition, little is known about patterns of service usage for children with posttraumatic stress and best practices for service delivery for this population. The purpose of this secondary analysis project is to describe the prevalence of PTSD and dissociation and patterns of service usage for trauma-exposed adolescents (12-18) under the new DSM-5 posttraumatic stress diagnostic taxonomy which includes a dissociative subtype. A large national data set of trauma-exposed children from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network will be used for the analysis.  This predoctoral fellowship dissertation project is the foundation for a long-term research trajectory on health service delivery for child survivors of trauma and violence, with an ultimate end goal of  optimizing intervention service delivery and achieving better health equity for abused, neglected, and exploited children. The training plan for this project includes quantitative methodology, substantive content in child trauma and mental health, and academic researcher role attainment activities through interdisciplinary coursework, mentored training, research, community service, and writing."
"9389641","This Phase II proposal is a continuation of our successful Phase I grant whose overarching goal is to develop a more robust and accurate method for the deformable fusion of pre-operative magnetic resonance images (MRI) and intra-procedure trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) images to guide prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer is a major cause of death in the U.S. and biopsy is the gold-standard for its diagnosis. Each year over 1.1 million biopsies are performed in the U.S. alone at a cost of well over $1 billion. Most of these biopsies are performed under TRUS guidance in a systematic fashion but blinded to potential tumor locations because many tumors are invisible on ultrasound. This procedure is highly inef?cient and as many as 30% of serious tumors may be missed on a ?rst- time biopsy. Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) acquired before the biopsy can be used to de?ne potential targets and then used in conjunction with live TRUS imaging to perform targeted image-guided biopsy. A key challenge is the accurate registration (fusion) of the intra-procedure TRUS with the pre-acquired MRI. This fusion procedure is often performed using rigid registration which does not account for prostate deformation between the MRI and TRUS acquisitions. Eigen's Artemis system is one of a newer generation of devices that performs deformable mapping between MRI and TRUS. Current fusion methods (such as in Artemis), however, are highly operator dependent as they rely on semi-automated TRUS segmentation by the clinician during the procedure which is error prone, time-consuming and critically reliant on operator skill. We propose to extend the development of our strategy for deformable registration (from Phase I) based on a statistical deformation model learned from an existing, large, multi-institutional database (N=200) of MRI-TRUS prostate image pairs. We will learn the statistics of both biopsy deformation and prostate shape clusters. The model will reduce the dimensionality of the search as well as constrain the deformation. The proposed registration method will use a regional con?dence estimate for the intra-procedure interactive TRUS segmentation in order to enhance robustness by focusing the registration on the more con?dent portions of the bounding surface. We will also generate regional anisotropic estimates of registration uncertainty. These methods will streamline the clinician's work?ow by providing a more accurate and robust registration with less dependence on segmentation errors. This project is signi?cant in that it has the potential to improve the utilization of MRI-TRUS fusion guided prostate biopsy (especially outside of major academic hospitals) by alleviating the dependence of the work?ow on exact prostate segmentation from often poor quality TRUS images. In Aim 1, we will further improve our fusion algorithm, integrate it into the Artemis system and test for improved accuracy. In Aim 2, we will create an innovative research interface to our new algorithm to allow for clinical testing and then perform a two-site clinical validation in N=40 patients. We will compare our new method to the current non-rigid MRI-TRUS fusion method used in our FDA-cleared Artemis system to demonstrate improved accuracy."
"9398825","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments."
"9370978","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age globally. We are specifically interested in the diarrheal disease cholera because of the devastating impact the disease has on at-risk populations and an emerging opportunity to leverage mobile technology to overcome fundamental clinical and scientific challenges we have faced for decades in the cholera field. Despite effective treatments and advances in provider education, cholera case fatality rates remain high. Conventional methods have been unable to overcome barriers to provide patients timely access to care and fully understand the disease at the level of the household. With the emergence of high rates of cell phone penetration in areas with significant cholera associated morbidity and mortality, we feel there are new opportunities for intervention. Our research challenge is to take an unconventional approach to develop a system using mobile technology to identify cases, improve access to care, and characterize the microbial flora early in the disease state. The application's specific aims are (i) develop a system to detect cholera patients early in disease using mobile technology, (ii) validate the detection system and clinical impact of the system in an interrupted time series study with a control group, and (iii) characterize the microbial flora of cholera stool during the early disease state. These aims will generate the following deliverables: We will show for the first time that mobile technology can be used to identify and provide ORS to diarrheal disease patients early in disease. We will show that mobile technology can be leveraged to decrease the incidence and severity of cases admitted to the hospital. Lastly, we will implement the system to characterize cholera stool using modern techniques early in disease for the first time, which may impact our fundamental understanding of correlates to disease progression and transmission."
"9167160","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 80-90%of liver cancer diagnosed in adult oncology and thus accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. A major mechanism of HCC resistance and ability of cancer cells to thwart treatments relies on the PI-3 kinase and Myc cell signaling pathways. We have generated preliminary data which suggest that a dual pan PI-3 kinase/BRD4 inhibitor, SF1126 has potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo against HCC and inhibits the BRD4-Myc interaction. These data support the hypothesis that dual PI3K/BRD4 inhibitors will have activity in the treatment of advanced HCC. Based on SEER database published in 2010 (www.SEER.org) the prevalence of HCC is 41,404 in the US. Currently, the only curative treatment for HCC is complete surgical resection or liver transplantation. The significance of our proposal derives from the unmet medical need for alternative therapy for patients with recurrent, unresectable, and/or metastatic HCC (termed advanced HCC). If successful, this therapy could provide a significant advancement in the quality of treatment and quality of life for this difficult to treat disease. A previous Phase I trial of a dual PI3K/BRD4 inhibitor, SF1126 (an integrin targeted prodrug small molecule) (partly supported by the NIH RO1 CA94233) was carried out in 39 non-genotyped patients diagnosed with recurrent adult solid tumors (including colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and recurrent breast cancer) and 5 patients with B-cell malignancy. SF1126 was well-tolerated and demonstrated complete pathway inhibition in tumor biopsies. Importantly, SF1126 displayed no hepatotoxicity in this Phase I trial. Clinical benefit was observed in the form of prolonged stable disease for up to 84 weeks duration. Stable disease was the best response in 19 of 33 patients (58%) evaluable patients with median duration of 13 weeks and mean of 18 weeks. MTD was not reached but the maximum administered dose (MAD) after 9 dose escalation cohorts was 1110 mg/m2 and this dose was chosen as the recommended Phase II dose (RMP2). The results of the Phase I trial justify a Phase I evaluation of SF1126 in HCC. We propose 3 specific aims to test the hypothesis that SF1126 will be efficacious in advanced HCC. The specific aims are designed: 1) to determine the toxicity profile of SF1126 in order to determine the RMP2 dose level in the treatment of advanced HCC patients including patients classified as Child-Pugh A-B7 with liver dysfunction/cirrhosis; 2) to evaluate mechanisms of resistance in HCC cell lines and tumor models and 3) to validate and compare the observed resistance mechanisms confirmed in Aim 2-3 to the TCGA-ICGC molecular and clinical dataset of 1094 HCC tumors in preparation for planned Phase II trial. An innovative component of this proposal derives from this being one of the first clinical trials of a novel PI-3 kinase/BRD4 inhibitor in a Phase I HCC trial and our efforts to use sophisticated molecular methods to identify a molecular signature in HCC model systems which may identify factors which define resistance or sensitivity to this class of agent in future Phase II trials."
"9413544","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Increasing epidemiologic and experimental evidence supports the role of inorganic arsenic in the development of diabetes. Arsenic in drinking water is a major concern for US populations who live in small rural communities. Prospective evidence and mechanisms for arsenic related diabetes must be investigated. Objective: To evaluate the role of inorganic arsenic exposure and metabolism and gene-arsenic interactions in the development of diabetes, insulin resistance, ? cell dysfunction and the metabolic syndrome among 2,717 Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) participants e18 year old who were free of diabetes at baseline. Preliminary studies: We have identified an association between urine arsenic concentrations and the prevalence of diabetes in American Indians 45-74 year old from Arizona, Oklahoma and the Dakotas who participated in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). Urine arsenic concentrations and methylation excretion patterns remained constant over a 10-year follow-up. The heritability of the proportion of monomethylarsonate (%MMA) in urine was 0.52. In a small linkage study, we detected potential quantitative trait loci associated with %MMA in areas of the genome close to methyltransferase genes. Design and setting: The SHFS is a population- based prospective family study that recruited parents, spouses, offspring, spouses of offspring and grandchildren of SHS participants in 1998-2005. Demographic, lifestyle and medical information and measures of fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile, hypertension endpoints, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences are available at baseline and follow-up visits through 2011. Urine samples and blood DNA samples were stored at -70oC. Exposure assessment: We will measure total urine arsenic and urine arsenic species concentrations using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and high performance liquid chromatography-ICPMS (HPLC-ICPMS), respectively. Genetic assessment: We will prioritize and measure ~1,500 SNPs in candidate genes related to arsenic metabolism and toxicity using a multiplex panel. We will measure SNPs in candidate genes related to diabetes traits using the Metabo-chip, a highly cost- effective candidate gene chip for diabetes and cardiometabolic traits. Statistical analysis: We will use mixed- effect models for binary and linear outcomes to assess the prospective association of urine arsenic species concentrations at baseline with the incidence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and changes in the homeostatic model assessment to quantify insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and ? cell dysfunction (HOMA-B) over time. Gene-arsenic interaction will be estimated using principle component analysis and accounting for population stratification using genomic control. Significance: By investigating the contribution of inorganic arsenic to diabetes, insulin resistance, ? cell dysfunction and the metabolic syndrome and by identifying genetic susceptibility factors, this study can inform the arsenic-diabetes relationship and impact the prevention and control of arsenic exposure in drinking water and food in the US and abroad."
"9234519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a clear need for a robust method to image cerebral hemodynamics to better understand disease processes, as well as to develop early stage disease biomarkers. Many diseases like cancer and stroke are characterized by deficits in perfusion and changes in other blood flow related parameters. There is also mounting evidence suggesting that poor regulation of cerebral blood flow is closely linked to the development of several diseases whose prevalence is on the rise, like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. While routine clinical perfusion imaging is cumbersome and requires the injection of contrast agents. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to image perfusion without injection of contrast agents. ASL is rapidly gaining prominence in the clinic because perfusion can yield crucial information about the health of brain tissue and its vasculature, although it is being used with increasing frequency in other organs as well. While ASL's potential as a clinical and research tool is phenomenal, the technique is still severely challenged by low signal to noise ratio (SNR). These challenges are exacerbated in the white matter because of its low perfusion rate and longer transit time from the labeling site to the voxel. In this proposal we aim to develop a new acquisition and quantification framework for imaging perfusion and other physiologically relevant parameters. This framework takes advantage of newly developed MR fingerprinting techniques. We aim to optimize this framework in order to maximize the sensitivity and accuracy, while reducing the scan time. Finally, we aim to validate the technique by comparison to independent measurements of the same parameters using alternative, established methods."
"9389581","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recombinant AAV vectors are becoming an increasingly important gene transfer tool. Recent successes in clinical therapeutic applications suggest that the number of patients treated with these vectors is likely to increase rapidly in coming years. Preclinical studies have overwhelmingly supported the safety of rAAV gene therapy in numerous different tissues and animal models. However, a small number of studies have reported an excess incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas associated with rAAV treatment in mice, and in one case, this could be directly linked to vector DNA integration in a specific chromosomal locus. Other studies have found little evidence of such a link, despite exhaustive characterization of vector integration by massive parallel sequencing of DNA from tumors in rAAV infected mice. These inconsistent results leave the issue of rAAV genotoxicity in question, making it difficult to anticipate and disclose potential risks to patient groups. We have adopted a different strategy for the investigation of rAAV genotoxicity, essentially creating conditions where vector integration is likely to lead to tumor promotion in order to provide the sensitivity we need to detect oncogenic events, and then working back to dissect the mechanisms of genotoxicity as well as the vector elements that contribute to it. Using this strategy, we show in preliminary studies that we can readily measure an increase in tumor incidence associated with vector infection in a tumor-prone mouse strain (C3H/HeJ). This provides a valuable model for determining the comparative genotoxic potential of different rAAV vectors and, importantly, allows the characterization of the most likely mechanisms of oncogene activation. Using a rAAV vector designed to test the effects of strong read-through transcription on tumor promotion, our preliminary studies show tumor-associated vector genomes interacting with oncogenes through transcriptional read- through, transcriptional enhancer effects, and disruption of tumor suppressor genes. A second vector, of conventional design, was associated with excess tumors in this model through an apparently different mechanism, with little evidence for vector integration in tumors. Both of the vectors tested in our previous study were the self-complementary derivative of rAAV vector. In the proposed research, we will include three Aims designed to: 1. Directly compare self-complementary AAV and single-strand rAAV vectors for liver tumor promotion in the C3H/HeJ mouse model, and for differences in patterns of vector insertion in normal liver tissue from these animals. 2. Modify the scAAV vectors to determine what features contributed to tumor promotion, particularly from the vector that was not expected to activate oncogenes by transcriptional read- through. 3. Use deep sequencing technology to fully characterize rAAV integration sites in tumors and normal tissue with and without induction of cell-cycling. We will also relate the observed effects of vector infection in the tumor-prone mice to a tumor resistant mouse model to help extrapolate to liver tumor risk in humans. Together, these studies will greatly advance our understanding of the risk factors associated with rAAV vector gene therapy."
"9391159","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evolutionary processes are fundamentally shaped by the physico-chemical properties of proteins, DNA, and other biomolecules: many layers of biophysical and biochemical mechanisms connect a DNA mutation to a cell's ability to survive and reproduce. Little is known about how random mutations affect these molecular properties and ultimately shape the evolutionary fate of a population. This knowledge is particularly crucial for predicting or controlling the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The complexity of  binding interactions and gene regulation suggests that a mutation to a single protein may have far-reaching effects throughout the cell. The goal of this project is to determine how mutations affect these molecular interactions and the resulting consequences for evolution in bacteria. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, it tests the hypothesis that protein-protein and regulatory interactions evolve rapidly and predictably in response to a mutational perturbation, while specific compensatory mutations that target individual protein traits, such as folding stability, and evolve over longer times. The project will first develop a multi-scale model that combines the biochemical kinetics of protein folding, binding, and regulation with the evolutionary dynamics of selection, mutation, and genetic drift. Computational simulations of the model will make experimental predictions. The project will then test these predictions by experimentally evolving E. coli with mutant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an essential metabolic enzyme. Whole-genome sequencing and phenotyping of the evolved populations will allow comparison of the experiments with the theoretical predictions. This project will substantially increase our understanding of how mutations affect molecular interactions in cells, and how this shapes evolutionary outcomes."
"9282581","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone loss is among the most disabling and costly conditions suffered by Americans, and can be caused by traumatic injury, inflammatory and infectious diseases, congenital defects or oncologic resection. Conventional treatment involves harvesting bone grafts from the patient or another tissue donor for repair of the defect. These approaches face limitations such as donor site morbidity, insufficient or poor quality donor tissue, and potential immunogenicity. Stem cell-based therapy offers a promising alternative approach for the repair of bone loss such as cranial and long bone defects, however, treating large bony defects remains one major challenge. A critical barrier to progress in the field is the lack of suitable cell carriers that can support stem cell survival, and guide vascularized and mineralized bone formation in situ. To address the above challenges, our proposed multidisciplinary approach aims to validate the efficacy of microribbon-based scaffolds as a novel type of cell carrier for enhancing stem cell survival and mineralized bone matrix deposition in vivo. The proposed work will be accomplished by an interdisciplinary research team comprised of basic and clinician scientists, with complementary expertise in biomaterials, stem cells, molecular imaging and animal models to validate the efficacy of novel tissue engineering strategies for bone repair. We have demonstrated the unique microribbon morphology confers markedly enhanced mechanical strength of the scaffolds, with interconnected macroporosity to support cell proliferation and extracellular matrix formation. We hypothesize that: (1) osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in microribbon-based scaffolds can be enhanced by tuning the stiffness and biochemical cues of microribbons; and (2) the macroporosity of microribbon-based scaffolds would lead to enhanced cell survival, faster vascularization and enhanced bone tissue formation in vivo. To test these hypotheses, three specific aims will be pursued including (1) Develop and characterize poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based microribbons for forming 3D macroporous cell niche with independently tunable biochemical and mechanical cues; (2) Determine the optimal biochemical ligands and stiffness of PEG-based microribbons that support osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stromal cells in vitro; and (3) Assess the efficacy of microribbon-based scaffolds for repairing bony defects in vivo using a murine cranial defect model. We expect the findings from this proposal would improve the current treatment options for bone loss, a debilitating condition that afflicts individuals across all populations and ages, and correspondingly reduce the associated socio-economical burden on society."

"9387029","Project Summary  In order to convey information, communication requires both signal and silence. In biology this is achieved through signaling enzymes that are dynamic and reversible, allowing itself to be both activated and inactivated. As a prototypical signaling kinase, Protein Kinase A, PKA, has been observed to be both activated and inactivated in a matter of seconds, which is essential for its roles in key physiological processes such as regulating heart contractility and the oscillatory release of insulin by the pancreas. PKA is inactive when its catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits are bound in a closed confirmation and PKA is activated by the binding of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, to the regulatory subunit prompting the release of the catalytic subunit. While it had been assumed that equilibrium binding of cAMP would be commensurate with the activation and inactivation of PKA, both the dissociation of cAMP from the regulatory subunit and re-association of the regulatory and catalytic subunits are far too slow in vitro to agree with the fast inactivation observed in cells. The work proposed in this fellowship will examine the hypothesis that the inactivation of PKA requires the direct removal of cAMP by phosphodiesterases, PDEs, and the dephosphorylation of the regulatory subunit by the phosphatase Calcineurin, CN. This hypothesis will be tested with the following two specific aims:  ? First, the kinetic effects of disrupting the ability of PDE to directly degrade cAMP bound to PKA will be  measured at both the molecular and cellular levels.  ? Second, in vitro and live-cell quantification of PKA activity will be used to evaluate the role of PKA RII  dephosphorylation by CN in PKA inactivation. Furthermore, live-cell observation of PKA dependent  changes in mitochondria morphology will allow us to characterize the downstream functional effects of  RII dephosphorylation by CN. The results from these studies will answer a long standing question in the field of PKA signaling dynamics."
"9243840","Gender-variant youth exhibit disproportionally high rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality. They often present seeking medical or mental health treatment for gender dysphoria, which manifests with particular severity as youth enter puberty. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that gender dysphoric youth in early stages of puberty receive medical treatment to suppress endogenous puberty and prevent the development of undesired secondary sex characteristics. These clinical guidelines reference recommendations by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health that youth satisfy eligibility and readiness criteria as determined by a mental health clinician prior to initiating pubertal suppression treatment. While eligibility criteria are clearly defined, readiness is not well operationalized. Indeed, youth are considered ready for pubertal suppression if they understand expected outcomes, benefits, and risks of treatment. However, there is no objective measure of readiness, and reliance is placed on subjective ?clinical expertise?. This lack of standardized assessment is an increasing problem as medical treatment for gender dypshoria is more commonly sought and pubertal suppression is more widely accepted as standard of care. The goal of the proposed study is to develop an assessment tool that can aid mental health clinicians in systematically assessing readiness for pubertal suppression from a decisional capacity framework. Specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop a Pubertal Suppression Readiness Assessment Tool (PS-RAT) by following methods used to develop an existing vignette-based measure of decisional capacity, obtaining expert feedback on the tool, and assessing initial reliability and validity, and (Aim 2) explore how neurocognitive and emotional functioning are associated with decisional capacity as measured by the PS-RAT. Successful completion of this study will result in a prototype PS-RAT which will (1) assist clinicians in systematically and objectively assessing youth?s breadth and depth of understanding the potential risks and benefits of pubertal suppression treatment for gender dysphoria, (2) help to identify specific domains in which youth may need additional psychoeducation and/or therapeutic support to facilitate readiness to move forward with treatment, and (3) contribute to informed decision-making by youth and families."
"9238998","Project Summary Phosphate levels are critical for cellular energy and skeletal development and mineralization. FGF23 is a key phosphaturic hormone, dysregulated actions/levels of which are the cause of several inherited bone diseases. FGF23 elevation in response to phosphate retention also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of and complications related to renal failure. The mechanisms underlying the production of FGF23 are poorly understood, limiting the ability to develop effective treatments for these disorders. XL?s is a G protein alpha-subunit, genetic alterations of which are associated with multiple human diseases. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the regulatory function of XL?s in FGF23 production and its role in diseases with dysregulated FGF23 production. Studying XL?s knockout (XLKO) mice as a model to explore the function of XL?s in humans, we found that XL?s plays a critical role in phosphate homeostasis during early postnatal development. We also showed that XL?s mediates renal PTH actions immediately after birth via the PLC/PKC pathway. Our recent work showed that XL?s ablation results in hyperphosphatemia with significantly reduced serum FGF23. Our preliminary results strongly indicate that XL?s ablation leads to diminished FGF23 and Fgfr1 mRNA levels, as well as reduced PLC/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling in a bone cell-autonomous manner. In addition, our preliminary results show that XL?s ablation mitigates the rise of FGF23 induced by acute kidney injury in mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that XL?s plays a critical role in the production of FGF23 in bone. In Aim 1, we will determine (a) the role of XL?s/PLC/PKC signaling in FGF23 production, and (b) the mechanism by which XL?s regulates ERK1/2 activation. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that XL?s contributes to PTH-induced FGF23 production via the PLC/PKC and/or ERK1/2 pathway. We will also address the hypothesis that the interaction of XL?s with SNX9, dynamin, RACK1 and/or IQGAP1 is critical for XL?s- mediated FGF23 production. In Aim 3, we will determine whether XL?s ablation mitigates the elevated serum FGF23 levels in a mouse model of (a) acute kidney injury and (b) chronic kidney disease. Results of the proposed experiments will provide novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of FGF23 production and will also identify potential drug targets for treating patients with dysregulated FGF23 levels. Moreover, our studies will provide mechanistic insights into the cellular actions of XL?s in bone and enhance the knowledge of its roles in human diseases."
"9198993","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) modalities such as angioplasty are often used as the standard procedure for treatment of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death in the U.S., they have many limitations including late restenosis and thrombosis. Delayed endothelium regeneration after vascular injury by PCI has been indicated as a major cause for these drawbacks, especially late thrombosis. Indeed, endothelium layer serves as a nature barrier for the artery and plays an important role in the prevention of platelet adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Thus our long-term goal is to engineer novel multifunctional targeting nanoparticles (MTNs) that can bind specifically onto the injured arterial site to serve as a temporary barrier to prevent platelet adhesion and smooth muscle cell migration while recruiting stem cells such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) for enhancing endothelium regeneration. The novel engineered MTNs will prevent platelet adhesion and encourage rapid endothelium healing at the injured site, allowing the potential of re-endothelialization in situ.  To reach our goal, three specific aims are proposed: (1) To synthesize and characterize novel biodegradable, biocompatible, and hemo-compatible biomaterials including urethane-doped polyesters (UPEs) for vascular tissue engineering applications. (2) To formulate MTNs, which are made of UPEs, loaded with therapeutic reagents including growth factors, and conjugated with both the injured arterial wall targeting ligands and the EPC binding molecules. Various properties of MTNs including the effects of MTNs on platelet deposition and endothelium regeneration in vitro will be further investigated. (3) To determine the effectiveness of novel MTNs in vivo for endothelium regeneration in situ following PCI injury using animal models.  There are several innovative aspects associated with this research. Our engineered MTNs, based on recent advances in both tissue engineering and nanotechnology, provide a unique strategy to promote endothelium regeneration and hence to stimulate vascular healing after PCI while preventing platelet adhesion. Another novel aspect of our research is that the engineered MTNs utilize the combination of (1) targeting injured arteries, (2) reducing platelet adhesion by serving as a temporary barrier, (3) capturing EPC at the targeted sites, which indirectly reduce platelet deposition on the damaged areas, and (4) promoting endothelium regeneration using engineered tissue nanoscaffolds. The proposed MTNs will bring in a significant improvement in the treatment of PCI-associated vascular injury and should generate highly scientific and economic impacts in cardiovascular disease therapy."
"9193086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most presently installed full-body MRI systems are based on 1.5 T liquid-He- cooled NbTi magnets, but the rate of installation of 3.0 T systems is rapidly increasing. However, the increasing cost of helium is well documented, and this leads to increases in the life cycle cost of MRI systems, which could limit ready access for traditional patient groups, and limit the ability to expand availability to traditionally less well served patint groups. The root cause of the problem is the growing shortage of helium worldwide. The major MRI magnet manufacturers (Siemens, GE, and Phillips) each have development programs focused on converting the 1.5T solenoid coils from liquid helium bath cooling to dry (cryogen free) conduction cooling. Indeed, freedom from the need for liquid-helium cooling (i.e. cryogen free, conduction-cooled, operation) is becoming more and more important. Presently, MRI systems (2000-3000 liters) are filled with liquid He helium at the factory prior to shipping at a cost in the U.S. of about 20-30 K. Given that from 2006 to 2011 the cost of LHe has tripled, and it is expected to continue to increase, corresponding increases in the cost of liquid-He MRI units can be expected. In some parts of the world liquid He costs about $9-13 per liter and in others about $25 to $70 per liter leading to re-filling costs of $18,000-$210,000 depending on the MRI's size and location. Thus a growing demand is predicted for MRI magnets that do not depend on liquid He for cooling.  Even beyond the liquid cryogen issues for MRI, the development of cryocooled MRI magnets could allow for new geometries and MRI applications, opening up new treatment possibilities. However, we must focus where the industry can transition this new technology commercially. Accordingly, the proposed program focuses on developing the technology to enable cryogen free 3 T systems using a cryocooled mode. We proposed to do this by; (1) Increases practical MgB2 engineering current density, Je, by one order of magnitude over presently developed 1 G wire, in the fields and temperature ranges appropriate to 3 T MRI (4-10 K, 0-4 T), (2) Developing n-values sufficient for persistent mode magnet operation (30 or more in the relevant field range) in the multifilament 2 G wires of (1), (3) Developing a magnet model with sufficient detail to develop the conductor specification/targets, and the tradeoffs between cooling, temperature gradients across a coil segment, and conductor performance, (4) Determining the proper Cu/SC ratio for wire-in-channel MgB2/Cu, and demonstrate its long-length manufacture, (5) Demonstrating one segment of the total coil, using the WIC of item (4), with the needed current, n-value, temperature gradient, and quench performance, and (6) Developing a robust persistent joint for MgB2 conductors in a magnet engineering friendly react & wind mode."
"9407103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated Na+ channelopathies are associated with multiple disorders. Mutations in neuronal Na+ channels cause epilepsy syndromes, ataxia, and autism; mutations in the cardiac Na+ channels are associated with arrhythmias, sudden infant death syndrome, conduction disorders, and cardiomyopathies. A hotspot for disease-causing mutations is the channels' C-terminal domain (CTD), which harbors a calmodulin (CaM) interaction site. Because Ca2+ is the ultimate signal of electrical activity and is often perturbed in disease states, the presence of a key Ca2+ sensor (CaM) at a hotspot for channel regulation (the CTD) provides a starting point for understanding how these channelopathies cause disease. Nevertheless, regulation of Na+ channels by Ca2+/CaM is poorly understood and information is limited by the lack of structural information and challenges to investigating channel function in native cell types. Here, we build on new structural information and novel methods to investigate how Ca2+/CaM regulates Na+ channels in the context of native cell types. Our new structural information provides background and guideposts for investigating how Ca2+-free (apo) CaM and Ca2+-loaded CaM differently affect channel function; how neuronal and cardiac channels are distinctly regulated by CaM in their native cell types, and how different CaM interacting domains within Na+ channels contribute to overall Ca2+/CaM-dependent regulation. Our novel methods of studying informative mutants in cardiomyocytes and neurons will provide an understanding of how Ca2+ affects Na+ channels and thus how Ca2+ dysregulation leads to the various Na+ channelopathies. The specific Aims addressed in this proposal are to determine: 1) How Ca2+-free apoCaM controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes; 2) How Ca2+/CaM interaction with the NaV CTD controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes; and 3) How Ca2+/CaM interaction with the NaV III-IV intracellular linker controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes."
"9296156","We propose to renew funding for the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry  (IMS) at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN. The previous funding cycle has been  extremely successful in both advancing IMS technology and applying it to cutting edge biological projects. In  this renewal, we seek to advance the technology to provide next generation capabilities that will encompass  sub-micron spatial resolution, ultra-high sensitivity, and ease of use tools that will be made available to the  non-expert investigator. This proposal contains two overarching aims. First, it proposes to pioneer novel  instrument technologies, sample preparation devices and methods, and data analysis/image informatics  solutions. The latter is a critical need for current research grade IMS instrumentation, and it will be essential for  next-generation instruments.. Second, this proposal seeks to simplify the entire imaging process that currently  requires expertise and significant time to get high quality, meaningful results. Achievement of these global  aims is important to bring this technology into the biological and clinical laboratory.   The proposed Technology Research & Development (TRD) program will provide performance  improvements that will meet many of the current needs of the user community. Specific TRD advancements  will focus on maximizing instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution. We will also develop specialty reagents  and methodologies designed to enhance sensitivity, molecular specificity, and preserve the location of  biomolecules during sample preparation and analysis. We propose to develop a next generation imaging mass  spectrometer for routine use that is capable of achieving 500 nm spatial resolution at high sensitivity.  Additionally, we will develop software capable of co-registering and viewing imaging data from multiple  modalities such as IMS and microscopy through an image fusion process. Finally, we will develop new  advanced bio-computational algorithms to mine imaging data for molecular patterns and to normalize images  from large datasets. These developing advanced technologies will be focused on important driving biomedical  projects (DBPs) in infectious disease, eye disease, diabetes, and cancer.   Important activities of the Resource include: selected collaborations with investigators who have NIH  sponsored research projects that would significantly benefit from the developing IMS technology. This includes  high spatial resolution imaging, high mass resolving power instrumentation and advanced data analysis and  informatics capabilities. Training and dissemination of the technology will continue to be accomplished through  a yearly on-site four day training course termed AIMS (Advanced Imaging Mass Spectrometry). In addition,  training and dissemination will occur through hosting individual visiting investigators, students, and fellows, and  through publication of the research outcomes for both the technology and its applications, and from individual  invited research lectures presented by the faculty of the Resource."

"9330398","Project Abstract Hearing loss is a highly heterogeneous genetic disorder that makes diagnosis and treatment of patients challenging. Mutations in genes that result in syndromic hearing loss are often involved in the development of hair cells and auditory neurons. The discovery and study of genetic factors that contribute to the development of the inner ear will clarify the molecular etiology behind hearing loss and allow development of strategies to treat hearing loss. The short stature homeobox domain 2 (SHOX2) gene was identified as a candidate transcription factor involved in early development of auditory neuron through bioinformatic analysis. To better understand and recapitulate the role of human SHOX2 in inner ear development, zebrafish was chosen as a model organism. During embryonic development, zebrafish shox2 is expressed in the otic placode and later in the cranial ganglia which includes the statoacoustic neurons. I hypothesize that shox2 determines the cell fate of otic progenitors that give rise to neurons. I will evaluate auditory and vestibular behavior of zebrafish after morpholino knockdown of shox2. I will determine shox2 expression in otic progenitors by performing immunofluorescence in situ hybridization on zebrafish reporter lines that mark the otic progenitor pools. Furthermore, I will determine how shox2 knockdown affects the number of cells within each progenitor population. Finally, I will perform lineage tracing by generating and utilizing a tamoxifen inducible shox2-p2A?CreERT2 to mark progeny that arise from shox2 cells. These aims will clarify the role of shox2 in establishment of otic progenitor cells and potentially add this gene to a repertoire of factors responsible for hair cell and otic neuron development."
"9206732","Project Summary  Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying genomic instability and tumorigenesis is the long-term goal of my laboratory. The broad objective, of this proposal, reflects our pursuit to gain a comprehensive understanding of the network involved in DNA repair and to determine how these proteins and pathways intersect, interact, communicate, coordinate, and collaborate for genome maintenance. The short-term goal is to perform detailed mechanistic studies of several DNA damage signaling and repair pathways, which will provide the foundation to achieve our long-term goal of exploiting DNA repair network for cancer therapy.  This proposal will define two overlapping DNA damage-signaling pathways that together are essential for cell survival. We and other researchers have constructed an elaborate signaling pathway that acts downstream of H2AX and regulates the recruitment and accumulation of many DNA damage repair proteins at sites of DNA breaks. This H2AX-dependent pathway is composed of H2AX, MDC1, RNF8, and RNF168. However, repair defects observed in H2AX-, MDC1-, RNF8-, or RNF168-deficient cells or mice are mild, raising the possibility that there is an H2AX-independent mechanism involved in the recruitment of these downstream repair proteins. We propose that this H2AX-independent pathway is controlled by NBS1.  On the basis of our previous studies and preliminary data presented in this proposal, we hypothesize that the H2AX- and NBS1-dependent pathways are involved in the DNA damage response and are critical for cell survival. We believe that these two pathways have redundant functions, especially in promoting homologous recombination repair. However, they are not completely separate, since they intersect at multiple points. This makes it considerably challenging for us to delineate the functions of these two redundant pathways. It is unknown whether we can elucidate the contribution of a single pathway to the ever-growing network, i.e., can we untangle the network to understand the mechanisms by which different pathways intersect and contribute to biological processes? We will address this question in this application and we will further study the mechanisms by which the H2AX- and NBS1-dependent pathways act together to ensure cell survival and the completion of DNA repair. We propose the following specific aims: 1) determine whether NBS1 acts redundantly with the established H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168 pathway to ensure cell survival; 2) delineate the NBS1-dependent pathway; and 3) explore the mechanisms underlying cell lethality caused by NBS1 and H2AX co-depletion. These studies will not only allow us to understand the redundant functions of H2AX and NBS1 in vivo but will also reveal ways to investigate the functions of proteins and pathways in today?s complex signaling networks. Moreover, results from these studies will provide the rationale for exploiting DNA repair defect and applying synthetic lethality concept in precision medicine for cancer patients."
"9407615","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products contain cyclopropane or ß-lactam moieties; however, these functionalities are difficult to access synthetically. Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) are valuable reagents for constructing complex molecular architectures. They exhibit broad reactivity and excellent functional group compatibility, are easily prepared, and can be handled under ambient conditions. Electrophilic FCCs are particularly attractive, as they undergo [2+1] and [2+2] cycloadditions to afford chiral, strained carbocycles or heterocycles. Fluorine stabilized FCCs are promising, albeit elusive, electrophilic complexes with potential applications in fluorination strategies. Here, deoxyfluorination of FCCs will be explored as a method to access fluorocarbenes. As FCCs exhibit analogous reactivity to carboxylic acid derivatives, fluorocarbene isosteres of acyl fluorides are expected from the action of deoxyfluorinating agents (e.g., aminosulfuranes) on FCCs.       The proposed methodology is a divergent, mild synthesis of fluoromethylene and fluoroketene mimics that can be used to prepare the aforementioned cyclic motifs. Reaction of fluoro-FCCs with olefins will afford fluorinated cyclopropanes, while reaction with imines will afford fluorinaed ß-lactams. As fluorination of drug scaffolds typically improves their physiochemical properties, the proposed strategy will enable rapid access to libraries of tailored, chiral scaffolds with potential therapeutic value.       Initially, commercial deoxyfluorinating reagents and synthetic FCCs will be screened to effect the target transformation. Alternative fluorinating strategies (e.g., treating acylated FCCs with Olah's reagent) will be explored in tandem. These novel complexes will be investigated using standard spectroscopies and computation to evaluate their structure and innate reactivity. Efforts will then focus on [2+1] cycloadditions with various olefins (e.g., electron neutral, terminal, internal, etc.) to prepare fluorocyclopropanes. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions with imines will also be explored to afford fluorinated ß-lactams. Mechanistic evaluations (e.g., 19F NMR and Hammett studies) of both reactions are proposed to facilitate the design of complexes with optimal activity."
"9391715","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms are constantly adapting and evolving in response to internal and external stimuli. These changes can arise by either new mutations or by genetic variation already present in the system. The latter source of standing genetic variation, which does not affect the usual range of phenotypes, but has a potential to modify a phenotype in the event of an environmental or genetic perturbation, is referred to as cryptic genetic variation (CGV). Due to the environmental and cultural changes in recent human history, the uncovering of CGV could be a potential explanation for the rising incidences of diseases of modernity (i.e. asthma, diabetes, depression, etc.). We believe that cryptic variants are quite prevalent in the genome and do play a significant part in determining the consequences of genetic perturbations in an organism. To demonstrate the release of CGV, we will use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, we will investigate how cryptic genetic variation can affect female differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster by perturbing intersex (ix), which encodes a sex-specifically acting component of the Mediator transcriptional regulatory complex. We hypothesize that mutating ix in different genetic backgrounds of flies will reveal varying phenotypic responses, which is a proxy to the release of CGV. By quantifying the amount of variation in perturbed phenotypic responses, we can assess the extent and nature of CGV. To investigate our hypothesis, we transgenically create a new loss-of-function mutation tagged with GFP for ix and introgress this mutation via backcrossing into the genetic backgrounds of the 192 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel lines. We will measure five quantitative female traits associated with ix (i.e. number of gonopod thorn bristles, proportion width of the sixth tergite that is darkly pigmented, number of bristles on the last transverse row on the foreleg basitarsus, number of spermathecae, and fusion of the anal plates) and analyze the phenotypic variation within and between the lines as well as with and without the introgressed mutation. We will also test for the role of ix in promoting robustness against developmental noise (i.e. microenvironmental variation) since Mediator components have been known to confer robustness against this type of variation in other organisms. In addition to morphological phenotypes, we will also investigate gene expression profiles using microarrays from the pupal genital discs of a subset of the DGRP lines with and without the ix mutation to understand line-by-genotype interactions in gene expression as well as explore correlations between these interactions with the phenotypic variation in the five female traits we will have measured in the first part of the project. With the completion of the project, we will not only hav a better understanding of the prevalence and behavior of cryptic genetic variation, but will have also produced a systematic protocol to study CGV that is highly customizable. We will have created a new strategy for introducing dominantly marked loss- of-function mutations into any gene of choice and a set of balancer DGRP lines as well as a pipeline for data analysis for the general research community to use for future studies."
"9255016","ABSTRACT Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a promising gene delivery vector for therapeutic and vaccine applications, but its low transduction efficacy currently limits its utility. The primary reasons for low transduction efficacy are as follows: (i) inefficient trafficking of the rAAV genome to the nucleus, (ii) inefficient host cell-mediated synthesis of double-stranded DNA from the single-stranded genome, and (iii) Toll like receptor (TLR) 9 responses. The goal of this proposal is to identify small molecules that increase the transduction efficacy of rAAV transduction by modulating any one of the barriers. One immediate application will be the use of these compounds in the rAAV-based gene-therapy against HIV developed in Dr. Michael Farzan?s laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute. The rAAV vector expresses an antibody-like immunoadhesin (eCD4-Ig), a fusion of CD4-Ig with a small CCR5-mimetic sulfopeptide, which binds to the HIV-1/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope glycoprotein and protects macaques from infection. Increased transduction efficacy will decrease both the cost of treatment and the adaptive immune response to the viral capsid and expressed transgene that limits the use of rAAV vectors in humans. However, the significance of our studies goes beyond HIV-1 prophylaxis. These small molecules will be useful for other rAAV-based vaccines and therapeutics, such as vaccines developed for influenza, malaria, and dengue infection, or for the long-term delivery of biologics. In Phase I, we will (i) develop a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify compounds that enhance rAAV transduction, (ii) identify transduction enhancers, (iii) broadly evaluate the mode of action, and prioritize hits for a Phase II study. Promising scaffolds will be subjected to a rational drug design program in Phase II, and will be advanced to IND enabling studies."
"9184041","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PITX1 gene is an important transcription factor implicated in both skeletal variation and disease. Predominantly expressed in the lower limbs and pelvis, PITX1 has recently been linked to height variation in human populations, suggesting that regulatory changes contribute to common traits. PITX1 has also been implicated as causal in clubfoot disease, a serious musculoskeletal abnormality with an estimated prevalence of one per 1000 live births. While there are documented coding changes in PITX1 in familial clubfoot, protein- coding changes have not been found in isolated cases. However, right-sided predominance of sporadic clubfoot is similar to right-biased anatomical changes documented in PITX1 mutant mice and stickleback fish, suggesting that many additional clubfoot cases may be due to unrecognized regulatory mutations in this gene. Yet despite the importance of PITX1 in human height and pelvic disease, its regulatory landscape is not well understood. Fortunately, work in the stickleback fish model system has now identified not one, but two, distinct pelvic enhancers in the PITX1 gene as underlying much of the variation in the pelvic girdle and pelvic spine. As these structures are homologous to the mammalian pelvis and hindlimbs, the sticklebacks are an ideal system for further studying natural PITX1-mediated pelvic variation. Using the stickleback PITX1 gene as a model, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling a gene that is pivotal in mammalian development will be dissected. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: (1) Determine the effect of targeted pelvic enhancer deletion in stickleback fish,  (2) Identify naturally occurring variants in PITX1 pelvic enhancers, and (3) Determine regulatory potential of enhancer variants found in natural populations. These Aims will employ a variety of methods, including targeted genome editing in stickleback fish, comparative genomics in vertebrate species, and identification of human pelvic enhancer variants relevant to height and clubfoot disease, and functional testing of different enhancers in both in vivo and in vitro systems. In this proposal, we will test the contributions that each enhancer makes to the overall development of pelvic structures in stickleback fish. The generality of these mechanisms will be mechanisms will be further explored. By better understanding the regulatory landscape around PITX1, it will be possible to better understand, diagnose, and eventually treat cases of misregulation of this gene, such as idiopathic clubfoot. Identifying and characterizing limb enhancer elements regulating this gene will provide an important advance to the field, as physicians would know where to do targeted sequencing of patients, or, for whole genome sequencing, would be able to quickly narrow down the possible causative mutations."

"9243567","PROJECT SUMMARY Out-of-network care is 2-3 times more common in mental health care compared with general health care, with 18 percent of privately insured mental health care users using an out-of-network mental health provider in the past year. Yet, no research has considered why there are such large differences and their consequence. We propose to field a web-based nationally representative survey of individuals with private insurance who have used an out-of-network mental health provider or considered using an out-of-network mental health provider in the past year. In Aim 1 we will determine why individuals use or consider using out-of-network mental health care. Factors patient may consider include whether an in-network provider is available, preferences related to provider type, the benefits of maintaining a relationship with a current provider who is no longer in-network, privacy concerns, perceived provider quality as well as others. In Aim 2 we will determine the consequences of mental health provider networks for individuals with mental health disorders. Provider networks may affect access to care (including the decision whether to use any mental health services), continuity of care (changing providers), type of treatment (e.g. use of psychotherapy versus medication alone), and out-of-pocket costs (including balance billing). In Aim 3 we will investigate the implications of mental health provider networks for plan choice and selection into health plans. If patients actively consider whether a preferred mental health provider is in a plan's network before choosing a plan, plans may benefit from excluding providers who serve high-cost patients from their network. In addition to providing important new information on out-of-network service use in mental health, this study will be used to develop hypotheses for new research. We expect future studies derived from this work may include the use of administrative data to examine effect of plan network size and composition on quality and type of care received, particularly by individuals with SMI, and the use of data from State Health Insurance Marketplaces to evaluate whether and how the composition of mental health provider networks affects selection into plans. As plans continue to increase their use of provider networks to control costs, it is critical to understand the effects on access to care, quality of care and financial burden for individuals with mental health disorders. Better understanding the reasons for high out-of-network use in mental health care will help to determine which of the current policies being considered are most likely to lead individuals with mental health disorders to have similar access to care as individuals with general medical disorders."
"9389554","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer simulations to examine fundamental processes of enzyme catalysis. A deep understanding of the physical mechanisms of enzyme catalysis will illuminate both the design of new catalysts, as well as drugs that inhibit enzymes. The proposal aims to understand a potentially important, novel aspect of catalysis by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP). AP catalyzes phosphate transfer, which is one of the most important reactions in biology and medicine, and recent experiments proposed that the enzyme uses functional modules at the active site to catalyze the reaction. The functional modules, consisting of a few amino acids each, display a previously unobserved mode of cooperativity. The proposed computer simulations will determine how this cooperativity works at an atomic level and whether it could be important for other enzymes. Additionally, in order to accurately model this enzyme, the proposed research will develop an improved method for computer simulations of enzymes. Currently available methods falter in reactions involving highly charged substrates, and the proposed improvements to treating such reactions will have useful applications in enzymology."
"9240639","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal inheritance of germ plasm ribonucleoparticles (GP RNPs) results in the activation of a conserved gene expression program for primordial germ cell specification, and we use the zebrafish as a vertebrate model system to study this process. Zebrafish maternally inherited GP RNPs have co-opted the cytoskeletal machinery to reach progressive levels of multimerization: aggregation prior to furrow initiation (pre- aggregation), recruitment to the furrow during its initiation, and distal compaction along th furrow undergoing maturation. These sequential processes result in the formation of four large masses of aggregated GP RNPs, which will eventually confer germ cell specification. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that increases in GP RNP multimerization prior to and during furrow formation are based on actomyosin-dependent rearrangements of the cytoskeleton, mediated by myosin II motors associated with GP RNPs. We hypothesize that rearrangements leading to various stages of this process, pre-aggregation, furrow recruitment and distal compaction, have a common underlying mechanistic basis. We will test models of actomyosin interactions that may result in GP RNP multimerization prior to and during furrow initiation (Aim 1) and during furrow maturation (Aim 2). We further hypothesize that these underlying mechanisms are modified differently to produce different cellular outputs. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that, prior to and during furrow initiation, a GP RNP- associated f-actin network is modified by outwardly growing astral microtubules, a process that is coupled to the global activation of GP RNP-associated myosin II. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that, during furrow maturation, slow calcium waves associated with cytokinesis confer a medial-to-distal bias of myosin II activity and/or cytoskeletal dynamics that result in GP RNP compaction at distal ends of the furrow. Our findings will provide insights into novel fundamental mechanisms for the segregation of cell fate determinants. Recent studies have shown a link between germ line genes and pluripotency and tumorigenicity, and understanding mechanisms of germ plasm segregation will provide knowledge applicable to reproductive, regenerative and cancer biology."
"9237189","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Obesity has increased in prevalence worldwide, which is thought to be due to the influences of  an obesity-promoting environment and genetic factors. Despite these influences there are  individuals and animals that resist obesity. Spontaneous physical activity (SPA), which  generates nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), can reduce weight gain. Injections of  hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin A (OxA) into the lateral rostral hypothalamus (rLH) increased  levels of SPA and increase obesity resistance. The neurological mechanism that drive SPA are  not fully defined. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which NEAT is regulated will have the  potential to develop novel approaches to preventing and treating obesity. OxA has been shown  to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen activated  phosphate kinase (MAPK) in various cell models. Mice globally lacking the inhibitor for both  these kinases, MKP-1, have been reported to be obesity resistant due in part to an increase in  energy expenditure and SPA, but it is unknown whether OxA signaling is altered. OxA has also  been recently shown to increase ATP and the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1a  (HIF-1a) in hypothalamic tissue under normoxic conditions. This is noteworthy given that HIF-1a  increases oxidative phosphorylation. Additional independent studies have shown that HIF-1a  expression is regulated in part by MAPKs and the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1a. PGC-1a  is a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, can simultaneously upregulate genes that protect  against oxidative stress, and increases ATP production. The central hypothesis proposed in  this application is: SPA effects on weight gain depend in part on OxA signaling in the rLH,  which alters genes and proteins involved in short- and long-term intracellular metabolic function.  The three specific aims that will test this hypothesis are: 1) Determine in vitro if OxA increases  HIF-1? by the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs. 2) Test in vitro whether OxA-induced  activation of HIF-1? mediates intracellular metabolic changes in rat rLH sections. 3) Evaluate in  vivo if OxA treatment ameliorates or prevents changes in the ERK1/2-p38-MAPK-HIF-1?-  PGC-1? pathway and intracellular metabolic responsiveness in the rLH following the  development of diet-induced obesity. The immediate goal of the work proposed will characterize  cellular mechanisms important in OxA-induced SPA using in vitro and in vivo models, with a  long-term goal of developing therapeutic treatments for obesity through pharmacological  manipulation of these identified pathways. The expected outcome is that OxA will increase the  short- and long-term intracellular metabolic capacity of activated neurons, resulting in the  maintenance of elevated SPA and obesity resistance. This will impact the field of obesity  research by identifying a mechanism through which intracellular OxA signaling might contribute  to obesity resistance. The innovation and the challenge to current paradigms are that the  proposed studies suggest a new mechanism through which OxA elevates SPA, which is by  altering genes that increase intracellular metabolic resistance in activated rLH neurons. This  mechanism may be responsible for conferring long-term obesity resistance and would provide a  new therapeutic target for obesity."
"9193084","Abstract: Dr. Chunqi Qian is applying for the K99/R00 career transition award in preparation for his immediate career goal to become an independent faculty member in an academic institution. Dr. Qian's long term career goal is to develop advanced detection technologies for the next generation MRI diagnosis with better sensitivity and accuracy. To achieve this goal, Dr. Qian has been continuously working in the research field of magnetic resonance for many years. His PhD thesis work was highlighted by the prestigious professional journal, the Journal of Magnetic Resonance, for his novel implementation of the wireless coupling technique in the construction of a variable angle MR detector. During his postdoctoral research at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Dr. Qian successfully constructed a broad range tunable detector with good homogeneity and efficiency for the world's highest field MRI at 21.1 Tesla. This important progress has thus enabled the practical exploitation of high field magnet for biomedical imaging. This work has also been honored by the Young Investigator Award during the International Conference in Magnetic Resonance Microscopy. As a research fellow at NIH, Dr. Qian has for the first time developed a very promising technology that can greatly enhance the MRI detection sensitivity of internal organs, based on the innovative design concept of wireless amplified detection. This new technology has already been applied to obtain high resolution images of rodent kidney in vivo, enabling the detection of individual glomeruli and renal tubules. To further improve the imaging resolution, Dr. Qian will reduce the motional artifact by dynamically tracking the object motion with implanted detector itself, as is mentioned in Aim 1. To maximize the image contrast, Dr. Qian will use different contrast agents to visualize different components of nephron and correlate these high resolution images with histological studies, as is mentioned in Aim 2. These two specific aims will be accomplished under the mentorship of Dr. Alan Koretsky, during which time Dr. Qian will receive complete support from the NINDS. After Dr. Qian obtains an independent faculty position, he will continue the development of the wireless amplifier technology and exploit its biomedical applications. As is summarized in Aim 3, Dr. Qian will fabricate miniaturized wireless amplified detectors with microfabrication techniques. As is summarized in Aim 4, Dr. Qian will construct arrayed wireless detectors to get a bigger field-of-view, where each detector can be individually manipulated by a specific pumping signal. It is anticipated that further development of the wireless amplifier technology will lead to such applications as the chronic monitoring of engineered tissues and the in situ chemical sensing inside the digestive track."

We will also develop specialty reagents  and methodologies designed to enhance sensitivity, molecular specificity, and preserve the location of  biomolecules during sample preparation and analysis. We propose to develop a next generation imaging mass  spectrometer for routine use that is capable of achieving 500 nm spatial resolution at high sensitivity.  Additionally, we will develop software capable of co-registering and viewing imaging data from multiple  modalities such as IMS and microscopy through an image fusion process. Finally, we will develop new  advanced bio-computational algorithms to mine imaging data for molecular patterns and to normalize images  from large datasets. These developing advanced technologies will be focused on important driving biomedical  projects (DBPs) in infectious disease, eye disease, diabetes, and cancer.   Important activities of the Resource include: selected collaborations with investigators who have NIH  sponsored research projects that would significantly benefit from the developing IMS technology. This includes  high spatial resolution imaging, high mass resolving power instrumentation and advanced data analysis and  informatics capabilities. Training and dissemination of the technology will continue to be accomplished through  a yearly on-site four day training course termed AIMS (Advanced Imaging Mass Spectrometry). In addition,  training and dissemination will occur through hosting individual visiting investigators, students, and fellows, and  through publication of the research outcomes for both the technology and its applications, and from individual  invited research lectures presented by the faculty of the Resource."
"9417131","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this revised renewal application for post-doctoral research training support is to produce cutting edge independent scientists and future research leaders in genetic epidemiology. We are proposing to do this in a multidisciplinary setting with emphasis on substantive applied orientation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors and other complex traits related to heart, lung, and blood disorders. We have made partnership arrangements with cardiology fellowship programs at our institution so that we can actively recruit MDs (and MD/PhDs) in addition to PhDs. We believe that the research environment at Washington University is outstanding for carrying out research in cardiovascular genetic epidemiology. The cornerstone of this young program is its emphasis on intense and sustained individualized training of each trainee under the supervision of an experienced preceptor. Indeed, emphasis on individualized training is one of its hallmarks. Its centerpiece is an Individualized Training Pathway (ITP) developed for each trainee by the Program Director, the trainee's preceptor(s), and the trainee. An individual trainee's ITP will reflect his/her educational background, the previous research experience if any, the particular research interests of the trainee, and will address the curriculum needs as well as the type of research experience he/she needs. The focus of the research and training philosophy advocated by the Program Director and the participating preceptors is a clear understanding of the concepts, principles, and methods of genetic epidemiology necessary for investigating the physiological and pathophysiological processes that underlie CVD and related complex traits. We are requesting funds for continuing to support 4 slots each year (with half the slots devoted to MDs and MD/PhDs). Our proposal rises to the challenge by blending and integrating carefully chosen didactic training with greater emphasis on a direct hands-on research and grant writing experience. One of the great strengths of this training program is that the vast established resources and rich interdisciplinary training environment of the entire DBBS, as well as those of our GEMS and MSIBS masters degree training programs are available to all post-doctoral trainees in this program. The proposed post-doctoral research training program aspires to produce future genetic epidemiologists in much demand in the current market place for pursuing cardiovascular and other biomedical research. The research training environment at Washington University is outstanding, which also has a separate Office of Post Graduate Affairs to look after postdoctoral trainees and their special needs and serve as their advocate."

"9233503","An estimated 1.2 million parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Parental cancer causes substantial behavioral and emotional distress in both the diagnosed parent and child. An estimated 22-33% of the children exceed clinical cut off scores on standardized measures of distress or behavioral-emotional adjustment. Parents, regardless of education and socioeconomic level, are known to struggle with how and what to tell their child about their cancer or how to support the child during the many months of medical treatment. Treatment or disease-related symptoms and parental depressed mood negatively affect the child's physical and emotional access to the parent and the quality of parenting. Despite the magnitude of the problem and numbers affected, there is only 1 cancer parenting education program that has been tested for efficacy, the Enhancing Connections Program. In a 6-state randomized control trial, the program decreased parental depressed mood and anxiety, improved parenting quality, parenting skills and confidence, and enhanced the child's behavioral-emotional adjustment. Child outcomes were significant at 1- year follow up compared to controls. But that program, the Enhancing Connections Program (EC), was tested as an in-person delivered program, constraining its access and availability for parents for whom cost and time constraints or the burden of travel are prohibitive. In order to increase the potential sustainability of the EC Program, the program was formatted for group-delivery. The overall goal of the proposed study is to test the feasibility and short-term impact of the group-delivered EC Program within the largest provider of free group- delivered cancer support services in the United States, the Cancer Support Community, an organization that is a merger of the Wellness Community and Gilda's Club.  Phase I will involve training 6 Masters prepared social workers drawn from 3 Beta test sites of the Cancer Support Community in the United States. Phase II will involve implementing the program at these 3 Beta test sites and obtaining detailed data on the feasibility and short-term impact of the program on 33 program participants. A within group (pre-posttest) design will examine short term impact of the program. A total of 33 diagnosed parents with Stage 0-3 cancer will be enrolled, drawn from each Beta site's active recruitment channels. Eligible parents will have a child 5-17 years and read, write and speak English among their languages of choice. After consenting and obtaining baseline measures, study participants will receive 5 fully manualized group-delivered educational counseling sessions at 2- week intervals. Outcomes will be assessed at exit using the same standardized measures as those used to test efficacy of the EC. With a sample of 33 parents, effect sizes will range from medium to large: 0.51-1.16; p values will range from .008 to <.001. Longer term, results will be used to inform a larger implementation grant and clinical trial."
"9241554","Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects the Veteran population: while 9% percent of the total US population has T2D, 25% of the Veteran population suffers from this disease. Adult ? cell mass normally increases via replication in response to insulin resistance, but failure of ? cell proliferation plus increased ? cell death lead to T2D. T2D incidence increases with age, in part due to a decreased ability of ? cells to respond to proliferative cues as they get older. Our lab identified the FoxM1 transcription factor as a critical regulator of postnatal ? cell replication and discovered that it is induced in response to several ? cell proliferative stimuli. Foxm1 expression in islets declines with age in mice and humans, but activation of FoxM1 in older mouse ? cells increases ? cell proliferation and ? cell mass, while enhancing ? cell function. Thus, our data demonstrate that FoxM1 is limiting in older ? cells and that activating FoxM1 can bypass inherent brakes in ? cell proliferation. Little is known about how proliferative stimuli induce Foxm1. Our lab discovered that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) induces Foxm1 and adult ? cell proliferation in mouse islets in vivo and ex vivo and in human islets ex vivo. The mechanisms and signaling pathways through which CTGF has these effects are currently unknown This study makes use of unique in vivo mouse models as well as ex vivo studies in both mouse and human islets from different ages. In this proposal we will identify and manipulate CTGF signaling pathways in ? cells as molecular targets for enhancing proliferation and regeneration in adult ? cells. In addition, we explore mechanisms through which FoxM1 activation enhances ? cell proliferation and survival, focusing on the antagonistic prostaglandin E receptors EP3 and EP4, which are reciprocally regulated by FoxM1 in islets. We hypothesize that CTGF acts through integrin ?1 signaling to induce Foxm1 expression and adult ? cell proliferation, and that in the setting of ? cell death, CTGF function is enhanced by macrophage-derived signals. We further hypothesize that FoxM1 activation overcomes age-related changes in ? cell proliferation in part through alterations in prostaglandin receptor activity. In this proposal we will: 1) Identify signaling pathways through which CTGF activates Foxm1 expression and ? cell proliferation; 2) Identify macrophage- derived factors that cooperate with CTGF to enhance ? cell mass regeneration; and 3) Determine the role of prostaglandin EP receptors in ? cell proliferation and survival. These studies are designed to identify molecular targets to enhance proliferation and survival in older ? cells with the goal of increasing functional ? cell mass."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) for risky adult alcohol use consistently identifies 5-10% of patients in need of brief intervention and 2-5% in need of more formal alcohol treatment. SBI programs are often expanded to include Referral to Treatment (aka SBIRT) to address the latter patients' needs4-6 and in primary care have increased access to treatment by 15-20% via referrals leaving 80-85% still needing treatment. Effective models of linking adults with SUD to AOD treatment are clearly needed. Recovery Management Checkups (RMC) 15 are an effective strategy for linking individuals with SUDs to AOD treatment. In 3 trials, compared to the control group, RMC participants were significantly more likely to enter treatment, enter sooner, and stay longer, contributing to fewer days of substance use and fewer SUD symptoms. RMC was recently modified for primary care settings (RMC-PC) and piloted in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC). Modifications include a primary care population presenting for physical health care (as opposed to AOD treatment), a refusal conversion component, telephone vs. face-to-face linkage, and referrals back to primary care when health problems are indicated. Results indicated that RMC-PC converted 75% of those who initially refused a referral for AOD treatment at the FQHC and quadrupled the linkage rate to treatment for these individuals.  In the proposed trial, we will: a) recruit 300 adults needing AOD treatment at 4 FQHCs, b) randomly assign half to SBIRT and half to SBIRT+RMC-PC, and c) conduct quarterly follow-ups for 12-months. Hypotheses include: 1) Relative to the SBIRT patients, SBIRT+ RMC-PC patients will be more likely to: a) initiate AOD treatment sooner, b) receive any AOD treatment, and c) receive more days of AOD treatment; 2) Relative to the SBIRT patients, SBIRT+RMC-PC patients and those who get more AOD treatment will report less days of: a) alcohol use, b) heavy alcohol use, c) cannabis use, d) other  drug use, and e) SUD problems; 3) days of treatment will mediate the relationship between SBIRT+RMC-PC and changes in the these AOD related behaviors; 4) Relative to the SBIRT patients, SBIRT+RMC-PC patients and those with fewer days of AOD use will have significantly less total health care utilization costs after factoring in increases in AOD treatment; 5) Days of AOD use will mediate the relationship between SBIRT+RMC-PC and total cost of health care utilization."
"9215663","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathologic studies demonstrate that kidney tubule injury, atrophy, and fibrosis are common features of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are highly predictive of progression to dialysis. Established CKD risk factors including hypertension and advanced age are associated with tubular injury and fibrosis on biopsy. However, current clinical assessment of CKD evaluates only glomerular function (GFR) and glomerular injury (albuminuria), but not kidney tubular dysfunction or injury. The overall hypothesis of this application is that kidney tubular dysfunction and injury are measurable contributors to CKD pathogenesis and prognosis. Dysfunction of the kidney tubules will be assessed by three indices: (1) renal tubule resistance to hormone actions of FGF23 and PTH; (2) acid/base homeostasis; and (3) urine protein reabsorptive capacity. FGF23 and PTH are hormones that induce phosphaturia through effects on kidney tubules. FGF23 can directly cardiac toxicity, however it may also mark kidney dysfunction. In our preliminary work, we have demonstrated that elevated levels of FGF-23 or PTH are more strongly associated with adverse outcomes among persons with concomitantly lower urine phosphorus excretion. These findings suggest that indexing FGF23 and PTH to urine phosphorus identifies individuals with renal tubules that are resistant to these hormonal signals. Abnormal acid/base homeostasis and incomplete reabsorption of filtered proteins from the urine are additional markers of tubule dysfunction that may also be important for prognosis in persons with CKD. In addition, we have investigated several novel urinary proteins that are specific to renal tubular injury. Among community-living individuals without acute kidney injury, we have observed that higher urine concentrations of two markers (KIM-1 and IL-18) are associated with incident development of CKD and risk of death and heart failure, independent of eGFR or albuminuria. Collectively, these results have led us to hypothesize that an assessment of kidney tubular health that incorporates assessments of tubular dysfunction and injury could develop into a major advance in our assessment and management of CKD. Kidney tubular disease would capture a nonglomerular axis of CKD, and could help identify patients at greatest risk for CKD progression and CVD events. To address these objectives, we propose an ancillary study to the SPRINT trial - a large, NIH-sponsored, multi-center randomized clinical trial testing whether intensive (<120 mmHg) vs. standard (<140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets result in lower CVD events and rates of CKD progression. Among 2,566 SPRINT participants with eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 at baseline, we will: (1) determine the association of kidney tubular dysfunction and injury with risk of CVD events, (2) determine the association of kidney tubular dysfunction and injury with CKD progression, and (3) determine whether randomization to intensive blood pressure management arm of the trial slows progression of kidney tubular dysfunction and injury over time compared with standard blood pressure management."
"9258754","Project Summary  The insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) pathway is highly conserved among animals and is essential for proper metabolism, development, and reproduction. However, IIS activity is also paradoxically variable, resulting in species-specific differences, including body size and fecundity. In humans, IIS heterogeneity may also predispose individuals to certain diseases and disorders. Therefore, an understanding of the broad consequences of differential IIS and its underlying genetic mechanisms will provide insight into development, oogenesis, and disease susceptibility. In Drosophila, IIS is highly divergent between species and, in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia, has been shown to influence fecundity by affecting the number of ovarioles. Utilizing the enormous genetic toolset in the Drosophila ovary, I aim to determine the significance of differential IIS as it pertains to ovariole development in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia. In Aim 1, I will determine the biological significance of differential IIS in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia at the organismal level. By examining life history traits including lifespan, length of development, and stress resistance, I will obtain a comprehensive understanding of how differential IIS broadly affects these species. Moreover, I will measure the active components of the IIS pathway to identify the causal gene(s) that mediate differential IIS. Aim 2 details a plan to find the genetic basis underlying differential IIS between D. melanogaster and D. sechellia by using a multispecies comparative analysis approach to identify regulatory regions that correlate with IIS activity. Coding regions and cis-regulatory regions of candidate genes from D. melanogaster and D. sechellia will be tested for their activity. In Aim 3, I will perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to find IIS-dependent factors that influence ovariole development. The RNAi constructs will encompass components of all known signaling pathways in Drosophila as well as Sirtuins and a subset of meiotic proteins whose mutants show phenotypes similar to those in the IIS pathway. These studies will contribute towards the identification of the genetic mechanisms and IIS-dependent pathways that mediate ovariole formation, fecundity, and overall health."
"9389793","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thymidylate synthase inhibitors are a class of drugs that are widely used for the treatment of various cancers. One effect of these compounds is to increase the levels of uracil bases that are incorporated into newly synthesized genomic DNA. Excessive uracil incorporation into DNA can become toxic to cells, and this is believed to contribute to the ability of thymidylate synthase inhibitors to target rapidly dividing cancer cell. The primary DNA repair enzyme that initiates the base excision repair pathway to correct these uracil lesions in genomic DNA is called the nuclear uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2). We propose a relationship between the uracil excision activity of UNG2 and the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil, a prototypical thymidylate synthase inhibitor. The activity of UNG2 is regulated in part by its localization within the nucleus and its accessibility to sites of DNA damage. Interactions of UNG2 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA) can affect its localization, specifically to the DNA replication fork; therefore, we reason that its ability to excise uracil from newly synthesized DNA during 5-fluorouracil treatment is als dependent on these protein- protein interactions. Specific UNG2 residues within the PCNA and RPA binding domains can be post- translationally modified, and we hypothesize that these post-translational modifications (PTMs) affect UNG2 interactions with these proteins. Post-translational modification of UNG2 is therefore hypothesized to modulate the susceptibility of cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil toxicity by affecting protein-protein interactions and subsequently removal of uracil from DNA. To test our hypotheses, we will use state-of-the-art protein semi- synthesis methods to generate UNG2 variants that have PTMs incorporated at specific residues. The post- translationally modified UNG2 variants will be used in biochemical assays that quantify their activity and their affinities for PCNA and RPA. The structural basis for modulating UNG2 interactions with PCNA and RPA will also be determined. To confirm that PTMs affect protein-protein interactions and the localization of UNG2 in the nucleus, we will use live cell fluorescence imaging of microinjected semi-synthetic UNG2 variants. Finally, the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil will be examined in cells that are transfected with UNG2 mutants that have altered affinities for PCNA and/or RPA. Together, the results of this interdisciplinary projec will address the contribution of a specific set of UNG2 PTMs towards the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil and other thymidylate synthase inhibitors."
"9388682","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A healthy human depends on trillions of cells coordinating their activity for the benefit of the entire multicellular organism. When this regulatd cooperation between cells breaks down, disease occurs. Therefore, the study of the origin and maintenance of animal multicellularity will pave a stronger foundation for understanding the principles underlying a healthy human body. The origin and maintenance of multicellularity can be better understood through studying the primitive multicellularity exhibited by the closest livin relatives of animals-the choanoflagellate class of aquatic protists. The multicellular life stage o the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta was recently found to be induced by a sulfonolipid small molecule (RIF-1) that is produced by the choanoflagellate's bacterial prey Algoriphagus machipongonensis. However, it is still unclear what other multicellularity-inducing molecules are produced by dozens of other Bacteroidetes prey and also how the choanoflagellates respond to these molecules and RIF-1. Unveiling the range of multicellularity-inducing molecules and elucidating their choanoflagellate receptors will further the world's understanding of the foundations of animal multicellularity; therefore, the proposed research specifically aims at these  objectives. First, multicellularity-inducing molecules produced by the marine Bacteroidetes bacteria Zobellia galactanivorans and Zobellia uliginosa will be isolated by extraction from bacterial cell pellets and activity- guided fractionation via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Newly discovered pure multicellularity-inducing molecules will be identified by standard spectroscopic methods. This work will demonstrate the breadth of molecules that induce choanoflagellate multicellularity. Subsequently, the biosynthetic pathways of the discovered multicellularity inducers will be hypothesized bioinformatically and confirmed by deleting the hypothesized biosynthesis genes from the Zobellia species and examining them for an inability to synthesize the target molecules. This uncovering of the genetic basis of multicellularity inducer synthesis will enable studies into the evolution of multicellularity-inducng genes across the bacterial kingdom-including bacteria in the human microbiota. Lastly, the choanoflagellate receptor proteins that bind to multicellularity-inducing molecules will be identified via synthesizing an affinity probe based on RIF-1 and using this probe to enrich for choanoflagellate proteins that bind multicellularity-inducing molecules. The proteins will be identified using mass spectrometry with comparison to the S. rosetta genome sequence. The identification of rosette inducer receptor proteins will enable studies into the evolutionary development and conservation of the proteins that drive multicellularity and respond to bacterial cues in animals. In total, this work will promote the world's understanding of the fundamental principles underlying animal multicellularity by uncovering both a range of new bacterially produced small molecule multicellularity cues and the choanoflagellate receptor proteins that recognize these cues."
"9387881","?    DESCRIPTION:  This application proposes novel investigations of the natural history of injection drug use, from initiation to cessation or death, as well as studies of trends in morbidity and mortality. We propose to undertake this work in Vancouver, Canada, where the steady growth in prescription opiate (PO) misuse has become a growing concern. Accordingly, we also seek to evaluate the impact of PO misuse on the natural history of injection drug use in an environment with an active heroin market, including the impact of PO use on injecting initiation and cessation, HIV risk behavior and overdose. We also aim to characterize early injecting careers and to identify the individual, social-structural and environmental factors that shape injecting initiation, early cessation of injecting, sustained injecting, and HIV risk behavior. Focusing on established injectors, we further aim to describe the individual, social-structural and environmental factors that shape cessation of and relapse into injecting, and associated morbidity and mortality. Our project involves the creation of a unique cohort, the Vancouver Drug Users Study (V-DUS, n = 1800), which involves adults who inject drugs and non-injecting street-involved drug-using youth. Participants provide behavioral information and biological specimens for testing, repository, and use by our team and other NIDA investigators. Members of our multidisciplinary team have more than two decades of experience conducting NIDA-funded cohort-based research, most recently through studies of IDU participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS), which is one of the longest-standing IDU cohort studies in the world, and street-involved drug-using youth participating in the At- Risk Youth Study (ARYS). In order to take advantage of considerable efficiencies, both academic and financial, we propose merging the ARYS and VIDUS cohorts into the Vancouver Drug Users Study (V-DUS), enabling a critical additional five years of investigation into the natural history f injection drug use. Vancouver is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. The city was home to one of the most explosive HIV epidemics ever documented among IDU, and Vancouver is a port of entry for illicit drugs and is now experiencing a PO misuse epidemic. Further, under the province of British Columbia's universal healthcare plan, we are able to link cohort data to various administrative databases, permitting assessments of barriers to care that are free of the confounding effects of medical insurance schemes, and our established multidisciplinary team and other NIDA investigators use our cohort platform to undertake diverse work in the areas of clinical epidemiology, social, spatial, and basic science, as well as modeling and cost-effectiveness studies. Lastly, Vancouver has been the site of the development of a range of innovative programs for IDU and therefore we plan to use this cohort infrastructure to build on our track record of evaluating highly innovative programs for IDU, as well as other naturally occurring events. Through this work, we aim to address several urgent global health challenges and inform the development of policies and interventions that seek to address illicit drug use."
"9378078","A large number of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) utilize cAMP as their second messenger to induce alterations in cell function. In fact, in the same cell several different GPCR can increase cAMP, leading to the question of how the cell interprets the signals from these receptors differently. The concept of cAMP compartmentation, where the second messenger is not generated uniformly throughout the cell, is readily accepted yet poorly understood. We have found that the enzymes that synthesize cAMP, adenylyl cyclases (AC's), are not uniformly distributed through the plasma membrane. Furthermore, GPCR can preferentially couple to certain AC isoforms due to colocalization in lipid rafts. While we have made progress in understanding how specific receptors can couple to certain AC's, little progress has been made in defining the compartments of cAMP inside cells and even less is known about what cellular responses can be modified by different pools of cAMP. One problem has been that common cell models used in the field lack highly compartmentized cAMP pools. We have found that cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells express identifiable cAMP compartments. Furthermore, we can define these compartments based on the isoforms of AC they express. We have observed that signaling by cAMP generated by AC2, but not AC6 or other AC's, leads to the expression of IL-6 by HASM. Moreover, cAMP generated by AC6, but not by AC2, increases expression of somatostatin and stimulates a cell shape change called arborization. Thus, AC2- and AC6-specific responses can be used to define the cAMP signaling compartments in HASM. The goal of this project is to characterize the other components of these two cAMP compartments by using overexpression and knockdown of specific AKAP's and PDE's. Novel AC mutants will be used to manipulate AC localization and function to determine how these pools are assembled. This project proposes novel, multidisciplinary approaches to define the components responsible for establishing and maintaining cAMP signaling compartments. Results will have broad applicability due to the fundamental nature of cAMP signaling, but because a well-differentiated cell model is used, our findings will also have direct relevance to asthma and COPD therapy.

"9309328","ABSTRACT Primary immune deficiencies with impaired cell-mediated cytotoxicity commonly manifest as Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohysticytosis (FHL), a life threatening disorder. FHL is characterized by disproportioned immune response mediated by excessively activated Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTLs), Natural Killer (NK) and macrophages. FHL subjects usually harbor biallelic germline-mutations in genes involved in intracellular membrane trafficking including Syntaxin 11 (STX11, FHL-4) and Syntaxin-Binding Protein 2 (STXBP2, FHL-5). Nonetheless, monoallelic mutations have also been associated in FHL, but their clinical and biological significance remain unclear. Despite evidences linking STX11 and STXBP2 mutations to abnormal CTL and NK cell activity in FHL patients, there is a significant gap in knowledge about the normal function of these proteins and how these mutations impact on cytotoxic activity and ultimately lead to disease. This proposal aims to bridge this gap in knowledge between the genetic findings and the clinical manifestations in FHL-patients by establishing the basic mechanisms through which STX11/STXBP2 cooperate to effect LG exocytosis and by dissecting how they are affected in patient cells. STX11 and STXBP2 physically interact in as yet poorly characterized ways to control the release of lytic granule (LG) content at the immunological synapse. Data from our lab provide evidences that STX11 also interact with different sets of membrane fusion proteins that could mediate distinct trafficking steps. We hypothesize that STX11/STXBP2 control endosome- lysosome trafficking and LG fusion at the plasma membrane through these interactions. We further hypothesize that FHL mutations interfere with these interactions and thus impair cell-mediated cytotoxicity and/or survival signaling, a process that ultimately results in an array of immunological disorders with HLH symptoms. First, we will evaluate how FHL-mutations in STX11 and STXBP2 affect the physical relationship with one another and with other interacting proteins involved in exocytic and endo-lysosomal pathways by using biochemical and Mass Spec approaches in patient cells. We will establish how mutations affect the structural requirements for protein-protein interactions by performing pull-down, liposome co-flotation assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. Second, we will assess the biological significance of both monollelic and biallelic FHL-mutations by investigating the intracellular trafficking defects in FHL-patient cells using super resolution STED and TIRF microscopy. Moreover, we will establish the molecular mechanisms of action of these mutations by using a unique in-vitro fusion assay develop in our lab. In summary, our studies will contribute more broadly to our understanding of the membrane trafficking steps that control cell killing pathways in CTL and NK cells, help in therapeutic decisions for patients carrying monoallelic mutations, establish common and gene-specific pathways affected in wide range of genetic disorders that share some manifestations of HLH symptoms and aid in the development of new tools for rapid diagnostic."
"9233791","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region of cerebral cortex in the medial temporal lobe that is frequently involved in epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Interestingly, DG neurogenesis is extremely prolonged relative to other cortical areas, and depends on migrations of progenitor cells within the dentate migration stream (DMS) and other transient neurogenic niches. Previous studies from the PI's lab have shown that one type of cortical progenitor cells, known as intermediate progenitors (IPs) or transit-amplifying cells, specifically express Tbr2, a T-box transcription factor, during DG development as well as adult neurogenesis. New preliminary data show that Tbr2+ IPs plays major roles in transient neurogenic niches and dentate migration streams that are essential to morphogenesis of the dentate gyrus. For example, Tbr2+ IPs appear to pioneer the DMS and enhance the subsequent migration of neural stem cell (NSC)-like radial glial progenitors (RGPs). Aims 1 and 2 of this project will analyze transient DG niches and cell migrations in mice, and determine the roles of RGPs and IPs in gyrogenesis (development of convoluted cortex). Aim 3 extends these approaches to characterize DG malformations in mutant mice with defects of IP or radial glial progenitor (RGP) differentiation."
"9387989","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin D levels vary seasonally with sunlight availability and with differences in diet. Seasonal variation of vitamin D levels is especially apparent at high latitudes where adequate sunlight may not be available, such as in Yup'ik Alaska Native communities living within the Arctic Circle (66°33'N). Previous research has shown that a traditional diet high in marine-mammals and fish may contribute to the high levels of vitamin D in Yup'ik people, but recent trends show that the traditional diet intake is declining  due to shifts to more Westernized foods, and this may result in vitamin D deficiency in Yup'ik young adults. Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread public health problem that is linked to increased risk for cancer, heart disease, and many other conditions. Despite evidence that variability in vitamin D (25(OH)D3) concentration is heritable, the current genetic literature only  explains a small percentage of the heritability. This proposal seeks to identify and characterize genetic variation in vitamin D metabolism and regulatory genes and to look for associations with serum vitamin D (25(OH)D3) levels and traditional diet in a cross-section of Yup'ik Alaska Native volunteers. To this end, I propose to apply novel technologies to identify genomic sources of serum 25(OH)D3 variability and to explore Yup'ik people's perceptions, understandings, and expectations for research involving genomic medicine. These findings will advance our understanding of vitamin D insufficiency; identify the facilitators and barriers to genomic research involving Yup'ik people; and position academic research collaborators to address current and future health priorities and concerns with precision medicine technologies in Alaska Native people."
"9405713","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a large body of evidence linking zinc deficiency and pneumonia. Zinc is an essential nutrient for both humans and bacterial pathogens, but up to one third of the world population does not consume sufficient dietary zinc. The World Health Organization has estimated that zinc deficiency contributes to up to 16% of all lower respiratory globally, and a pooled analysis of randomized studies found that zinc supplementation reduced pneumonia incidence by 41%. Zinc is important for regulating the immune system, partly through direct sensing of intracellular zinc levels by immunoregulators. Additionally, the host immune protein calprotectin sequesters zinc from bacterial pathogens, suppressing their growth and dissemination. In the United States, certain populations are at increased risk for zinc deficiency and infection by the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. Because zinc acquisition is critical to A. baumannii during pneumonia pathogenesis, we reasoned that it could serve as a model for defining the molecular mechanisms by which zinc deficiency increases pneumonia susceptibility. Preliminary data from our laboratory demonstrated that zinc deficiency significantly increases mortality from A. baumannii pneumonia by 24 hours post infection. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that mortality caused by A. baumannii pneumonia in zinc deficient mice is due to altered zinc homeostasis, which causes dysregulation of the innate immune response and enhanced bacterial virulence. The experiments proposed will integrate in vitro and in vivo studies linking zinc deficiency and inflammation caused by A. baumannii infection. In Specific Aim 1, human lung epithelial cells will be analyzed for differential responses to A. baumannii exposure based on zinc status using an innovative and high throughput mass spectrometry assay platform. Specific Aim 2 will determine the effect of zinc nutritional status on A. baumannii pneumonia by elemental and immunological analysis of the host. In Specific Aim 3, we propose to identify bacterial genes important for the observed enhanced mortality using a high throughput transposon sequencing strategy. This integrated approach will define molecular links between zinc deficiency and pneumonia and has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of nutritional determinants of infectious disease."

The resource includes comprehensive annotation of treatment exposure, ongoing longitudinal follow-up and an established biorepository, from which genotyping (SNP array) and sequencing (whole exome) of almost 6,000 survivors will be available for investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment-induced late effects. Extensive use by the research community has resulted in: 264 published or in press manuscripts now cited over 12,600 times; 229 presented abstracts; 42 investigator-initiated grants, totaling $37.1 million in funding; utilization by a diverse group of 673 investigators; training of 63 young investigators; conduct of six randomized trials; increased knowledge to inform exposure-based clinical care guidelines; and a highly successful model for multiple national and international collaborative initiatives of pediatric cancer survivorship research. During the next five years, activities will focus on maintaining, enhancing and promoting use of this singular resource. The overarching goal of the CCSS resource is to increase the conduct of innovative and high impact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship."
"9195707","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The in utero environment experienced by a fetus can have significant impacts on an infant's growth    trajectory. Although there is epidemiological evidence linking the uterine environment and growth in early infancy, there remains a poor understanding of the impact maternal infection and/or placental inflammation may have on growth, particularly during early childhood. Herein, we aim to evaluate the impact of maternal infection on nutrient transport across the placenta and fetal metabolic hormone production, as two potential mechanistic links between a compromised uterine environment and subsequent growth during early childhood. We hypothesize that these mechanisms contribute to poor linear growth and nutritional status in early childhood both through reduced birth weight and continued influences ex utero. Human schistosomiasis infects 200 million individuals, including 40 million women of childbearing age, and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in areas where the parasite is endemic. We have shown that schistosome infection in humans results in a pro-inflammatory response at the maternal-fetal interface, and may have a detrimental impact on birth weight of the affected offspring. This proposal is novel in its ability to link insults experienced in utero, even in the absence of gross infection of the placenta or fetus, to development of metabolic responses and infant growth. This will be achieved by leveraging well characterized samples and outcomes from an NIH funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment during pregnancy, as well as recruiting a new cohort of pregnant women. The overall research hypothesis is that S. japonicum infection during pregnancy impairs nutrient availability and metabolic profiles in utero, resulting in growth restricted offspring and disadvantaged newborns for subsequent growth. The potential impacts of schistosomiasis during the initial stages of gestation and consequences for fetal growth will be rigorously evaluated through completion of three aims: 1) comparison of transporter expression and amino acid levels in the placenta and cord blood from women ± PZQ, 2) comparison of the metabolic hormone profiles at 6 and 12 months of age between infants from pregnancies ±PZQ, and 3) recruitment of a new cohort of mother-infant pairs to examine the impact of maternal schistosomiasis as well as other helminth infections on metabolic profiles and growth in the offspring up to two years of age. Placental biopsies, maternal, infant blood and maternal milk are available from the RCT and a    follow-up Thrasher Foundation grant. In addition, the initiation of a new cohort of pregnant women residing in the same endemic region of the Philippines will allow for direct linkage of infection status throughout gestation and growth characteristics through the first two years of life. Innovative techniques including laser capture microscopy (LCM), quantitative PCR, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), ELISA, and placental perfusion will provide quantifiable answers to these research questions. Completion of all three aims will 1) highlight nutritional deficiencies experienced in utero in the context of schistosomiasis, 2) establish a precedent for altered metabolic hormonal control during initial insult and into the first year of life, and 3) evaluate the impact of maternal helminth infection during gestation on fetal growth in a longitudinal manner with direct comparison to pregnancies not complicated by schistosomiasis at the time of conception. My background in placental biology and molecular biology, coupled with my postdoctoral training in global health has created a solid foundation for this proposal. Under the tutelage of four mentors providing distinct expertise to support my career development, I will apply basic science techniques and questions to field-based    global health research in order to make a significant and novel contribution to the area of maternal-fetal health. This will be accomplished by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) conducting complex overseas field projects, 2) epidemiology and applied biostatistics, and 3) parasitology and reproductive biology. Specifically, I will spend significant time in the field under the guidance of mentors, collecting samples and initiating a new population-based study. Additional training will be obtained through a rigorous plan of coursework, seminars, international meetings and one-on-one training sessions with mentors specific to their areas of expertise. The proposed research experiences will prepare me to achieve my longterm career goal of becoming a productive, independent investigator making meaningful contributions to the field of maternal-fetal health. It is expected that the completion f the proposed studies will lead to additional grant submissions, including an R01 application. I benefit from an exceptionally strong research environment in which I will complete the proposed studies. The Center for International Health Research (CIHR) has an excellent track record in training junior faculty for successful independent careers in global health. In addition, the outstanding, established collaboration between CIHR and the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in the Philippines will allow me to experience all aspects of overseas field studies in a productive environment with highly trained staff. The full support of Rhode Island Hospital, as well as mentors at both Women and Infants Hospital and Brown University will round out a research environment in which both global and reproductive health research are institutional priorities and will further strengthen the training experience delineated in this proposal."
"9401848","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MARK/PAR1 kinases occupy critical signaling nodes in the development of higher organisms, and have been linked to a plethora of disease states including Autism, Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the structural and functional role of the kinase-associated 1 (KA1) domain, which resides at the C-terminus of MARK/PAR1 and related kinases. This module has recently been shown to interact with both phospholipid and protein ligands, but has also been proposed to provide an autoinhibitory function for the attached kinase domain. Preliminary studies have established that a separately purified KA1 module does bind the MARK1 kinase domain and can inhibit activity in vitro. We hypothesize that kinase autoinhibition is relieved upon binding o the KA1 domain to lipid and/or protein ligands and plan to rigorously assess these features of MARK/PAR1 kinases. The aims of this project are to (i) fully characterize the interaction between the MARK1 kinase and KA1 domains through a battery of structural and biophysical methods and, and (ii) establish a functional role for the KA1 domain in MARK1 activity by in vitro kinetic and in vivo cell-based methods, including determination of whether exposure to lipid or protein ligands of this domain disrupt autoinhibition and activate the kinase. These studies will shed light onto how varied inputs from lipid or protein ligands can lead to kinase regulation, and will provide the groundwork for design of specific allosteric inhibitors of MARK/PAR1 kinases."
"9313692","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methane is a prevalent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. While synthetically it is difficult to chemically convert methane to  less environmentally harmful substances, methanotrophic bacteria have developed an efficient way to metabolize methane. In the first step of the process, methanotrophs use a copper dependent enzyme complex called particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) to convert methane to methanol, but precisely how this occurs biochemically and how pMMO may be regulated are not well understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to characterize a protein called pmoD that is also likely involved in methane conversion and may somehow regulate pMMO. In one component of this work the phenotype of pmoD will be studied using a pmoD knockout strain. A second aspect of the work will focus on structural, biochemical, and spectroscopic characterization of pmoD. The third aim addresses the function of pmoD by determining whether it can interact with other proteins involved in copper metabolism and methane conversion and whether it can regulate these processes. Together, this combination of in'vivo studies, structural characterization, and biochemical analysis is expected to provide a comprehensive description of pmoD and its roles in methane metabolism and copper regulation. The insights gained from these studies have the potential to greatly enhance the current understanding of biological methane oxidation.

"9407422","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new antibiotics continues to grow more dire. Natural products from microbial sources have supplied the major pipeline for novel antibiotics, but traditional discovery efforts have yielded diminishing returns over the last severl decades, necessitating new approaches. This proposal uses the powerful approach of aligning chemical ecology with natural product discovery, exploiting the highly productive chemistry of bacteria associated with fungus-farming ants. These highly specialized ant-associated bacteria are thought to defend their niche using antibiotics against closely related competitors. The chemical basis of this antagonism has not been explored and is the foundation of this project. The first aim of this project is to screen ant-associated bacteria to identify antibacterial activiy and other chemically mediated interactions. Second, the molecules responsible for this activity will be identified and characterized. Genome sequencing will connect these active molecules to their biosynthetic gene clusters and also reveal which additional clusters are present but silent - that is, no corresponding metabolites are observed. These cryptic biosynthetic clusters are a near-universal feature of bacterial genomes and are a major opportunity for antibiotic discovery. The third aim uses ecologically inspired co-culturing approaches to supply missing chemical cues that elicit production of some of these cryptic metabolites. These chemical inducers of antibiotic production will be identified, tested for general utility, and applied to elicit additioal cryptic metabolites."
"9197297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A meaningful Summer Research Experience in a bioengineering laboratory at a major research university can enhance the knowledge of a high school pre-engineering or science teacher, making it possible to more effectively convey the nature of the scientific process in bioengineering to his or her students. In combination with guided instruction in Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards-aligned curricula design, the laboratory research can be more effectively translated and applied in high school science classrooms. The Bioengineering Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is ideally positioned to implement such a combined experience for Chicago high school teachers, which in turn would have a dramatic impact on one of the most diverse group of young learners in the country, who are our next generation of bioengineers. Our Research Education Plan includes a six-week intensive on-campus summer research experience in a bioengineering laboratory under the guidance of one of thirteen research-active core bioengineering faculty mentors, that is preceded by regular spring meetings to optimize the research project in advance and encourage the program participant to prepare in earnest for the summer-intensive experience, through a combination of reading assignments, online protocol training and other activities specific to the project. Several of these faculty members already have experience mentoring high school science teachers via an NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Teachers program administered by UIC Bioengineering for the past 10 years. In partnership with faculty from the UIC College of Education who are recognized experts in curriculum design and teaching in secondary education, and in particular, teaching of secondary science in urban schools, this program also provides guided instruction to help the teacher-participants incorporate their research experience and learning into their classroom. Illinois adopted the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in 2010 and the Next Generation Science Standards in 2014, which outline the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn throughout their K-12 education. Because of the rapid introduction, adoption, and implementation of the CCSS, many districts and teachers have found themselves searching for quality curriculum aligned to the CCSS; this presents a golden opportunity to make a major impact. But, as summer research experience programs aim to build long-term collaborative partnerships with STEM teachers by involving them in research and introducing them to the most current developments in engineering and science, it is also critical to provide them guidance on how to translate their experience to their own classrooms. Thus, in addition to bioengineering laboratory research opportunities in diverse areas including regenerative medicine, precision medicine, rehabilitation engineering, bionanomaterials and biomedical imaging, we will provide in-depth participant-tailored curricular mentoring via weekly workshops that will focus on principles of effective planning, instruction, and assessment to be directly connected to teachers' classroom curriculum."
"9258847","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. 1"
"9414124","Despite significance advances in anti-retroviral treatments, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains prevalent, and can affect a broad range of everyday activities. An effective brief cognitive screen that could be implemented in busy HIV clinics, where clinicians have limited time to provide care for patients with complex medical, psychiatric, and cognitive conditions, has the potential to significantly impact patient care, in terms of both identifying patients who may warrant additional treatment considerations as well as the potential to track changes in cognition over time. Unfortunately, current brief cognitive screens have lacked sensitivity to the generally mild and mild-to-moderate deficits associated with modern HAND. Phase I saw the development of a brief, iPad-based cognitive screening tool that could be self-administered, and exhibited good validity (relative to a gold-standard neuropsychological (NP) test battery) and test-retest reliability. The 4-test combination, taking only 6 minutes to complete, produced very good classification accuracy, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values all approximately 80%.  The aims of Phase II are to 1) enhance the technical capabilities and usability of the iPad-based cognitive screen for both patients and clinicians, 2) improve the clinical relevance of the iPad-based cognitive screening tool, and 3) establish the clinical utility of the revised tool.  To accomplish these aims, we will improve the existing interface by creating a revised dashboard based upon input from senior clinicians and adapt it to present results in a user-friendly and easily interpretable manner, and add additional brief questions address mood and problems with everyday functioning. In year 1 we will develop demographically-adjusted norms based upon 125 healthy adults, including norms for 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments in order to optimize the tool for use in monitoring patients over time. In year 2 we will implement this new, normed tool in HIV clinics in both San Diego and collaborating clinics in the United States. At least 150 HIV+ participants will complete the iPad measure in clinics, and at a 6-month (or clinic visit approximating that time) follow-up. A subset of these individuals (n = 100) will also provide more detailed neuropsychological data captured during a clinic or research-based evaluation. We will then assess the effectiveness of the tool in detecting HIV-related cognitive impairments based upon a gold-standard assessment.  As a result of this project we will have a fully functional, validated and marketable brief screening measure for evaluating patient cognition, improving HIV patient care, facilitating future studies of HAND and its treatment, and which will position Digital Artefacts in a key leadership role in the development of user- and clinician-friendly screening measures for HAND, as well as potentially other neurologic conditions."
"9406902","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of this Program is to prepare a cadre of outstanding cancer epidemiologists through rigorous academic training in research methodology and the epidemiology and biology of cancer, and mentored research. Additional emphasis is placed on molecular and genetic epidemiology methods and applications. A distinguished faculty provides a variety of substantial opportunities for research experience. There are three types of trainees: Doctoral Candidates in Epidemiology includes pre-doctoral candidates either with or without a prior doctoral degree (generally clinicians) who undertake 2-3 years of coursework, in addition to research, in the course of earning a doctoral degree in Epidemiology; Clinical Researchers include physicians with specialty training in cancer preparing for careers in clinical epidemiology who undertake a one year Master's degree program in methodology followed by a year of research; and Post- doctoral Fellows who hold a prior doctoral degree in Epidemiology or in Biology and undertake mentored research (and with coursework if needed) in preparation for an academic career. Those trainee positions are generally awarded for 2 or 3 years. The number of trainee positions requested includes five pre-doctoral students and seven post-doctoral fellows, for a total of 12 trainees. The program had supported 16 trainees since 1998, but at the behest of the NIH project officer, we have reduced the requested number to 12. The Program is based in the Department of Epidemiology of the Harvard School of Public Health, and is also affiliated with the Channing Division of Network Medicine in the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital. A dedicated molecular epidemiology laboratory is available. This proposal continues a long history of excellence in training in cancer epidemiology at Harvard University; the current training program is now in its 37th year, with an outstanding record of achievement in training."
"9197698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive operations performed by the human brain and is fundamentally multisensory: when conversing with someone, we use both visual information from their face and auditory information from their voice. Multisensory speech perception is especially important when the auditory component of the speech is noisy, either due to a hearing disorder or normal aging. However, much less is known about the neural computations underlying visual speech perception than about those underlying auditory speech perception. To remedy this gap in existing knowledge, we will use converging evidence from two complementary measures of brain activity, BOLD fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG). The results of these neural recording studies will be interpreted in the context of a flexible computational model based on the emerging tenet that the brain performs multisensory integration using optimal or Bayesian inference, combining the currently available sensory information with prior experience.  In the first Aim, a Bayesian model will be constructed to explain individual differences in multisensory speech perception along three axes: subjects' ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech; subjects' susceptibility to the McGurk effect, a multisensory illusion; and the time spent fixating the mouth of a talking face.  In the second Aim, we will explore the neural encoding of visual speech using voxel-wise forward encoding models of the BOLD fMRI signal. We will develop encoding models to test 7 different theories of visual speech representation from the linguistic and computer vision literature. In the third Aim, we will use ECoG to examine the neural computations for integrating visual and auditory speech, guided by the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. First, we will study reduced neural variability for multisensory speech predicted by our model. Second, we will study the representational space of unisensory and multisensory speech."

"9402846","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is relentlessly progressive and despite effective symptomatic therapy in the early stages of the illness most patients have substantial morbidity and disability. There is an urgent need to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of PD so that more effective symptomatic therapies and ultimately preventive therapies can be developed. Our hypothesis is that a-synuclein, parkin and LRRK2 contribute to a complex signaling network that results in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease and related disorders. The center will approach this hypothesis in a multidisciplinary manner. The center represents a multi-disciplinary, mechanistic approach involving interactive, productive investigators with complementary areas of expertise who have long been committed to studies of neurodegenerative diseases. Our center will integrate diverse advanced technologies within the center to accelerate discovery. It will work collaboratively within the Udall Center Network to  accelerate discovery of disease, new therapies and disease and progression biomarkers. Through the integration of the activities of the various disciplines, the interrelationships will result in a greater scientific contribution than could be achieved if each project or center investigation were pursued individually. The Johns Hopkins Udall Center will serve as a local and national resource for PD research including broad sharing of data and clinical and biospecimen resources and fostering community outreach activities. We will provide and coordinate training of young investigators in the pathogenesis and study of Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's syndromes. The Johns Hopkins Udall Center is focused on understanding the interrelationship between parkin (Project 1), the most common cause of autosomal recessive PD, ?-synuclein (Project 2), which is causal in sporadic PD and LRRK2 (Project 4), the most common cause of autosomal dominant PD and to use our discoveries to develop disease and progression markers (Project 3) and ultimately new therapies. The insights into how these three genes interact in the pathogenesis of PD and the discovery of biomarkers would not be possible without the Udall Center structure as it enables the evaluation of these major causes of PD and the ability to evaluate findings in each arm of PD to elucidate common pathways if they exist as these may provide the best opportunities for comprehensive new therapies and biomarkers. We believe that our multi-disciplinary approach has the capacity to produce unique information concerning the mechanisms of neuronal injury in animal models of PD that will lead to a better understanding of the function and the role of ?-synuclein, parkin, and LRRK2 in normal and pathophysiologic processes related to PD."
"9195754","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting over 5 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness, stroke and even death. Recent advances in mapping techniques have revealed that spiral waves, similar to electrical spinning tops, are present in the vast majority of AF patients.It was found that these spiral waves do not migrate throughout the atrial chambers but remain in a confined and stable spatial location. What is not clear, and limiting our ability to improve therap for AF, is how these stable spiral waves disorganize and cause AF. This project will test the novel hypothesis that structural components of the atrial tissue are responsible for the spatial stability of the spiral waves and that the disorganization is caused by 'functional' properties of the heart that occur at the level of cells. We will address this hypothesis using a combined theoretical/clinical approach that employs advanced multiscale computational techniques and state-of-the-art clinical mapping. We will 1) determine using computational simulations how structural properties of heart tissue can prevent spiral waves from migrating throughout the atria; 2) determine how drugs affect the migration and disorganization of spiral waves; 3) create patient-specific digital computer models to test possible causes of AF. The patient-specific digital computer models that we will create in this project will be among the most detailed and clinically-relevant in the field, and can be used by others to understand the disease and help design better therapy. This project is significant because it will establish new mechanisms for human atrial fibrillation, potentially resulting in novel therapies to eliminate AF. Understanding AF at this level may also allow a more rational approach to drug development and gene therapy. This project will be performed in patients during electrophysiologic study, so that its results can be translated directly to practice."
"9296153","We propose to renew funding for the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry  (IMS) at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN. The previous funding cycle has been  extremely successful in both advancing IMS technology and applying it to cutting edge biological projects. In  this renewal, we seek to advance the technology to provide next generation capabilities that will encompass  sub-micron spatial resolution, ultra-high sensitivity, and ease of use tools that will be made available to the  non-expert investigator. This proposal contains two overarching aims. First, it proposes to pioneer novel  instrument technologies, sample preparation devices and methods, and data analysis/image informatics  solutions. The latter is a critical need for current research grade IMS instrumentation, and it will be essential for  next-generation instruments.. Second, this proposal seeks to simplify the entire imaging process that currently  requires expertise and significant time to get high quality, meaningful results. Achievement of these global  aims is important to bring this technology into the biological and clinical laboratory.   The proposed Technology Research & Development (TRD) program will provide performance  improvements that will meet many of the current needs of the user community. Specific TRD advancements  will focus on maximizing instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution. We will also develop specialty reagents  and methodologies designed to enhance sensitivity, molecular specificity, and preserve the location of  biomolecules during sample preparation and analysis. We propose to develop a next generation imaging mass  spectrometer for routine use that is capable of achieving 500 nm spatial resolution at high sensitivity.  Additionally, we will develop software capable of co-registering and viewing imaging data from multiple  modalities such as IMS and microscopy through an image fusion process. Finally, we will develop new  advanced bio-computational algorithms to mine imaging data for molecular patterns and to normalize images  from large datasets. These developing advanced technologies will be focused on important driving biomedical  projects (DBPs) in infectious disease, eye disease, diabetes, and cancer.   Important activities of the Resource include: selected collaborations with investigators who have NIH  sponsored research projects that would significantly benefit from the developing IMS technology. This includes  high spatial resolution imaging, high mass resolving power instrumentation and advanced data analysis and  informatics capabilities. Training and dissemination of the technology will continue to be accomplished through  a yearly on-site four day training course termed AIMS (Advanced Imaging Mass Spectrometry). In addition,  training and dissemination will occur through hosting individual visiting investigators, students, and fellows, and  through publication of the research outcomes for both the technology and its applications, and from individual  invited research lectures presented by the faculty of the Resource."
"9258215","Many human diseases, collectively called ?ciliopathies?, are caused by the dysregulation of cilia and ciliary signaling and often present with neurological defects. Development pathways such as Hedgehog and WNT are modulated by the cilium and are deeply involved in neural development. Further, recent evidence suggests that cilia and ciliary signaling respond to chemical and mechanical cues as environmental ?sensors?. Here, we propose to study a unique function of cilia in zebrafish spinal cord development. The Isacoff laboratory recently discovered that VALopA, a non-visual G-protein linked opsin, expressed in the zebrafish spinal cord and suppressed neural activity and locomotive movement when activated. Recent results have showed the VALopA localizes to cilia in the spinal cord, likely in motor neurons. These results suggest that motor neurons in the spinal cord may integrate light signals through VALopA and modulate neural and circuit development. I will utilize motor neuron specific Gal4 fish lines and VALopA CRISPR knock-out fish lines (currently available in the lab), live in vivo imaging with biosensors, superresolution in vivo imaging, pharmacological analysis, and electrophysiology to probe if and how light can function through cilia in spinal cord neurons to influence neural and circuit development.  My specific aims are as follows:  Aim 1: Direct sensory signaling through cilia in motor neurons.  Aim 2: Ciliary GPCR signaling: gating neuronal activity. Aim 3: Ciliary GPCR signaling: gating the ciliary beat.  The phenomenon that a non-visual opsin in cilia could turn motor neurons into light sensitive cells, would represent a new mechanism for neural circuit modulation and development. This could also suggest a broader function of cilia in the nervous system: to serve as environmental sensors that mediate circuit development and tune circuit activity. These results could also inform future studies on the neurological defects caused by cilia dysregulation."
"9299483","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cryptosporidium parasites, most commonly Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum, cause chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS, and are the second most common cause of life threatening diarrhea in children under one year of age. The currently available drug treatments for immunocompromised people and young children with cryptosporidiosis are poor, and drug development is complicated by a very rudimentary experimental system in which Cryptosporidium cannot even be continually cultivated in vitro. This project addresses both the need for new drug leads and the need for a continuous culture system. The hypothesis is that Cryptosporidium asexual-to-sexual stage differentiation can be targeted to develop both new treatments and tool compounds that enable continuous in vitro cultivation of the asexual forms of the parasite. This hypothesis is based on two facts: 1) that both the asexual and sexual replication cycles of Cryptosporidium occur in a single host with oocyst sporulation occurring in situ, which yields immediately infectious oocysts leading to chronic auto-infection in compromised patients; and 2) that, at least in vitro, the asexual type I meront forms of the parasite all develop into late-stage type II meronts that are committed to undergoing sexual differentiation. Interference with sexual differentiation at late-stages is predicted to block auto-infection and result in cure, and interference with differentiation at early-stages is predicted to prevent differentiation to the committed, type II meront and enable continuous culture of the asexual forms. Data describing a novel biomarker, a high content imaging assay method for C. parvum sexual differentiation, and identification of one differentiation inhibitor are presented. Additional inhibitors will be identified in aim1 by screening a library of biologically active, drug-like compounds. In aim 2, compounds will be classified as potentially useful as drug development starting points or as tool compounds to achieve culture synchronization and/or continuous culture. The effects of compounds on Cryptosporidium will then be characterized using transmission electron microscopy, a C. parvum tissue culture development assay, an in vitro pharmacodynamics assay, and a NOD SCID gamma mouse model of chronic cryptosporidiosis. Completion of these studies is expected to determine the utility of targeting Cryptosporidium differentiation, to yield well characterized small molecules drug leads and tool compounds, and, if the hypothesis is correct, to yield a simple method for continual cultivation of Cryptosporidium."
"9233658","Heart failure affects ~3% of the adults and 37% of the Medicare population, and is the second leading cause for hospitalization within VA medical centers after psychiatric illness. A hallmark of patients suffering from chronic heart failure is dysautonomia, characterized by increased sympathetic tone and diminished parasympathetic tone. The importance of this autonomic imbalance is highlighted by the remarkable benefits in morbidity and mortality with the use of ?-adrenergic receptor blockers. In fact, all of our most effective pharmacological therapies to treat heart failure are targeted toward the efferent limbs of these aberrant neurohormonal pathways. However, no new proven effective drugs to treat heart failure have come forth in last couple of decades. How can we expand our therapies? We propose that targeting the triggers ? in particular the molecular receptors within the sensory neurons ? that initiate these pathological reflexes presents a novel strategy to abrogate the dysautonomia associated with heart failure. In fact, recent studies have shown that inhibiting the sensory pathways that trigger this dysautonomia can have beneficial effects on this autonomic imbalance, and improve cardiovascular function in animal models of heart failure. However, very little is known about these sensors at the molecular level. We and others have shown that acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are highly expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac afferents, and within the carotid body, where they sense metabolic changes associated with ischemia and exercise, and initiate reflexes to maintain homeostasis. Accordingly, we have preliminary data demonstrating that ASICs are required for normal maximal exercise capacity in mice, and in Aim 1 we will define the mechanism by which ASICs contribute to exercise in health. However, these same sensory pathways are exaggerated in heart failure, and have been shown to contribute to the chronic associated dysautonomia. Thus, we hypothesize that ASICs are major contributors to this autonomic imbalance, and could serve as molecular targets to treat heart failure. Consistent with this hypothesis, our preliminary data indicate that ASICs in skeletal muscle afferents have altered biophysical properties in a mouse model of heart failure. Moreover, we have preliminary data showing that the deleterious cardiac remodeling that occurs after myocardial infarction is abrogated in ASIC knockout mice. The Aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine the mechanisms by which ASICs contribute to exercise physiology; and 2) determine the contribution of ASICs to the dysautonomia associated with heart failure. Understanding the beneficial role of ASICs during an acute stressor in health (exercise) is crucial to understanding their potential pathological role in a chronic stress condition (heart failure). Our studies will provide a better understanding of the molecular sensors that trigger dysautonomia, and could therefore lead to a novel means to treat heart failure, and possibly other chronic cardiovascular diseases."
"9402239","Project Summary Protein binding events are essential to most cell functions and often lead to disease when disrupted. Of particular interest here are very high affinity protein interactions with dissociation constants (Kd) in the femtomolar range. The physical origin of the large binding free energy involved in these interactions is not well understood. In the literature, these extreme affinities have been largely ascribed to enthalpic contributions (structural interactions) and the hydrophobic effect (entropy of water). In preliminary results with barnase:barstar, one of the highest affinity protein-protein interactions known, we found that this view is incomplete. Recently, the Wand laboratory has developed a ?conformational entropy meter? that is able to quantitatively relate measurements of fast (ps-ns) dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains to the conformational entropy. Conceptually, the approach relies on the idea that the motion indirectly reports on the distribution of microstates accessible to the system. Our initial study of the high affinity barnase:barstar complex reveals an unprecedented role for conformational entropy. A widespread increase in fast motions occurs upon formation of the complex, particularly in regions distant from the binding interface. This corresponds to a large and favorable change in conformational entropy upon binding of about -18 kcal/mol. It follows that we should be able to decrease the binding affinity of extremely high affinity complexes by restricting motions in barnase:barstar. To test this, intramolecular disulfide bridges will be introduced in both proteins to rigidify the structures (akin to molecular stapling). The effect on global thermodynamics will be studied by calorimetry. Affinties in the very high regime will be measured by a competitive inhibition kinetics assay. Successful candidates with decreased affinity will be studied using NMR relaxation methods to measure dynamics of the backbone and methyl-bearing sides chains. The ?conformational entropy meter? will be used to interpret quantitatively the changes in motion as changes in T?Sconf. Furthermore, the generality of this approach will be evaluated by using the same strategy to study other extreme affinity complexes, such as the bacterial cognate protein complex E9:Im9 (Kd ~ 10 M). Lastly, the total binding entropy of barnase:barstar -15 has been reported as near-zero. This means that the contribution we find of -18 kcal/mol from T?Sconf must be compensated by a similar but unfavorable contribution from solvent entropy. This is consistent with the ~20 water molecules seen trapped at the interface in the crystal structure. To test whether these waters exist in solution and are truly constrained, reverse micelle technology will be used to trap single proteins with only a few layers of water. Confinement in reverse micelles allows tracking of the protein-water interaction times and will reveal the slowed dynamics of water molecules trapped at the barnase:barstar interface. This work will directly evaluate the role of conformational entropy in the formation of very high affinity protein complexes."
"9316213","PROJECT SUMMARY  Infectious disease is a major threat to human health worldwide. The emergence of antibiotic resistance pathogens necessitates the development of new drugs to treat infection. A fundamental challenge in developing antibiotics is that many pathogens replicate inside host cells rendering them inaccessible to antimicrobial agents. Critical processes for pathogen growth in host cells represent the most promising new targets for therapeutic intervention. Thus, a systematic strategy to identify virulence mechanisms central to establishing growth within the host cell and avoiding killing by host defenses is paramount for defining new targets for therapeutic intervention.  Through specialized secretion systems, many intracellular pathogens deploy an arsenal of proteins termed effectors that modulate numerous host cell processes to establish growth. Loss of function of the secretion machinery restricts pathogen survival and replication demonstrating a critical role for effectors in disease. Despite the importance of effectors, very little is known about the events that determine when individual effectors are deployed or their individual contributions during infection. This can largely be attributed to the inability to monitor effector populations in host cells due to low endogenous levels that are undetectable by standard biochemical techniques and redundancy amongst effectors whereby loss of any individual effector does not result in a discernible phenotype. Innovative approaches that overcome the limitations of classic genetic and biochemical approaches are necessary to further our understanding of effector-mediated virulence mechanisms employed by pathogens.  BioID is a powerful biochemical technique used to define protein-protein interactions. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt BioID to examine the interactions of bacterial virulence proteins in the context of an infection. Using Legionella pathogenesis as a model system, we will apply this technology to define molecular events central to effector translocation, targeting and function. Our BioID-based experimental system will allow several key questions central to the infection process to be addressed that cannot be resolved using currently available methodologies: 1) What are the host targets of individual effectors? 2) How are effectors distributed once they enter the host cell? 3) When are individual effectors secreted and into which host cell types? 4) What are the signals that trigger effectors selection for secretion? Once established, this technology will be broadly applicable to the study of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms and provide a foundation for defining critical events in disease that is crucial to developing new strategies for therapeutic intervention."
"9204431","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that intermediate oligomers of the microtubule-associated protein tau are more neurotoxic in tauopathies than densely packed ?-sheet fibrils. However, this remains unproven because relevant mechanisms to trap distinct assemblies of tau aggregates have been lacking. Here we will fill these gaps in our knowledge by using the Hsp90/co-chaperone machinery to control tau structure and assembly to prove how tau aggregate structure relates to its toxicity. Our team showed that tau physically interacts with the chaperone Hsp90, providing the first 3-dimensional structure of a client complexed with Hsp90. While Hsp90 levels are largely static in the aging brain, a group of co-chaperones that can interface with tau through Hsp90 are much more dynamic; some rise and others fall during a lifetime. We have found that Hsp90 and one of the rising co-chaperones, the cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), coordinate to provoke tau pathogenesis by reducing tau ?-sheet amyloidosis. This corresponded with increased oligomerization and neurotoxicity in tau transgenic mice. Thus, we speculate that the Hsp90 complex controls whether tau aggregates into toxic or benign species depending on the associated co- chaperones. In fact, we now have evidence that just as FKBP51 levels increase in the aging brain, so do the levels of a second Hsp90-associated PPIase, cyclophilin 40 (CyP40/PPID), to an even greater extent than FKBP51. And just like FKBP51, CyP40 reduces tau aggregation and produces amorphous intermediates. Now, we have also discovered that two other co-chaperones, Aha1 and FKBP52, which decrease in the aging brain, actually enhance the ?-sheet propensity of tau. With these tools, we can now test the hypothesis that tau toxicity arises due to structural changes in tau assemblies brought on by the Hsp90/co-chaperone system. To test this, we will determine if Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes that promote tau oligomer formation inevitably lead to toxicity. We will then determine if Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes that stimulate tau amyloidosis prevent its toxicity. Lastly we will determine the impact of Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes that favor tau amyloid or oligomer production on functional deficits in a mouse model of tauopathy. We anticipate that we will identify ways to regulate tau aggregation using the dynamic Hsp90 complex, which will allow us to home in on structures of toxic tau intermediates. We also will determine whether distinct Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes can differentially triage aberrant tau in the brain, possibly allowing us to improve the specificity of therapeutics targeting this mechanism."
"9205250","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased global aortic stiffness (AoS) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and impacts the large aging population. The pathogenesis of AoS-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be due to and potentiated by abnormal hemodynamics created by the interactions between the proximal aorta, left ventricle (LV), and distal vasculature. Both resting proximal AoS and exercise-induced increases in AoS likely play fundamental roles in LV remodeling, systolic and diastolic function, and the evolution of heart failure with a preserved LV ejection fraction (HFPEF), to which women may be particularly susceptible due to greater age- associated increases in AoS. The uniqueness and compliance of proximal aorta are reflected in its elastic composition, distinct from that of the distal aorta. Yet, this region has not been well evaluated due to limitations of traditional imagin techniques. This application will utilize cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), which fully images the proximal aorta and aortic arch, to study the properties of the local ascending and proximal descending aorta and regional aortic arch (collectively labeled CMR AoS). Dr. Tsao will investigate the relationships of CMR AoS with: 1) LV and central aortic hemodynamics (with rest/exercise in both hospital- based patients and community-dwelling individuals), 2) subclinical CVD reflected in echocardiographic LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction and increased carotid intima-medial thickness, and 3) prognosis of adverse clinical CVD outcomes, with comparison to risk prediction by global AoS. She will also conduct analyses of effect modification by gender in the relations of CMR AoS with her phenotypes of interest. Her preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of using CMR to target this crucial segment of the aorta and suggest associations with age, female sex, exercise blood pressure, and measures of adverse LV remodeling and function. Together, data from these studies will enhance the scientific community's understanding of the pathophysiologic relationships of AoS, and ultimately aim to identify targets for prevention and therapy.  Dr. Connie Tsao is a non-invasive cardiologist with clinical and research experience in CMR techniques and cardiovascular epidemiology, with a goal to continue patient-oriented and epidemiologic research applying non-invasive imaging to investigate vascular disease pathophysiology in an academic setting. The current proposal will expand Dr. Tsao's experience and training in the study of vascular physiology and imaging, as well as the longitudinal epidemiologic methods that she will employ in future expansion of her work. Her career development plan leverages the resources of her institutions, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/ Harvard Medical School and the Framingham Heart Study, to provide opportunities for continued learning and to synthesize a superb team of mentors, advisors, and co-investigators with complementary expertise in all aspects of this application. Dr. Tsao's mentors and advisors are all well-established and well-funded clinical and translational researchers who will supervise her training and support her transition to independence."
"9197945","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1993, the Washington Metropolitan WIHS (WMW) Consortium has enrolled and retained a representative community cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected women with the purpose of supporting NIAID in understanding the current epidemiology of HIV, risk behaviors, disease progression, treatment uptake and outcomes, and related co-morbidities. The early cohort of infected women is aging, and the effects of age and menopausal status on disease outcomes and co-morbidities is yet to be elucidated. The WMW has joined with centers around the country and with sites across metropolitan Washington, DC to address these issues. This is particularly pertinent as Washington, DC has the highest prevalence of HIV of any urban center in the U.S. and the WMW has enrolled and retained a cohort that represents women both ethnically and psychosocially. The WMW has successfully participated in all elements of the WIHS protocol and has actively supported the infrastructure of the national WIHS. WMW investigators have participated in all of the major WIHS scientific initiatives. Additionally, with its rich data baseand local and national specimen repository, the WMW has supported local and national initiatives designed to understand the pathophysiology underlying co-morbidities. The WMW proposes to continue this work and to expand its research portfolio by continuing its strong collaborative relationship with the national WIHS in the area of protocol development, implementation, sub study participation, and identification of new initiatives. Additionally, for the next cycle of funing we have proposed new initiatives that include a telephone-based intervention for depression that will positively impact adherence and health behaviors with the goal of reducing community viral load. This intervention can easily be implemented in the larger DC community. We are expanding our local initiatives on HIV and HCV associated liver disease by engaging a team of researchers in exploring the host response, epigenetic factors, and protein glycosylation in liver disease and cancer. We will also continue and expand our investigations in organ specific morbidities associated with long-term survival in an aging population with the goal of reducing or preventing morbidity in the areas of vascular health, neurocognitive decline, and the vaginal immunologic response in aging. We will accomplish this by engaging with national and local investigators with proven expertise in these areas to further leverage the NIH investment in this important cohort of women. This will allow us to better define the status of women with HIV and bring to fruition the goals of an AIDS free generation and effective and sustainable treatment for those already infected."
"9388902","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing rates of antibiotic resistant, hospital-acquired bacterial infections, and our diminishing antibiotic options, are undercutting all medical  treatments that require hospital-based recovery. Understanding how bacteria persist and spread in hospitals is paramount to elevating the burden of antibiotic resistant hospital-associated bacterial infections. Acinetobacter baumannii is a hospital-associated pathogen of rapidly growing importance, and is a paradigm for endemic clinical contamination. Reoccurring hospital outbreaks of endemic A. baumannii strains are well documented, as are its colonization of a wide array of medical equipment and the difficulty of exterminating it from hospitals. A. baumannii's robust desiccation tolerance is a key characteristic exacerbating each of these problems, however scarce information is available describing the underlying mechanisms of desiccation-induced lethality and survival for A. baumannii or any bacterium. The overall objectives of this proposal are to characterize the role of oxidative stress and proteostasis components critical for desiccation tolerance. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) to characterize the role and identify targets of oxidative stress during desiccation and (2) to characterize components of A. baumannii's protein chaperone network that promote desiccation survival. The completion of these aims will contribute to an essential body of knowledge to the persistence of bacteria in the clinical setting and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms by which A. baumannii survives for long periods of time in the desiccated state. This proposal represents a preventative approach to eradicating contamination and spread of pathogenic bacteria in hospitals and will offer a framework for future investigation of a critical,  yet understudied, aspect of infectious disease control."
"9258836","PROJECT SUMMARY Ovarian cancer affects tens of thousands of women each year, many of whom do not show symptoms until the disease has advanced significantly. With an increased challenge in treating patients exhibiting resistance to chemotherapeutics, targeted siRNA therapy offers great promise as a complementary or standalone treatment. Unfortunately, while RNA interference has been studied for at least 15 years, there are still no FDA approved vehicles for siRNA. Amongst the liposomes, micelles, cationic polymers, and other vectors currently being investigated, issues related to toxicity, specificity, and stability are all too common. Cationic polymers synthesized with precise lengths, sequences, tacticity, and chirality would offer an improvement of the status quo by being able to control structure with atomistic precision from the ?bottom up?. Structurally precise polymers, though ubiquitous in Nature, still remain as synthetic challenges for organic chemists. While Nature creates polypeptides to catalyze specific transformations and polynucleotides to store genetic information, both from a small catalog of building blocks, there is still a need to develop biomimetic syntheses of structurally precise artificial polymers. Iterative exponential growth (IEG) techniques have been known since the 1980?s and allow for highly efficient coupling between two monomers/oligomers, doubling the chain length after each iteration. While such methods have produced numerous examples of uniform high molecular weight (MW) oligomers with high degrees of polymerization, their applications for sequence-controlled synthesis have been scarce due to limitations in incorporating functionality. Recent advances have allowed for the introduction of functionalized chiral side-chains into the IEG platform (IEG+) to synthesize high MW (~ 6.5 kDa) oligotriazoles, providing a unique avenue to explore novel ?unimacromolecular? structure-function relationships. The IEG+ methodology represents a landmark in molecular architecture that combines efficient reactions (CuAAC) to access high MW structrues, highly soluble products, and complete control of backbone stereochemistry/sequence. As a consequence of the high yielding CuAAC reactions, triazoles are available for post-polymerization alkylation. In this work, IEG+ methodology will be exploited to synthesize and characterize 24 triazolium-containing polymers, all with precise lengths, sequences, tacticity, and chirality. It is expected that the diffuse nature of the positive charge throughout the heterocycle will confer decreased toxicity compared to traditional ammonium-based delivery agents. Upon evaluating these structures? affinity for ID4 siRNA, complexation will be correlated with the identity of each polymer. These data will then be utilized for the in vitro delivery to OVCAR8 cells and the in vivo treatment of subcutaneous xenograft tumor-bearing female mice. While chirality is expected to play a major role in binding helical siRNA, our ability to precisely tune so many additional structural parameters will provide great insight to the design principles that govern the development of siRNA nanotherapeutics for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
"9257929","Project Summary Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are enzymes that convert (?edit?) adenosines (A) into inosines (I) within RNA. As inosine is recognized as guanosine by the translation machinery, splicing factors, and other RNA binding molecules, A-to-I editing events can alter the coding potential of mRNA, RNA splicing and miRNA/siRNA mediated gene silencing. RNA editing is essential for proper neuronal function with aberrant editing associated with numerous neuropathological diseases and glioma malignancy. Organisms deficient in editing have numerous biological consequences including altered immune responses, altered neurological behavior, and altered lifespan. Understanding the substrates and mechanisms by which RNA editing affects biological functions such as these will be key to developing therapeutics capable of restoring proper function in disease states. The proposed studies will determine the RNA editome of neural cells as well as the biological consequences of editing specific transcripts. My central hypothesis is that tissue specific editing of neuronally expressed transcripts regulates expression of genes responsible for proper neurological behavior. To address this hypothesis the following aims have been proposed: Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of A-to-I editing on the neuronal transcriptome.  Rationale: Thus far, RNA editing studies in C. elegans have utilized whole worm extracts; however  ADARs as well as their editing targets are differentially expressed in tissues. Specific Aim 2: To assess the biological consequences of editing within neural cells.  Rationale: Though defects in chemotaxis in editing deficient C. elegans was identified over a decade  ago, studies have not been able to identify the edited transcripts responsible nor the mechanisms by  which editing alters chemotaxis behavior. The proposed studies will provide a rationale for therapeutic discovery leading to improved treatments for neuropathological diseases and cancer. The planned approach will be the first of its kind in the RNA editing field and spans from developing novel methodology for cell-type specific target identification to organismal behavior; thus, significantly advancing our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate RNA editing. Furthermore, the completion of these studies will provide me with the skills necessary for establishing my career as an independent investigator."
"9198958","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that permit thrombin and other extracellular proteases to regulate cellular behaviors. Together with the coagulation cascade, PARs link tissue injury to cellular responses that help orchestrate hemostasis and thrombosis, inflammation, cytoprotection, repair, and pain perception. Given these and other roles, PARs are potential drug targets. Available evidence supports a model in which thrombin activates the prototypical PAR, PAR1, by cleaving the N-terminal exodomain of the receptor at a specific site to generate a new N-terminus that then functions as a tethered peptide agonist, binding intramolecularly to the receptor's heptahelical bundle to effect receptor activation. Structures that test this model and reveal how the tethered ligand binds and how such binding drives transmembrane domain (TM) movement and G protein activation are lacking, as are structures to support development of pharmaceuticals targeting PARs. Building on our recent crystal structure of inactive-state PAR1 complexed with the antagonist vorapaxar, we propose studies to illuminate the mechanism of PAR activation, signaling and antagonism at a structural level. We will 1) Solve crystal structures of thrombin- activated PAR1 in complex with Gi and either Gq or G12/13. 2) Determine the basis for vorapaxar's specificity for PAR1 over closely related receptors and the route of vorapaxar entry (from the plasma membrane or the extracellular space), and 3) Solve the crystal structure of a PAR2-antagonist complex. Cutting edge crystallographic approaches, including use of stabilizing nanobodies and single particle EM to assess complexes, will be employed. Molecular dynamics simulations will aid design and interpretation of mutational studies. Our studies of PAR1 will reveal the mechanism by which the PAR1 tethered agonist binds and triggers TM movement and G protein activation, the structural basis for PAR1's promiscuous coupling to multiple G protein subtypes (Gi, Gq, and G12/13), a novel route of antagonist entry and the importance of entry route for specificity. Detailed studies of the PAR1-vorapaxar structure and the PAR2 crystal structure will provide an entry to structure-based discovery and optimization of better PAR antagonists needed to explore the role of these receptors in human disease. Our studies will provide the first structure of a peptide agonist- GPCR-G protein complex and the first structural insight into whether distinct conformers of individual GPCRs recognize different G proteins."
"9198921","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Although spirometry is critical for diagnosis of COPD, FEV1 may be of limited value in a classification scheme designed to illuminate differences in disease mechanism among individuals. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the lung is a tool that may fulfill the need of new biomarkers to: facilitate the creation and testing of novel therapies, act as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials and provide researchers with the ability to reduce the heterogeneity of a cohort of subjects with COPD into more homogeneous subgroups to assist in monitoring study endpoints Airway Inspector is a open source software tool based on Slicer 2.x developed at Brigham and Women's Hospital for the analysis of chest CT scans for the analysis of emphysema and airway disease. The tool was conceived to analysis low resolution CT scans bringing the gap between retrospective data and new emerging CT technologies. The success of the tool in the COPD clinical community is supported by the array of peer- review publications that have used the tool to define metrics of disease that enable hypothesis driven research. Beside the existence of alternative commercial applications, Airway Inspector is the only freely available maintained platform for COPD research. In spite of its success, Airway Inspector is limited to a discontinued version of Slicer. The broad objective of this proposal is to support the refactoring and development of Airway Inspector as a platform for image-based COPD research. This goal will be achieved by the creation of the Chest Imaging Biomarker Platform (CIBP) library that integrates novel algorithm solutions to lung image analysis that have been developed in our laboratory. Those solutions include: robust lung extraction, parenchymal tissue classification based on local density, airway, fissure and pulmonary vascular extraction based on scale-space particles and airway labeling based on Hidden Markov Models. That software platform will be used to create workflows that will be integrated in Slicer 4 for their deployment in the clinical community. Slicer 4 is a NIH supported open software general purpose imaging software platform that is specifically designed to integrate solutions like Airway Inspector. The workflows will provide an end-to-end solution for the clinical to obtain phenotypes to characterize emphysema, airway disease and pulmonary vascular remodeling."
"9197981","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our study is to elucidate the molecular basis for host factors involved in maintaining microbial homeostasis and to develop novel approaches that prevent and treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by restoring host-microbe relationships. Reduced levels of vitamin D and its receptor VDR have been found in human IBD and experimental colitis. In colitis animal models, downregulation of VDR promotes the severity, extent, and duration of mucosal inflammation. We have shown that conditional removal of VDR in the intestinal epithelium made mice more susceptible to chemical injury and Salmonella-colitis. Our recent Gut paper has demonstrated that intestinal epithelial VDR conditional knockout (VDR?IEC) leads to dysbiosis. However, how intestinal epithelial VDR is involved in maintaining microbial homeostasis and innate immunity remains largely unknown. The objective of this application is to study special consequences of VDR deficiency in Paneth cells and dysbiosis in the inflamed states. We study Paneth cells because: 1) the Paneth cells sense microbes and secrete anti-microbial peptides (AMPs); 2) the roles of Paneth cells are dependent on a functional autophagy pathway, which is essential in innate immunity and microbial ecology; and 3) a lack of ATG16L1, an IBD risk genes, leads to abnormal Paneth cells in the intestine. Intriguingly, we are the first to report that ATG16L1 is a target gene of VDR. Th absence of intestinal epithelial VDR is accompanied by a reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of ATG16L1. Therefore, we hypothesize that intestinal epithelial VDR is a determinant of IBD risk through its actions on Paneth cell functions and microbial assemblage in intestinal homeostasis. We have now developed novel experimental models to investigate VDR actions that critically affect host functions and microbiota of the intestine. Aim 1 will test the working hypothesis that intestinal epithelial VDR determines the function of Paneth cells and autophagy, thus changing gut microbiota in inflammation. We will A) elucidate how intestinal epithelial VDR leads to abnormal Paneth cells (impaired differentiation and decreased AMPs), in VDR?IEC and VDR?paneth cell mice; B) determine effects and mechanisms of VDR on autophagy regulators through apoptosis/autophagy balance, using organoids and VDR transgenic mice; and C) investigate whether over-expression of intestinal VDR restores Paneth cells and autophagy, using organoids and Tg-I-VDR mice. Aim 2 will test the working hypothesis that regulating the microbiome and restoring balance in VDR functions and the microbiome will restore function of Paneth cells and autophagy, thus reducing severity of colitis. We will: A) investigate the role of intestinal epithelial VDR in altering bacterial populations when administered via fecal transplantation or recolonization in originally germ-free mice; and B) define the effect and mechanism of forced intestinal VDR expression in restoring microbial homeostasis though Paneth cell and autophagy regulation in IL10-/- colitis mice. Our studies are innovative because they provide a unifying hypothesis that can potentially account for defective autophagy, abnormal Paneth cells, and dysbiosis found in many patients with IBD and intestinal disorders. These insights will lead to novel strategies to prevent and treat IBD and intestinal disorders."

"9390280","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the misassembly of protein and nucleoprotein complexes is implicated in many regulatory disorders, we have extremely limited knowledge of the mechanisms by which these complexes assemble in vivo. Because many proteins must associate into higher-order assemblies in order to carry out their biological functions, predicting the self-assembly of these complexes is crucial for understanding the organization and regulation of the proteome. Experimental investigations of the assembly of these complexes are complicated by the fact that many essential complexes, including the ribosome and the proteasome, contain dozens of subunits that assemble in a highly cooperative manner. Furthermore, it is now known that assembly in vivo differs signi?cantly from reconstitution experiments conducted under dilute conditions, particularly due to the presence of molecular chaperones that act as assembly co-factors. New theoretical approaches are thus needed to cope with this complexity and to identify the physical principles governing robust self-assembly and regulation at the proteomic level.       Building on a powerful theory of self-assembly that I have recently developed to describe DNA-based nanostructures, I shall establish a novel theoretical approach for predicting the assembly pathways of protein and nucleoprotein complexes. This approach will provide a considerably more complete picture of the mechanism of assembly than can be obtained from experiments alone and is orders of magnitude more ef?cient than conventional simulations. Leveraging this ef?ciency to perform computational screens that were previously intractible, I shall test the hypothesis that nucleoprotein complexes have evolved to optimize the rate of assembly. I shall also investigate the sensitivity of self-assembly to variations in subunit stoichiometries, and I shall apply the theory to examine the role of chaperones in promoting accurate assembly. These theoretical predictions will be tested with two case studies of speci?c model systems.       This work will lead to an improved understanding of regulation at the proteomic level. A physically rigorous theory will establish general principles of the self-assembly of macromolecular complexes. Understanding the mechanisms of chaperone-assisted self-assembly will also enable the rational engineering of biomimetic chaperones, which hold great potential for altering the production of complexes in vivo, thus guiding the development of therapeutic strategies for a wide range of protein-misassembly disorders."
"9387686","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nucleus is the organelle which must properly transduce or resist biophysical forces to dictate the spatial organization of the genome, which in turn determines the expression profile of the cell. Initial force experiments have revealed that lamins are a major structural and resistive component of the nucleus and are located inside the inner nuclear envelope. Unlike lamins, it is unknown if heterochromatin, which is tethered to the nuclear periphery and lamins, or chromatin in general contributes to the mechanical or structural properties of nuclei. Mutation or altered amounts of lamins and heterochromatin accompany aberrant nuclear morphology in many major human diseases. These diseases include laminopathies, based in mutations in lamins, which are focused in cells or tissues that incur constant mechanical strain, such as the cardiovascular system or muscles. It is unclear how mutant lamin and altered chromatin in these diseases or other diseases each contribute to alterations in nuclear mechanics and structure. I propose to use microdissection, micromanipulation, and nanonewton-level force measurement in conjunction with live cell imaging to probe the physical properties of mouse and human nuclei. First, I propose to provide a comprehensive analysis of nuclear properties in wild-type cells by depleting or altering each component (chromatin or lamin protein) and analyzing force and structural response. Preliminary evidence suggests that chromatin contributes to the resistive properties of the nucleus: increasing the amount of decompact euchromatin using a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor results in a more compliant nucleus as quantified by micromanipulation. Second, I plan to use cells of patients with a premature aging laminopathy disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) with a common mutation in lamin A called progerin to investigate changes in the physical properties of nuclei with nuclear blebs. Nuclear blebs are a phenotype common to laminopathies, cancer and aging. In all of these pathologies the nucleus becomes disfigured with multiple lobes that extend away from the nucleus. The mechanics underlying this phenotype are unknown. I will determine the contributions of accumulation of mutant lamin A progerin and decreased heterochromatin to the physical properties of nuclei with nuclear blebs. Through analyzing the contribution of each component as well as the interplay between them I aim to uncover the mechanistic basis behind changes in nuclear properties relevant to human disease."
"9394454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Executive function (EF), the ability to flexibly exercise control over thought, action, and emotion, develops rapidly in childhood and predicts a range of outcomes associated with success in adulthood, such as academic achievement, income, and health. Children's EF can be fostered through a wide range of training interventions, so it is a target area in the promotion of healthy development. Language is likely one critical factor tapped in successful training interventions. For example, children's use of overt or covert self-directed speech (termed private and inner speech, respectively) appears to play a key role in the engagement of EF in an anticipatory way, in advance of needing to execute a response. Such patterns have been observed across children's planning, task-switching, and working memory. Furthermore, such patterns appear to converge with a recently discovered developmental transition in the temporal dynamics of EF. Specifically, children shift from a more reactive form of control, engaged in the moment as needed, to a more proactive form of control, engaged in anticipation of needing it. These developments in the temporal dynamics of EF and in the use of language to engage EF in an anticipatory way may support one another, but their relationship has not been tested, nor has the relationship between private speech and subsequent inner speech. In an effort to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the development of EF, the proposed project aims to make an innovative contribution by integrating previously independent lines of research with a new theoretical approach and complementary methods and paradigms in the pursuit of two mutually informative aims. Aim 1 examines relations among private speech, proactive control and inner speech using established paradigms and individual differences and longitudinal methods. Proactive control will be assessed at multiple levels of analysis (behavioral, pupillometric, neurophysiological), to provide convergent, comprehensive data on the temporal dynamics of the shift from reactive to proactive control and how it relates to private speech. Private speech and proactive control are expected to be correlated at age 6, and these factors are expected to predict the transition to the use of inner speech at 7 years of age. Aim 2 tests questions of causality by manipulating children's use of proactive control or private speech, and examining the effect on the other process. Experimentally increasing children's proactive control is expected to increase their subsequent use of private speech, and encouraging children's private speech is expected to increase their subsequent use of proactive control. The proposed research would provide not only the first link between distinct language processes supporting EF, but also the first link between these language processes and the shift from reactive to proactive control. The knowledge gained from this project will advance the study of the development of EF, and may lead to the design of larger-scale training interventions to improve EF in disadvantaged populations."
"9228394","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the existence of a government-led HIV prevention program focused on men who have sex with men and transgender women (MSM/TW) for nearly two decades in Peru, HIV incidence among them remains high at 5%, and most (70-75%) HIV+ MSM/TW are unaware of their HIV status. This is similar to the rest of Latin America, where sexual transmission among MSM/TW drives the HIV epidemic. HIV prevention efforts for MSM/TW in Peru are ineffective, in part, because this population remains exposed to high levels of societal discrimination, homophobia and transphobia, because of social norms favoring silence about HIV and sexual risk, and because of lack of cultural competent health services. Moreover, HIV+ MSM/TW face substantial HIV stigma, which affects disclosure of HIV status, willingness to obtain HIV testing and care, and social support. A multilevel intervention approach is needed that addresses factors at the individual, social/community, and health system levels, to facilitate earlier detection of HIV infection; linking, retaining, and re-engagin HIV+ people in care and treatment to achieve viral suppression; sexual risk reduction among both HIV- and HIV+ people; and community mobilization around these issues to provide support for and change social norms and engagement in HIV prevention and treatment. A multilevel approach stressing prevention-care links in the Continuum of Prevention and Care (CPC), is likely to reduce barriers to HIV prevention and care through integrated activities involving both community and health facilities, while creating synergy across the intervention elements. We have developed and piloted Proyecto Orgullo (PO), a multilevel, theory-based intervention that diffuses support for and creates positive social norms around HIV prevention by building a mobilized, empowered MSM/TW community to reduce unsafe sex and promote biannual HIV testing. PO has shown to be acceptable, feasible and potentially effective. In collaboration with the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and local healthcare facilities, we now propose to develop, implement and test the efficacy of PO+, an extension of PO that will facilitate full engagement in the CPC, and strengthen the linkage between the community and the health system. If shown effective, PO+ can be scaled up throughout Peru with the support of the MoH, and used as a model elsewhere in the Americas, including the US.  The project aims are: (1) to create Proyecto Orgullo+ (PO+), a comprehensive, integrated, multilevel intervention that will focus on the CPC; (2) to implement PO+ for 3 years in Lima South, in collaboration with the Peruvian MoH, hospitals that provide HIV care, and HIV testing sites; (3) to evaluate the efficacy of PO+ in affecting the CPC by using: (a) data on the CPC, including sexual risk behavior, HIV testing frequency; incidence of anal Chlamydia and gonorrhea, and engagement in care among HIV+ people, collected through longitudinal cohorts of MSM/TW in Lima South and Lima East (the control area), recruited independently of the intervention, oversampling HIV+ MSM/TW; and (b) CD4 and VL data for HIV patients, collected and provided by the MoH."
"9408135","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asymmetry of epithelial cells is necessary for proper organ function in metazoans and for impeding aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Epithelial cell membranes are divided into two domains, apical and basolateral, which are demarcated by tight junctions (TJs). These electron dense structures encircle the cell and connect the apices of opposing cells. TJs are thought to maintain cell polarity by limiting the lateral diffusion of domain-specific components, such as the apical, heavily glycosylated mucins. However, the regulation and mechanism of the TJ complex as a barrier remains obscure. This proposal will determine how physical constraints on TJ proteins can drive spatial organization essential for maintaining cell polarity. Transmembrane TJ proteins, e.g. claudin-1, are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through cytosolic TJ proteins, e.g. ZO-1. Recent work has suggested that actin networks and protein size are critical determinants for membrane asymmetry, and as such, we propose that TJs are mechanically regulated. We will examine the effect of force on TJ's ability to prevent translocation of domain-specific phosphatidylinositol phosphates using a patterned cantilever and a custom-built atomic force microscope with a side-view optical imaging system. We will also test whether TJs segregate proteins based on a size-dependent sorting mechanism. This work will provide new insight into how TJs are able to maintain cell polarity and how dysregulation of TJs leads to disease, particularly cancer."
"9278070","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Despite improvements in tobacco control, the prevalence of cigarette smoking remains high at 27% among Veterans and 21% among the general U.S. population (~46 million U.S. adults). Of these smokers, approximately 33% smoke menthols, meaning that roughly 9% of all Veterans smoke menthol cigarettes. In addition to menthol cigarette usage being prevalent among Veterans, this problem is likely to worsen over time, because recent military deployments increase the chances of smoking initiation and marketing of menthol cigarettes is aimed at roughly the age group that comprises the active military.  A central difficulty with menthol cigarettes is that smokers who use them have lower cessation rates in standardized treatment programs than smokers who use non-menthol cigarettes. Though many factors have been implicated in the initiation and continued usage of menthol cigarettes, studies of biological markers of smoking demonstrate that menthol itself inhibits nicotine metabolism, and that menthol cigarette smoking leads to elevated serum levels of nicotine and cotinine, and greater exhaled carbon monoxide levels. These elevated levels would be expected to up-regulate the density of brain 1422* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which could mediate the greater severity of Tobacco Dependence found in menthol cigarette smokers; however, these points have not yet been demonstrated in human smokers.  Based on prior literature and pilot data collected for this grant application, the primary hypothesis for the proposed research are that: 1) pre-treatment 1422* nAChR densities in the thalami (and other brain regions of interest) will be higher in menthol than non-menthol cigarette smokers, 2) menthol cigarette smokers will have greater reductions in 1422* nAChR density in the thalami (and other brain regions of interest) from before to after quitting smoking (with combination treatment with the nicotine patch, cognitive behavioral group psychotherapy, and contingency management) than non-menthol cigarette smokers, 3) menthol cigarette smokers who quit smoking with treatment (compared to those who receive treatment but do not quit) will have greater reductions in 1422* nAChR density in the regions of interest than non-menthol cigarette smokers who quit (compared to those who do not quit), and 4) lesser severity of 1422* nAChR up-regulation at baseline (along with clinical factors such as lesser severity of nicotine dependence) will be associated with better treatment outcomes, including an improved likelihood of quitting and/or decreasing smoking.  To test these hypotheses, menthol and non-menthol cigarette smokers will be recruited through flyers distributed at the VA Greater Los Angeles Smoking Cessation Programs. Participants will undergo the following sequence of procedures: (1) telephone/in-person screening, (2) a bolus-plus-continuous-infusion 2- FA positron emission tomography (PET) scanning session, (3) a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan within one week of the initial PET session, (4) ten weeks of standard treatment with a nicotine patch taper plus cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy (CBT), (5) four weeks of treatment with continued CBT plus contingency management (CM), and (6) a follow-up 2-FA PET session with the same protocol as the initial PET session at the end of the 14-week treatment period. Rating scales for the determination of smoking- related symptoms will be collected before, during, and at the end of treatment. Smoking status and measures of nicotine exposure and metabolism will be collected throughout the study using participant reports, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels, urine cotinine levels, and plasma nicotine, cotinine, and 3'-hydroxycotinine levels.  PET data will be analyzed to determine the total volume of distribution (VT) in primary brain regions of interest (a measure directly proportional to 4 2* nAChR density). For the central study analyses, differences in pre-treatment VT levels between menthol and non-menthol smokers will be determined, followed by a comparison of changes in VT levels between menthol and non-menthol smokers who quit with treatment. A comparison of VT level change in menthol and non-menthol smokers will also be performed including quit status as a factor. And, the predictive value of pre-treatment VT levels (and other smoking-related variables) in determining who will quit with treatment will also be determined.  If the central hypotheses hold true, this study will identify a potential mediating factor for the relative severity of addiction to menthol cigarettes, which results in these smokers having more difficulty quitting than non-menthol cigarette smokers. Thus, the proposed study may contribute to our understanding of the relationships between brain 1422* nAChR densities, menthol cigarette smoking, subjective symptoms of Nicotine Dependence, nicotine metabolism, and treatment outcomes, and may (in the future) have implications for the treatment of menthol cigarette smokers."
"9411238","Project Summary  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. Protein misfolding and aggregation are a central feature of ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases. The complexity of neurodegeneration calls for large-scale unbiased screening studies. Over the past few years, we have made breakthrough observations that have significant implications for the understanding of cellular defense systems against proteotoxicity. Using a unique blend of biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches, we discovered a novel pathway to reprogram protein quality control, and with new genetic hits related to this pathway in hand. We now propose work to elucidate a previously unrecognized p53 network in protein quality control. The studies on this network could expand our understanding of proteotoxic-stress-responsive quality control systems in the cell, beyond the well-established heat shock response or unfolded protein response. Our unique potential to contribute to this field is both technical and conceptual: We have developed a unique tandem C. elegans/mammalian system to study neurodegeneration, and our recent success bodes well for future plans. For example, our expanding repertoire of diease models will allow us to conduct unbiased screening studies of proteotoxicity-associated neurodegeneration in vivo and extend the findings to mammalian models and patient cells. The findings will not only provide novel entry points for understanding the molecular causes of key ALS genes but also suggest new strategies for harnessing the cellular defense system to prevent and treat the relevant forms of ALS and other related neurodegenerative diseases. We predict that the advances gained through our research efforts will eventually lead to new therapeutic interventions to address these diseases in the world's rapidly aging population."
"9198983","Project Summary Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is currently used >16,000 times/year in the United States to treat hematologic disease, leukemia, and to restore hematopoiesis in cancer patients. HSC are thus one of the most clinically exploited stem cell populations. Multiple recent studies demonstrate that the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) that restore hematopoiesis following bone marrow transplant (BMT) are distinct from those that sustain native hematopoiesis. These findings place an imperative on better understanding the selective regulation of HSPC repopulation. Thus, our laboratory seeks to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate HSC repopulation. In a functional screen for genes whose depletion perturbs HSC in vivo repopulation, we identified the Nuclear Factor I (NFI) gene family member, Nfix, as a novel regulator of HSPC function post-BMT. Loss of Nfix severely curtailed the ability of HSPC to reconstitute ablated mice. Further, Nfix-deficient HSPC display increased apoptosis post-BMT, lack CFU potential, and are reduced in number in recipient bone marrow. As the expression of multiple apoptotic regulators is perturbed in the presence and absence of Nfix in HSPC, we propose that Nfix is a key intrinsic regulator of HSPC survival post-BMT. Here, we will test this hypothesis and also assess a role for Nfix in native hematopoiesis, according to the following specific aims: 1) to test the hypothesis that Nfix regulates HSPC survival post-BMT, 2) to identify the molecular targets of Nfix in HSPC, and 3) to test if Nfix is required during native hematopoiesis. For Aim 1, we will employ mice deficient in key cell death pathway regulator genes to test if apoptosis is critical to the loss of Nfix-deficient HSPC post-BMT. As Bcl-xL is downregulated in Nfix-deficient HSPC, we will also test if restored Bcl-xL expression rescues the repopulating defect of Nfix-deficient HSPC. Finally, Nfix overexpression greatly prolongs the ex vivo culture of primary hematopoietic cells. Thus, we will also test if Nfix overexpression protects HSPC from apoptosis ex vivo. For Aim 2, we will leverage the transcriptomes of HSC lacking Nfix, HSC overexpressing Nfix, and NFIX ChIP-seq binding patterns in primitive hematopoietic cell lines to identify candidate downstream targets of Nfix. These candidates will be functionally validated via shRNA-mediated gene knockdown in HSPC overexpressing Nfix for an obligate role in promoting the Nfix- dependent survival of these cultures. We predict that genes necessary here will also play a key role down- stream of Nfix in HSPC post-BMT. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze Nfix+/+, Nfixfl/+, and Nfixfl/flROSA26Cre-ERT2 bone marrow chimeras for perturbations in blood lineages, HSPC bone marrow compartments, and HSC quiescence following Nfix deletion. Treatment with tamoxifen efficiently deletes Nfix from the hematopoietic compartment in these mice. By defining Nfix's role as an HSC regulator, we will improve our understanding of HSC and identify new pathways that can be targeted to enhance marrow engraftment after BMT."
"9401833","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen associated with a large number of infections that impact millions worldwide. One important virulence factor for this organism is the production of redox-active metabolites called phenazines. Phenazines are a double-edged sword. While on the one hand, they play important physiological roles in the survival of their producers; on the other, they can cause oxidative damage to both the host and members of the associated microbial community. A large hole in our understanding of phenazines is how P. aeruginosa defends itself against their toxic effects. This proposal will focus on understanding how P. aeruginosa modulates the concentration and redox activity of phenazines to maximize fitness. I hypothesize that P. aeruginosa utilizes a two-fold strategy to deal with these metabolites when their negative effects outweigh the positive: (i) sequestration and shielding from the environment and (ii) active degradation. Insights gained from this work will help us to understand the in vivo physiology of this important human pathogen, and will influence how we think about and respond to P. aeruginosa during infection."
"9415529","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), and recent studies have demonstrated that astrocytes not only play critical roles in the construction of neural circuits during development, but also that astrocyte dysfunction is a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The progenitor cells that give rise to the distinct subclasses of neurons during development in the spinal cord also generate astrocytes, and recent work has suggested that astrocytes, like neurons, exhibit positional identities dependent upon the progenitor domain from which they originate. These region-specific astrocyte subtypes may have important roles in the development of local spinal circuits, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases in which very specific populations of neurons are affected- motor neurons in the case of ALS. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how the regional identity of astrocytes contributes to the formation of sensory-motor circuits in the mammalian spinal cord, and to the dysfunction of these circuits that occurs in disease. The experiments described here will make use of novel transgenic tools in mice to probe regional populations of astrocytes in the spinal cord in order to analyze these populations on a gene expression level. Gene profiling experiments will be performed on astrocytes from anatomically distinct regions of wild type mice, as well as from ALS mouse models harboring the well- characterized mutant SOD1 transgene. In addition, a novel in vitro assay for astrocyte secreted factors that influence motor neuron activity will be employed. Finally, an innovative viral tracing strategy will be developed t label subsets of astrocytes that associate with synapses in defined sensory-motor circuits. Collectively, these studies will allow for the functional characterization of diverse astrocyte subtypes in the spinal cord, as well as an understanding of how these cells sculpt the formation and activity of sensory-motor circuits both during development and in disease."
"9298853","PROJECT SUMMARY  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains one of the major causes of morbidity in humans. The only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), BCG, is ineffective in protecting against adult pulmonary TB. This warrants the development of alternative vaccines or booster strategies that confer better protection against Mtb. Several subunit vaccine candidates have been developed using Mtb protein antigens that elicit potent Th1 responses. However, little is known about the potential use of Mtb lipid antigens in vaccines against Mtb. Since the Mtb cell wall is lipid rich, with mycolic acid (MA) being the most abundant lipid species, harnessing cellular immune responses to MA could be a promising vaccine strategy. CD1 molecules present a range of Mtb lipids to cognate T cells. They are divided into group 1 (CD1a, CD1b and CD1c) and group 2 (CD1d). Of the four CD1 isoforms, CD1b presents the largest cohort of Mtb-derived lipids, including MA. MA-specific CD1b- restricted T cells have been detected in the blood as well as disease sites of Mtb-infected individuals. In addition, we have recently shown that MA-specific CD1b-restricted T cells play a protective role during Mtb infection in a humanized transgenic mouse model. These data suggest that MA would be an ideal model antigen to test the feasibility of a lipid-based subunit vaccine to TB.  In this proposal, we will investigate the possibility of using nanoparticle-encapsulated MA as a subunit vaccine to examine its protective capacity in human CD1 transgenic mice challenged with Mtb. As suggested by our preliminary data, use of nanoparticles facilitates easy delivery of MA to the lungs through the intranasal route. Since it is known that the size of nanoparticles affects antigen-presenting cell (APC) targeting, in specific aim 1, we propose to compare the efficiency of antigen presentation in vivo when either micelles (~30 nm diameter) or polymersomes (~120 nm diameter) are used to encapsulate MA together with the dual adjuvants, CpG ODN and MPLA. In an attempt to elicit the most robust MA-specific T cell response upon immunization, we will further test if the co-delivery of ?-GalCer and GM-CSF will enhance the immunogenicity of these MA nanoparticles. The best combination of MA-nanoparticles and adjuvants from specific aim 1 will be used in specific aim 2 to immunize human CD1 transgenic mice to induce MA-specific T cell responses in a polyclonal setting. Lastly, the protective capacity of vaccination with MA-adjuvant nanoparticles against Mtb infection will be evaluated. Collectively, this study will not only provide a ?proof of concept? that group 1 CD1-restricted lipid antigens can be included in subunit vaccines against Mtb infection but also explore the possibility of using nanoparticles for efficient lipid antigen delivery to the primary site of infection."

Given that NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and that known outcomes include cirrhosis, liver transplant and liver cancer, it is imperative that we develop better noninvasive measures to diagnose with more severe or progressive forms of NAFLD and that we find improved therapies with unique and rational targets. The proposal in this limited competition renewal for our Clinical Center demonstrates the progress made in longitudinal database studies and significant findings in past and current/ongoing randomized clinical trials in adults and children (FLINT and CyNCh, respectively). Our Center and the Network describe plans for completion and continued development of clinical trials, for finding novel bio-imaging methods to assess response to therapy and to complete and develop ancillary studies for understanding the role of genetic and environmental factors in modulating the course of disease. In this regard, we lead studies in genome-wide association scans in Hispanic boys with NAFLD, in recognizing the role of sex steroids and nuclear hormone receptors in steatosis, inflammation and cell injury; and in elucidating the role of the gut microbiome in pediatric NAFLD. We intend to continue to play leading roles in the NASH CRN, as the PI is Co-Chair of the Steering Committee and Database Committee, a member of the Executive Committee, and Chair of the Pediatric Committee. Our Centers' leading role in enrollment, along with our leadership in recruitment and retention of children and minorities in the NASH CRN are expected to continue through completion of current trials and initiation of newly proposed studies."
"9396611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental disorders are among the leading causes of disability in the world, and improved strategies to reduce their burden are needed. The goal of this training program is to produce the next generation of psychiatric epidemiologists who can address this need by conducting research that will advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of mental disorders; developing, implementing, and evaluating rationally designed interventions to prevent and control these disorders; and critically examining mental health services and systems of care to improve mental health outcomes. Recent scientific advances such as in genomics, proteomics, and informatics present new opportunities for accelerating the discovery and translation of findings into public health gains. This training program will capitalize on the unusually rich resources for biomedical research at the Johns Hopkins University to provide trainees with the skills and experiences needed to lead multi-disciplinary research that takes advantage of these emerging opportunities and promotes mental health. It will achieve this through a rigorous program of coursework, research apprenticeships, and integrative activities that provide trainees with a solid foundation in the core proficiencies of psychiatric epidemiology while giving them the opportunity to pursue specialized training in one of four Domains of Expertise that build on strengths within our department and are recognized as high priority: Genetic and Environmental Etiology of Mental Disorders, Mental Health Services and Outcomes, Mental Health and Aging, and Global Mental Health. The program will include 5 predoctoral students and 2 postdoctoral fellows who are supported by an experienced group of 20 Core Faculty and 23 Affiliate Faculty with expertise in one or more of the identified domains. The trainees will be prepared to assume leadership positions in academia carrying out mental health research typically on faculty in Schools of Public Health or Medicine, in government formulating research priorities and mental health policy at the local, state, national, and international levels, in private industry conducting appled research for pharmaceutical or other mental health care delivery companies, and in non-profit mental health agencies or non-governmental organizations advocating for those with mental disorders. This training program has successfully trained psychiatric epidemiologists for over 30 decades. The former Director of the program, Dr. William Eaton, recently stepped down and handed the leadership to Dr. Peter Zandi. Dr. Zandi is a graduate of the program and now an accomplished faculty member with expertise in the genetic and pharmaco-epidemiology of mental disorders. In this competing renewal, he is poised to build on the rich tradition of the program and lead it in new directions that will prepare the next generation of leaders in psychiatric epidemiology who will advance the field beyond traditional studies of the incidence and prevalence of mental disorders (i.e., descriptive epidemiology) and drive research that focuses on etiologic mechanisms, targeted interventions, and delivery of services (i.e., analytic epidemiology)."
"9256765","Project Summary This application is for a predoctoral fellowship awarded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to physician-scientist trainees. The applicant is a trainee of the Medical Scientist Training Program at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. This award would help him achieve his career goal of becoming a physician-scientist investigating the role of circadian rhythms in metabolism. Circadian rhythms are biological clocks that regulate all-encompassing aspects of human physiology. Circadian misalignment is prevalent in the modern society and one of the contributing factors to the rising epidemics of obesity and diabetes in the U.S. and worldwide. In support of this, many epidemiological studies have demonstrated that night shift workers are more likely to have higher BMI and more prone to developing metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and related cardiovascular comorbidities. While this is an imperative public health issue with increasing significance, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the circadian clock and metabolism. In efforts to better understand the molecular mechanisms linking circadian rhythms to metabolic homeostasis, our lab has undertaken a genome-wide study characterizing how hepatic transcription is regulated in a circadian manner. Reassuringly, we identified several transcription factors known to coordinate specific circadian phases of transcription, such as Rev-erb? and Bmal1. Interestingly, our functional genomic data predicted that a transcription factor from the ETS family regulates a circadian phase of transcription at 7 AM-10 AM. However, there is no ETS factor known to behave in a circadian manner. In this proposal, I provide preliminary proteomic and genomic data suggesting that GABP? is the circadian ETS transcription factor, with potential roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. This finding raises both mechanistic questions about how GABP? coordinates circadian transcription and the functional role of GABP? in hepatic metabolism. For Aim 1, I will dissect the molecular mechanism of circadian transcriptional control by GABP? using a genetic loss-of-function approach and an unbiased proteomics approach. For Aim 2, I will determine the physiological role of GABP? in hepatic metabolism by measuring physiologic and metabolic parameters and performing functional metabolic assays, ultimately to link molecular, cellular, and metabolic changes with physiological outcomes. These integrative experiments will determine the previously unrecognized circadian role of GABP? in transcriptional regulation and hepatic metabolism. Furthermore, the novel insights gained from this proposal will have both mechanistic and therapeutic implications for how circadian misalignment leads to metabolic dysfunction."
"9189682","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lassa fever (LF), a severe hemorrhagic illness, is one of the most threatening infectious diseases known because of its unique status as both an immediate public health crisis and a bio-safety level 4 (BL-4) potential bioterror hazard. Endemic in large parts of West Africa, LF is estimated to hospitalize tens of thousands of individuals and cause several thousand deaths each year, with a case fatality rate in hospitalized patients that can reach 50% or more. Antibody-based surveys suggest that infection with the LF-causing agent, Lassa virus (LASV), is far more widespread than previously thought, with over 20% of Nigerians and Sierra Leoneans showing evidence of exposure. It is not known why many West Africans infected with LASV do not exhibit disease symptoms while others go on to suffer encephalitis, deafness and death, but recent genomic studies offer a hypothesis. A genome-wide survey of human genetic variation identified two genes biologically linked to LF infection among the strongest signals of recent human adaptation in West Africans. Further analysis of the LASV genome itself indicates that the virus has been circulating in West Africa for over a millennium. These findings-coupled with the high rates of disease, observed disease resistance, significant mortality and disability in affected individuals, and the widespread exposure to the rodent reservoir for the virus-suggest that LF is an ancient selective force, driving the emergence of genetic variants that confer resistance. LASV's unique status among BL-4 agents as a widespread, long-standing selective force is reflected in the serious global health risk it poses, but also provides a tremendous opportunity to study LF and the genetic mechanisms of resistance to it. Along with our partners in the US and Africa, we have built thriving clinical and research centers in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and implemented diagnostics, training and infrastructure there to ensure safe, high-quality sample collection from patients hospitalized with LF. We have performed a preliminary genome scan and found several promising candidate adaptive and immune genetic variants associated with LF resistance. We have further developed a number of high-throughput technological approaches to rapidly validate and characterize these variants functionally. Based on our previous success in this area, we propose to pursue genetic determinants of resistance to LF through a larger patient collection, deeper diagnostic characterization, more extensive genetic studies, and functional characterization of candidate variants. Through our study, we hope to lay a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics while also providing a path forward for further research into LASV and other BL-4 agents."

"9069009","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our purpose is to evaluate the longer-term impact of Green Dot across the Bluegrass, an active bystanding-based randomized intervention trial in 26 high schools across Kentucky designed to reduce dating and sexual violence in a cohort of seniors as they transition into young adulthood. Our central question is: Does Green Dot continues to have an effect in changing the culture of violence acceptance and reducing violence perpetration among students exposed to Green Dot relative to those not exposed as this cohort enters young adulthood? In this prospective cohort of approximately 7,500 students, we will measure the individual level exposure to the Green Dot program and into young adulthood allowing us to estimate the risk of dating and sexual violence victimization and perpetration. Very few studies have prospectively estimated the risk of dating and sexual violence among a cohort randomized to a primary prevention intervention and followed into young adulthood. This R01 is also unique because cohort members will be followed independent of whether they do or do not attend college. Individually following this cohort of seniors represents a significant value-added and time-sensitive opportunity because the full implementation of Green Dot began in late 2011. Only now (2013-15) would we anticipate seeing an effect of Green Dot among rising seniors on changing bystanding and potentially reducing violence. Aim 1. Prospectively determine whether and how the Green Dot intervention reduces rates of teen dating and sexual violence into young adulthood by (a) changing social norms of violence acceptance, (b) increasing active bystanding, and (c) diffusing the intervention through peer networks. Approximately 7500 high school seniors who attended Kentucky high schools randomized to the Green Dot intervention (n~3750) or control schools (n~3750) will be followed 42 months into young adulthood. Aim 2. To determine the potentially modifying effects of participants' post-high school life experience on the association between exposure to the Green Dot intervention and bystanding actions, teen dating and sexual violence incidence. Post-high school experience will be categorized as attending any form of college or university versus no additional education. Specific life stressors such as relationship status, pregnancy, military deployment, family and peer violence, and substance abuse will also be explored. This cohort study is appropriately powered (?90%) to address both aims. Comparisons will be made at 6-month intervals and across the 42-month follow-up and the interaction of intervention by time will be evaluated. Generalized Estimating Equations will be used to test the impact of Green Dot over time while taking clustering of high schools and correlation among repeated measurements among individual students into account and adjusting for confounders. This prospective cohort builds upon a large population-based and promising primary prevention intervention, designed to reduce dating and sexual violence among high school students and provides an important test of the longer-term efficacy of this program into young adulthood."
"9213819","The biguanide metformin that inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity is now in over 200 oncology clinical trials. In this proposal we will determine how to enhance cancer cell sensitivity towards metformin therapy. There are two principal modes of cellular energy production ? glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation of glycose and fatty acids. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial energy production. Therefore, when switched to a low glucose medium (that reduces glycolysis), cancer cells become sensitized to metformin. Physiological glucose concentration in tissues is however significantly lower compared to that used in most cell culture studies and glucose concentration is even lower in tumor tissues. At this physiological range of glucose, cancer cells maintain high glycolytic rate and genes that regulate cancer cell glycolysis may resist biguanide action by upregulating compensatory glycolysis when mitochondria is inhibited. Therefore, identification and inhibition of such genes may enhance cancer cell liability towards biguanides. Despite promise in other cancers, our data shows that glioma stem cells (GSCs) are resistant to biguanides at physiological glucose. We discovered that the cellular energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) that augments glycolysis during stress in cardiac and skeletal muscle is co-opted by GSCs for optimal glycolysis. We propose to test the mechanisms by which AMPK regulates glycolysis in GSCs in vitro and in vivo. Through dose escalation pharmacological studies in mice we will determine maximum tolerated metformin dose in brain tumor-bearing mice, quantitate metformin plasma levels, and metformin concentrations attained in normal brain and tumor tissue. We will test if genetic inhibition of AMPK in GSCs reduces glycolysis, suppress proliferation and tumor growth and improves metformin sensitivity."

In vitro model studies7 conducted on synthetic 2 suggest that these natural products may cross-link of DNA, but no experimental evidence using isolated oligonucleotides in vitro or seeking markers of DNA alkylation in culture have been disclosed. DNA-reactive agents comprise a considerable portion of the modern chemotherapeutic arsenal.8?11 Moreover, the purported mechanism of action of 1 and 2 closely resembles that of the illudin family of natural products12?17, a derivative of which (irofulven, 3, Figure 1)18,19 advanced to Phase II and III clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic for the treatment of breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancers, among others.12,20 The development of 3 exemplifies the underexplored potential of DNA cross- linking natural products as a viable source of chemotherapeutic agents. Total synthesis of 1 represents an essential first step in translational development toward a potential novel chemotherapeutic. Ready access to 1 could also provide a chemical tool for biological studies involving DNA cross-linking, which may ultimately result in further insight into important biological processes such as DNA repair. With biological evaluation and translational development of 1 as the ultimate goal, the synthetic route toward 1 is designed to be scalable and concise. The overall strategy centers on joining two complex cyclohexyl fragments through a robust acetylide addition, with a subsequent Heck-type cyclization envisioned to construct the final carbocyclic ring of the target. Specific aims entail: 1) development of syntheses of the two cyclohexyl precursor fragments of 1, 2) synthesis of the model system and analogue 4, and 3) completion of the synthesis of 1 using conditions developed for synthesis of 4. As projected, the total synthesis of 1 should be achieved in 15 steps. The long-term goals of this project include intensive mechanism of action studies of 1, design and synthesis of analogues for structure?function studies, elucidation of the activity and cell line selectivities of 1, and validation of 1 as a lead for translational development.

"9256272","Abstract Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) is the second most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STD) with an estimated world prevalence of 78 million. Approximately 820,000 cases occur annually in the U.S. but over half are unreported, and rates continue to rise as indicated by a 10.5% increase from 2010 to 2014. GC is a major cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that can lead to tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. GC also facilitates the transmission of HIV-1 infection. While we rely on antibiotics to treat GC infections, empiric therapy has fueled the already problematic issue of drug-resistant GC in the U.S. and the world. The main obstacle to stemming the spread of GC infections is the lack of a point-of- care (POC) diagnostic that could provide surveillance and early detection, reducing infection rates and sequelae. Current GC diagnostics rely on commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) that are expensive, require equipment and highly trained operators, take a day to days for results, and can result in loss to follow up of patients. Thus, current NAATs are not suitable at the POC. Our team comprised of Drs. Dean and Gaydos, experts on STDs and POC development, and Diassess, a startup company with proprietary technology for POC diagnostics, have preliminary data showing that we: 1) can rapidly extract GC nucleic acids from endocervical swabs with no instruments or trained operator in a prototype Sample Preparation Module; 2) have an instrument-free multiplexed Detection Module for colorimetric detection of GC nucleic acids; 3) have a limit of detection of 10 organisms/assay; 4) have validated assays to detect GC strains and assays to detect human RNA/DNA with no cross reactivity with other STD pathogens; and 5) have shown that our system can detect GC reliably in clinical endocervical swabs that are know positive by a commercial NAAT. We will expand on our preliminary studies with the following aims. Aim 1: Using the expanding aggregate of reference and clinical GC genome sequences, we will refine our assays, replacing failed assays as needed, and ensure that our assays detect diverse GC clinical strains without cross-reactivity with STD pathogens or common vaginal/cervical species; Aim 2: Optimize sample preparation chemistry for nucleic acid extraction from urethral, vaginal and endocervical swabs, assay design and colorimetric chemistry for these swab types, without false negative or positive results from interfering substances; Aim 3: We will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of our fully-integrated system (the combined Sample Preparation Module with Detection Module) compared to commercial NAATs. By the end of Phase II, we will be poised to manufacture and use our rapid (<35 min), inexpensive, user-friendly, instrument-free, sensitive and specific GC POC test for clinical trials in the U.S. to obtain FDA regulatory clearance. Our overall goal is to deploy our GC POC diagnostic for use in doctor?s offices, small to large city and rural clinics, teen, family and STD clinics, ERs and hospital clinics, other testing sites, and resource-constrained settings around the world."
"9393215","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This T32 training program with 5 postdoctoral trainees/year has been funded by NIAID since 1994 and takes advantage of the combined extensive allergy research activities in the La Jolla scientific community. The faculty members are from two neighboring institutes: University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LIAI). The program is open to MD's and PhDs interested in allergic/immunologic disease-oriented research and committed to a career in basic research applied to these clinical diseases. The trainees have opportunities to be exposed to a wide range of allergy research topics. In addition, the inter-institutional training program serves as a catalyst for promoting interactions and collaborations among researchers from different institutes. All 16 faculty members have well established NIH funded research programs; their research backgrounds are diverse and when taken together encompass genetics, immunology, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology. Therefore, this training program represents an interdisciplinary approach. The trainees can be involved in the following research areas: 1) genetics and epigenetics, 2) biology of inflammatory cells, including mast cells and eosinophils; 3) T cells; 4) dendritic cells, 5) innate immune responses (TLRs, ILC2, NK cells) 6) cell receptors critically involved in allergic reactions; 7) signal transduction; 8) inflammatory mediators/cytokines; 9) functions of epithelial cells; 10) complement, and 11) endothelial adhesion. The goals of the program are 1) to foster the development of trainee's laboratory based investigative skills, in particular, applying molecular and cellular biological approaches to study mechanisms of allergic diseases, and 2) to mentor trainees to successfully compete for either independent research grants and faculty positions, or research positions in biotechnology. The trainees are expected to devote over 90% effort to research, and training will be supplemented by conferences, seminars, journal clubs and courses. Upon completion of the program trainees will have developed a solid background in the molecular and cellular mechanisms of allergic inflammation and become qualified and confident in embarking upon their careers as independent investigators in allergy research."
"9404717","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-cellular organisms develop from a single cell that undergoes many stages of proliferation and differentiation that result in the vast array of progenitor and terminal cell types. While dogma defines development as a series of discrete steps, it is actually a continuous process, characterized by transitional stages and intermediate cell types that have yet to be described. We propose reframing development in terms of branching trajectories: We will develop computational algorithms that use high dimensional single cell data to map each individual cell into a lineage tree representing the chronological order of development. Rather than grouping cells into nodes of this tree (cell types), single cells will fill in the branches in a continuum ordered according to their developmental chronology. Thus, each branch is a developmental trajectory that represents all the transitional stages between cell states. In essence, combining single cell technologies with sophisticated computation will empower us to do for Homo sapiens what John Sulston and colleagues did for C. elegans-to construct a complete and detailed map of normal development. This map will provide both a full catalog of all cell types in our body, as well as the developmental relations between them. The detailed resolution of the resulting map will empower developmental studies, help elucidate how and where development is derailed in disease, and guide the next generation of regenerative medicine."

"9322153","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Germ cells serve as a link between generations, producing gametes that propagate genetic material from parent to offspring. Understanding the mechanisms by which germ cells develop will help illuminate the nature of totipotency, the causes of infertility, and the origins of germ cell tumors. Much knowledge of germ cell development derives from studying model organisms that utilize cytoplasmic determinants to specify germ cell fate in early embryogenesis. In contrast, many organisms (including mammals) utilize inductive signals to specify germ cell fate later in development. In spite of these differences, germ cells specified by determinants and those formed inductively share several common intrinsic mechanisms, including transcriptional repression of somatic fates and post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Mechanistic studies of inductive germ cell development have been limited almost exclusively to mouse and important questions remain unanswered. For example, what transcriptional networks define and maintain germ cell fate? After a germ cell has been specified, what systemic factors link its further differentiation with te physiological status of the animal? The freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, serves as a powerful model for studying these questions. It has prodigious regenerative abilities, based upon a population of adult stem cells that allow even tiny body fragments to regenerate complete individuals. In planarians, the germ cell lineage develops post- embryonically from the somatic stem cells; like the soma, the germ cell lineage can also be regenerated. Preliminary data generated in the applicant's laboratory have identified intrinsic and extrinsic regulators required for maintaining germ cells and for regulating their differentiation. Based on these data, two specific aims will be pursued: (i) to characterize the transcriptional network in early germ cells; and (ii) to dissect the neuropeptide-based systemic regulation of germ cell differentiation. Work performed under the first aim will use chromatin immuno-precipitation, next-generation sequencing, and computational approaches to identify targets of a germ cell-specific transcription factor required for maintaining early germ cells. Experiments conducted under aim two will characterize the neuropeptide receptor mediating the systemic regulation of germ cell development, identify the cell type(s) that express the receptor, and discover genes expressed in response to neuropeptide signaling. For both aims, the functional genomic tools for studying S. mediterranea (high- throughput in situ hybridization; RNA interference by feeding double-stranded RNA) will be used to validate target genes and determine their functions. These studies use a model organism with unique attributes, and take unbiased, genomic approaches to identify conserved factors; thus, they have great potential to innovate. This work is significan because of its potential: (i) to identify conserved genes required for proper germ cell development; and (ii) to provide a promising strategy for understanding and treating parasitic flatworms that infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide."
"9381676","DESCRIPTION    Abstract:    Vhh's require neither disulfide bonds nor glycosylation for stability; they are remarkably thermostable as well. By immunizing an alpaca with cytoplasmic proteins from the organism of interest, a representative set of such Vhh's will be generated and isolated by means of selective amplification of the Vhh sequences present by PCR, followed by expression of the Vhh's as a library in phage display mode. At the C-terminus of each Vhh, the phage expression vectors carry a recognition motif for sortase, a bacterial enzyme that allows quantitative and site-specifi modification of proteins of interest, including Vhh's. Sortases recognize an LPXTG motif, and cleave between the Thr and Gly residues with concomitant formation of a thioacyl intermediate. Short synthetic peptides, modified according to need with fluorophores, biotin or combinations of thereof, resolve this thioacyl intermediate and allow covalent, near-quantitative and site-specific installation of such probes at the site of sortase cleavage, without inflicting chemical damage on the Vhh antigen combining site. This allows the rapid production of Vhh's that are affinity tagged with biotin. They can be used directly for retrieval of the target antigen to facilitate its identification by affinity purification and proteomic (LC/MS/MS) analysis. Indeed, this unbiased approach has been successfully reduced to practice in a trial run in the applicant's laboratory, leading to the isolation of a high affinity Vhh that recognizes murine class II MHC products, starting from a library constructed from an alpaca immunized with unfractionated mouse splenocytes. The next targets envisioned are components of the yeast nuclear pore, available in mg amounts.  While some yeast work has been performed in the applicant's laboratory, the proposed project presents the first serious foray into yeast cell biology, but with obvious extensions into multicellular eukaryotes.

"9315040","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor quality and impractical measurement has impeded the study of implementation barriers, facilitators and strategies necessary for promoting widespread delivery of evidence-based care and improving mental health. Measures derive research and policy/practice insights that guide subsequent decision making. However, for measures to advance science and inform practice they need to be both psychometrically strong and pragmatic. No studies have evaluated the psychometric properties of a comprehensive array of measures delineated in highly-cited, foundational implementation science frameworks such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) 4 or the Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF).5 Moreover, no research has attempted to advance pragmatic implementation science measures, and the only existing pragmatic criteria was generated in the absence of stakeholder involvement. Our long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive battery of reliable, valid, and pragmatic measures that researchers and stakeholders could use to advance the science and practice of implementation. The overarching objective of this application is to put forth a measurement-focused research agenda for implementation science (i.e., which constructs possess psychometrically strong and pragmatic measures, which require further development) as well as measures and methods to accomplish this work. Three aims guide this proposal. One, establish a stakeholder-driven operationalization of pragmatic measures and develop reliable, valid rating criteria for assessing the construct. Our approach to generating pragmatic rating criteria employs mixed methods (literature review, qualitative interviews, and Q-sort and Delphi methods) to engage stakeholders. Two, develop reliable, valid, and pragmatic measures of accept- ability, appropriateness, and feasibility. We have vetted an effective development procedure to establish their reliability; substantive, discriminant content, structural, known-groups, and predictive validity; structural invariance; and sensitivity to change. Our approach to developing and testing new measures involves a series of laboratory studies to assess psychometric properties under controlled conditions and field studies to gauge psychometric and pragmatic performance under real world conditions. Three, identify CFIR and IOF-linked measures that demonstrate both psychometric and pragmatic strength. Our approach to assessing over 420 existing measures of 46 constructs builds upon our preliminary studies and accesses an established task force. The pragmatic measure rating criteria will be integrated into our established psychometric rating criteria rendering psychometric and pragmatic measure profiles. We predict that few existing measures are psycho- metrically sound and pragmatic, but that rigorous, replicable development and testing procedures will generate measures that possess these qualities. Once pragmatic, psychometrically strong measures are identified, the field can generate robust scientific knowledge about which implementation strategies work best, when, and for whom so that stakeholders can use evidence-based approaches for implementing evidence-based practices."
"9391736","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 Career Development Award investigating the novel anti-inflammatory properties of breast milk in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC affects nearly 1 out of 10 premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams, with a mortality of up to 50%. It is characterized by intestinal barrier disruption and intestinal necrosis, multi-system organ failure and death. The specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of NEC remain unclear. Our laboratory has shown that activation of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is required fo NEC development and that TLR4 activation leads to two key pathological features of NEC: NF-kB-mediated inflammatory response with associated intestinal injury and impaired mucosal healing. Breast milk is the only known protective agent against NEC, but the specific protective component and protective mechanism remain unknown. Our preliminary studies show breast milk decreases TLR4 signaling and a major factor mediating this protective effect is epidermal growth factor (EGF). The overall hypothesis is that activation of the EGF receptor ameliorates NEC by antagonizing at least two major deleterious aspects of TLR4 signaling: inflammation and impaired epithelial healing. The protection seen with EGFR activation likely involves the competitive interaction of several signal transduction pathways. Therefore, we further hypothesize that the EGF in breast milk promotes intestinal cell healing by enhancing Wnt and decreasing Notch activation. To test this hypothesis, we will use our experimental NEC model to pursue the following specific aims: 1. To determine the extent that breast milk inhibits TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling in NEC. 2. To characterize the effects of breast milk on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and mucosal healing. 3. To determine the mechanisms by which breast milk regulates intestinal epithelial cell differentiation via TLR4-mediated Notch activation in NEC pathogenesis. The candidate is a Neonatologist who has been working closely with her mentor for the past four years. She benefits from a well-established and successful mentor with a supportive academic environment. In addition, the candidate meets on a regular basis with her Scientific Advisory Committee, which is comprised of experts in Immunology, Cell Biology and Physiology, and her collaborator, Dr. Jennifer Grandis with expertise in EGFR signal transduction. The candidate's immediate goals are to gain increased knowledge in molecular biology, immunology and signal transduction. Her long-term career goals are to become a productive independent investigator who will significantly contribute to the field studying the pathogenesis of NEC. To achieve these goals, a structured career development plan was developed which includes: gaining knowledge through educational activities, course work, conferences, frequent mentor meetings with a gradual increase in independence and a Scientific Advisory Committee who is devoted to the candidate's success."
"9378244","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is extremely common among HIV-infected individuals, affecting 1 in 6 patients. AKI substantially increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease and mortality among HIV-infected persons. To address the disproportionate risk of AKI and its adverse consequences in the HIV- infected population, strategies are needed to identify patients at highest risk of AKI and its consequences. These methods need to be tailored for HIV-infected persons as their risk factors for AKI and progressive kidney disease are distinct from the general population. Interventions for AKI have failed, however, in part due to the reliance for AKI diagnosis on serum creatinine which rises only after substantial kidney damage has already occurred. Despite the promise of novel urine biomarkers for early AKI diagnosis, at present, their clinical application is considerably hampered by the techniques currently used to measure them which are slow, have constrained detectable ranges, and measure biomarkers in isolation.  The Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the associations of novel kidney injury biomarkers with AKI and related adverse health outcomes in the HIV- infected population. The JHHCC has a well-characterized population of HIV-infected patients and a highly integrated system that enables the collection of ambulatory and inpatient data as well as biospecimens which are imperative in the study of AKI. In this proposal, we will leverage the extensive resources within the JHHCC to achieve the following Aims: 1) to determine the association of ambulatory kidney damage with incident hospitalized clinical AKI and progressive kidney disease after AKI; 2) to investigate the prevalence of subclinical and clinical AKI among hospitalized HIV-infected individuals and their associations with progressive kidney disease after hospitalization; and 3) to develop and validate a predictive model which integrates a multiplex panel of complementary, informative urine biomarkers and clinical variables that will distinguish risk for incident AKI and subsequent progressive kidney disease. We will measure urine biomarkers of kidney endothelial and tubulointerstitial injury, inflammation and fibrosis at ambulatory visits and serially during hospitalizations in Aims 1 and 2. We will then utilize the observed associations in Aims 1 and 2 to guide the development of a clinically adaptable multiplex panel of urine biomarkers. This panel will be combined with clinical variables to develop a model that distinguishes the risk of AKI and subsequent kidney disease progression among HIV-infected persons. This study will greatly enhance our understanding of subclinical and clinical AKI and their contribution to adverse health outcomes among HIV-infected persons. Our study will yield a predictive model which incorporates the multiplex HIV-AKI Risk Panel which could then be tested as a screening tool in clinical trials comparing early management of AKI or intensive management after AKI with the current standards of care as well as a surrogate endpoint for early phase therapeutic candidates for AKI."
"9404152","ABSTRACT Amid declining cigarette consumption, sales of non-cigarette tobacco products remain strong. Importantly, the diverse products available in the current tobacco marketplace pose different levels of harm to the user. Combustible products such as cigarettes and cigars are higher on the tobacco risk continuum than non- combustible products such as smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Conceivably, smokers who switch to a non-combustible product may reduce their risk of smoking-related disease. This behavior, however, is significantly more common among whites compared to blacks, who have the highest rates of combustible tobacco use of any racial or ethnic group. Indeed, cigarette smoking rates are declining faster among whites than blacks, potentially driven by e-cig uptake. Differential rates of quitting smoking by switching to e-cigs or other non-combustible products may exacerbate existing health disparities between whites and blacks. Although tobacco use is influenced by several individual, interpersonal, and societal factors, the retail environment is known to play a critical role in shaping smoking behaviors, particularly among racial minorities, whom the tobacco industry has historically exploited. Despite the growing popularity of e-cigs and other non- cigarette tobacco products, little is known about the promotion of these products at the point-of-sale. This project will examine how the retail of diverse tobacco products varies across the U.S. and the extent to which it is associated with use behaviors of community residents. Specifically, this study will 1) investigate the relationship between regional tobacco product sales, tobacco control policies, and community demographics using Nielsen market scanner data and census data, 2) document the association between the local tobacco retail environment and tobacco product use using geocoded data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and store audits, and 3) model smoking-related disparities attributed to changes in tobacco use behaviors using repeated cross-sectional NHIS data and longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study."
"9397859","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS continues to be a major public health threat particularly for rural substance-using AA women. Condom use is an effective method of preventing HIV transmission and a number of interventions have been developed to increase condom use among high-risk populations. Such interventions have been shown to increase condom use intentions and behaviors, but they have limited reach, thus using time and resources without notable large scale impacts on HIV efforts. The proposed project involves assessing the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting and implementing an evidence-based single session HIV prevention intervention using social media tools. Aims 1 and 2 involve examining the feasibility and acceptability of social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) for recruitment, enrollment, and implementation of VOICES online for substance-using heterosexual African American women residing in rural Mississippi. Aim 3 will assess the effectiveness of the online VOICES intervention by comparing it to the traditional VOICES at 3 month post- intervention follow-up on intentions to use condoms, number of unprotected sexual acts, program costs per enrolled participant and geographical reach. Taken together the results of the proposed project aims could demonstrate the use of social media as a wide reaching, cost-effective method to implement evidence-based, group-level HIV interventions for individuals with limited access to prevention services. Increased scalability and reach of HIV programing could aid in preventing new HIV infections, particularly in populations of increased risk."
"9270934","Project Summary This proposal will evaluate the novel role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation as a key driver of inflammatory mediated cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HIV and represents a substantial investigative departure from understanding the traditional physiologic role of the RAAS in regulating sodium balance and blood volume. There is a considerable rise in non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality secondary to cardiovascular complications among those HIV patients well treated on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and studies show that HIV patients are at a two-fold increased risk for CVD compared to the general population. In support of this, cardiac imaging studies from our group demonstrate critical evidence that HIV patients have a higher prevalence of a vulnerable type of coronary plaque, more inflamed and prone to rupture. Overall, combined use of ART and conventional agents, such lipid and glucose lowering medications, are not completely effective for CVD risk reduction in HIV. In this regard, no current FDA approved strategies are available to significantly lower the risk of CVD in the HIV population. Therefore, CVD in HIV presents an unmet public health challenge that demands investigation of a novel therapeutic target, which importantly leverages an HIV-related mechanism. In this regard, preliminary data from the Candidate demonstrate that HIV patients have increased aldosterone in association with excess visceral adiposity and insulin resistance compared to non-HIV individuals during a RAAS activated state. Moreover, the Candidate has shown that the RAAS activated state stimulates a pro- inflammatory milieu among the HIV population. An important sequela of progressive inflammation is atherosclerotic disease. Taken together, these novel data suggest a unique metabolic phenotype in HIV with clinical relevance to CVD and provides the strong rationale for a physiologically based strategy to reduce RAAS activation in HIV-related CVD via mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism. In Aim I, the Candidate will perform a detailed and controlled physiologic investigation of the RAAS using sophisticated algorithms to assess differences in generalized and vascular inflammation during a RAAS activated vs. RAAS suppressed state. In Aim II, the Candidate will evaluate the clinical benefit of manipulating this hormonal system through implementation of a randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial evaluating first in the field effects of MR blockade on arterial inflammation in HIV. This study will use cardiac 18F-FDG-PET/CT technology, which takes advantage of a biologic approach to identify macrophage-rich vulnerable plaque through active tissue metabolism, to characterize arterial inflammation. Both Aims will be conducted in parallel, but are independent explorations that will provide new information to the field assessing RAAS physiology, inflammation, and CVD in the HIV population. The current K23 proposal is a comprehensive five year training plan that presents an outstanding mechanism for a mentored career development award. The Candidate is a trained Endocrinologist and faculty member within the Division of Endocrinology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School with an investigative focus on mechanisms for cardiometabolic disease in HIV. The Candidate has assembled a robust mentoring team headed by Steven Grinspoon, MD (Massachusetts General Hospital) and Gail Adler MD, PhD (Brigham and Women's Hospital), both internationally recognized in their respective fields of HIV CVD risk assessment and mineralocorticoid physiology and well-funded. In addition, the Candidate will be supported by a diverse team of advisors providing sophisticated training in areas of cardiovascular imaging, biomarker science, nutrition and metabolism, HIV immunology and statistics. Moreover, the research infrastructure and educational tools available through the Harvard Catalyst and the Program in Nutritional Metabolism at Massachusetts General Hospital will provide a comprehensive training experience. The Candidate has demonstrated outstanding productivity in the early stages of her investigative career and would benefit from advanced mentorship and instruction to address the novelty of this grant proposal, which leverages concepts in physiologic algorithms for metabolic phenotyping, regulation and safety of a randomized controlled trial, mineralocorticoid systems physiology, radiographic modalities for non-invasive CVD risk assessment, immunophenotyping, and rigorous data handling for longitudinal data sets. HIV is a model of acquired chronic inflammation and CVD, and in this regard, these studies and research principles will serve as a paradigm in the long-term for advanced clinical and translational investigations focused on hormonal contributions to further inflammatory processes in HIV and other at risk populations, including obesity. To that end, funding from the K23 award will critically allow the Candidate to continue on a promising trajectory towards independence as a clinician scientist in patient-oriented research."
"9317609","SUMMARY Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the single largest viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia, with a high worldwide mortality, and there is no safe and effective vaccine. Ever since the encounter with vaccine- enhanced disease (VED) during a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccination trial in the 1960s, it has been enormously challenging to impart both sufficient safety and efficacy in a single vaccine. For RSV-naïve children, live-attenuated vaccines are an important focus, because inactivated and subunit vaccines are poor at inducing cell-mediated immunity which contributes to VED. Moreover, live vaccines can induce broad systemic and local immunity. Thus, for RSV-naïve individuals a live vaccine approach is an attractive option, provided the vaccine itself is sufficiently safe and cannot revert to a more aggressive phenotype. It has recently been recognized that the viral fusion (F) protein is unstable and readily shifts to the post-fusion conformation during purification or vaccine preparation. As a result, a large proportion of vaccine-induced antibodies (Abs) target the post-fusion form, which is functionally obsolete. To avoid induction of anti- post- fusion F Abs, McLellan et al were able to genetically stabilize the pre-fusion form (referred to as FPRE), thereby greatly increasing neutralizing capacity of anti-F Abs, when given as a protein vaccine. However, subunit vaccines are deemed unsafe for the RSV-naïve target population. Thus, to protect RSV-naïve children there is a need to place the advantageous pre-fusion F concept in the context of a balanced immune response that does not cause VED, which could be achieved by expressing FPRE from a live-attenuated virus. However, stabilization of FPRE renders it non-functional and a virus solely expressing FPRE is not viable. We previously reported a baculovirus GP64 based complementation system that can overcome this problem, as it uniquely allows generation of infectious F-deleted or F-compromised viruses from cDNA in GP64-expressing cells. These GP64-pseudotyped viruses could be amplified to high titer and were significantly more temperature stable than wildtype RSV. Due to replacement of functional F with trans-complemented GP64, the viruses are infectious but self-limited and cannot spread beyond initially infected cells, thus constituting an attractive live-attenuated platform. We have in vivo preliminary data using a similar single-round RSV vaccine that suggests such vaccines are efficaceous. The goal of this proposal is to exploit the GP64 system to generate a live RSV which solely expresses the pre- fusion F form. Our hypothesis is that replacing the native, functional, F gene with a gene encoding a pre-fusion stabilized F in a live virus, will drive the anti-F response toward the pre-fusion F form, and will induce a balanced response that includes cell-mediated immunity and avoids VED. We will test this hypothesis through two aims: 1) Generate and in vitro characterize a live-attenuated RSV lacking a functional F copy and expressing instead a conformationally stabilized pre-fusion F; and 2) Characterize immune properties of RSV expressing FPRE in vivo to assess safety and efficacy. If successful, the vaccine will exceed previous formulations in inducing a broadly efficaceous yet safe immune response for the RSV-naïve target population."
"9195108","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is a central idea of the NIH that basic research will lead to new approaches in medicine, and we believe that we have found one. As a result of earlier funding by the NIH, we have discovered a family of peptides that (1) target acidic tissues in vivo, including tumors, and (2) can deliver polar molecules into cells, releasing them in the cytoplasm. Studies of the peptides have led to new insights about the basic science of peptide insertion into membranes in terms of structure, energetics and kinetics, and as we learn more about the principles, we will be able to design better versions of peptides for specific applications. The peptides, which we call pHLIPs (for pH (Low) Insertion Peptides) are soluble as mostly unstructured monomers in aqueous solution, bind as unstructured monomers to the surfaces of bilayers or membranes, and fold to make helices that insert across membranes when the environment is acidic. We have established the basic energetics and kinetics of peptide insertion. We have shown that a labeled version of pHLIP targets and images many kinds of tumors in mouse models, and that the imaging reveals very small tumors (1mm) and accurately identifies tumor borders. We have also established that small cargo molecules can be delivered into cancer cells on the inserting end of pHLIP. A water-soluble therapeutic molecule can be attached as cargo to the inserting end of pHLIP by a bond that is unstable in side a cell, but stable outside the cell. When pHLIP folds at low pH and delivers the cargo across the membrane, the bond breaks and the cargo is released in the cytosol, where it may have a therapeutic effect. When injected into a mouse, a form of pHLIP-delivered treatment has been recently demonstrated to successfully target and effectively treat lymphoma in a mouse model. Our proposed studies are aimed at refining pHLIP designs for specific uses in targeted delivery of toxins and Peptide Nucleic Acids. We also plan a more advanced method for fluorescence labeling of tumors and a new method for measuring the pH at cell surfaces, a key parameter for the acidic targeting of pHLIPs. If successful, while learning more about the biophysics of peptide-membrane interactions and the physiology of cell surface acidity, we will have advanced the technology toward clinical applications."
"9399000","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is fast becoming clear that symptoms of psychiatric disorders, such as social avoidance, which are present in multiple conditions, may have singular neural dysfunctions underlying their presentation. Social abnormalities are present in autism, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety-related disorders, representing a significant portion of the population afflicted with mental disease. While many pharmacotherapies exist, the success rate of treating a majority of patients is surprisingly low. This highlights the urgency in studyin common symptoms across multiple models, while examining new brain circuits to parse out specific adaptations responsible for maladaptive behaviors. While the brain's dopamine system is clearly involved in psychiatric disorders, the brain's major neurotransmitter glutamate has also  recently been implicated in underlying certain psychiatric symptoms, yet due to its ubiquity throughout the brain, its function has been difficult to determine. Many studies of the effects of stress on the brain have seen that it alters cell morphology and electrical properties, however many of these studies have occurred in discrete brain regions without knowledge of the input to the cell. With the advent of novel viral techniques and transgenic mouse lines it is now possible to isolate specific synapses, the point of communication between cells, to discover which glutamatergic pathways are involved in a specific behavior. In this proposal I will utilize two stress paradigms (a social and non-social) to isolate the effects of social stress on social reward  processing. I will utilize manipulation of specific cells with light-activated ion channels and transgenic lines in combination with electrophysiology to study glutamatergic synapses of the thalamus impinging upon regions important in reward processing and social behavior, specifically the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. This proposal hypothesizes that social stress will have unique synaptic adaptations when compared to non-social stress and these adaptions are specifically involved in regulating social reward processing. Preliminary results demonstrate the involvement of thalamic cells synapsing on nucleus accumbens neurons in social interaction and the impaired acquisition of a social conditioned-place preference selectively by social stress. This study will seek to further understand how altering activity at these synapses can alleviate stress induced impairments in social behavior, as well as examining other thalamic based circuits that may regulate social behavior. The information gathered from these studies will provide novel starting points for developing unique therapies to alter circuit function and alleviate specific symptoms of psychiatric disorders."
"9218640","ABSTRACT  Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in mammalian development by repressing transcription of genetically linked (adjacent) protein coding genes. The archetypal repressive lncRNA is Xist, which silences nearly all genes along the inactive X chromosome. Other lncRNAs, such as Kcnq1ot1 and Airn, silence adjacent genes in smaller genomic intervals, and may function through related mechanisms. Collectively, dysregulated gene expression caused by altered function of repressive lncRNAs can cause cancers and genetic disorders that affect roughly 1 in 1,000 live births. Methods to attenuate or potentiate the biological activity of such lncRNAs could provide new means to control gene expression in disease relevant regions of the genome. However, the mechanisms by which repressive lncRNAs silence their target genes remain poorly defined, and it is unclear how modulation of their silencing potential might be achieved. The long-term goals of our research are (i) to determine the molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate gene expression and (ii) to apply this knowledge to advance human health. To these ends, we recently developed a reductionist assay to study mechanisms of lncRNA-induced gene silencing. Using the assay, we discovered a novel function of the Xist lncRNA that we hypothesize is essential for its gene silencing ability. In parallel, we developed a novel method to quantify sequence content of lncRNAs that can be used to predict lncRNA function. This algorithm ? to our knowledge the first of its kind ? allowed rational design of Xist-like synthetic lncRNAs and uncovered a recurrent sequence signature shared between Xist and hundreds of other lncRNAs, including many known to have repressive activity. Lastly, through chemical probing of Xist's secondary structure we discovered a structural context for this sequence signature. These data support our central hypothesis, that lncRNAs with a shared sequence signature silence gene expression through a common mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we will: determine the physiological consequences of Xist's novel function and the mechanism by which it occurs (Aim 1), determine the sequence and structural signatures required for silencing by Xist and related lncRNAs (Aim 2), and determine the trans-acting factors required for silencing induced by Xist-like lncRNAs (Aim 3). We are uniquely suited to pursue these objectives given our expertise, the expertise of our collaborators, and the data described in our application. In the course of our work, we will develop computational and experimental methods that can be applied to predict and study function of any lncRNA. Our study will provide novel insights into the roles of lncRNAs in cellular physiology and disease and may suggest protein and structural dependencies of repressive lncRNAs that can be exploited to control transcription in regions of the human genome that are essential for normal health and development."
"9223737","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common, lifelong, disabling disorder with unsatisfactory treatment, motivating research into its causation and pathogenesis. The heritability of SCZ is estimated at over 70%, yet recent GWAS mega analyses have explained a relatively small fraction of the heritability. Another portion of the heritability is lkely due to rare loci. Although by definition the rare loci may affect risk in only a small number of individuals, investigations of diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia show that the rare loci can potentially teach us much about the etiology of disease and even indicate new avenues of treatment. Recent publications support this contention. We propose to identify rare SCZ loci with large effects through highly selected extended pedigrees. We will leverage resources from an ongoing NIH funded Multiplex- Multigenerational Genetic Investigation (MGI). Over the past ten years, through a three- site collaboration, we have identified, intensively characterized and investigated over 43 multiplex, multigenerational SCZ pedigrees and community controls. MGI has a wealth of phenotypic data, including gene expression, structural and functional brain imaging, and neurocognitive performance measures, as well as standard clinical symptom, diagnostic and functional information on participants. From this sample, we have identified four extended families, each with three or more individuals with SCZ and an unusually high number of additional family members with non-SCZ Axis I diagnoses. We aim to identify rare SCZ risk variants in these families using an efficient and cost effective strategy that combines novel founder-specific linkage analyses, whole genome sequencing of selected individuals and panels of selected SNPs. Using the available extensive quantitative data, we will investigate the expression of the risk loci beyond affection status and take a dimensional approach to vulnerability and severity. We will also investigate the expression of the rare variants in neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. By investigating a range of highly relevant phenotypes, our proposal aims to go beyond disease gene mapping to initiate an understanding of SCZ pathogenesis. Our consortium brings expertise in SCZ, neurobiology, neurocognition, neuroimaging, and genetics to this effort. We have made all existing tissue samples and data available to the scientific community and will continue to do so."
"9197980","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American have an approximately 3-5 fold increased risk of developing end stage renal disease. Recently, coding region polymorphisms (G1 and G2) in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene has been identified that can explain this increased risk. According to recent reports, there are more than 3 million African Americans with high-risk genotype, who are at increased risk for kidney disease development. Interestingly, mutations of APOL1 can present with diverse phenotypes, including patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis (HN) presenting with low-grade albuminuria or patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and HIV associated renal disease (HIVAN) showing nephrotic syndrome. APOL1 is an HDL associated protein in the circulation, but glomerular and tubule epithelial cells, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells also express APOL1. APOL1 is a relatively recent gene and it is not present in rodents. Animal model studies proving that APOL1 is the causal gene for kidney disease development is lacking. The aim of the proposal is to understand APOL1-Associated Kidney Disease (AAKD) development. Aim1. A. Provide decisive evidence that APOL1 risk variants compared to the reference allele cause kidney disease B. Demonstrate that our cell type specific inducible mouse model system recapitulates human disease at a functional, histological and molecular level. C. Determine the critical cell type(s) for APOL1-mediated disease development by characterizing the phenotype of transgenic mice with podocyte, tubule epithelial cell, liver, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle specific inducible G0, G1 and G2 APOL1 expression. Aim2. Define whether lowering risk allele APOL1 levels can stabilize or reverse kidney disease Aim3. Understand the transcriptional regulation of APOL1 in podocytes Examine whether transcriptional suppression of APOL1 by STAT inhibitors can reduce APOL1 expression and ameliorate the mutant protein induced cytotoxicity. The studies shall have a broad significance, as APOL1 mutations might be the most common genetic cause of glomerulosclerosis; including FSGS."
"9371102","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to elucidate the mechanism(s) and the nutritional and genetic determinants of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) incorporation into DNA, and its role in the etiology of neural tube closure defects (NTDs). Impairments in folate- and vitamin B12 (B12)-dependent one-carbon metabolism (OCM) are associated with common pathologies, including NTDs. Recently, we discovered that impaired folate-dependent de novo thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis causes NTDs in mice by generating serine hydroxymethytransferase 1 (SHMT)-deficient mice. SHMT1 is the only reported folate-dependent enzyme whose disruption causes folate-responsive NTDs, which provides evidence that de novo thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis and uracil accumulation in DNA underlies NTDs. Recently, others discovered that the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)- catalyzed conversion of UDP to dUDP competes with folate dependent dTDP synthesis to regulate dUTP incorporation into DNA. The experiments described herein will test the overarching hypothesis that RNR-mediated dUDP synthesis competes with folate-dependent dTDP synthesis (via de novo dTMP biosynthesis & the enzyme dTMP kinase (TMPK)) to regulate dUTP incorporation into DNA, and that this interaction underlies folate and vitamin-B12-associated NTD pathogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary data show that maternal dietary deoxyuridine (dU) rescues NTDs in folate-deficient Shmt1+/- dams, whereas dietary uridine causes NTDs in wt mice, independent of dietary folate. This proposal integrates disparate observations in the literature, including that p53, RNR, folate and vitamin B12 are associated with NTDs, into a common mechanism and pathway. The results will establish the pathway for NTDs and inform future human and population studies for the prevention of folate- and B12-associated pathologies including NTDs. Aim I. Determine if vitamin B12 deficiency impairs nuclear dTMP biosynthesis and modifies NTD incidence in wt and Shmt1+/- mice. These studies will establish the role of dietary folate and B12 in nuclear dTMP biosynthesis and NTD pathogenesis, and clarify the associated mechanisms. Aim II. Determine if TMPK modifies NTD incidence in wt and Shmt1+/- mice. These studies will confirm that that disruption of de novo dTMP biosynthesis downstream of folate and B12 metabolism causes NTDs. Aim III. Determine the role of RNR in uracil accumulation in DNA and NTD pathogenesis in mice. This aim challenges the current dogma that uracil accumulation in DNA is caused by dUTP misincorporation due to impaired dTMP synthesis. These studies will determine if p53 and RNR expression affects uracil levels in DNA and NTD incidence independent of folate, and if the Shmt1 genotype modifies these outcomes. Aim IV. Validate the genetic and metabolic mechanisms of NTD pathogenesis by dietary rescue with metabolic intermediates. We will determine the mechanism and efficacy of maternal dietary dU in preventing NTDs in Shmt1+/- mice, and the mechanism and dose of maternal dietary uridine that causes NTDs."
"9386861","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riboswitches are structured RNAs that undergo significant conformational changes in response to specific ligands as a mechanism to regulate gene expression. In addition to several proteins, two different classes of c-di-GMP riboswitches have been implicated in the cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) second-messenger pathway, a ubiquitous signaling method in bacteria. The crystal structures for both classes of c-di-GMP riboswitches have been solved showing two different mechanisms for c-di-GMP recognition. These riboswitches are located in the 5'-untranslated regions of genes involved in biofilm formation, cell motility, and virulence factors. Since c-di-GMP riboswitches are prevalent in bacterial species responsible for tetanus, anthrax, botulism, and cholera among others, their characterization has direct therapeutic applications. Although the structure of both classes of riboswitches has been extensively characterized, very few experiments have been performed in vivo. The Strobel lab has synthesized a series of c-di-GMP analogues to differentially study the ligand binding characteristics in both c-di-GMP riboswitches. Several of these ligands also show resistance to intracellular cleavage and are ideal for studying the behavior of c-di-GMP riboswitches in the cell. This proposal seeks to determine the functions of c-di-GMP in the cell and define the role of the c-di-GMP riboswitch on bacterial gene expression using a multidisciplinary approach spanning biochemistry, structural biology, microbiology, and genetics."
"9376539","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Internalizing disorders (i.e., anxiety and mood disorders) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of internalizing disorders in patient and population samples using prospective observational designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on internalizing disorder severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training and experience in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology and machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers, environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study internalizing disorder onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of disorder onset and subtypes of disorder course based on a multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarkers). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional internalizing disorder data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder following a stressful life event (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop internalizing disorder risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are preliminary; replication is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan aims (Specific Aim 3) to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/ personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities of internalizing disorder onset and course (i.e., self-report surveys of psychological/personality and environmental vulnerabilities; home-based biomarker collection via salivary assays and portable electronic devices). Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an internalizing disorder or be at high-risk of developing internalizing disorders will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of a year. The Phase 2 feasibility study is also innovative. Despite being called the future of epidemiological research web-based survey studies of the internalizing disorders are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies of internalizing disorders tend to have very long gaps between follow-up assessments (1-4 years; increasing recall bias). The proposed bimonthly online survey assessments address this limitation. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of internalizing disorder onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors."
