"9378489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a widespread international health problem that imposes costs of over 600 billion dollars per year. This application focuses on fibromyalgia (FM), which is characterized by persistent, widespread body pain, with significant evidence of altered brain function. One of the few effective treatments for FM is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to reduce pain intensity and pain-related disability, potentially via reductions in catastrophizing, an important psychosocial factor that plays a crucial role in shaping individual differences in pain- related outcomes. It is likely that brain mechanisms underpin the beneficial effects of lowered catastrophizing and reduced pain in FM, and CBT-produced decrements in catastrophizing may act to normalize dysfunctional central nervous system pain processing. Our previous study in FM patients confirms that patients who are high in catastrophizing show enhanced pain-related activation in brain areas that process emotional aspects of pain (e.g., anterior insula and medial thalamus). In addition, catastrophizing was associated with altered pain-evoked functional connectivity between thalamus, anterior insula, and default mode network (DMN) structures such as medial prefrontal cortex. The DMN is a constellation of brain regions that mediate self- focused cognitive processing; our prior work has implicated altered resting-state functional connectivity between DMN and insula as a biomarker for clinical pain in FM. In our pilot study, a subset of FM patients was randomized to CBT or an active educational control condition. We found that CBT reduced catastrophizing and produced corresponding changes in brain activation and DMN connectivity. In the present proposal, we hypothesize that CBT-produced improvements in pain will be anticipated and mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and their associated effects on pain-related brain functioning. Participants with FM will be randomized to 8 weekly treatments with CBT or an education/attention control, and followed up for 6 months. Functional MRI data, including functional connectivity during both a resting and evoked deep- tissue pain state, will be collected at baseline, mid-treatment, and after the final treatment visit. We hypothesize that CBT will reduce catastrophizing early in treatment, resulting in adaptive changes in the brain's responses to an externally-applied noxious stimulus. These changes will then predict subsequent changes in patients' resting state connectivity in DMN and pain- relevant brain regions, which will underlie long-term improvements in clinical pain. Our overarching goal is to understand the neurobiological pathways by which CBT and reduced catastrophizing facilitate improvements in chronic pain; such information will help to refine biopsychosocial models of pain, identify potential non-responders early in treatment, and facilitate the enhancement of psychosocial interventions for chronic musculoskeletal pain."
"9282239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aspergillus fumigatus is the major causative agent of invasive aspergillosis, a severe and life-threatening disease of immunocompromised patients. A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous and adept pathogen, able to adapt quickly to the mammalian lung environment and to effectively handle the stresses encountered while growing within the human host. Because of the multi-factorial nature of fungal growth, attempts to identify individual A. fumigatus virulence determinants are often unsuccessful. However, previous studies have consistently proven that filamentous fungal pathogens must be able to coordinate proper hyphal morphogenesis in order to invade tissue and cause high mortality rates. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms supporting sustained polarized growth and the establishment and progression of invasive disease is incomplete. To elucidate these mechanisms, better models of the signaling pathways and protein interactions that regulate fungal morphogenesis must be developed. Ras proteins orchestrate multiple fungal morphogenetic processes in pathogenic fungi. Regulation of these processes by Ras plays an essential role in fungal virulence, making fungal Ras signaling an invaluable tool for probing fungal pathogenesis and identifying new targets for novel therapeutics. Although many aspects of Ras signaling pathways are often considered too highly conserved to serve as antimicrobial targets in eukaryotic pathogens, we have identified novel, fungal-specific protein domains that define fundamental differences between fungal and human Ras proteins. These include two areas of significant divergence between fungal Ras proteins and their human counterpart, H-ras: 1) the Invariant Arginine Domain (IRD), a novel domain conserved in the RasA homologs of every available fungal genome but not present in H-ras, and 2) an extended hypervariable region (HVR) in filamentous fungi. Our preliminary data show that the IRD and HVR are required for Ras function during hyphal growth and morphogenesis, revealing fungal-specific aspects of Ras signaling. The overall objectives of this proposal are to fully define the impact of these fungal-specific protein domains to Ras biology, using mutations of these domains to identify novel Ras pathway interactions critical for polarized morphogenesis and virulence. Using mutational and biochemical analyses, Aim 1 or this proposal will define the contribution of the IRD and HVR to A. fumigatus Ras biology. These studies will address how mutation of the IRD and HVR affect RasA GTPase activity, activation, localization and interaction downstream effectors. Complementing our Aim 1 studies, Aim 2 utilizes an unbiased proteomics screen to identify novel, fungal-specific Ras interactions contributing to Ras-mediated growth and virulence. Because Ras signaling is essential for fungal virulence, identification and characterization of fundamental differences between human and Ras pathways carries the long-term potential of uncovering novel antifungal therapies."

"9191596","Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is mosquito-borne alphavirus capable of producing large outbreaks. The infection presents as a febrile illness with accompanying arthralgia. The arthralgia can be debilitating in some cases may become chronic, lasting for years after infection. One question in CHIKV research that remains unknown is why there is such a wide variety in severity and duration of symptoms. To this end, the long-term goal of this study is to determine the role of host genetic diversity in CHIKV disease outcomes. To accomplish this, the Collaborative Cross (CC) genetic reference population of mice were infected with CHIKV. The CC represents a series of recombinant inbred mouse lines derived from a funnel breeding scheme of 5 common laboratory lines and 3 wild-derived lines. The resulting lines are reproducibly inbred and genetically diverse. Sixty four of these CC lines were infected and monitored for footpad swelling and pathology. The initial screen of animals produced a wide variety of phenotypes that allowed for genetic mapping to identify four separate quantitive trait loci (QTLs) for four separate phenotypic measures. The varied phenotypes observed in the 64 lines that were screened will allow us to not only determine genes responsible for a giving phenotype, but to preform descriptive analysis of poorly understood disease pathologies and to characterize a more human-like mouse model as a tool for the field of CHIKV research. In Aim 1 we propose a series of studies that will further our understanding of the biphasic swelling phenotype experienced in the majority of mouse models following CHIKV infection utilizing RNAseq, viral load, and flow cytometry. In Aim 2 we propose a two-pronged approach to describe the novel phenotype of disseminated arthritis and inflammation in an immunocompetent adult mouse, which we observed in several of the CC lines. The first approach will be to use the QTLs we discovered for disseminated arthritis and tendonitis to isolate genes of interest for these respective phenotypes. Secondly, we propose a series of studies to determine the underlying virological requirements for the disseminated pathologies. The Objective of this study is to identify novel genes and pathways that are associated with disease susceptibility and resistance while simultaneously producing tools that the field can use to advance therapeutics and vaccine development for CHIKV."

"9174841","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species are life- threatening superbugs due to their ability to escape the killing of traditional antibiotics. According to the Centers for Diseas Control and Prevention, these six types of bad bugs cause two thirds of the health care-associated infections, leading to 99,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is stunning that the annual frequency of deaths from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is comparable to those caused by HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new treatments against superbugs. Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are universal host defense molecules that have retained their potency throughout the years. To effectively exploit these interesting compounds, we have been constructing, expanding, and updating the widely used Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD; http://aps.unmc.edu/AP). This comprehensive database facilitates naming, classification, statistical analysis, search, prediction and design of novel antimicrobials with desired properties. The APD tool has facilitated the research and education in the antimicrobial peptide field and laid a solid basis for this project. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that most critical parameters can be extracted from the APD as a basis for designing and optimizing potent antimicrobial peptides that cause damage on bacterial membranes, leading to bacterial death and augmenting host defense. To test our hypothesis, we have designed the following specific aims: (1) To identify the critical parameters that determine potency of antimicrobial peptides and their mimics based on the APD; (2) To elucidate the critical modulator in antimicrobial peptides that determines mechanism of action and potential bacterial response genes; and (3) To examine the efficacy of database-designed peptides and their mimics against bacterial biofilm infection in vivo and mechanisms of immune modulation. To accomplish these aims, the PI has assembled a strong team that provides complementary expertise needed to understand host-pathogen interactions at the genetic, protein, and structural level as well as peptide-mediated immune responses in vivo using animal models. Because our database-designed compounds represent a novel antimicrobial strategy that effectively attenuated resistant superbugs both in vitro and in vivo, the outcome of this innovative research has great potential in providing potent antimicrobial agents that benefit patients."
"9179594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Enteric pathogens, which represent a major group of disease-causing agents, must overcome barrier immunity within the intestinal environment to infect a host. To counter this, the gastrointestinal tract has evolved as a physical and immunological barrier. Moreover, many enteric viruses infect intestinal epithelial cells which are both targets of and act as sentinels for infection. Increasing evidence suggests that epithelial cells sense infection directly to induce antimicrobial pathways. It is also clear that the microfloa within the intestinal tract plays a fundamental role in immunity and that imbalanced bacterial communities have detrimental consequences to immune defense. Aging animals present with immune deficiencies and an altered microbiome. Mechanistically, which microbes or microbial ligands, mediate these effects and how they impact antiviral immunity is unclear. To overcome our gap in knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control enteric viral infection, we developed an oral model of arboviral infection using the powerful genetic model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the gut presents a high barrier to infection: young wild type flies are refractory to oral challenge with enteric viruses, while inoculation into the body cavity, which bypasses the gut, results in robust infection. Importantly, we found that the ERK pathway is activated in the intestinal epithelium by infection, and that genetic depletion of the ERK pathway only in the intestinal epithelium leads to increased infection. Furthermore, we found that the microbiota plays an important role in susceptibility to infection. In young flies, te loss of commensals in the gut led to increased permissivity to viral infection, suggesting that signals from the microbiota impact innate signaling. However, we found that older flies that present with dysbiosis are more susceptible to oral viral infection. Under these conditions ablation of the commensals protects the animals from enteric viral infection. Therefore, the microbiota, depending on its composition, can either be protective or detrimental for antiviral defenses. In this proposal we will address fundamental questions in antiviral immunity by determining the mechanisms by which the microbiota and epithelial cells control immunity in the intestine against human viruses, using a genetically tractable organism with a highly manipulable microbiome and short lifespan."

"9188027","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our data indicates that STING (Stimulator of interferon genes) controls a key cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and is responsible for DNaseII-deficient lethality and chronic polyarthritis (CP) as well as TREX1-mediated SLE-like disease in mice. For example, DNaseII mice die during embryonic development due to undigested DNA derived from apoptotic cells activating DNA sensors that trigger the production of type I IFN and pro- inflammatory cytokines. DNaseII-/- mice are born normally in the absence of STING, however, without any signs of inflammation-aggravated disease. Further, TREX1-/- mice which have a median lifespan of 10 weeks due to the development of inflammatory myocarditis remain viable when crossed onto a STING-/- background, and do not exhibit such disease. Mutations inTREX1 have been shown to be involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) in humans, typified by high levels of circulating type I IFN and early death. Despite this significant progres, the mechanisms that control STING function and the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway remain to be fully clarified. We thus propose two aims. The first is to further understand the mechanisms controlling STING function, such as by phosphorylation and the triggering of cytokine production responsible for inflammatory disease. The second aim is to study the mechanisms by which Trex1 may regulate STING. These objectives will shed considerable insight into mechanisms of innate immunity as well as into the causes of inflammatory disease."
"9189317","PROJECT SUMMARY  Christianson syndrome (CS) is a monogenic, X-linked neurologic disorder caused by changes in the Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) that provides an opportunity to study both neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration (Gilfillan et al 2008). It is one of the most common X-linked disorders (Tarpey et al. 2009) and is notable for cerebellar pathology such as Purkinje cell loss (Garbern et al. 2010, Christianson et al. 1999) and cerebellar atrophy (Pescosolido et al. 2014). How NHE6 mutations cause cerebellar-associated pathology is unknown. By identifying the cellular mechanism underlying abnormal cerebellar development, novel therapeutic agents targeting progressive cerebellar symptoms can be tested. Our preliminary evidence recapitulates progressive Purkinje cell loss in NHE6 mutant mice, and motor dysfunction has been identified in these mice (Stromme et al. 2011, Sikora et al. 2015). Our previous research has shown loss of NHE6 results in endosomal overacidification, which leads to decreased neuronal arborization and BDNF signaling (Ouyang et al. 2013). Furthermore, a CS mouse model has shown to have deficits in endosomal-lysosomal functioning (Stromme et al. 2011), suggesting autophagy dysfunction as a potential mechanism in NHE6 mutations. Purkinje cell degeneration can be caused by autophagy deficits (Hara et al. 2006). Therefore, we hypothesize that NHE6 mutations cause endosomal overacidification and enhanced autophagy resulting in Purkinje cell that leads to abnormal cerebellar development and degeneration. We will also test the hypothesis these defects may be reversed by IGF-1 treatment in vitro and in vivo in our mouse model. We will address these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims. In the first aim we will demonstrate that an over-abundance of low pH endo-membranes in NHE6 mutant Purkinje cells is associated with abnormal Purkinje cell development that can be rescued or worsened by drugs in vitro. In the second aim we will elucidate a mechanism involving enhanced autophagy and decreased mTOR activity in NHE6-null Purkinje cells in vitro and in vivo that may be reversed by IGF-1 treatment. We will also examine whether IGF-1 treatment may ameliorate motor coordination deficits in NHE6 mutant mice. We will utilize cerebellar slices from an NHE6 null male mouse model to examine endo-lysosomal membranes, Purkinje cell development, autophagy, mTOR activity and IGF treatment. The information obtained from this project will provide a mechanistic understanding of cerebellar pathology in Christianson syndrome and, possibly, other neurologic disorders with cerebellar-related symptoms. Furthermore, this research may identify an FDA-approved drug, IGF, as a potential therapeutic for neurologic disorders with cerebellar dysfunction."
"9170958","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure to treat end-stage organ failure. However, transplantation of organs between genetically distinct individuals results in acute graft rejection by the immune system unless patients take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. The strength of the anti-transplant immune response, also called the alloresponse, is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In mouse models of skin and heart transplantation, we have previously found that bacterial infections at the time of transplantation can enhance the alloresponse and promote transplant rejection. This supports the role of microbial infections as environmental factors that can modulate alloresponses, although these are not frequent environmental factors. In contrast, the communities of commensal bacteria that inhabit our body, collectively called the microbiota, share many microbial patterns with infectious bacteria, and are constantly present at barrier surfaces such as the skin and the intestine. Recent evidence indicates that the composition of the microbiota is determined by the immune system and that the microbiota, in turn, drives several effector functions of the immune system. Therefore, we have proposed the hypothesis that the microbiota is an important and omnipresent environmental factor that can enhance alloresponses and promote graft rejection. To address this question, we have used both sterile mice devoid of microbiota and conventional mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics to reduce microbiota diversity. Our preliminary results show that both sets of mice display prolonged skin graft survival compared with control animals, demonstrating that the microbiota indeed enhances the strength of the alloresponse and accelerates graft rejection. In this application, we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which the microbiota promotes graft rejection, as well as the consequences on the composition of the microbiota of immunosuppression and ongoing alloresponses. Finally, we will attempt to manipulate the microbiota for therapeutic purposes to limit the strength of the alloresponse and prolong graft survival. This research will guide follow up studies in humans to identify the impact of microbiota on alloimmunity and graft outcome. As the composition of the microbiota can be manipulated via anti-microbials, as well as prebiotics (diet), probiotics (beneficial bacteria) and postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism), this line of research has important possible clinical benefits."
"9261099","This proposal requests funds to support the annual Autumn Immunology Conference (AIC). The AIC was established in 1972 to promote Immunology research in the upper Midwest region of the United States. The conference provides a forum for the exchange of scientific data and ideas, fosters collaboration between scientists at different institutions, and provides career development and education opportunities to a diverse group of individuals with an interest in Immunology. The scientific focus of the meeting is intentionally broad; it includes basic Immunology and related biomedical fields such as cancer biology, pathogenesis, vaccine development, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Special emphasis is given to providing pre- and post-doctoral trainees with an opportunity to share their data, participate in scientific and career discussions, and to meet and exchange ideas with established investigators. The organizers also seek to attract, involve, and promote the careers of women and racial/ethnic minorities that are underrepresented in science. These objectives are met by inviting a group of outstanding Immunology researchers (12-13 each year) from around the world, to speak at the meeting. All presenters present both an oral and poster presentation in sessions that are designed to provide the greatest opportunity for feedback to the trainees. Finally, scholarship programs, career development workshops, and mentoring luncheons promote the inclusion of minority scientists and seek to recruit undergraduates into the discipline of Immunology."

"9184557","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurotoxic injury to the developing CNS is linked to neurological disease in humans but mechanisms that may predispose to such conditions remain very poorly understood. Exposure to elevated levels of the essential element manganese (Mn) causes a spectrum of neurochemical and neuropathologic changes that can culminate in irreversible neuronal injury in subcortical and cortical structures. Children appear to be more vulnerable to Mn than adults and recent epidemiological evidence links high Mn in drinking water to cognitive and behavioral impairment in children but the basis for the apparent greater sensitivity of young individuals is not clear. Persistent inflammatory changes in glial cells may b a potential link between exposure to Mn early in life and heightened susceptibility to neurotoxic injury and neurological dysfunction during aging because neuroinflammation is now recognized as a central feature in the progression of manganism and other neurological disorders of the basal ganglia. It is the central hypothesis of this proposal that Mn exposure during development stimulates  NF-kB-dependent intercellular signaling between microglia and astrocytes, resulting in ongoing neuroinflammation that enhances susceptibility to neurological dysfunction during aging. This hypothesis will be tested by three Specific Aims that will examine: the role of glial- specific NF-kB activation in promoting Mn-induced neurotoxicity during development and aging (Specific Aim 1), critical cell-cell interactions between astrocytes and microglia necessary for amplifying inflammatory activation and neuronal injury (Specific Aim 2), and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in astrocytes mediating NF-kB-dependent induction of neuroinflammatory genes (Specific Aim 3). We will use a two-hit model in NF-kB-EGFP reporter mice and astrocyte-specific NF-kB knockout mice generated in our laboratory that expose animals to Mn from pre-weaning through puberty and then examine their susceptibility to the dopaminergic neurotoxicant, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We except to identify temporal patterns of NF-kB activation in astrocytes and microglia that correlate with onset of neuroinflammation and that astrocyte-specific loss of function of NF-kB activity will mitigate the neurotoxic effects of Mn, both in developing mice and during aging. We also expect that exposure to Mn during juvenile development will lead to greater neurological dysfunction during aging due to persistent neuroinflammation that increases neuronal dysfunction, relative to mice without prior exposure to Mn. Collectively, the proposed Specific Aims will build upon previous work from our laboratory to address key mechanistic questions regarding critical cellular interactions between astrocytes and microglia that potentiate neuronal dysfunction caused by developmental exposure to Mn."
"9259592","Project Summary/Abstract Fats or lipids are thought to be deleterious to human health, but recent research has begun to identify beneficial roles for these molecules. Branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, named FAHFAs, are a newly discovered group of lipids that are produced in mammalian tissues (mouse and human), with highest levels in adipose (fat) tissue. Administration of purified FAHFAs to mice reverses diabetes and reduces inflammation, indicating that raising the levels of these lipids in vivo would be of therapeutic benefit. Indeed, analysis of FAHFA levels in humans revealed that people with type 2 diabetes had lower FAHFA levels than healthy individuals. Administration of pure FAHFAs in mice provides an experimental framework to study these lipids, but lipids make inferior drugs because they are not absorbed well and at high doses they can cause problems in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, an alternative approach to raising FAHFA levels would be to inhibit the proteins that are responsible for degrading these lipids in vivo. By blocking these proteins, FAHFA levels should increase leading to improved health, such as reduced inflammation. As new lipids, very little is known about the proteins and metabolic pathways (i.e., the biochemistry) that are present in the body to control the concentrations of FAHFAs. Recent work reported the first two enzymes capable of degrading these lipids, but these enzymes are not thought to be present in adipose tissue where the highest levels of FAHFAs are found. In new data introduced in this application, an adipose tissue enzyme called Ces3 in mice and CES1 in humans is found to degrade FAHFAs. And mice that lack Ces3 have higher FAHFA levels suggesting that this enzyme can also control FAHFA concentrations in a living animal. Ces3/CES1 are already interesting genes because the loss of these proteins from mice dramatically improves their metabolic health. As a result, Ces3/CES1 is a potential target for treatment of metabolic disease, but to date, no natural substrates for this enzyme have been reported. By defining the lipid substrates of Ces3/CES1 in vitro, in vivo, and pharmacologically, this application has the potential to provide the mechanistic insight necessary to promote the development of Ces3/CES1 inhibitors as a new class of anti-diabetic and anti- inflammatory drugs."
"9190348","Project Summary/ Abstract This proposal builds upon the candidate's demonstrated commitment to a career in clinical research and interest in body composition and clinical outcomes in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The core components of this comprehensive career development plan include: 1) advanced didactic instruction and completion of a Master's degree in Epidemiology and Clinical Research, 2) implementation of a hypothesis- driven research project evaluating the prevalence and clinical significance of increased adiposity and relative sarcopenia in adults with and without CKD in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 3) tailored mentorship and participation in multidisciplinary work-in-progress conferences and seminars, and 4) experience with primary data collection and management through collaborations on the mentors' ongoing studies. The overarching goal is to inform the development of a K23 proposal that will ultimately lead to improved nutrition, body composition, and outcomes in patients with CKD. Sarcopenia is a frequent complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the prevalence and clinical significance of sarcopenia in adults with non- dialysis requiring CKD have not been established. Obesity is also common in the CKD population and is associated with progression to ESRD. Higher fat mass is strongly associated with higher muscle mass; therefore, conventional definitions of sarcopenia may fail to capture low muscle mass relative to fat mass among persons with higher fat mass, i.e. relative sarcopenia. Measures of body mass index do not distinguish between muscle and fat mass, and therefore may misclassify individuals with sarcopenia and/or excess adiposity. Prior studies of body composition in adults with CKD defined obesity based on a high percent body fat (%BF); however, this is a limited index of adiposity in those with sarcopenia: in two individuals with the same fat mass, a lower lean mass will result in a higher %BF. In contrast, fat mass index (FMI kg/m2) is a measure of adiposity that is independent of lean mass. The proposed study will leverage the DXA body composition data available in approximately 14,000 NHANES participants (including 1,075 with CKD stages 3 to 5) to generate age, sex and race-specific standard deviation scores for appendicular lean mass index (ALMI, kg/m2) relative to FMI as a measure of relative sarcopenia. Our preliminary data demonstrate that this measure was associated with poor physical function and incident disability in older adults while the conventional ALMI measure was not. The objectives of the study are to determine if the prevalence and degree of relative sarcopenia and excess adiposity differ in NHANES participants with CKD, compared to those without CKD, and to determine if relative sarcopenia and excess adiposity are associated with increased risk of mortality in NHANES participants with and without CKD. The results will identify CKD patients at greatest risk and inform future interventions to improve body composition."

"9282950","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is strong evidence that the environment experienced in utero can contribute to the development of cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health and disease in childhood and adulthood. Understanding the mechanisms that account for these relationships can impact the development of novel treatment and prevention efforts to reduce long-term health risks. Emerging published evidence, from our own laboratory and others, is suggesting that the placenta, as a master regulator of the intrauterine environment and of fetal development plays a critical role in the developmental origins of health and disease, and thus is an ideal tissue in which to study mechanisms underlying the effect of the environment on newborn and child health. Work from our group has linked altered expression of specific microRNA in the placenta, which can impact tens to hundreds of genes, to newborn outcomes including growth and neurobehavioral development. We propose the hypothesis that variation in expression of miRNA in the placenta acts as a mediator of the impact of common environmental exposures, specifically trace metals on neurobehavioral and growth outcomes. Further, we hypothesize that variation in miRNA expression in the placenta is linked mechanistically to these outcomes by (1) impacting placental gene and protein expression thereby altering placental function and potentially altering levels of serum neuropeptides and hormones regulated by the placenta, and/or (2) acting to signal to the mother or developing fetus by being packaged as exosomes and released into maternal or fetal circulation where they can impact various tissues of the mother or developing child thereby altering development. We will employ the existing resources of the ongoing New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study and the Rhode Island Child Health Study, which have similar study designs and exposure assessment tools and which represent populations of infants exceeding 2,000 newborns. These cohorts have established biorepositories of placental tissues to allow sensitive and robust assessment of genomic and epigenomic features including microRNA expression as well as infant and maternal toenail samples for sensitive detection of trace metals representing chronic long-term exposures. We aim to comprehensively profile the expression of microRNAs to examine their association with newborn outcomes including growth and newborn neurobehavior, assessed using the validated, prospectively predictive NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales. We will also examine the effect of altered miRNA expression on target mRNA and protein in placental tissue and in circulation. These examinations will provide critical insight into the mechanisms of the developmental origins of lifelong health, will highlight novel pathways affected by exposures and driving children's health that can be targeted for prevention and treatment, and will identify novel biomarkers which can be used to identify, children at-risk so that necessary interventions can be employed early enough to prevent future disease."

"9223631","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Alcohol dependence is a devastating psychiatric disorder to individuals and their families, with substantial medical and societal impact. There exists a serious public health need to identify and characterize new and more effective treatments. Chronic alcohol intake leads to long lasting changes in reward- and stress-related neuronal circuitry. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an integral component of this circuitry. The stability of behavioral alterations associated with chronic alcohol abuse suggests maladaptive neuroplasticity that is likely achieved through transcriptional mechanisms. Recent clinical trials have revealed that deep brain stimulation of the NAc decreases alcohol craving and relapse in alcohol dependent subjects (Vogues et al., 2012). Much is unknown about the efficacy and mechanisms underlying treatments that alter brain activity. In the proposed studies, I will use DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) to increase or decrease neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens and measure alcohol binge drinking (using the limited access paradigm, drinking in the dark) and relapse-like drinking (using chronic intermittent ethanol induction of dependence followed by limited access drinking) behaviors in mice selectively bred to drink intoxicating levels of alcohol in a limited access paradigm. Interestingly, preliminary data reveal that increasing NAc activity decreases binge drinking without altering alcohol reward. Since this is the first time a study such as this has been conducted, it will be essential to determine if these changes in behavior are accompanied by changes in expression of plasticity-related genes and identify DREADD/alcohol responsive gene expression networks using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA Seq). These findings could have vast implications for alcohol research and treatment."
"9269795","PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate HIV incidence estimates are critical for monitoring the HIV/AIDS epidemic and evaluating interventions for HIV prevention. We have developed multi-assay algorithms (MAAs) that provide accurate incidence estimates. However, there are new challenges in this field of research. With increasing use of antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment and prevention and a push towards early treatment initiation, more individuals, including those with recent infection, will be virally suppressed. This will impact cross-sectional incidence testing: higher rates of viral suppression will increase misclassification with standard serologic incidence assays; low viral load (VL) will no longer serve as biomarker for non-recent infection; and use of HIV diversity assays for incidence testing will be problematic, since it may not be possible to analyze samples with low VLs. Our hypothesis is that well-characterized samples, novel assays, and statistical modeling can be used to develop methods that provide accurate cross-sectional incidence estimates in the evolving landscape of HIV treatment and prevention. The Specific Aims of this project are: Aim 1: Expand a repository of well-characterized samples with information on the duration of HIV infection;  use these samples to evaluate performance of HIV incidence assays. Our repository includes >17,000  samples from individuals with known duration of infection. We will continue to expand this repository,  focusing on key populations and settings with high rates of viral suppression. These samples repository will  be used to evaluate serologic HIV incidence assays. Aim 2: Use massively multiplexed VirScan assay to identify serosignatures that discriminate between recent  and non-recent HIV infection. VirScan uses phage display, immuno-precipitation, and next generation  sequencing to measure antibody reactivity to >3,300 HIV peptides. We will test samples from Aim 1 with  VirScan and will use the data to identify ?serosignatures? that distinguish between recent and non-recent  infection, independent of VL. We will also use VirScan data to develop multi-peptide immunoassays (EIAs). Aim 3: Develop MAAs for HIV incidence estimation and validate the top-performing MAAs using independent sample sets from cohort studies and clinical trials with known HIV incidence. Data from Aims 1 and 2 will be  used to identify MAAs that maximize accuracy and minimize cost of cross-sectional incidence testing. The  performance of MAAs and VirScan-based EIAs will be validated by comparing incidence estimates obtained  with these methods to those observed in longitudinal follow-up in cohorts and clinical trials. Based on our prior work and preliminary data, we believe that these studies will identify accurate, cost- effective methods for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation for use in diverse populations and settings. This work will have direct public health benefit, providing improved methods for surveillance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, targeting prevention interventions, and design and evaluation of HIV prevention trials.

"9192867","ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly-diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than 33 million individuals throughout the world. One in four Americans above the age of 40 will be diagnosed with AF in his or her lifetime. AF accounts for one-fourth of all strokes and is also associated with an increased risk of dementia, heart failure, and death, even in patients receiving optimal evidence-based care. Despite the profound healthcare burden caused by AF, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms that provoke the arrhythmia in patients. Hence, new pathophysiologic insights into AF susceptibility are essential to guide improved therapeutic and preventive strategies to reduce the unacceptable burden of stroke, death, and hospitalizations associated with AF. TBX5 has been associated with AF both through GWAS and familial inheritance. However, the role of TBX5 specifically in the adult atrium has not been investigated. We now generate compelling preliminary data using conditional deletion of Tbx5 in the adult mouse using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. This strategy of conditional deletion in adult mice bypasses the developmental requirements of TBX5 and permits study of TBX5 in normally developed adult hearts. We found that deletion of Tbx5 in the mature myocardium leads to reproducible, spontaneous atrial fibrillation in the absence of heart disease or any structural abnormalities. Preliminary gene expression analysis in the atria after removal of Tbx5 reveals misregulation of many genes linked to AF, including a number of ion channels and the transcription factor Pitx2, the most frequently implicated AF susceptibility locus. We hypothesize that TBX5 drives a gene network in the adult atria which includes PITX2 and coordinates the maintenance of atrial rhythm in the adult heart. This proposal will define the mechanisms by which adult removal of Tbx5 results in atrial fibrillation, and delineate the pathways by which TBX5 and maintains normal atrial rhythm. Defining these atrial transcriptional networks will allow prediction of AF risk and a strategy for primary prevention.  "
"9186452","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenic and its arsenical derivatives are estimated to effect greater than 200 million people worldwide. Exposure to arsenicals comes from a number of sources such as contaminated drinking water, soil or as an airborne pollutant. Various epidemiological studies have linked chronic arsenic exposure to a number of disease states including cancer of the lungs, bladder, or skin; metabolic diseases such as diabetes; cardiovascular and other vascular diseases; and skin problems such as 'black foot disease'. In addition to the epidemiological studies there has been a great deal of effort to understand the mechanisms of pathology, but to date many questions along these lines remain obfuscated. Part of the problem with understanding arsenic toxicity is the sheer number of cellular systems that arsenic alters. For instance arsenic leads to oxidative stress, compromise of protein quality control, heat-shock response, and cell-cycle alterations to name a few. Work from our lab has identified a crucial link in the effects of arsenic on cells. Chronic treatment with low levels of arsenite (one of the oxides of arsenic) leads to a compromise of autophagy, a major protein quality control pathway. This breach comes at the step of autophagosome/lysosome fusion, leading to a build-up of autophagosomes and high levels of the autophagy specificity factor, p62. Critically, p62 contains a recognition element for Keap1, which is a substrate recognition factor in the Cul3-Keap1-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This E3 complex normally maintains a low level of the oxidative stress responsive transcription factor, Nrf2. In the presence of excess p62, Keap1 is occupied, allowing for constitutive, high level expression of Nrf2 and subsequent activation of antioxidant response element regulated genes. This high-level expression confers a growth advantage on the cells and can lead to diseases such as cancer. Despite these mechanistic leaps, it remains the mechanism by which arsenite interferes with autophagy is unknown. In the present research program we propose the hypothesis that arsenicals interfere with the AAA+ protein quality control machine, p97. This provides a critical link between arsenic and autophagy as well as other protein quality control mechanisms. To probe the detailed mechanistic underpinnings of this arsenic-mediated breach we will use an array of detailed mechanistic enzymology studies, coupled with cellular biochemistry, and in vivo studies. These efforts will be greatly aided by the multi-PI team we have assembled."
"9180625","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite evidence from human and animal studies that clearly identifies neurotoxicity as the primary adverse endpoint; the long-term effects of repeated occupational and environmental exposures to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) remain poorly understood. There is also a critical need to investigate the susceptibility of children and adolescents to pesticides, since the developing brain may be uniquely sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of these agents. Partnering with colleagues at Egypt's Menoufia University, we conducted a pilot study of adolescents working for the Ministry of Agriculture as pesticide applicators for the cotton crop. Building on these preliminary findings, we propose a longitudinal study to investigate the relationship between sensitive and specific biomarkers of pesticide exposure, effect and susceptibility and multiple measures of neurobehavioral function in this unique cohort over a 5 year period to assess cumulative and potentially reversible effects. Our overarching hypothesis is that the inherent plasticity of the developing adolescent brain will allow recovery from selected neurobehavioral deficits associated with short- and long-term exposures to pesticides. Three aims address this hypothesis, expand on the successful efforts begun in the R21 project, to build research skills at Menoufia and work with the Ministry of Agriculture to identify susceptible populations and put into place appropriate measures to reduce pesticide exposure. Aim 1 will determine the association between pesticide exposure and neurobehavioral function in a longitudinal study among adolescent cohorts with occupational (applicators) or environmental (non-applicators) exposures to test the hypothesis that neurobehavioral performance deficits associated with short-term exposure occur during the application season but that there is recovery of selected neurobehavioral functional domains after the summer spray season ends. Some deficits may persist beyond the spray season or after repeated summer spray seasons. A biologically- based exposure assessment will incorporate levels of urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos and profenophos (OPs) and alpha-cypermethrin (pyrethroid) and functional polymorphisms in key enzymes involved in OP metabolism (CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and PON1) as modifiers of bioeffective dose. Aim 2 will expand the research capacity at Menoufia University by establishing a Research Institute that will: (a), build epidemiologic research capacity (b) teach grant writing and research skills in shot courses held locally and through videoconferences, (c) provide mentoring and international education experiences, and (d) implement a pilot project research program. This is designed to create a competitive research culture at Menoufia University. Aim 3 will develop a training program for the Ministry of Agriculture workers (including applicators) on ways to reduce exposure through hygiene, behavior (work practice) change and use of protective equipment, addressing both environmental (home) and occupational exposures. A randomized controlled trial design will evaluate the impact of the training program on reaction, behavior, and knowledge (learning and retention)."
"9261236","Abstract The purpose of this application is to provide the applicant training to become an independent investigator with a research program that investigates the sociocultural conditions contributing to sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk of young Black women. STIs are defined as preventable communicable diseases, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and genital herpes that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual contact. Annually more than 20 million Americans contract STIs and cost the health care system approximately $16 billion. Women are biologically more susceptible to STIs than men. Each year 1 in 4 women contracts an STI placing them at risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, HIV/AIDS, newborn morbidity, and death. Nearly half of newly diagnosed STIs occur in young people aged 15 to 24 years. More than 40% of infected young women have at least one subsequent STI within a year. Black females in this age group are disproportionately affected by STIs. Black women are twelve times more likely to contract gonorrhea and five times more likely to contact chlamydia than white women. Black women are nearly three times more likely to have a subsequent STI than women of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. The majority of STI research that includes Black women focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention and either excludes other STIs or considers them secondary to HIV. Most STI prevention studies focus on primary prevention of first infection, rather than recurrence among women previously diagnosed with STIs, who have a high likelihood of becoming re-infected. Limited research has been conducted on the prevention of recurring STIs. Gaining an understanding of the sociocultural conditions that influence sexual behavior is essential to inform interventions designed to reduce STI risk and recurrence. Thus, the purpose of the proposed grounded theory study is to develop a conceptual model from the perspectives of young Black women that explains the sociocultural conditions contributing to STI risk, specifically to the risk of recurrent infection. The proposed grounded theory study will facilitate development of a conceptual model, based on the interview data from 20 to 30 young Black women with a history of STIs, to explain the sociocultural conditions contributing to STI risk. The training grant will support coursework, directed study, mentorship, and resources to accomplish the short-term goal of building a foundation for a program of research focused on STI prevention in young Black women. The long-term goal is to develop evidence-based interventions to prevent STIs in women of color, including but not limited to Black women. The proposed study is well-aligned with the NINR priority of ?Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness? by focusing on ?nursing science that seeks to promote health and prevent illness?.in minority and underserved populations.?"
"9171936","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application for grant AI-41236-A1. Our major goal is to obtain definitive proof that the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg) control self-tolerance. We have recently succeeded in establishing an excellent autoimmune disease model induced by Treg depletion alone. Diphtherial toxin treatment of B6AF1-DEREG mice (express DTR-foxp3 transgene in artificial chromosome) leads to transient Treg loss for 7 days. Six weeks later, the mice develop multi-organ autoimmune disease that targets the testis, ovary, stomach and lacrimal gland. The mice produce autoAb against the testis germ cell and Leydig cell Ag, ovarian theca cell Ag and the ZP3 (335) epitope, and gastric ATPase. They are healthy-looking, gain weight and survive normally. Our focus is on the gonadal diseases because they resemble the disease in >60% of autoimmune polyendocrine sydnrome type I (APS1) patients. APS1 is rare but of immense significance. The cause is a mutation of the autoimmune Responder (AIRE) gene, a known participant in central tolerance. We are acknowledged as leaders in gonadal autoimmunity research and the best candidate for this investigation. We discovered that Treg depletion leads to a Teff and Treg imbalance, governed by the intrinsic Treg strength. The net response determines disease outcome. B6AF1-DEREG mice show dominant Teff cell response and develop autoimmune disease. B6-DEREG mcie show a dominant Treg response and do not have autoimmunity. We also discovered that the Teff cells of B6AF1-DEREG mice with AO resist Treg suppression, and they express low levels Cbl-b. Cbl-b is an E3 ligase the controls the TCR response threshold. In Aim 1, we will verify the T cell imbalance hypothesis and study the causal relation of Treg resistance to Cbl-b expression. Unexpectedly, the germ cell-specific response is Th2-dominant and autoAb is IgG1-dominant. AO is not associated with testis inflammation, but is associated with massive IgG1+ immune complex (IC) that targets germ cell Ag. Importantly, the cause of testis failure and infertility are Sertoli cell injury and blood-testis barrier (BTB) disruption. The Sertoli cells normally control BTB and sperm production. In Aim 2, we will investigate eosinophil in promoting the IgG1 autoAb response, and define an Fc receptor-dependent mechanism for the Sertoli cell injury as a cause of AO. Also unexpected is the finding that B6-DEREG mice, after Treg depletion, spontaneously lose testis immune privilege and stop making sperm. Amazingly, this novel process is reversible with full recovery, and thus it can be controlled by Treg. The B6AF1-DEREG mice also develop a similar early innate cell injury in the testis. In Aim 3, we will determine whether this unique, non-autoimmune innate cell- mediate injury will predispose the testis to autoAb-mediated AO. In summary, our exciting and highly novel project will provide definitive proof for Treg as a non-redundant tolerance mechanism. Our study will define many Treg functions relevant to many common human diseases such as: pemphigus vulgaris, IC disease (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, APS1, gastritis, and male and female idiopathic infertility due to gonadal failure."
"9188921","Our long-term goal is to provide clinicians with a theoretical framework of mobility and framework-derived measurement tools to improve rehabilitation of persons who have mobility restrictions consequent to a stroke. Recovery of mobility from stroke requires restoration of independent muscle excitation from the mass extension and flexion muscle co-activation commonly observed post-stroke. The basis of the theoretical framework used in this study is to delineate the relationship between lesion damage to ipsi- and contra-lesional corticospinal tract and cortico-recticular pathway and muscle co-excitation impairment and the limitations in the execution of the biomechanical functions needed in mobility (e.g., body support and forward propulsion). In past projects where self-selected walking was studied, healthy persons were found to use a small set (n=4) of independent muscle co-excitation patterns to execute the critical biomechanical functions. Persons after stroke walk slower with suboptimal execution of the biomechanical functions because they cannot activate the patterns independently; instead they merge the patterns. The aim of this project is to assess the limits of mobility capability of healthy and post-stroke persons within this framework by having them perform a variety of tasks fundamental to household and community walking, such as how fast they can initiate or stop walking: speed up or slow down, or turn. Experimental analyses of each task will determine how the number, muscle composition and neural control (timing and magnitude) of the independent muscle co-excitation patterns limit body support, body forward propulsion, body mediolateral control, leg propulsion, foot clearance, and muscle mechanical energy production. Across the different mobility tasks, we expect the merging of the late stance pattern (e.g., plantarflexors) with the early stance pattern (e.g., hip and knee extensors) into a stance pattern will be one primary coordination impairment because their contributions to body support and propulsion then conflict at times or are wrongly timed. Another primary coordination impairment expected is the merging of the swing-to-stance pattern (e.g., hamstrings) into the early stance pattern such that leg deceleration at the end of a step cannot be independently controlled. In future projects the relationships found here delineating how muscle coordination impairment limits biomechanical function execution will be used to create a clinical assessment and decision-making ?toolbox? capable of inferring patient-specific deficits in muscle coordination and biomechanical function execution, and their impact on limiting household and community walking. Thus, clinicians will be able to guide individual treatment and monitor individual rehabilitation progress."
"9184558","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the physicochemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) contribute to hazard generation in the lung. Without this knowledge, it is difficult to evaluate CNT safety in a predictive and affordable manner. The long-term goal of our multidisciplinary approach is to develop a predictive toxicological approach for CNT safety assessment in which the physicochemical properties leading to hazardous interactions at the nano/bio interface can be used to understand the materials' pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic effects in the lung. The overall objective of this application is to develop a series of single- wall (SW) and multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) libraries that can be screened by robust cellular assays to establish quantitative structure activity relationships (SARs) and hazard ranking of the tubes' potential to induce pulmonary damage. Our central hypothesis is that tube dimensions (including length, diameter and aspect ratio), state of dispersion, catalytic surface chemistry, electronic properties and purity play key roles in initiating cooperative cellular interactions in macrophages and cellular elements from the epithelial- mesenchymal trophic unit, which are key to the development of development of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the quantitative contributions of specific physicochemical properties to hazard generation is known, it will be possible to use a predictive toxicology approach for expedited safety assessment of CNTs as well as their safer design. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1: To develop hazard ranking that relates the properties of well-prepared and characterized MWCNT and SWCNT libraries to mechanistic toxicological responses in epithelial cells and macrophages, with a view to develop quantitative structure- activity relationships (SARs) that predict in vivo injury potential. Aim 2: To develop and validate a predictive toxicological paradigm for pulmonary hazard potential of well-characterized commercial and purified CNTs, using in vitro SAR-based hazard ranking and grouping of materials that can also be used towards a tiered risk assessment approach. Aim 3: To use covalent and non-covalent surface modification to demonstrate the feasibility of safe-by-design approaches for CNTs, using a predictive toxicological approach. Our approach is innovative, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo, namely the use of purified and well- prepared CNTs that are investigated according to robust toxicological mechanisms that predict the in vivo toxicological outcome. The proposed research is significant because: (i) it addresses the concern of how to perform CNT safety assessment using a robust, quantitative scientific platform; (ii) the establishment of a robust safety platform based on grouping of CNT properties that can be used for control banding and read- across risk assessment; (iii) the research will develop an affordable and rational scientific platform for regulatory decision-making and product approval towards the marketplace."
"9235615","Abstract Malarial infections are still one of today's great global health problems, with nearly 600,000 deaths and millions of new infections occurring annually. Plasmodium parasites (the causative agents of malaria) are transmitted between a mosquito vector and their mammalian host, and they have developed intricate systems to adequately prepare for transmission, and to then to firmly establish an infection. Because relatively few parasites are passed between the host and the mosquito vector, these two transmission events have long been prioritized as optimal points for interventions with drugs and vaccines. Recent work has demonstrated that Plasmodium parasites have evolved to use selective translational repression just prior to transmission events to store the mRNAs that it will need for the next steps of development. The adaptation of translational repression for these purposes is a logical choice, as the transmitted gametocytes and sporozoites cannot anticipate when they will be transmitted, and this system allows the parasite to always remain ready for that moment of transmission to occur. While some of the key proteins and mRNAs involved in these events have been identified, many important questions still remain. What proteins are responsible for selecting mRNAs for translational repression? What proteins act to repress them? What attributes of an mRNA will flag it to be selected for translational repression? In this proposed work, we will leverage new technological and experimental approaches to answer these questions, and by doing so, we will better understand the fundamental mechanisms that the parasite has evolved to be efficiently transmitted in both the gametocyte and sporozoite stages. Moreover, we will observe similarities and differences in how the parasite uses translational repression at these two stages in both rodent- infectious, and human-infectious parasites. Taken together, these findings will provide the first mechanistic studies of protein/RNA complexes in sporozoites, will allow a functional comparison across stages and species, and will highlight molecular components and functions that the parasite requires for transmission that may exploited in the future as targets for new therapeutic agents."

"9192983","Loud noise exposure experienced during military service results in the two most common service-related disabilities faced by Veterans ? tinnitus and hearing loss. Recent animal studies indicate noise exposure can result in significant loss of auditory nerve synapses. Additional studies suggest that synaptic loss may be associated with tinnitus and hyperacusis. However, synaptic loss can exist even when auditory thresholds are normal, making it difficult to detect. Since clinical audiometric testing is not sensitive to this ?hidden hearing loss?, we currently have no method of testing people for this type of auditory damage. This indicates that there is a critical need to identify individuals suffering from noise-induced cochlear synaptic degeneration and the related perceptual deficits. The long-term goal is to develop strategies for prevention, monitoring and treatment of hidden hearing loss in the Veteran population. The overall objective for this CDA-2 application is to identify physiological markers of hidden hearing loss. The central hypothesis is that individuals with a significant history of noise exposure will show physiological differences in the auditory nerve, brainstem, and cortex when compared to individuals with less noise exposure and that these differences will be associated with hyperacusis and tinnitus. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data and the research literature. Preliminary data shows differences in the amplitude of wave I of the auditory brainstem response (a measure of the synchronous firing of the auditory nerve) between individuals with differing levels of noise exposure. The research literature suggests that noise exposure and tinnitus/hyperacusis may be associated with additional changes in auditory physiology. The rationale that underlies this proposal is that identification of physiological markers of hidden hearing loss and the resulting perceptual changes will facilitate the development of methods for preventing or treating this condition. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following four specific aims: 1) Identify envelope following response (a measure of the brainstem's ability to phase-lock to the envelope of a stimulus) abnormalities present in Veterans with normal pure tone thresholds and high levels of noise exposure; 2) Identify elements of the middle and late latency responses (auditory evoked potentials generated by the cortex) that differentiate noise-exposed Veterans with normal auditory thresholds from individuals with less noise exposure; 3) Evaluate Veterans with high noise exposure and normal pure tone thresholds for differences in contralateral suppression of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (a measure of the strength of the medial olivocochlear efferent feedback pathway); and 4) Investigate the relationship between hyperacusis and tinnitus and the physiological measures described in aims 1-3. The physiological measures described above will be compared across three groups: Veterans with a history of exposure to high levels of noise, Veterans with less exposure, and non-Veterans with limited noise exposure. To minimize the effects of age and hair cell loss, only young subjects with normal pure tone thresholds will be included. This approach is innovative because it investigates noise-related changes to auditory physiological measures in Veterans, a unique population of individuals with significant noise exposure history. This contribution will be significant because it will identify metrics to detect hidden hearing loss, providing the basis for a clinical test battery that can be used to aid in the prevention and treatment of cochlear synaptic degeneration in the Veteran population."
"9261153","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eukaryotic pathogens are the causative agents of some of the most devastating and intractable diseases of humans, including malaria, amebic dysentery, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and meningitis. Furthermore, many of these infectious agents are also classified as bioterrorism agents and/or cause neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is also noteworthy that infections caused by eukaryotic pathogens are increasing in the US due to globalization. Scientific meetings serve the purpose of sharing knowledge, establishing multidisciplinary collaboration, and mentoring of junior researchers (students, post-doc, junior faculty). Thus, the pace of science is accelerated by conferences. We propose to continue hosting an NIH- funded conference on eukaryotic pathogens at the Eukaryotic Pathogens Innovation Center (EPIC) at Clemson University (CU). The content of the conference is innovative because it will have equal representation of research involving parasites and pathogenic fungi and will include laboratory (basic cell biology and drug development) and field (disease ecology and implementation of treatment and control programs) sessions. CU is located in South Carolina, an IDeA-eligible state. Continuation of these NIH-funded conferences at EPIC are bringing recognition to research done in SC and the Southeast and promoting regional collaborations. Both of these serve the goal of the IDeA program to enhance the reputation and competiveness of biomedical research programs in states for which NIH-funding is historically low. In this submission, the 4th conference in this series is proposed (November 2016). In addition to the traditional oral and poster presentations, we will host a panel discussion focused on the different career paths available for young scientists. We will also fund the travel and registration fees for young scientists and students identified through the INclusiVe Excellence in Science and Technology Program (INVEST) whose goal is to increase the success of nontraditional students and underrepresented minorities in science. Based on the feedback from participants of the last conference, we are moving the venue for oral and poster presentations to the new Watt Family Innovation Center (WFIC). This newly constructed facility is specifically designed to support working collaborations and includes a 148- seat auditorium, an open-air atrium that accommodates 49 traditional easel-style posters and has mobile digital displays for electronic posters. We will continue to rigorously and systematically assess the impact of the conference and use this data in developing future meetings. Hosting regular conferences at EPIC will sustain the momentum of this research center and contribute significantly to an important area of biomedical research."
"9179589","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1/5 of adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) experience cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and/or myocardial infarction and this contributes substantially to mortality. We have made the novel and seminal observation that Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of CAP, can enter the myocardium during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and forms microscopic vacuolar lesions (i.e. microlesions) filled with extracellular pneumococci. In mice with IPD, cardiac microlesion formation was concomitant with aberrant cardiac electrophysiology indicative of ongoing heart failure. In stark contrast to cardiac infections caused by other bacteria, S. pneumoniae cardiac microlesion formation is remarkable due to the complete absence of infiltrated immune cells. Why this occurs is unknown, yet the lack of a host response is undoubtedly permissive for heart damage. We hypothesize that S. pneumoniae forms an immunoquiescent biofilm within the cardiac microlesion. Our preliminary results support this notion and demonstrate that biofilm S. pneumoniae (BF-Spn) does not incite NF?B activation from host cells nor results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our goal is to discern the host-pathogen interactions that occur during cardiac microlesion formation and identify targets for intervention. Aim 1: Determine the requirement for biofilm formation during pneumococcal cardiac microlesion formation. We will examine cardiac microlesions for the presence of biofilm extracellular matrix components and test isolated S. pneumoniae for the biofilm phenotype. We will test the ability of S. pneumoniae mutants deficient in the ability to form biofilms in vitro for their ability to form cardiac microlesions in vivo. We will compare the cytokine and chemokine response of cardiomyocytes exposed to planktonic (P-Spn) and BF-Spn. This aim will directly test if S. pneumoniae within cardiac microlesions are in an immunoquiescent biofilm. Aim 2: Characterize S. pneumoniae within cardiac microlesions and identify novel virulence determinants required for their formation. Using RNA-sequencing we will characterize and then compare the gene expression profile of S. pneumoniae in cardiac microlesions to those in the blood of infected mice. Genes with high in vivo gene expression will be deleted and isogenic mutants tested for the ability to cause cardiac microlesions. This aim will characterize how S. pneumoniae adapts to growth within the heart and identify in an unbiased manner targets for intervention. Aim 3: Characterize the cardiomyocyte response to pneumolysin exposure. We will measure the cytokine/chemokine response and susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to pneumolysin, the S. pneumoniae pore forming toxin, and bacterial cell wall. We will test if S. pneumoniae activates the NLRP3 inflammasome within cardiomyocytes. We will determine if sub-lytic levels of pneumolysin trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. This aim will discern if cardiomyocytes exposed to S. pneumoniae undergo a cell death program that is not inflammatory."
"9171364","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Immunotherapy, which focuses on augmenting host immunity against tumor-associated antigens, represents an important means to treat cancer that is yielding clinical success. Successful manipulation of T cell responses requires understanding how particular T cell subsets influence cancer development and growth. For example, Th1 and Th17 cells can augment tumorigenesis. Treg cells can block anti-tumor immune responses and thus represents one of the main obstacles to successful tumor immunotherapy. While Tregs are recognized as tumor supporting cells, the relationship between Th17 cells and tumor immunity has been controversial.             A major unappreciated element in T cell fate decisions is the metabolic environment. As part of an effort to study the metabolic regulation of T cell differentiation decisions, we have discovered that hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a critical role in driving the Th17 response. Further preliminary results suggest that lack of this molecule results in reduced tumor initiation and progression. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) further dissect the role of HIF-1 in Th17 development. We will address the breadth, and particular facets of HIF-1's contribution to the Th17 lineage. We will also touch on the suitability of HIF-1 as a therapeutic target in humans; (2) we will explore the role of HIF-1 in regulating the Th17 and Treg responses in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and cancer progression; (3) we will subsequently use these in vivo cancer models to test the therapeutic potential of HIF-1 targeting. In these studies mice will be treated with the HIF-1 inhibitors, Digoxin and Acriflavine and we will evaluate the ability of these compounds to impede tumor growth either alone or in concert with Treg depletion. Such a strategy is expected to have potent anti-tumor effects as it should, given our preliminary data and past results, simultaneously sabotage two major tumor- promoting immune cell populations"
"9171952","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The flexible regulation of emotional processes is a hallmark of normal adaptive behavior. To wit, the same stimulus or action can elicit a positive emotional response in one situation, but a negative one in another situation. In general, stimuli or actions can acquire affective meaning through experience. Subjects learn that previously neutral stimuli or actions predict rewarding or aversive events. Thus the motivational significance, or value, of stimuli can be changed by virtue of this experience. Here, value can have either positive or negative valence. Emotional responses to these stimuli may be based in large part on the representation of value. This grant explores the mechanisms by which the brain adjusts representations of the value of learned stimuli. Brain structures likely to participae in implementing these processes include the amygdala, long recognized as a critical structure in coordinating emotional responses, and the prefrontal cortex, which contains two brain areas densely interconnected with the amygdala: the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. These prefrontal areas are thought to confer the type of flexible regulation required for rapid emotional adjustments. In this grant, we will study two different ways in which the value of stimuli and/or actions may be adjusted. In Aim 1, we will study the role of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in a reversal learning procedure, whereby the previously learned associations of two stimuli reverse (or switch). We will characterize the relationship between processing in the amygdala and ACC during this task, building on our prior work studying the amygdala's relationship with OFC. In Aim 2, we will use two different tasks to study how subjects can adjust their representation of the value of a stimulus by knowing how to apply a rule. In one task, no operant actions are required of the experimental subjects, but reinforcement delivery does follow rules. In the second task, subjects must perform the correct operant action according to a rule in order to obtain reinforcement. The second task was designed to elucidate the differential role of the anterior cingulate cortex, as compared to the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, as the anterior cingulate has been proposed to play a prominent role in action valuation, error monitoring, and subsequent adjustments of behavior. This work has direct relevance to understanding the neural circuitry that becomes dysfunctional in many psychiatric disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, as well as schizophrenia. In those disorders, dysfunction in amygdala- prefrontal circuitry likely impairs the type of emotional flexibility required for normal mental health."
"9171382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this application is to develop much needed and easy to use optical and genetic tools to permit the study of astrocyte function in physiological compartments for genetically specified and tractable cell populations. Astrocytes interact with neurons via fine specialised distal extensions called peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs). However, a bottleneck to progress has been lack of methods to monitor calcium signals in PAPs, which is a crucial hurdle to overcome in order to understand diverse astrocyte functions in different parts of the brain. This application is based on advances made in our laboratory that allow us to directly measure calcium signals in PAPs. To develop such a method we modified a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) called GCaMP2 to carry a membrane tethering domain (Lck), thus generating Lck-GCaMP2. Then we improved this ~3-fold to generate Lck-GCaMP3 and expressed this in vivo with adeno associated viruses (AAV). Our recent unpublished findings show that Lck-GCaMP3 allows for non-invasive imaging with spectacular clarity. This is a very exciting innovative breakthrough that for the first time will alow researchers to directly measure physiologically relevant astrocyte signals and functions. Moreover, with recent structure-based refinements we made Lck-GCaMP5G, which is ~3-fold better than Lck-GCaMP3 and ~10-fold better than Lck-GCaMP2. We are now ready to develop novel in vivo tools so that Lck-GCaMP5G can be used by anyone and thus generalise a precise way to study astrocyte function and diversity. In Aim 1 we will generate knock-in mice expressing Lck-GCaMP5G at the Rosa26 locus. In Aim 2 we will generate novel BAC transgenic mice expressing Cre/ERT in genetically specified astrocytes. In Aim 3 we will exploit our novel mice to image astrocyte calcium signals in thalamocortical slices."

"9171943","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human V?9V?2  T cells are the major subset of ?? T cells that are found in human blood, comprising up to 5% of the T cells in healthy individuals and expanding to 20-50% during infection or disease. These cells play important roles in mediating immunity against microbial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae (the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively), and can respond potently against certain types of tumor cells. V?9V?2 T cells respond to these threats through recognition of structurally related non-peptidic phosphorylated antigens (pAgs). In tumor cells these are intermediate metabolites that accumulate due to over-production of the mevalonate pathway and in microbes they are generated during isoprenoid biosynthesis. It is largely unknown how V?9V?2 T cells recognize these pAgs; this proposal seeks to improve our overall understanding of the mechanisms behind V?9V?2 T cell activation and improve our ability to modulate this population in clinical settings. These cells also represent a prime opportunity to study alternative recognition strategies by ?? T cells, as classical and most no-classical MHC molecules do not appear to be involved in the recognition process. Our collaborators were the first to define the role of the BTN3A molecules in pAg-mediated V?9V?2 T cell stimulation and we have since then demonstrated the intracellular domain of one on them, BTN3A1, is the molecular sensor for pAg accumulation. We seek to understand the events that occur after pAg binding in our Aim1: To determine the direct molecular consequences of pAg binding to the BTN3A1 B30.2 intracellular domain. by using structural and dynamic studies including crystallography, NMR and fluorescence based measurements (FRET). In our Aim 2. To determine the supra-molecular organization of BTN3A1 molecules in the plasma membrane upon pAg or 20.1 mAb binding and its role in V?9V?2 T cell activation, we will use FRET based approaches, microscopy and protein engineering to study the factors that mediate cell surface assembly of BTN3A molecules. Finally, we will employ cross-linking and pull-downs combined with a SILAC-based mass spectrometry approach, complemented with a high-throughput genome-wide knockdown screen to pursue our Aim 3. From BTN3A1 to the V?9V?2 TCR: discovery of the relevant molecular players linking BTN3A1 to V?9V?2 T cell activation, which will define the other molecular players that are involved in pAg recognition in inducing the signals that directly lead to V?9V?2 T cell activation."
"9170743","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite that causes debilitating and sometimes life- threatening disease during pregnancy and in immunocompromised individuals, including those with AIDS. Toxoplasmosis is the second most common cause of death by foodborne illness in the USA and costs the economy billions of dollars annually. T. gondii is also a valuable experimental model for related apicomplexan parasites, including those that cause malaria and cryptosporidiosis. Host cell invasion is essential to the parasite's life cycle, and apical membrane antigen1 (AMA1) is a highly conserved transmembrane protein on the parasite surface that plays an important role in invasion. Much is known about how the extracellular domain of AMA1 interacts with its ligand on the host cell surface (RON2) during invasion, but surprisingly little is known about the function o its short, C-terminal tail, which is located in the parasite cytosol. The central hypothesis of thi project is that the cytosolic tail of T. gondii AMA1 (TgAMA1) functions in invasion-related signaling pathways, through interaction with other parasite proteins. The Aims of the project are to: (a) Determine the phenotypic consequences of specific mutations in the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail, establishing  at what step(s) in invasion the cytosolic tail functions and the specific resides involved; (b) Identify and determine the biological function of proteins that interact with the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail,  establishing whether tail mutations that disrupt invasion also affect the binding of specific proteins; and (c) Determine whether the binding of TgAMA1 to TgRON2 triggers intracellular signaling mediated by the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail, resulting in invasion-related changes to the parasite phosphoproteome. These studies address a significant gap in our understanding of the role that AMA1 plays in the invasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites. A more complete understanding of AMA1 function will generate new approaches to preventing or controlling the devastating diseases caused by this important group of human pathogens."
"9170742","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal looks at the importance of viral diversity on transmission and evolution. Viruses exist not as clonal populations but as 'swarms' of variants with mutations along the genome. Variation has not been characterised in arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), which require infection of a vertebrate host and a vector (such as a mosquito or tick). During infection of the mosquito there are several anatomical barriers that reduce the number of viral particles, thus a bottleneck is imposed on the virus. It i hypothesised that, upon infection of the mosquito vector, the amount of variation decreases, leading to a decreased rate of evolution in the arboviruses as compared to viruses with a single host. The rate of evolution is important to understand viral ecology and emergence. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and two natural mosquito vectors will be used to model viral variation present in wild-type transmission, and the impact that mosquito infection has on viral diversity. VEEV is of interest because it is both an important, naturally emerging virus and a potential bioweapon with no licensed vaccine or therapy. The virus circulates in Mexico and has caused outbreaks in equids and humans in the U.S. Viral diversity will be investigated using 3 specific aims. First, the bottleneck profile of the epidemic vector Psorophora confinnis will be determined compared to the bottleneck profile already determined for the enzootic vector Culex taeniopus. Secondly, the profile of intra-host variation of VEEV subtypes IE and IC will be determined upon infection of the mosquito vectors C. taeniopus and Aedes taeniorhynchus and an appropriate rodent host, individually and as part of a transmission cycle. The effect of the anatomical mosquito bottlenecks on viral diversity will be investigated using an established protocol to initiate a laboratory transmission cycle that approximates to that occurring naturally. The levels of diversity will be determined using Next Generation Sequencing technology to determine the minority populations present throughout the transmission cycle. This decrease in diversity may lead to a reduction in fitness due to stochastic effects. The level of drift caused b this decrease in diversity will be tested via an experimental transmission cycle. Thirdly, the change in the ability of the virus to complete a transmission cycle when the polymerase fidelity is increased by genetic manipulation will be examined. It is hypothesized that viral variation aids in viral survival therefore viruses mutated to exhibit high-fidelity in their replication will be ued in experimental infections. It is expected that viral survival will decrease. The results of this projct will enhance our understanding of arboviral population genetic dynamics occurring in the mosquito vector as well as determine the degree to which natural selection and genetic drift influence the persistence and emergence of new arboviruses. The results will translate to other emerging arboviruses such as dengue, West Nile and chikungunya, as well as provide the data to generate effective models of arbovirus emergence."
"9189197","PROJECT SUMMARY  The pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can form biofilms on both abiotic and mucosal surfaces. The presence of biofilms is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with C. albicans infections. Biofilm formation in C. albicans is mediated through a core network of 6 transcription factors, one of which is the zinc cluster transcription factor, Rob1.  We discovered that a deletion of one ROB1 allele results in heterozygous rob1?/ROB1 isolates with two distinct and disparate phenotypes. One set of rob1?/ROB1 isolates had decreased biofilm formation and decreased hyphae production while the second set of rob1?/ROB1 isolates had increased biofilm formation and hyphae production exceeding that of wild type. We analyzed the ROB1 ORF in SC5314 and identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that distinguishes the two alleles of ROB1 and codes for either a serine or proline at amino acid position 946. The rob1?/ROB1 mutants containing Ser946 have increased hyphae and biofilm formation, while mutants with Pro946 have decreased hyphae and biofilm formation. Based on this data we developed the hypothesis that the SNP in ROB1 impacts the activity of Rob1. To address this hypothesis we propose the following specific aim: Aim 1: Determine the functional significance of ROB1 allelic heterozygosity in C. albicans.  We next analyzed whole genome sequencing data from 20 clinical isolates of C. albicans to identify additional mutations in ROB1 and found multiple variants of ROB1 relative to the SC5314 reference sequence. These clinical isolates also have varying ability to form biofilms. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that mutations in ROB1 influence the ability of clinical isolates to form biofilms. To test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aim: Aim 2: Characterize the role of ROB1 indels and nonsynonymous SNPs on the ability of C. albicans clinical isolates to form biofilms.  We performed an in silico preliminary screen of 82 Zn(2)Cys6 transcription factors in C. albicans and identified 52 genes with allelic heterozygosity. We hypothesize that these allelic variations influence transcription factor function. We will test this hypothesis in the proposed specific aim: Aim 3: Identify and characterize Zn(2)Cys6 transcription factors with functionally significant allelic heterozygosity.  This study will be the first to screen and characterize allelic heterozygosity of zinc cluster transcription factors in C. albicans and to characterize the isoforms of Rob1 in different C. albicans clinical isolates."
"9171367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diminished ability of thymus to produce naive T cells with progressive aging remains a fundamental and  puzzling  phenomenon  for  immunology  and  to-date,  an  intractable  clinical  condition  that  contributes  to  immune  dysfunction  in elderly.  With  advancing  age,  the  thymus  undergoes  striking  fibrotic  and  fatty  changes that culminate in its transformation into adipose tissue. The lineage of ectopic adipocytes and  the  mechanism  of  development  of  thymic  adipocytes  during  aging  are  not  well  understood.  Using  lineage-tracing,  our  research  team  has  shown  that  FoxN1+  thymic  epithelial  cells  (TECs),  that  are  necessary  for  T  cell  development,  can  transition  and  give  rise  to  thymic  adipogenic  precursors.  Consistent  with  this  new  paradigm,  our  lates  preliminary  data  provide  further  in  vivo  evidence  that  proadipogenic  cells  in  aging  thymus  can  originate  from  epithelial  and  endothelial  lineages  via  a  secondary mesenchymal precursor. Based on our novel findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the transition of TECs and endothelial cells contribute towards the lineage of thymic adipocytes and leads to age-related thymic involution.  The  corollary  is  that  blocking  the  fibrogenesis  and  pro- adipogenic  signaling  in  TEC  and  endothelial  lineage  cells  will  protect  against  aging  of  thymus.  Experiments  in  Aim  1  will  test  the  hypothesis  1  that with  advancing  age  transition  of  FoxN1+  cells  into  adipogenic precursors via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process gives rise to ectopic thymic  adipocytes and compromises the thymic stromal microenvironment. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis 2 that  that  endothelial-lineage  cells  serve  as  adipogenic  progenitors  and  will  reveal  that  blocking  he  ectopic  adipocyte development in thymic perivascular space protect against thymic aging. The Aim 3 will test the hypothesis 3 that age-related fibrogenesis in thymus causes reduction in thymopoiesis and reveal that mechanisms that commit secondary mesenchymal cells into adipocytes participate in thymic dysfunction.   The long-term goal of this research project is to understand the mechanisms that cause thymic adiposity and to develop new approaches to prevent or reverse the process of age-related thymic involution."

We are unaware of any formalized finance and sponsored programs harmonization meetings. There are very few if any academic-based national research network within the country with a harmonized IRB system. A consortia-based harmonized IRB is needed to more rapidly implement multi-site clinical trials. The ability to have multiple IRBs cede their authority to a central IRB can markedly reduce the start-up time for a clinical trial. The network has initiated the harmonization of IRBs by working closely with all IRB directors, and presently, 16 of 18 institutions have agreed to the harmonization plan.

"9181413","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiological data support a causal link between exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter (PM) and increased lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children. During the H1N1 influenza (Flu) pandemic, exposure to PM was a potential contributing factor to the disparity in the increased levels of H1N1-induced morbidity and mortality observed in Mexico and the United States. Interestingly, the risk of LRTIs due to PM exposure is highest in infants. Despite strong evidence associating PM exposure and LRTI susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality in infants; there is very little research on this subject nd the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. We have developed a novel neonatal (<7d of age) rodent model for studying PM exposures, which we apply here to understand the effects of PM on enhanced susceptibility to LRTI and LRTI-mediated disease severity. We show that age of exposure to PM is important in predicting LRTI disease sequela and that infant exposure to PM initiated several events that may explain the epidemiological data.  First, exposure of neonatal mice to PM results in epithelial disruption. Second, adaptive immune responses following PM exposure in neonates are suppressive in nature (i.e. increased IL10 and Treg cells and decreased Th1, Tc1, and Th17 cell numbers) and not protective. The end result is enhanced severity of Flumediated disease as evidenced by increased pulmonary viral loads and mortality in neonatal mice infected following exposure to PM. Our data further suggest that PM-induced epithelial signals either cell associated or secreted (i.e. epimmunome) are used to direct this aberrant immune response to Flu by programming dendritic cells (DCs). Thus, we hypothesize that exposure to PM during infancy increases the severity of infectious respiratory disease through a process involving alteration of the epimmunome. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that neonatal exposure to PM suppresses pulmonary host defense against Flu and enhances disease. Aim 2 will define downstream regulatory T cell mechanisms induced by PM exposure which suppress the immune response to Flu. Our preliminary data indicate a role for IL10 and regulatory T cells in enhanced Flu-mediated disease. We will first determine the source of PM-induced IL10 using reporter mice and examine the necessity for IL10 in PM exposure enhanced Flu severity using IL10 deficient mice and IL10 reconstitution experiments. Aim 3 will determine the upstream signals from PM altered airway epithelium that dictate dendritic cell (DC) phenotype which in turn influences T cell responses. These studies will be accomplished using DC specific ?-catenin knockout mice and our recently developed neonatal epithelial:DC co-culture system to explore the role of ?-catenin signaling in DC function. Completion of these studies will provide us with an understanding of the molecular signaling events between injured epithelial cells and DCs crucial to understand how PM exposure alters Flu pathogenesis in infants and to identify pharmacologic targets for the treatment of environmentally-induced asthma exacerbations due to LRTI."

These people are at risk of developing cancer and nonmalignant diseases, including diabetes mellitus. Results of our previous population and laboratory studies challenge the existing paradigm that the iAs-induce diabetes is typical of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized primarily by insulin resistance due to nonresponsiveness of the liver and peripheral tissues to insulin signaling. In fact, we found significant negative correlations between iAs exposure and fasting plasma insulin and insulin resistance, suggesting impairment in pancreatic beta-cell function. We have also shown that the methylated metabolites of iAs play important roles in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure. Our population studies have linked the risk of developing diabetes to the production and urinary levels of one of the toxic metabolites of iAs, dimethylarsinite (DMAsIII). Our laboratory experiments have shown that DMAsIII and its metabolic precursor, methylarsonite (MAsIII), inhibit insulin signaling, but are even more potent as inhibitors of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic islets. Notably, the inhibition of insuli secretion by either MAsIII or DMAsIII was reversed by incubating islets in arsenic-free medium. Taken together, these data suggest that pancreatic beta-cells are the primary targets for iAs exposure and that the toxic methylated metabolites of iAs, MAsIII and DMAsIII, play an important role in beta-cell dysfunction. The goal of this project is to characterize the role of MAsIII and DMAsIII in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure and to identify molecular mechanisms by which these arsenicals inhibit GSIS in pancreatic beta- cells. We will use both in vivo and in vitro studies to address this goal. We will compare the susceptibility to develop diabetes in C57BL/6 mice which effectively methylate iAs and C57BL/6/As3mt-KO mice with limited capacity to produce MAsIII and DMAsIII. We will use insulinoma (INS-1/832-13) cells and isolated murine and human pancreatic islets to identify molecular mechanisms by which MAsIII and DMAsIII inhibit GSIS. Finally, we will determine whether the diabetogenic effects of in vivo iAs exposure in mice and in vitro MAsIII and DMAsIII exposures in INS-1 cells or pancreatic islets can be reversed by discontinuing the exposure. This is the first project to examine the role of MAsIII and DMAsIII in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure in the endocrine pancreas and to identify the mechanisms by which these metabolites of iAs inhibit pancreatic beta-cell function. Results of this work will help to better understand the phenotype of diabetes associated with iAs exposure. Additionally, data generated by this project will help to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes in populations chronically exposed to environmental or occupational iAs."
"9186526","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Title: Sequence-based pathogen discovery in post-stem cell transplantation syndromes Applicant: Ami S. Bhatt, MD, PhD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School Mentor: Matthew Meyerson, MD, PhD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and Broad Institute While the clinical application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has resulted in the ability to cure otherwise refractory hematologic diseases, there is a significant rate of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation are highly susceptible to life- threatening infections; while the pathogenic trigger is known in a subset of these cases, in many other potentially infectious syndromes the trigger remains elusive. This proposal seeks, through an innovative, translational and integrated research program, to characterize the gastrointestinal and pulmonary microbiome in healthy and diseased patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation, thus allowing for unbiased, sequencing-based identification of potential pathogens. This approach has been validated in the investigation of the gastrointestinal microbiome as demonstrated by my preliminary data, where I have successfully employed a sequencing and computational method for the identification of a new bacterium, Bradyrhizobium enterica, in a post-HSCT colitis syndrome. I intend to culture and isolate this organism and undertake validation experiments whereby the pathogenicity of B. enterica will be investigated in a murine model of infectious colitis. I will also use the sequencing-based methodology that we have developed in order to investigate the pulmonary microbiome of patients with post-HSCT idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and bronchiolitis obliterans, two post-HSCT pulmonary syndromes that are posited to be triggered by a heretofore- unidentified pathogen. In doing so, we hope to illuminate the triggers of these idiopathic illnesses and translate this knowledge into future targeted therapies. I am a senior hematology/oncology fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and have substantial prior research experience in biochemistry and molecular biology. I am currently engaged in a mentored research project as in the laboratory of Matthew Meyerson at the Broad Institute and DFCI. Taking advantage of the excellent research environment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Broad Institute, I intend to learn modern genomic and bioinformatics techniques and to apply them to comprehensively define microbial alterations that may contribute to cancer treatment-related morbidity and mortality. I am seeking a K08 award to support mentored research so that I may become facile with the use of modern tools for genomic and metagenomic analysis of diseased human tissues and so that I may learn how to functionally validate promising candidate pathogens to demonstrate disease-association and causation. I will also be co-mentored by Dr. Wendy Garrett, a well-respected, R01-funded translational oncologist at with expertise in the generation and manipulation of mouse models of human colitis syndromes. She will advise me in selecting appropriate cell-based and animal models in which to test candidate pathogens identified by the aforementioned genomic approaches, and will oversee these animal-based experiments. I am supported by my institution in my plan to devote 80% of my time to a focused research program in understanding the pathogenic perturbations of the microbiome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. I will complement this with 20% of my effort dedicated to seeing patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the clinic and to training activities including attendance and presentation at internal and external seminar series and meetings as well as independent coursework in the tools of translational investigation and modern genomic analysis. My ultimate goal is to become an independent physician-scientist with a tenure-track position at an academic cancer center with a research effort focused on complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the use of modern genomic techniques to identify new human pathogens."
"9174898","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses require the host biosynthetic machinery. A fundamental requirement is the host translational machinery for the synthesis of new viral proteins. The mechanisms by which viruses co-opt the host translational machinery and avoid the innate host defenses that act to degrade viral mRNA and diminish cellular protein synthesis to prevent or lessen the synthesis of viral proteins are not understood. The goal of this project is to define mechanisms by which mammalian reoviruses reprogram the host translational machinery to preferentially synthesize viral proteins. In particular, the project will focus on virus-mediated compartmentalization of the translational machinery, a novel pathogenic mechanism by which viral protein synthesis can be maintained during infection-induced stress. The hypotheses to be tested are that reovirus promotes the translation of its viral mRNAs by: (1) compartmentalizing translation factors and ribosomal subunits within defined sites of viral replication in the cytosol called viral factories; (2) by sequestering the GADD34/protein phosphatase 1 complex that dephosphorylates eIF2? within viral factories, thus, protecting translation of viral mRNAs from stress-induced inhibition of protein synthesis; and (3) by directly modifying the ribosome and altering its function to promote translation of non-canonical viral mRNA. Three Aims are proposed: (1) To identify mechanism(s) by which the host cell translational machinery is compartmentalized within viral factories in reovirus-infected cells; (2) To determine whether activation of the integrated stress response and compartmentalization of cellular GADD34 and protein phosphatase 1 within reovirus factories promotes translation of reovirus mRNAs; and (3) To determine the role of the viral nonstructural protein ?NS in enhancing the translation of reovirus mRNA in infected cells. Expected outcomes of this work are identification of the viral factors required for compartmentalization of the host translational machinery within viral factories, an understanding of the mechanisms by which reoviruses replicate in the face of ongoing phosphorylated eIF2? and activation of the integrated stress response, and a greater understanding of the role of the reovirus protein ?NS in co-opting the host translational machinery and modifying ribosome function. We expect that an important outcome of this proposal will be new basic information regarding viral strategies to overcome innate host defenses."
"9246381","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), one of the most lethal forms of breast cancer, accounts for ~15% of all  breast cancer deaths. IBC is particularly devastating in disadvantaged minority women who have both a higher  incidence and poorer survival. Gene expression profiling of IBC tumors has identified the hedgehog(Hh)/GLI1  pathway as higher in patients with aggressive and relapsing IBC. We have previously demonstrated that GLI1  is highly expressed in IBC cells derived from an aggressive primary IBC tumor, and that down-regulation of  GLI1 in these cells decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and reduced migration. The objective of  the proposed research is to identify those genes that are critical for GLI activation and function, including those  that are both up- and downstream in of GLI1, to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying or  driving IBC. The hypothesis to be explored is that GLI1 and the genes that it regulates promote the growth and  survival of IBC, and that identifying these genes may lead to the elucidation of novel targets. The long-term  goal is to inform novel approaches for anti-tumor efficacy in IBC. This objective will be met by applying an  innovative approach that includes utilization of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq),  genetically engineered cell lines and human IBC tissue samples. This will become accomplished by the  following Aims: 1) To identify gene expression differences between low and high GLI1 expressing IBC models  including drug resistant and GLI1-antagonist treated IBC models. Differences in gene expression patterns will  be determined by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). 2) To confirm and validate those  gene expression differences by qRT-PCR analysis including a comparison of IBC and non-IBC cell lines. To  assess overlap of those differentially expressed genes with African American patient derived non-IBC cell  lines. We will assess GLI1 expression and the expression of a subset of differentially expressed target genes  identified in Aim 1 in archival IBC patient and control tissue samples accessed from the Duke Biospecimen  Repository and Processing Core by immuno-histochemistry, and gene expression analysis. To define  functional roles for these target genes, a subset will be knocked down by shRNA or knocked out using  CRISPR/Cas9 and effects on IBC growth and survival will be determined. 3) Selective pharmacological  inhibitors will be used to assess the role of previously identified pathways in activating GLI1 in IBC and non-  IBC. We assess effects on IBC cell biology in a panel of functional and phenotypic assays. This proposed  research will further the collaboration between Duke and NCCU on IBC and will support the development of an  under-represented minority postdoctoral fellow performing research focused on transcriptional profiling of GLI1  activation pathways in IBC. Completion of these Aims will provide mechanistic insights into the consequences  of GLI1 activation and antagonism in IBC, the downstream pathways involved and inform novel approaches for  anti-tumor efficacy in IBC with the long term goal to translate new therapies for IBC into the clinic."
"9188784","?     DESCRIPTION:           Aphasia is a language impairment that can result from damage to the brain after stroke. It     impairs a person's ability to read, write, speak, and understand. Aphasia is usually treated through language?based treatments. While effective, there is substantial variability in the outcomes of these treatments. Other factors, such as long?term stress, may influence the success of treatment. Research has shown that chronic stress may change how the brain works; specifically, it may change how well the brain can remember and learn. Aphasia treatments, like other types of rehabilitation, require learning and memory. If veterans and others with aphasia are chronically stressed, they may not be able to improve with treatment. In the proposed study, the candidate will develop a measurement of chronic stress for people with aphasia. This will be accomplished by modifying a questionnaire about chronic stress, called the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen & Williamson, 1988), so it may be understood and used by people with aphasia, or people with other communication difficulties. The questionnaire will be systematically modified with the input of aphasia researchers and clinicians, outcomes measurement experts, people with aphasia, and their caregivers. Then, the modified PSS will be validated with 75 people with aphasia. These research participants will also provide a small sample of scalp hair, used to measure a stress hormone called cortisol, and provide biological information about the level of stress the participant has experienced over the last several months. Responses from the modified PSS, the amount of cortisol in the hair sample, and responses from a few select questionnaires about stress, psychological resilience, depression, and anxiety will be analyzed to assess the validity of the modified PSS, and understand how stress and other self-reported psychological factors may be related for this population. Once this study is complete, the modified PSS will be used in future research to a) determine if chronic stress is a barrier to rehabilitation of aphasia and other cognitive?linguistic impairments, and ) develop treatments for chronic stress to ensure greater treatment success for veterans and others with aphasia, and other types of brain injuries.          Many veterans and others with acquired brain injuries are chronically stressed. Chronic stress     may limit a person's neurological capacity to learn, a requirement for effective speech, language and other cognitive treatments. Veterans with brain injuries who are chronically stressed may not be able to benefit from rehabilitation, wasting the time, efforts, and financial resources of patients, families, healthcare providers and related organizations, like the VA. The proposed study will develop a measure of chronic stress to understand this factor and its impact on rehabilitation success. The ultimate goal of this research program is to find ways to minimize chronic stress and maximize treatment outcomes for veterans."
"9181411","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental exposure to environmental chemicals is a significant public health problem. In the United States alone, one in six children has some form of developmental disability. Many of these cases are attributed to developmental exposure to toxicants. There are also strong indications that some of these exposures increase the risk of adult-onset diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have implicated epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation in the persistent effects of developmental exposure to toxicants. DNA methylation plays an essential role in development and it involves the chemical modification of DNA by the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine nucleotide by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. DNMT3 group of enzymes are responsible for the establishment of de novo methylation patterns, but it is not known how they target specific DNA sequences for methylation, and how toxicants alter the methylation patterns. In this R01 grant application, the investigators propose to investigate the role of DNMT3s in normal development, as well as in the long-term effects of developmental exposure to toxicants. Using zebrafish, a well-established developmental and toxicological model system, the investigators propose to characterize DNMT3 functions and to determine their role in the response to environmental toxicants. In aim 1, the investigators will test the hypothesis that DNMT3s show DNA target specificity, with each DNMT3 paralog targeting a unique set of genes, thereby establishing DNA methylation patterns. They will determine DNMT3 target specificity in vitro by using an episomal methylation assay and characterizing the sequence specificity of recombinant DNMT3 isoforms, and in vivo using DNMT3- knockout zebrafish. In aim 2, the investigators will test the hypothesis that toxicants alter DNA methylatio patterns, and that these alterations are DNMT3-dependent. They will expose wild-type and DNMT3-knockout zebrafish embryos to environmentally relevant toxicants during sensitive windows of development, and determine the effects on DNA methylation patterns using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), a genome-wide approach for measuring DNA methylation in CpG rich regions of the genome. In Aim 3, the investigators will test the hypothesis that differentially methylated DNA regions in toxicant-exposed embryos show increased occupancy by DNMT3s. They will expose the zebrafish embryos to a toxicant that induces DNA methylation changes and determine chromatin occupancy using Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by bisulfite sequencing (ChIP-BS-Seq). Overall, the proposed studies will demonstrate the functions of DNMT3s in establishing DNA methylation patterns during normal development and in mediating toxicant-induced effects."
"9185980","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Muscle weakness is a major factor contributing to declines in functional mobility and is a strong predictor of mortality. Muscle weakness and wasting is also one of the most common pathologic clinical symptoms of environmental exposure to arsenic. However, the mechanisms and molecular pathogenesis in the etiology of arsenic-induced muscle morbidity is relatively unknown. In addition, although the contribution of arsenic exposure on stem cell function important for development has been increasingly investigated, there is an under-recognized need to know whether and how environmental toxicants like arsenic affect adult stem cell behavior and it is important to resolve how stem cell vulnerability to environmental contaminants affects the ability of otherwise healthy tissues to respond to acute injury. An enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying the clinical symptoms of skeletal muscle dysfunction is crucial for the design of strategies and policies to prevent or reduce injury. As a first step towards this end, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact and mechanisms of arsenic on pathogenic alterations of muscle function and regenerative capacity.  We find that low to moderate environmental exposure to arsenic in drinking water damages skeletal muscle by disrupting muscle composition and structure, as well as injuring mitochondria and altering mitochondrial bioenergetics. In addition to myofiber pathology, we find sustained alteration of adult muscle stem cell function, including an impaired differentiation, aberrant mitochondrial bioenergetics, and increased autophagy. Interestingly, this stem cell dysfunction induced by arsenic in vivo is sustained in isolated cells cultured over serial passages, even after the arsenic stimulus has been removed. The preliminary findings support investigation of our central hypothesis that lasting mitochondrial alterations stimulated by As(III) alter myofiber and MuSC bioenergetics to impair muscle maintenance and regenerative capacity. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate whether commonly encountered arsenic exposures induce myofiber mitochondrial dysfunction and altered bioenergetics to decrease muscle development, maintenance, and exercise capacity. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate whether direct arsenic effects on muscle stem cell bioenergetics and function result in decreased skeletal muscle regenerative potential. Success in these aims will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced losses in muscle maintenance and clinical symptoms of weakness and will elucidate skeletal muscle microenvironmental factors controlling stem cell declines. This will ultimately lead to future mechanistic investigations designed to improve functional outcomes in patients living in arsenic-endemic areas and to create prevention strategies."
"9110902","DESCRIPTION:     The prevalence of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and co-occurring AUD and PTSD is elevated among Veterans compared to civilians (Carter et al., 2011). Despite available empirically supported treatments, relapse and non-response rates remain high and individuals with co-occurring AUD and PTSD evidence particularly poor clinical and functional outcomes (McCarthy & Petrakis, 2010). Given recent estimates that 63-76% of OEF/OIF Veterans with an AUD also have a diagnosis of PTSD (Seal et al., 2011), there is urgent need to reduce chronic impairment among this growing and highly vulnerable population.  AUD and PTSD are characterized by separate and overlapping deficits in attention, memory and higher-order skills known as executive functions (e.g., planning, inhibition, self-regulation), which are in turn, associated with poor clinical and functional outcomes (Bates et al., 2013; Polak et al., 2012, Aupperle, 2012). Indeed, cognitive dysfunction can interfere with many aspects of recovery (e.g. gaining control of maladaptive, over-trained behaviors) and its targeting as a trans-disease process for direct intervention represents a potentially high-yield and innovative approach for optimizing recovery outcomes. Neuroscience-based computerized cognitive training programs for psychiatric illness have achieved growing support in the literature and demonstrate strong potential to remediate disrupted cognitive processes observed in AUD and co- occurring PTSD (Bates et. 2013; Vinogradov et al., 2012). These programs offer a highly accessible, individualized, patient-driven, non-medication treatment approach for improving cognitive functioning. Such improvements may increase emotional and behavioral control and enhance patients' capacity to effectively employ more adaptive self-management strategies. To date however, no studies have capitalized on available evidence-based cognitive remediation technologies to comprehensively target patterns of neurocognitive dysfunction that underlie both AUD and PTSD.  The proposed RR&D CDA-2 seeks to fill this gap by conducting a randomized prospective study, designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an existing web-based cognitive training program (BrainHQ; Posit Science/Brain Plasticity Institute) versus a placebo, for improving cognitive functioning and recovery outcomes. The research will be conducted iteratively, in two stages, based on the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapy Development per the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and has two overarching aims: Aim 1: Examine the acceptability, usability and feasibility of an existing web-based cognitive training program tailored for AUD and co-occurring PTSD. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of the web-based cognitive training program to improve cognitive functioning as well as clinical and functional outcomes. To test these aims, 148 Veterans with AUD and PTSD will be recruited from an outpatient Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment program. Participants will be randomized into either cognitive training or a computer game control. Individuals will then complete a baseline assessment, followed by 30 hours of home-based cognitive training or computer games over 6 weeks. Assessments will be completed each week of the training, as well as post-training and at post- training follow-up. Our primary outcome will be performance on an (untrained) neuropsychological assessment battery 6 months post-training. Secondary outcomes include alcohol use, PTSD symptoms and quality of life.  Findings from the proposed study will inform clinical practice and policy by investigating whether a cognitive training program (shown to improve cognitive functioning in other clinical populations) can improve cognitive functioning and promote gains in functional recovery from AUD and PTSD. This study will lay the groundwork to investigate the potential for cognitive training to remediate neurocognitive disruptions in other dually diagnosed SUD patient populations across different VA treatment programs. This translational program of research will help vulnerable Veteran populations achieve more optimal and enduring recovery outcomes."
"9174892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing."
"9332057","Project Summary/Abstract Hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory deficit in humans and causes a significant toll on the quality of life of those afflicted. The mammalian cochlea initiates the perception of sound by converting sound waves into electrical signals with exquisite sensitivity, speed and precision. Mechanotransduction in sensory hair cells leads to electrochemical signalsthat induce neurotransmitter release from specialized ribbon synapses, initiating the neural signal for auditory processing. The molecular composition of the auditory processing machinery in hair cells is not well understood, and the nature of how specific molecular interactions lead to physiological events for the processing of sound is unclear. Over 100 nonsyndromic forms of genetic hearing loss have been described but many of the genes linked with these mutations are unknown or not well characterized. Mutations in Catechol-O- methyltransferase 2 (COMT2) cause nonsyndromic recessive deafness (DFNB63) in humans. Our lab generated by ENU-mutagenesis a mouse mutant (termed `Add') in which a point mutation in Comt2, the mouse homolog of the human gene, leads to profound deafness. Comt2 mRNA is expressed by hair cells in the inner ear but the manner in which COMT2 contributes to auditory processing in mice and humans is completely unknown. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of COMT2 in the peripheral auditory system and the contribution of COMT2 to auditory processing. The hypothesis is that COMT2 contributes to hair cell function and auditory processing by regulating synapse function in the cochlea. Aim 1 will utilize in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and immunogold electron microscopy to precisely characterize the cell-specific and temporal expression patterns of Comt2 mRNA in the mouse inner ear and auditory brainstem and the subcellular localization of COMT2 protein in sensory hair cells. Aim 2 will use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to generate and validate constitutive Comt2 null mice and floxed Comt2 mice to facilitate studies that will examine loss of Comt2 function on peripheral auditory function and auditory processing. Aim 3 will analyze Comt2 mutants to determine the mechanism by which Comt2 contributes to auditory processing in sensory hair cells. By interrogating Comt2 expression patterns and functions within the auditory system, this work will contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms of auditory processing, physiological roles of COMT2, and etiologies of DFNB63 in humans.

"9182894","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary: Eukaryotic cells face constant challenges to the integrity of their genome from both endogenous and environmental sources, and sophisticated processes have evolved to respond to and minimize long-term DNA damage. Cells employ DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways to ensure the completion of DNA replication by filling in gaps created by replication barriers or lesions in the DNA. By allowing replication to continue even in the face of minor lesions, DDT pathways prevent replication forks from stalling, which can lead to fork collapse resulting in serious chromosomal abnormalities and genome instability. Nevertheless, at least one arm of the DNA damage tolerance pathway, known as translesion synthesis (TLS), can be mutagenic, the extent to which depends on the lesion and TLS polymerase involved. Thus, considered broadly, DNA damage tolerance pathways help maintain genome stability but can also promote mutagenesis, which can contribute to cancer and drug resistance. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern damage-specific lesion bypass. In the previous funding period, we identified SHPRH and HLTF as multi-functional proteins that contribute to multiple aspects of DDT pathways in mammalian cells. These proteins exert their effects in a damage-specific manner, responding to alkylation damage and UV damage with complementary specificities, yet the mechanisms by which they act remain undefined. In order to understand how SHPRH and HLTF regulate DNA damage tolerance, we will study their regulation and their role in DDT using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. The first aim of this proposal will address how HLTF and SHPRH are regulated following DNA damage. We will analyze the interaction of HLTF and SHPRH with damaged replication forks, and determine how different types of DNA damage affect the interaction of HLTF and SHPRH with Rad18, another regulator of DDT. The second aim will address the function and mechanism of action of HLTF and SHPRH in DDT. We will ask how these proteins affect mutagenesis and template switching, the protein composition of stalled forks, and the stability of repeat sequences. Collectively, these studies will provide novel insights into the regulation of two critical regulatory genes that help to minimize mutations arising from replication stress. Both HLTF and SHPRH have been found to be altered in numerous cancers, hence these studies are highly relevant to cancer and other diseases that are modified by genetic mutations."

"9178620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cell receptor (TCR) ligation induces intracellular signaling cascades including the Ca2+-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways that play crucial roles in activation and differentiation of T cells. Defects in these pathways lead to immune deficiency or hypersensitive immune responses in humans and mice. The small GTPases, Ras, Rac and Rho are known to play a central role in activation of TCR signaling pathways and are therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases. These small GTPases are recruited into the immunological synapse (IS), the interface between an antigen-presenting cell and a T cell via interactions with signaling adaptors and activate the downstream MAPK pathway. However, in contrast to Ras, Rac and Rho GTPases, little is known about the role of more than 60 members of the Rab GTPase family in T cell activation. Our long-term goal is to uncover the role of Rab GTPases in TCR signaling to identify novel therapeutic targets to alleviate autoimmunity. We have recently identified a novel Rab GTPase, CRACR2A GTPase that plays a key role in TCR signaling. Our preliminary data show that CRACR2A GTPase is a lymphocyte-specific large Rab GTPase with many functional domains in contrast to small GTPases. We found that CRACR2A GTPase translocates into the IS to activate the downstream JNK (c- Jun N-terminal kinase) MAPK pathway. Furthermore, it is highly expressed in TH1 cells and plays an important role in expression of IFN-? and T-bet, and thus in autoimmunity. Our central hypothesis is that CRACR2A GTPase is recruited into the IS via protein interactions and regulates the JNK pathway to drive TH1 differentiation. The objective of this proposal is to identify 1) interacting partners, 2) GTP binding and prenylation-mediated regulation, and 3) the physiological role of CRACR2A GTPase in T cells using high resolution imaging techniques, genomics and conditionally targeted knockout mice. CRACR2A GTPase is the first example of a large molecule containing the small Rab GTPase domain. We expect to reveal a hitherto unknown mechanism of regulation of the JNK pathway in T cell differentiation. We are confident that we will also identify a unique signaling function of Rab GTPases, which are otherwise known to mediate only intracellular protein trafficking. These mechanistic studies will have significant impact on therapeutic exploitation of this novel GTPase to treat autoimmune diseases."
"9325817","Adolescence is the period in which individuals are most likely to initiate the consumption of drugs of abuse. The onset of drug use during adolescence, however, also confers the highest risk of progressing from recreational use to addiction. This suggests that drug exposure during the critical window of adolescence may interfere with ongoing neuronal development and cause behavioral changes which facilitate subsequent substance abuse and addiction. However, there is still a significant lack of knowledge about the mechanisms accounting for these age-dependent effects of drug exposure. To address this gap in our knowledge, it is important to understand (1) the mechanism underlying the interaction between drugs of abuse and the adolescent brain, (2) how these interactions disrupt the development of neuronal circuitry, and (3) the resulting long-lasting changes in addiction-relevant behaviors. The guidance cue receptor DCC has recently emerged as a key molecular player in the adolescent organization of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, and expression of DCC is regulated by adolescent exposure to drugs of abuse. Exposure to the stimulant drug of abuse, amphetamine, during early adolescence disrupts the development of dopamine input to the medial prefrontal cortex of mice via alterations to DCC signaling. The long-term goal of the studies proposed here is to determine if amphetamine in adolescence reroutes dopamine axons to the medial prefrontal cortex from limbic regions by disrupting DCC-mediated guidance events, and identify the enduring consequences on prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive behavior. These neurobiological and behavioral alterations may underlie heightened vulnerability to progress to addiction in individuals that initiate drug use in adolescence. The experiments will employ neuroanatomical, gene transfection, and behavioral techniques in a mouse model to assess three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether amphetamine in adolescence increases prefrontal cortex dopamine innervation by promoting the rerouting of mesolimbic dopamine axons during adolescence. Aim 2 will assess whether DCC signaling is the molecular mechanism by which amphetamine in adolescence reroutes mesolimbic dopamine axons to the prefrontal cortex. Aim 3 will determine the role of DCC in mediating the long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent mesocorticolimbic dopamine reorganization. The results of the proposed research will move the field toward a clearer understanding of the mechanisms accounting for the age-dependent effects of drug exposure on addiction vulnerability. These results could be used to facilitate development of individualized prevention and treatment strategies aimed at adolescent drug users, who are at heightened risk to progress to addiction."
"9182819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) promote replication through DNA lesions which block the continued progression of the replication fork. Although structural studies with the various yeast and human TLS Pols have indicated that they could function in TLS in highly specialized ways, the information available for their biological roles has been relatively meager; in particular, the biological role of Pol? has remained the least understood. In the proposed studies, we will use a combined genetic, biochemical, and structural approach to test the hypothesis that Pol? makes an important contribution to promoting replication through DNA lesions which impair Watson-Crick (W-C) base pairing or which protrude into the DNA minor groove. Furthermore, and most importantly, studies will be done to test the hypothesis that Pol? functions opposite DNA lesions in a much more error-free manner than opposite undamaged residues. In Aim 1, we will examine the roles of Pol? and other TLS Pols in human cells in promoting replication through N1-methyl adenine (1-MeA), which impairs W-C base pairing; a deaza derivative of N3-methyl adenine (3-dMeA), which protrudes into the DNA minor groove; and an N2-dG adduct of 1,3-butadiene (N2-dG, R-butadiene monoepoxide), which like 3-dMeA, is a minor groove lesion but chemically more complex. 1-MeA and 3-dMeA are generated from exposure to environmental alkylating agents and from endogenous cellular reactions, and 1,3-butadiene is an important industrial chemical and an environmental pollutant. For TLS analysis in human cells, we will utilize two different duplex plasmid systems, an SV40 origin-based plasmid and an EBV origin-based plasmid, and the relative contributions of Pol? and of other Pols to lesion bypass and to mutagenicity will be determined. In Aim 2, biochemical studies will be done to examine the proficiency of Pol? and of other Pols in synthesizing DNA opposite the 1-MeA, 3-dMeA, and N2-dG R-butadiene monoepoxide adducts. By steady-state kinetic analyses, we will determine the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of Pol? and of other Pols for inserting a nucleotide (nt) opposite each of these lesions and for extending from the inserted nt. In Aim 3, structures of Pol? in ternary complex with the 1-MeA, 3-dMeA, N2-dG R-butadiene monoepoxide, and also a (6-4) TT photoproduct will be determined to uncover the bases of Pol? ability to function opposite these DNA lesions in a predominantly error-free manner. Biochemical studies, and TLS studies in human cells, will be carried out to examine the effects of mutations in residues that help stabilize the correct incoming nt opposite the lesion site. The proposed studies are highly relevant for cancer biology and cancer etiology as they will reveal whether Pol?, in conjunction with other TLS Pols, promotes a predominantly error-free mode of TLS opposite a diverse array of DNA adducts. An error-free mode of TLS would be in keeping with a role for Pol? in suppression of carcinogenesis that would otherwise result from exposure to environmental and chemical carcinogens."
"9192327","Project Summary  Despite progress in the field of human-machine interfaces to control assistive devices for individuals with tetraplegia, the learning burden to efficiently operate these devices rests largely upon their users. The objective of this proposal is to lessen this burden by leveraging principles of optimal control that govern unimpaired movement. Specifically, manipulating feedback noise may be an effective means of shaping and enhancing control of redundant degrees of freedom and may improve human-machine interface performance of individuals with tetraplegia. This work uses a kinematic human-machine interface that translates high dimensional body movements to low dimensional control commands. Clinical impact of the proposed work will be directly measured by conducting extensive assessments of individuals with tetraplegia performing functional tasks, controlling a computer cursor and driving a power wheelchair. The results of these studies are intended to inform training paradigms for a wide family of human-machine interfaces that exploit the availability to the disabled users of control signals in excess of the number of variables that are required to control an assistive device. If successful, this work will directly result in enhanced training paradigms for reorganizing human dexterity and adapting it to the constraints established by the disability. This will increase the number of individuals who will be able access assistive devices, increasing functional independence and broadly improving quality of life."
"9124576","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenic is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid element to which prolonged exposure in humans is associated with keratosis, hyperpigmentation, lung and cardiovascular disease, and multiple forms of cancer. Chronically exposed individuals show high variability in symptoms, even among similarly exposed individuals. Host specific factors like genetic variability, body weight, and diet only partially account for this observed variability. In ecosystems where it occurs naturally, arsenic can exist in a variety of organic and inorganic chemical compounds of varying degrees of toxicity. In these environments, biochemical transformations of arsenic are primarily driven by microbial processes. Some microbes also have the ability to incorporate arsenic into their cellular biomass.  The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome of mammals confers numerous important functional benefits to the host organism, many of which are not well understood or characterized. It has also been shown that altering gut microbial communities of mice can change the profile of arsenic transformations that take place in these communities. Preliminary research suggests that the GIT microbiome functions to protect the murine host from ingested arsenic. We have demonstrated that germ-free mice and mice with antibiotic-disrupted GIT microbiomes accumulate more arsenic in host tissues when compared with similarly exposed mice with conventional microbiomes. When the primary host system for detoxifying systemic arsenic is inactivated, mortality is observed in germ-free and antibiotic treated mice, even at low  levels of arsenic exposure.  The proposed research aims to investigate the function of the human microbiome in arsenic toxicity by leveraging the use of germ-free mice, which can be colonized with the GIT microbiome from a human donor. This research will investigate not only the influence of the human microbiome on host arsenic exposure, but also the mechanisms by which it influences. Arsenic transformations will be measured in germ-free and humanized mice while tracking host health to determine the health impacts of specific transformations in vivo. In order to determine if specific microbial groups increase or decrease the host's exposure to toxic arsenicals, the microbiome of humanized mice will be manipulated while monitoring arsenic transformations and host health. This research will elucidate new functions of the human microbiome relating to arsenic toxicity. There is potential for this project to have immediate impacts on human health interventions."
"9274822","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Objectives. Co-occurrence of alcohol use disorder (AD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common. Research supports exposure therapy as the front line treatment for PTSD as this approach is most likely to lead to sustained recovery from the disorder. However, individuals with AD are generally not offered exposure therapies because of beliefs that exposure would lead to engagement in greater alcohol use and other dangerous behaviors. Most research and clinical treatment for AD/PTSD have involved coping skills based therapies that have generally not shown sustained reductions in alcohol use and PTSD symptoms. A growing body of evidence suggests these individuals with AD/PTSD are able to handle and benefit from exposure. This proposed trial will compare an integrated exposure psychotherapy to an integrated coping skills psychotherapy for the treatment of AD/PTSD. In addition, mechanisms of change for Veterans with AD/PTSD in both treatment conditions, including therapy process variables, changes in negative affect, and sleep problems, will be explored. Significance: This project addresses a critical barrier in the field - the widely held belief that individuals with AD and PTSD cannot tolerate exposure therapy, although it is the best practice treatment for PTSD. If completed, this project will help change the practices that drive treatment for this highly prevalent and highly distressed population. The fundamental rationale is to improve the evidence base that informs how patients with AD/PTSD can attain sustained recovery. Innovation: This application seeks to shift current clinical practice paradigms. A refinement to existing interventions is proposed through integration of two evidence based treatments. The simplicity of the exposure therapy protocol makes it amenable to dissemination and modification to AD treatment settings. Methodology. We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an integrated exposure-based treatment (Integrated Prolonged Exposure; I-PE) for concurrent AD and PTSD that is evidence based and includes both in-vivo exposure and trauma processing. The primary aim will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of I-PE when compared to a present-focused coping skills based intervention (Seeking Safety) in 148 male and female Veterans who have AD and PTSD. The hypotheses are that at post-treatment both groups will show reductions in alcohol use, but I-PE will demonstrate greater reductions in PTSD symptoms than SS. At 5- and 8- month post-baseline follow-up, I-PE will have significantly fewer percent drinking days and fewer PTSD symptoms than SS. In addition, mechanisms of change in both treatment conditions will be examined."

"9273336","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/Abstract:  Approximately 75% of adults with serious mental illness (SMI) have a desire to work, but the level of unemployment for this population ranges from 85-90% (1-4). In addition to enjoying the benefit of increased income, research evidence indicates that persons with SMI who work also experience the additional benefits of increased self-esteem, satisfaction with finances, satisfaction with leisure and overall life satisfaction (5). Among the various types of vocational rehabilitation services currently available, supported employment (SE) is the most effective service for persons with SMI (13, 15, 16) and the VA has mandated that this evidence-based practice be offered as part of Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) Programs throughout the VA (21). Despite this mandate, there is a low rate of utilization of SE within the VA (22). Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based clinical practice with demonstrated effectiveness in producing desirable behavior change in the use of alcohol and drugs, as well other outcomes such as binge eating, smoking, treatment attendance, medication compliance and gambling (26- 34). Recently, Drebing (47), Glynn (45) and Mueller (46) have begun investigating the effectiveness of MI for increasing the rate of entry and length of participation n vocational rehabilitation programs among veterans with SMI. Mueller and her colleagues are currently conducting a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of MI for increasing the rateof entry into SE and competitive employment outcomes.  This two-year study analyzes archival data from the Mueller (46) study in which 79 unemployed veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) agreed to audiotaping and received either general supportive counseling (control) or Motivational Interviewing (experimental) in up to six sessions conducted over a period of six months. The purpose of the present study is to further analyze data from these research sessions to identify key ingredients of MI that are associated with the action of taking a step toward using SE services. Each MI research session is rated as having either a successful or unsuccessful outcome on the variable of taking a step toward supported SE utilization, which serves as the study dependent variable. The 206 audiotaped MI sessions conducted with participants in the experimental condition are coded using MISC 2.1 coding and analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling to identify significant predictors of taking a step toward using SE. The independent variables are: a) therapist behaviors (spirit of MI and MI technical proficiency); and b) client behaviors (intensity and frequency of change talk and counter change talk). Covariates examined include age, race, mental health diagnosis, health status, work motivation, work importance, duration of unemployment, and type of disability benefits received.  The study also analyzes sessions from 16 MI participants and 16 control participants using a grounded theory qualitative approach to identify emergent patterns and themes in the sessions. These findings are then combined with the quantitative findings to develop conceptual frameworks that explain differences between veterans with a successful outcome and those with an unsuccessful outcome.  Study results are translated into recommendations regarding the components of MI that should receive greatest emphasis when training clinicians who will use MI with veterans who have SMI. The study also identifies additional factors influencing the taking of steps toward utilization of SE by veterans with SMI. New information obtained from this study will be useful for VA policy makers, administrators, clinicians, vocational rehabilitation specialists, and researchers interested in reducing the underutilization of Supported Employment, an evidence-based practice, and in improving employment outcomes that contribute to the overall recovery process for veterans with serious mental illness."
"9182820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the concomitant loss of dopamine in the striatum. While multiple processes likely contribute to the loss of dopamine neurons, we argue that disruption of the proper storage and release of dopamine from vesicles plays a key role. This theory is supported by the literature, which demonstrates that improper storage of dopamine causes the formation of oxidative dopamine byproducts and toxic aldehydes that damages neurons. Evidence from genetic and toxicological studies of PD demonstrates that many insults converge on the dopamine vesicle to exert their deleterious effects. We hypothesize that vesicular function mediates dopamine neuron toxicity, such that increasing vesicle function will enhance dopamine storage and release and confer resistance to neurotoxicants, while decreasing vesicle function will have the opposite effect. Our laboratory has generated and characterized two unique mouse lines that allow us to test this hypothesis: a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic mouse that overexpresses VMAT2 (VMAT2-HI) and a genetic knockout of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C-KO), which was recently implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Here, we provide preliminary data that clearly demonstrate that increased vesicular function is beneficial to the dopamine system and that SV2C is a novel regulator of dopamine uptake and release. Together, these findings provide the basis for the following aims. Aim 1: To determine the effects of variable VMAT2 or SV2C expression on vesicular dopamine storage and release dynamics. We will determine how these genetic manipulations alter vesicular dynamics, including the readily releasable pool. Aim 2: To determine if altered vesicular storage and release alters vulnerability of dopamine neurons in a model of PD. We determine the effect of reduced SV2C or increased VMAT2 on MPTP toxicity in aged mice, a classical and well-established model. Aim 3: To determine if altered vesicular storage and release of dopamine influences vulnerability to the PD-related toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). We expect that our mice will show an inverse correlation between vesicle function and PCB-induced. In addition to the novel mouse lines generated in our laboratory we will use a suite of cutting-edge techniques in our studies, including optogenetic stimulation, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, in vivo microdialysis, and CLARITY. Completion of these aims will establish a pivotal concept in neuroprotection: increasing vesicle function improves neurotransmitter signaling and opposes dopamine neuron toxicity. This suggests that modulation of synaptic vesicle function represents an innovative and unexplored opportunity for addressing dopamine neuron dysfunction and provides a foundation for new therapeutic approaches."
"9178626","PROJECT SUMMARY This application is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying reprogramming of lipid metabolism in CD4 T helper subsets, and assessing the impact of sterol metabolism on T helper cell function. Accumulating evidence indicates that CD4 T helper cells rapidly change their metabolic state in response to TCR activation and cytokine signals. This reprogramming is necessary to match the bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements of specific effector functions. In general pro-inflammatory CD4 T cells (e.g., Th1 and Th17) acquire a robust glycolytic program, and shift their metabolism towards an anabolic state. In contrast, regulatory T cells are largely reliant on fatty acid oxidation and macromolecule catabolism to meet their bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements. This distinction in metabolic programming appears to be essential for proper T helper cell function. Genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of a T helper cell's metabolic state can attenuate or exacerbate specific effector functions. For example, enforcing a glycolytic program perturbs the suppressive ability of Tregs, and results in a loss of self-tolerance in models systems. In contrast, enforcing fatty acid oxidative metabolism downregulates the pro-inflammatory function of Th1 and Th17 cells, thereby attenuating disease pathogenesis. These observations have led to the concept that a CD4 T helper cells metabolic state is a fundamental component of the effector program. Despite the clear importance of acquiring and maintaining the appropriate metabolic state, the molecular mechanisms underlying how distinct T helper cells acquire the requisite metabolic programs remain poorly understood. In recent work we have identified the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP1 and 2) as critical regulators of metabolic reprogramming in CD8 T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that SREBPs are activated by TCR signals and drive acquisition of glycolysis and anabolic metabolism. In the absence of SREBP activity, we found that CD8 T cells were unable to upregulate glycolytic flux and synthesis of lipids, resulting in poor proliferative capacity and attenuated effector responses. These data have led us to hypothesize that SREBPs would play a critical function in regulating the CD4 T helper subset differentiation and effector function. In support of this hypothesis, we find in preliminary data that attenuation of the SREBP program selectively perturbs the in vitro differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, but does not influence induction of regulatory T cells, nor does it influence the generation/homeostasis of Foxp3-positive Tregs in vivo. Thus, we conclude that SREBP signaling plays an important and previously undefined role in controlling the balance of T helper subsets. In this application, we extend on these intriguing preliminary data and propose three integrated aims designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which SREBPs influence T helper cell function, and determine if these metabolic pathways control the balance between self-tolerance and autoimmunity."
"9197218","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Summary Infections are the most common complication of hospital care and one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. Multi-drug resistant gram negative organisms (MDRGNOs) account for a steadily increasing rate of infections in healthcare settings every year; including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Of particular concern are those infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and specifically carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). The importance of understanding the burden of these infections is emphasized by the impact they have on treatment regimens; requiring more complex therapy. In addition, these organisms have been found to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer length of stay, and increased costs. However, in persons with spinal cord injury and disorder (SCI/D), literature is limited on antibiotic resistance patterns and their impacts on outcomes. Persons with SCI/D are at high risk for these infections compared to the general patient population due to factors such as frequent hospitalization or contact with the health care system, frequent and chronic use of invasive medical devices such as urinary catheters, and development of pressure ulcers. Furthermore, infections are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with SCI/D. The majority of Veterans with SCI/D are chronically injured; but we have little data on the burden, risk factors, and impact of antibiotic resistance in this population. The overall objectives of this study are to describe the prevalence of and risk factors  for MDRGNOs causing infections in persons with SCI/D, and assess impact of MDRGNOs on patient hospitalization outcomes and long-term outcomes. We propose to conduct a retrospective analysis using national VA medical data sets to achieve these aims. Additionally, we will conduct multiple matched case-control studies to assess impact of MDRGNO's on patient outcomes. The proposed study also addresses a priority area of the VA Rehabilitation Research & Development program as it recognizes the impact of chronic SCI/D on subsequent complications and consequences such as infections. In addition, this study can assist with future efforts and priorities of the VA MDRO Program Office and VA SCI/D Services Program Office in understanding the burden of MDRGNO's and outcomes and determine if further efforts are needed to curb infections caused by this organism."
"9186541","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heat waves currently account for significant mortality and morbidity and climate change is resulting in more frequent, more intense, and longer heat waves. Developing effective prevention strategies for heat-related illness and morality is of critical importance. We hypothesize that significant differences in heat-related health risks exist between urban and rural communities. The research proposed here extends our initial work in developing community-engaged research in underserved urban and rural communities in Alabama. In it we propose to gather community-level and individual-level heat and air pollution exposure data in communities. This analysis will result in a more precise picture of exposures to heat and air pollution as well as behavioral factors that may medicate exposure in at-risk populations in the Deep South. We propose to do the following in the present study: 1) Build our current collaborations that bridge diverse research disciplines and local level government and community organizations in urban (Birmingham) and rural communities in the Black Belt region of Alabama through community advisory board meetings and capacity building workshops , 2) Measure community-level heat and air pollution exposure in urban and rural communities by setting up stationary monitoring sites where community members frequent, 3) Determine individual-level exposure by recruiting community members to wear personal monitors and 4) Identify behavioral and physiological parameters associated with personal exposure through daily activity logs and questionnaire. The proposed investigation will contribute to prevention research by identifying specific exposure and behavioral risk factors in urban versus rural communities which will aid in developing prevention strategies tailored to the needs of these communities. Spatially explicit vulnerability maps that apply remote sensing datasets will inform community prioritization and planning applicable to a broader geographical scale."
"9181408","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIEHS-SRP project will evaluate the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the transport and bioavailability of DNAPL and dissolved hydrophobic compounds within groundwater and at the groundwater-surface water interface and how these processes determine the efficacy of in situ remediation methods. Lipophilic contaminants in sediments may accumulate in shellfish, posing a human health risk. Sediment remediation strategies will ideally limit contaminant transport via the aqueous phase thus limiting bioaccumulation and risk. In situ capping is one remediation technique utilized to stabilize and physically isolate contaminated sediments to reduce exposure to biota and humans. Caps are designed to resist physical disturbance by erosion and bioturbation, and are consequently composed primarily of coarse granular material, which is highly permeable. Recent work has shown that groundwater-surface water interactions include numerous advection mechanisms that operate independently of canonical groundwater flow. As a result, DNAPL and contaminated porewater advection may be orders of magnitude higher than expected from groundwater considerations alone, reducing the effectiveness of capping for in situ remediation. This study will provide new understanding of surface water- groundwater interactions and DNAPL contaminant degradation, transport, and bioavailability; novel methods for evaluating shallow advection rates and pore water PAH concentrations for site characterization to guide in situ remediation; and guidance for remediation managers to improve safe and effective cap design where groundwater advection processes are active. Hypothesis 1. Bioavailable PAH concentrations in porewater at the sediment-water interface are decoupled from PAH flux due to non-equilibrium effects when advection dominates diffusional transport. 2. DNAPL mobility is enhanced by the intrusion of dense seawater, resulting in transport of liquid organic phase in saline and brackish coastal groundwater. 3. Advection in subaqueous permeable sediments results in measurable disequilibrium between parent and daughter nuclides of the naturally-occurring Th-Ra-Rn system that  is proportional to advective flux. 4. Advection dynamics and seawater intrusion increase bioavailable PAH flux and NAPL transport in permeable cap materials used for in situ remediation at contaminated sites  in the Elizabeth River."
"9251354","Abstract Metal orthopedic implants are common devices used for restoring musculoskeletal joint function and patient mobility. Given the large number of orthopedic joint reconstructions conducted each year, it is important to minimize rates of aseptic implant loosening which causes pain and often leads to revision surgery. Therapeutics that modify endogenous epigenetic processes are promising for the treatment of many musculoskeletal disorders, including osteopenia and osteoporosis, yet the delivery mode and molecular mechanisms that act to diminish clinical symptoms are in need of further investigation. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that osseointegration of orthopedic implants can be improved by modulating the biological properties of endogenous skeletal repair cells using epigenetic inhibitors. Based on recent preliminary data, this amended proposal has evolved to address the specific working model that epigenetic drugs can be used to stimulate paracrine signaling (e.g., BMP2 activity) to drive endogenous skeletal repair cells into the osteoblast lineage. New data I generated show that human mesenchymal stromal cells (both adipose and bone tissue-derived) attach to porous metal orthopedic implants, as well as proliferate and deposit an extracellular matrix. Additional preliminary data reveal that Ezh2 inhibition can bolster the differentiation of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts, both in vitro and in vivo. Based on these preliminary data, this study will (i) determine the in vivo effects of Ezh2 delivery before, during or after reconstructive orthopedic surgery (Aim 1), and (ii) examine the mechanism of Ezh2 inhibition by measuring the effects of blocking paracrine signaling (e.g., BMP2) on osteoblast differentiation in vitro (Aim 2). My long term goals are to develop strategies for localized delivery of bone anabolic therapeutic reagents to address the increasing demands of an expanding, aging, and increasingly active human population. These studies should ultimately lead to the development of surgeon- assembled adjuvants and become part of routine orthopedic practices, as well as support my career progression as an independent investigator capable of executing clinically relevant translational research similar to that proposed here."

"9179591","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There exists a great need to understand how the human herpesvirus Varicella zoster Virus (VZV) interacts with neurons. The sensory neuron is critical to successful VZV pathogenesis as the site of a decades-long state of persistence, and the source for VZV reactivation to cause Herpes zoster. This painful and debilitating disease is encountered by a third of adults, and is frequently complicated by chronic pain and neurological problems. Furthermore, ophthalmic zoster is a potentially devastating infectious disease that causes significant vision loss and a much greater toll than zoster elsewhere in terms of pain, complications and marked disruption of the quality of life. Even if all eligible persons received the zoster vaccine (which is far from being achieved). the partial effectiveness would still result in some half of a million zoster cases annually. What we know of VZV latency and reactivation has remained enigmatic, controversial and unclear, because most animal models or their neurological tissues do not support VZV replication or reactivation. Indeed, VZV experimental reactivation has proved exceedingly difficult under any circumstances. Yet, if neuronal infection, spread, persistence or reactivation can be prevented, disease could be more easily controlled. We now have an unprecedented cultured human neuron platform, derived from human embryonic stem cells, that supports not only VZV productive infection, but also persistent states that can now be reactivated. Our overlying hypothesis is that this system will enable us to address aspects of neuron infection, latency and qreactivation in a manner that has not been previously possible. Our first aim will test the hypothesis that specific VZV proteins are required for neuron axonal infection, replication, inter-neuronal spread or anterograde axonal return. We will evaluate fluorescent reporter VZV with gene deletions for each stage of neuronal infection to identify those proteins required. Such proteins could be not only be targeted in strategies to block latency and reactivation, but such VZV mutants could be the basis for improved vaccines with defined deficiencies in neurotropism. Our second aim will address the viral transcription program during VZV persistence and reactivation. We will then identify what transcription occurs during persistence and reactivation, including a search for small RNAs that may contribute to latency. We will also address if transcriptional programs differ following reactivation at differen temperatures. Our third aim will test the hypothesis that the persistent VZV genome can be targeted by large sequence recognition nucleases, in order to reduce VZV latent genomic loads or prevent reactivation. This would establish principles or targeting the latent VZV genome without reliance on viral gene products. Globally, our studies will set the stage for understanding and targeting the VZV latent state in a manner that has not been previously possible."
"9293575","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to define the mechanisms responsible for the malignant hyperthermia syndrome. We have previously shown that a universal feature of RyR1 MH mutations is an increased resting myoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and more recently that they are associated with an increased resting Na+ concentration ([Na+]i). We have also shown that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) leak is a factor in controlling myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration at rest working in concert with sarcolemmal channels, pumps and exchangers. Furthermore, because the amount of Ca2+ in internal stores is limited compared to the extracellular pool, after MH is triggered these same sarcolemmal channels, pumps and exchangers and perhaps others must be involved in the maintenance of the MH syndrome. Because of the observed increase in [Na+]i in MH muscles, TRPCs are the most likely candidates. Our immediate objectives are to use two mouse models that we have created, RyR1-R163C a mouse model of human MH, and CSQ1 null mice, which have an MH like phenotype, to study how mutations that alter intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis cause a fulminant MH response when exposed to volatile anesthetics. These models will allow us to test a unified general hypothesis applicable to any and all MH mutations regardless of the location of the mutation: MH is caused by conformational changes in RyR1 as a result of a mutation, or by conformational changes in RyR1 induced indirectly by a mutation in CaV1.1 or another protein closely associated with RyR1 (as demonstrated by an MH like phenotype in Casq1 null mice). A transformative concept to be investigated here is that a defect in signaling among Ca2+ release unit proteins leading to increased RyR1 leak is a common convergent pathway leading to all MH susceptibility. Hypothesis 1: MH susceptibility is the result of a conformational change in RyR1 caused either by a RyR1 mutation, or induced indirectly by mutations in other proteins closely associated with RyR1 which results in increased RyR1 SR Ca2+ leak and sarcolemmal Na+ and Ca2+ entry. Specific Aim 1. To determine the filling state of the SR and rate of SR Ca2+ leak in MH muscle fibers. Specific Aim 2. To determine the role of TRPCs in causing abnormalities in sarcolemmal Na+ and Ca2+ entry RyR1-R163C and CSQ1 null muscles and then to determine if skeletal muscle specific over-expression of a dominant negative non-conducting TRPC6 channel can modify RyR1-R163C's MH phenotype. Hypothesis 2: In addition to blocking RyR1 SR Ca2+ release, dantrolene abrogates the MH phenotype by modulating RyR1 SR Ca2+ leak and sarcolemmal Na+ and Ca2+ entry. Specific Aim 3. To determine the mechanisms by which dantrolene diminishes aberrant Ca2+ signaling. Successful completion of these specific Aims will provide a more comprehensive understanding of MH."
"9180622","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both developmental lead (Pb) exposure and prenatal stress (PS) impact low socioeconomic status communities and target the brain mesocorticolimbic (MESO) system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Combined Pb and PS in rodents can produce enhanced behavioral toxicity that is related to underlying inter-correlated MESO and HPA axis changes. Preliminary data in Pb+/-PS mice demonstrates hypomethylation of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene NR3C1 in both sexes with consequent increased expression in Pb+PS mice only. Pb differentially alters frontal cortex histone acetylation (AcH3K9) levels by gender. Thus MESO GR epigenetic changes may be important mechanisms of Pb+/-PS-induced CNS toxicity. Behavioral experience is a critical determinant of later behavior and brain function, and epigenetic marks can be modified by behavioral experiences. In our studies, positive vs. negative behavioral experience not only differentiated MESO neurotransmitter levels, but also altered the effects of Pb, PS and Pb+PS on neurotransmitter levels. Thus critical to a full understanding of the consequences of Pb+/-PS is a determination of how the nature of behavioral experience might either mitigate/reverse vs. further enhance Pb and PS- associated epigenetic marks, and associated CNS and HPA toxicity. The proposed studies test the hypotheses that: 1) developmental Pb+/-PS induce sex-dependent MESO GR epigenetic changes, including enhanced alterations in response to Pb+PS; 2) different behavioral experiences (i.e., those associated with 'resilience' vs. further pathology) after birth will result in differential profile of epigenetic marks per se that can be related to differences in their ability to mitigate or enhance Pb and/or PS-associated toxicity. These studies will significantly enhance the understanding of CNS epigenetic-behavioral relationships, provide critical information on mechanisms of Pb+/-PS effects, and provide a foundation for establishing behavioral interventions that could assist in mitigating effects of Pb+/-PS effects, two ubiquitous developmental risk factors."
"9172235","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to advance the understanding, at the molecular level, of the pathogenicity and epidemiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains to better target treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections, reduce resistance, and provide information on possible targets for vaccines and antibiotics. The proposed studies are focused on understanding the basis of urovirulence of E. coli by the comparative genome-wide analysis of strains that will be isolated from a large number of patients with first-time and recurrent cystitis and healthy women. The central hypothesis is that the relatively few clonal groups involved in UPEC human pathogenesis can be defined and characterized as to their key genetic loci and the impact of genetic variations on UPEC virulence. Our preliminary data support that we can investigate sizeable samples of fresh isolates, establish strong clonal associations with recurrent cystitis and determine genome- wide the pathogenicity-adaptive genetic changes. We will determine how mutational changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions/deletions, etc) and horizontal gene transfer contribute to the emergence of UPEC. Our aim is to potentially examine every gene shared by at least a portion of UPEC strains for being under positive selection for pathogenicity-adaptive mutations or horizontal transfer. For this, we will employ a population genomics-based analysis to trace the mutations and gene transfer, followed by assessment of the functional significance of the representative positively selected loci in UPEC."
"9172231","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the absence of an effective vaccine, administration of antiretroviral drugs prior to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exposure (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP) may be a reliable method to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. Daily oral tenofovir and FTC (Truvada) is currently approved for use as PrEP in high-risk individuals but has had limited success in human clinical trials to date, mainly due to adherence issues.  Rilpivirine (RPV) is the most recent reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1. Drug-resistant mutations detected in patients failing RPV-containing regimens conferred mainly low-level resistance to RPV and RPV is active against most mutants selected by other drugs. RPV has been formulated into injectable long-acting nanoparticles (RPV-LA) for use as long-lasting PrEP to be administered by healthcare providers. Development of resistance or transmission of RPV-resistant variants during PrEP has not been previously addressed, particularly their impact on subsequent ART. A case has recently been described of a woman who became HIV-1-infected during RPV-LA treatment and subsequently developed RPV-resistant virus in the presence of sub-therapeutic plasma RPV concentration. We propose to investigate vaginal transmission of wild-type (WT) HIV-1 and drug-resistant variants in the presence and absence of therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations of RPV-LA PrEP or Truvada, using a novel animal model that will also allow us to investigate the dynamics of infection and dissemination in the female genital tract in real-time.  Using an innovative new reporter virus system and a well-characterized humanized mouse model, we hypothesize that a prevalent HIV-1 mutant resistant to both RPV and Truvada (E138K/M184I) will be transmitted in the absence of drug and in the presence of Truvada PrEP, but will lead to an abortive infection of local CD4+ target cells in the genital trac in the presence of therapeutic RPV-LA concentrations. However, transmission or development of drug-resistant HIV-1 will lead to faster virologic failure during subsequent ART."
"9140318","?     DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)          Military Veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to exhibit increases in anger and aggressive behavior. Dysregulated anger and aggression can create fear and distress in spouses, family members, and friends resulting in deteriorated relationships, and can have a detrimental impact on Veterans' social, occupational and other important areas of functioning. Standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based interventions for anger and aggression are limited in part because they do not directly target the specific PTSD symptoms most strongly associated with aggression, namely increased hyperarousal and physiological reactivity. Further, they do not assist individuals in achieving awareness and insight into their anger states, which is necessary for effective management of anger and aggression. Mindfulness involves the self-regulation of attention on one's immediate experience and adopting an orientation of acceptance toward one's present experiences. Research studies conducted with civilians have found mindfulness to be effective in reducing anger and aggression. To date, no research has examined the effectiveness of mindfulness in decreasing anger and aggression among Veterans with PTSD. The proposed study aims to examine the initial efficacy of an established mindfulness intervention, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in decreasing trauma-related anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD. The proposed project also aims to examine potential mechanisms of action accounting for its effects. Dr. Kachadourian is a postdoctoral fellow in the Clinical Neurosciences Division o the National Center for PTSD at the West Haven VA who has conducted basic research on alcohol, PTSD, anger, and aggression. Her current interests include conducting clinical trials to test novel therapeutic approaches like mindfulness meditation in treating anger and aggression among military Veterans with PTSD. TRAINING GOALS: The objectives for this CDA-2 application include advancing Dr. Kachadourian's expertise in conducting clinical trial research and advanced statistical analyses, and increasing her proficiency in mindfulness interventions. This will be accomplished through a rigorous program of formal didactics, collaboration with researchers experienced in clinical trials research and in mindfulness, PTSD, anger, and aggression, and a randomized controlled pilot study examining the initial efficacy of MBSR in decreasing anger and aggression among Veterans with PTSD. METHODS: Sixty Veterans with PTSD experiencing problems with anger and aggression will be randomly assigned to participate in a PTSD psychoeducational course (Trauma Recovery Education Class or TREC) or MBSR. All participants will attend a baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up session to assess changes in self-reported anger and aggression over time. At the post-treatment session, participants will also engage in a trauma-imagery procedure using trauma narratives developed at the baseline session. They then will participate in a laboratory paradigm designed to assess provoked aggression. In addition to examining whether participation in MBSR decreases self-reported levels of anger and aggression, this study will examine whether MBSR decreases aggression in participants after being exposed to trauma reminders in vivo. The extent to which mindfulness reduces physiological reactivity and increases emotion regulation will also be examined. The key question in this study is whether mindfulness decreases anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD. Through this award, Dr. Kachadourian will be able to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent VA scientist with expertise in testing novel clinical interventions to treat problematic anger and aggression in military Veterans with PTSD."
"9105154","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interleukin-1 family members are key inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response to infection. While IL-1 is necessary for proper defense against pathogens, the production of this cytokine must be carefully regulated in order to prevent immunopathology. One checkpoint on the release of IL-1 family cytokines is their requirement for post-translational processing by a multi-protein complex known as the inflammasome, which serves as a platform for recruiting and activating the protease caspase-1. Sensing of extracellular bacteria by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers the transcription of il1b mRNA, but IL-1 is not released until inflammasome sensor proteins recognize bacterial products that have entered the cellular cytosolic compartment. Type I interferons (IFN-I) are known to inhibit inflammasome activity, which partially explains their long-recognized immunosuppressive capacity, although the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. Induction of the enzyme Ch25h, which produces 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) from cholesterol, is a key component of IFN-I- mediated inhibition of inflammasomes. Ch25h is an IFN-I-stimulated gene in macrophages, and deletion of Ch25h results in increased capase-1 activity and release of IL-1. 25-HC is a potent suppressor of the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein (SREBP) cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and Ch25h-deficient macrophages additionally display increased SREBP pathway activity after TLR stimulation. Deletion of SCAP, a protein required for SREBP activation, in macrophages results in decreased inflammasome activity. Based on these data, I aim to characterize how the SREBP pathway positively regulates inflammasomes. Specifically, I propose to determine the necessity and sufficiency of SREBP proteins in augmenting inflammasome function, and to define which step of inflammasome activation they regulate (Aim 1). I also propose to test the hypothesis that SREBPs promote inflammasome function via the production of cholesterol (Aim 2)."
"9173016","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Producing high-affinity antibodies that potently neutralize target pathogens remains a central goal for vaccine research. Many promising vaccine antigens fail to elicit long-lasting protective antibodies due to inefficient generation of high-affinity memory B cells. While memory B cell development is an active area of research, major gaps remain in our understanding of cognate regulation by CD4+ TH cells and the rules governing ongoing evolution of antigen-specific B cell memory. Research Focus: In these recent studies, we demonstrate that all memory B cell responses require antigen-specific mTH cells. Importantly, direct in situ labeling revealed both Bcl-6+ and Blimp-1+ CD4+ TH cells in the follicular regions of reactive LNs after recall. In support of this observation, using single cell T-qPCR, we demonstrate a transcriptional divide between two tetramer-binding CXCR5+ mTFH compartments with differential expression of Bcl-6 and Prdm-1 at recall. Based on these findings, we propose a division in cognate regulatory function with separable mechanisms used by the different mTFH compartments that may also pre-exist at initial priming. We predict that this division of cognate regulatory function can be targeted to control, remodel and re-assort antigen-specific memory B cell fate at antigen recall with high impact on durable immune protection. Specific Aims: We have developed multi-dimensional single cell strategies to track complex cellular behaviors in vivo and can temporally delete of these two major transcriptional repressors in a cell- specific manner using mixed BM chimeras. We will use this approach: SA-1: to study the molecular control of antigen-specific mTFH differentiation. SA-2: to dissect and modify the mechanisms and GC-regulating function of Bcl-6+ mTFH cells SA-3: to examine the cognate regulatory mechanisms used by Prdm-1+ mTFH cells. Impact: We use polyclonal murine models of protein vaccination with state-of-the-art single cell analyses of antigen-specific immune function. These high-resolution studies of model antigens have the capacity to shift the basic conceptual framework that surrounds existing vaccine paradigms. Importantly, these basic new principles and assays can be used to re-design contemporary vaccine formulations that optimize high-affinity B cell immunity to more complex antigens."
"9378561","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While anti-inflammatory agents and hyaluronic acid-base viscous replacements have been developed to treat people with osteoarthritis, there has been little impact on the progression and treatment of the disease. What is more, there are few therapeutic strategies that aim to interact with the existing extracellular matrix (ECM) to stem disease progression and potentially provide an environment conducive to autologous repair. Osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease that, according to the Arthritis Foundation, affects over 7 million Americans. The disease is characterized by a breakdown of articular cartilage; including ECM molecules type II collagen, aggrecan, and hyaluronic acid (HA). Osteoarthritis is often triggered by injury, resulting in release of catabolic cytokines (e.g. IL-1) and enzymatic (e.g. aggrecanase, hyaluronidase, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)) expression by chondrocytes. Aggrecanases initially degrade the aggrecan core protein. Once aggrecan is degraded, both HA and type II collagen are exposed and become susceptible to hyaluronidases and MMPs, respectively. Hyaluronidase cleaves HA, producing HA oligosaccharides that trigger additional MMP synthesis [1]. The MMPs, specifically MMP3 and MMP13, degrade type II collagen. Like HA oligosaccharides, type II collagen fragments further stimulate cartilage catabolism through induction of cytokines and MMPs [2]. Importantly, therapies that protect the ECM from degradation may halt this viscous cycle that perpetuates cartilage breakdown. Recently, we reported on a new class of biosynthetic molecules, coined peptidoglycans that mimic many of the functions of proteoglycans [3-5]. The peptidoglycans can be designed to limit hyaluronidase degradation of HA and MMP degradation of collagen. Unlike the native proteoglycans, peptidoglycans are not susceptible to proteases because peptidoglycans do not contain the proteoglycan core protein. The peptidoglycans instead contain small peptides that simulate the desired core protein activity. Given the need to prevent ECM degradation to limit OA progression coupled with the preliminary evidence of the abilities of peptiodglycans, we hypothesize that proteoglycan mimics can protect HA and type II collagen in articular cartilage from cytokine-induced enzymatic degradation, thus suppressing cartilage erosion associated with OA. We further hypothesize, that lubricin mimics that interact with both HA and type II collagen can be used to restore the low friction properties of articular cartilage, thus protect th surface from mechanical wear. Our immediate goals are to optimize the peptidoglycans ex vivo, improve our mechanistic understanding of their function, and assess in vivo efficacy of the compounds. Our long term goals include formulating the peptidoglycans for delivery to injured joints to alleviate OA symptoms and protect against further ECM degradation."
"9058072","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, and costs of two patient-centered, theory-based, technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs to initiate and sustain weight loss among pre-diabetic adults (i.e. impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) within a health care setting. The overall aim is consistent with the NIDDK's Behavioral/Prevention Research Program's focus on individual, family, and community-based strategies for prevention of diabetes and its complications. While evidence of lifestyle interventions that increase physical activity and improve eating habits to achieve modest weight loss in delaying and preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes continues to mount, the translation of these interventions into effective programs to health care settings with modest resources remains a challenge. The proposed research project will conduct a pragmatic clinical trial that employs a hybrid Preference/Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) designed to compare two technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs in achieving objectively verified weight loss relative to a standard care control at comparatively lower costs. Adult patients (18 years of age and older) at risk for developing diabetes will be randomized to either the Choice group or the Randomization group. Those patients randomized to the Choice group (n=240) will have the opportunity to choose one of two programs to participate in: 1. A 2-hour Small-Group (SG) session, with automated interactive voice response (IVR) systems targeting personal action planning to support lifestyle change and weight loss over a period of 12 months; or 2. A DVD-based intervention with the same IVR follow-up. Those patients assigned to the RCT group (n=360) will be randomized to one of three groups: 1. SG/IVR; 2. DVD/IVR; or 3. Enhanced standard-care (SC). SC includes the referral to a currently offered pre-diabetes class. Primary outcome measures include weight loss, cost, and reach of each program. Secondary outcome measures include physical activity behavior; eating behavior; and process evaluation. It is hypothesized that both the SG/IVR and the DVD/IVR interventions will produce significantly greater amounts of weight loss at 6, 12, and 18 months following program initiation than SC but will not differ from one another. We also hypothesize that the DVD/IVR will have broader reach and may be more cost-effective than SG/IVR or SC."

"9334539","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Salmonella infection is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. It is estimated to cause about 1.2 million illnesses in the Unitd States each year, with about 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths. A deep knowledge of its physiology and pathogenesis is important for identifying novel targets to develop new antimicrobial agents due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains. Currently, the genetic code expansion strategy has been widely used to incorporate various unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into target proteins to solve the problems which are difficult or impossible to address by most classical methods due to the limited chemical diversity of the 20 natural amino acids. However, very few studies have been reported to incorporate UAAs in human pathogens such as Salmonella. Here, we will expand the genetic code in Salmonella by introducing an orthogonal translation system (OTS) which can efficiently incorporate various UAAs into target proteins to form labels and probes for confocal microscopy, paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Aim 1). For proof-of-concept, we will use this OTS to investigate the spatial organization of bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) in Salmonella which has not been studied before (Aim 2). BMCs are large protein complexes containing viral capsid-like shells and encapsulated enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways. Studies have implicated 1,2-propanediol and ethanolamine degradations, which occur within BMCs, in Salmonella pathogenesis. We will incorporate p-azido-phenylalanine into the shell proteins of BMCs in Salmonella, followed by a Cu-free click reaction to form small-sized fluorescent probes for dynamic imaging to overcome the potential interference with the assemblies and functions of BMCs from the commonly used fluorescent protein tags. The spatial distribution of BMCs, the segregation of BMCs during cell divisions, key proteins of BMCs responsible for the spatial organization, and the interactions between BMC proteins and cytoskeletal components will be determined. These studies will provide new information and may reveal new paradigms in our knowledge of BMCs. In summary, we will show a practical application of the genetic code expansion strategy in studies of bacteria. Since Salmonella is an important model pathogen, the OTS we developed in this proposal could be broadly used by many laboratories to facilitate studies of microbial pathogenesis."
"9174092","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the years since the completion of the human genome project, our ability to read the genome has improved tremendously. Frustratingly, our ability to interpret and comprehend what we can now easily read has lagged behind. Genetic variants that lie outside protein-coding regions are particularly challenging to interpret because the rules that govern their regulatory function are far less understood than the principles of protein- coding sequence. Addressing this challenge is particularly urgent because the drastic fall in whole genome sequencing costs will bring with it a wave of newly discovered non-coding and potentially causal variants. The recent completion of several genome-scale projects, and the release of pilot data from new and ongoing projects, have made it possible to begin building models whose goal is to predict the function of non-coding genetic variation. We propose the development of a brain-centric variant annotation framework that integrates temporal and spatial expression information from existing data sets, regulatory relationships established by eQTL studies, and chromatin state information uncovered by ENCODE and other studies, with the aim of providing, for any arbitrary input variant, an estimate of the magnitude of the effect, the systems or tissues most likely affected by the variant, and the stage of development at which the variant is most likely to produce a phenotype. Models will be trained on variants from whole genome sequencing studies of diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. Development of this framework will proceed in three stages: 1) the above lines of genomic evidence will be combined with other features as predictors of enrichment for variants identified in individuals with diagnosed neuropsychiatric conditions, producing a score indicative of the variant's phenotype-shaping potential; 2) spatiotemporal gene expression matrices will be integrated to provide estimates of the tissues and time points most likely affected by variation at the non- coding query locus; 3) by combining the estimates produced in stages 1 and 2, we will create a single weighted context matrix that represents the individual's aggregate regulatory variant burden in space (i.e. brain tissue/region) and time. The framework will be demonstrated on previously unpublished variants in autism and bipolar disorder. The proposed framework would to our knowledge be the first non-coding variant annotation system that focuses on the effect on the brain, and is able to guide the user as to when and where the effects of potentially functional variants are likely to emerge in an individual. A further novel aspect of the proposed system is that it will provide an integrated estimate of the overall burden context for an individual in spac and time. The proposed project will provide a valuable resource for scientists performing research in the genomics of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Perhaps more importantly, the lessons learned in the course of this project will provide the foundation for developing tools that may one day make interpreting non-coding variation in the clinic a reality."
"9171383","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activity-regulated modulation of synapse function lies at the heart of molecular theories of learning and neural development, and is disrupted by diseases and disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder. In glutamatergic synapses, multi-domain proteins establish the core of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the structure which links neurotransmitter receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and to intracellular signaling pathways. Though the structures of PSDs and synapses are known to change dramatically in diverse paradigms of synaptic plasticity, it is not known to what extent structure alone-rather than molecular content such as receptor number-can control synaptic strength. We have developed tools to address this. Thus, in cultured neurons from rat hippocampus, we will use single-molecule imaging approaches along with electrophysiology and new molecular tools to tackle this central question of synapse biology. First, we will follow up on intriguing work from our prior funding period indicating that scaffold molecules in the PSD are distributed with substantial peaks and valleys of density across the PSD parallel to the membrane. We hypothesize that these peaks establish a similar organization of other proteins at points that stretch from the presynaptic terminal too deep into the spine, and particularly that PSD structure guides protein organization within the active zone, thus assuring the optimal alignment of vesicle fusion apparatus with clustered postsynaptic receptors. Second, we ask whether PSD substructure-rather than its overall size-regulates receptor activation and thus synaptic strength. We test this using new techniques to monitor postsynaptic NMDAR or AMPAR activation during concurrent super-resolution imaging to measure postsynaptic structure. Third, using a newly developed method, we analyze for the first time the distribution of vesicle release sites within single active zones. For these aims, we test the role of the key scaffolding molecule Shank in maintaining transsynaptic structural organization, both to test fundamental mechanisms and because its failure to do so may contribute significantly to human disease. The answers to these questions provide a new and detailed view of how synaptic function arises from its notoriously detailed architecture. Perhaps most importantly, they will provide an important platform on which to test hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of disorders that disrupt synaptic transmission."
"9190040","Project Summary The long-term goal of this dissertation research study is to help public and private payers build their own budget impact models, to better inform their formulary decisions, and ultimately maximize efficiency in their health care systems. We will achieve this goal by collaborating with the national TRICARE payer, which serves the military and their dependents, to develop a budget impact model for their recent formulary changes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the budget impact of TRICARE?s recent antidiabetic drug formulary changes. The specific aims of the project are: i) develop a model to predict the budgetary impact of TRICARE?s antidiabetic drug formulary changes, ii) calculate the actual empirical budget impact one year after implementation of the formulary changes, and iii) identify, compare, and contrast the cost drivers in the budget impact model versus empirical analysis. Both the budget impact model and empirical analysis will use existing TRICARE pharmacy and medical claims data. To successfully conduct this research, the principal investigator will attend International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research short-course programs in topics such as budget impact analyses, modeling, advanced decision modeling, and statistical methods in economic evaluations, as well as University of Maryland, Baltimore professional development workshops and responsible conduct of research courses. The principal investigator will also learn stakeholder engagement as a project manager in the PATIENTS Program. Additionally, the principal investigator will have biweekly 1-on-1 meetings and biweekly team meetings with the sponsor-- University of Maryland, Baltimore?s Professor Mullins, who has expertise in budget impact analyses and payer engagement, and will reinforce principles. In addition to the sponsor, four other experts in TRICARE, clinical diabetes treatment and management, decision analyses, and large databases will serve on the principal investigator?s dissertation committee and provide guidance."
"9281286","Neuronal and Glia Culture Facility  The Neuronal and Glial Culture Facility or NGF is a core facility structured to provide cultures of interest to neuroscientists. In some cases, the NGF provides training and starting supplies to investigators that prefer to learn the procedures and then continue doing the cultures themselves. In each case, the NGF facilitates and speeds up research. The NGF does not occupy physical space, it uses the equipment of the central cell culture facility of the RCMI and the NGF technician uses the equipment and space of a laboratory in the  Department of Biochemistry. Therefore, the NGF is based on a space and equipment-sharing basis. This core facility consists of a coordinator (PAF) and a technician, Mrs. Brenda Cuadrado (BC), experienced in neuronal cell culture. Among other skills, she is able to prepare neuronal cultures from fetal cortex or hippocampus, astrocytes from neonatal cerebral cortex, organotypic hippocampal slices using the Stoppini method. BC was trained at the UCC (by PAF), by Dr. C. Ghiani from UCLA and BC traveled to UK, Lexington (USA), to learn organotypic slice culture in the laboratory of Dr. Littletone. During the last year,  Mrs. Cuadrado has learned immunocytochemical methods under the guide of Dr. H. Yeh (consultant), the NGF coordinator (PAF) and Dr. H. Martins. The immunocytochemical methods are used to monitor the cultures provided by the NGF. By dedicating one technician to produce a significant part of the cultures done at the UCC alleviates in part the crowding in the culture room, the duplication of equipment and saves sera and reagents. As result of this facility, the investigators no longer need to develop from scratch the cultures. This core facility is based on a similar arrangement in the laboratory of Dr. de Vellis' laboratory  (UCLA) where a single person is dedicated to provide cultures for all the members of this prestigious group.  The proposed budget consists of supplies and personnel. Salaries of the technician (BC) the coordinator (PAF) and the consultant costs are included. Supplies include media, sera, antibodies for quality control and further development of cultures. The objective of this unit is not to exclude anyone from using the existing cell culture facility but by providing a better alternative discourage the initiation of individual neuronal culture laboratories throughout the UCC. By doing so, we will increase the efficient use of space and equipment.  By providing the expertise in brain cell culture and the labor involved, this core facility will leave more time to the investigators for the scientific endeavor."
"9182893","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to develop effective treatments for the common sporadic form of Parkinson's disease (PD) by elucidating pathogenic mechanisms, thereby facilitating identification of neuroprotective interventions. PD is characterized by degeneration of groups of neurons in the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems with formation of eosinophilic intracellular inclusion, Lewy bodies, in surviving neurons; the prominent motor symptoms of PD are attributable to severe loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Convergent genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence implicates (i) alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic protein and a major component of Lewy bodies, and (ii) abnormalities of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and resulting oxidative damage, in pathogenesis. In preliminary studies, we showed that these factors are mechanistically interdependent. Chronic exposure of rats to rotenone, a pesticide that is epidemiologically linked to PD, causes systemic mitochondrial complex I inhibition, resulting in specific neuropathology closely resembling PD (including alpha-synuclein aggregate formation). Abrogation of alpha-synuclein gene expression in the substantia nigra of rats prevented neurodegeneration, demonstrating that the PD-like neuropathology resulting from this etiologically-relevant environmental trigger is dependent on endogenous alpha-synuclein. Interactions between alpha-synuclein and mitochondria have been suggested previously, but the mechanisms whereby alpha-synuclein is necessary for susceptibility of dopamine neurons to etiologically-relevant mitochondrial toxins in vivo are not known. In order to address this question, we will employ a range of innovative models and tools, including: viral vectors that abrogate SNCA expression in vivo; transgenic zebrafish models in which neurodegeneration triggered by mitochondrial toxins is dependent on human alpha-synuclein; and novel transgenic zebrafish lines that express fluorescent reporters, allowing detection of dynamic changes in reactive oxygen species, glutathione oxidation, ATP levels, and mitochondrial fission, fusion and transport, in live dopamine neurons in vivo. Using these unique tools, we will determine how alpha- synuclein affects ROS production and oxidative stress (aim 1), cellular respiration and bioenergetics (aim 2) and mitochondrial dynamics (aim 3) following exposure to mitochondrial toxins implicated in PD pathogenesis, in mammalian and zebrafish dopamine neurons in vivo. In aim 4, we will exploit automated behavioral measurements in zebrafish larvae housed in 96-well plates to discover small molecule modifiers of alpha-synuclein-dependent toxicity of mitochondrial inhibitors in dopamine neurons. These data will elucidate the mechanisms underlying alpha-synuclein-dependent degeneration of dopamine neurons in response to mitochondrial toxins implicated in PD pathogenesis. The unique array of model systems and the team of investigators will enable us to understand the mechanistic link between the two most prominent pathological abnormalities in sporadic PD and thereby address a critical roadblock in the development of PD therapeutics."

"9182896","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current methods for identifying links between an individual's exposure to toxic air pollutants and adverse health outcomes suffer shortcomings of limited temporal and spatial granularity in exposure monitoring and the lack of real-time analysis to establish a causal relationship between an individual's exposure profile and impact on health. The goals of this proposal are 1) to provide researchers with a new tool to better assess the impacts of pollutant exposure to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and 2) to provide individuals with an inexpensive wearable device for real-time reporting of exposure data for personalized alerts and managed care services. In the long term, a significantly improved medical understanding of air toxics would allow more relevant regulation of toxic air pollutants and more effective personal prevention plans. To achieve these goals, we propose to explore several key technologies and approaches that will enable implementation of a novel wearable, autonomous, sensor array microsystem for acute multi-pollutant exposure assessment, with real-time monitoring of toxic gases and volatile organic compounds, initially targeting SO2, NOx, CO, ozone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, and o-nitrobenzene. The proposed exposure assessment microsystem will integrate into an inexpensive thumb-sized device with all of the sensing, signal conditioning and data analysis necessary to overcome the limitations of existing air pollution instruments. These groundbreaking capabilities will be accomplished through innovations including 1) systematic design across all layers of the sensor microsystem to uniquely achieve desired system attributes, 2) development of new, miniaturizable, ionic liquid electrochemical sensors, 3) incorporation of multi-mode electrochemical techniques to enhance analytical information content, enabling sensitivity improvement, automated drift calibration, and sensing of diverse pollutants with a small number of physical sensor elements, and 4) design of computationally efficient sensor array processing algorithms for real-time classification and quantification of target analytes. This project will pursue the following specifc aims: Aim 1: Develop and characterize a miniaturized electrochemical sensor array for detection and quantification of multiple air pollutants, Aim 2: Develop compact, energy efficient, instrumentation electronics and heterogeneous sensor array processing algorithms to enable an autonomous wearable microsystem, Aim 3: Integrate and characterize a model multi-pollutant electrochemical microsystem and benchmark its performance in the field against standard exposure assessment equipment. Through a combination of accuracy, reliability, small size, low power, real-time measurement, and autonomous operation, the proposed system will provide revolutionary capability to individual exposure monitoring and the study, treatment, and prevention of health impacts of acute exposure to air toxics. Our highly skilled, multidisciplinary team has expertise in electrochemical sensor interface design and characterization, integrated microarray and microelectronic instrumentation development, and exposure assessment and health effects of air pollutants."
"9180679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clearance of intracellular bacterial pathogens requires initiation of an effective immune response. However, pathogens have evolved virulence factors to disable such immune responses. A key gap in our knowledge is to understand how successful host defense can be achieved despite pathogen subversion. Legionella pneumophila, an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, disarms and replicates within alveolar macrophages by delivering bacterial effectors via a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Several T4SS effectors potently block host protein synthesis. However, host sensing of Legionella T4SS-translocated substrates paradoxically enhances cytokine production. To elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of this host response, we developed a powerful approach to simultaneously track bacterial effector translocation and cytokine responses at the single cell level. We found that infected cells poorly produced several key cytokines, but could still synthesize and release IL-1 family cytokines. Moreover, IL-1 signaling was required for robust production of cytokines by uninfected immune cells and neutrophil-attracting chemokines by lung epithelial cells. Our findings indicate that paracrine IL-1 signaling circumvents the pathogen-imposed translational block to orchestrate a rapid immune response by uninfected bystander cells. While IL-1 signaling is critical for the initiation of host defense,the cell types responding to IL-1 and the specific consequences of IL-1? and IL-1? responses in these cells are unclear. Moreover, mice lacking IL-1 signaling eventually recover bystander cytokine responses, neutrophil recruitment, and control over infection, suggesting that IL-1-independent immune signals coordinate an additional layer of host defense. Thus, we propose the following Aims to define how IL-1-dependent and IL-1-independent immune mechanisms collaborate to generate successful immunity. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that IL-1? and IL-1? regulate distinct immune functions in different cell types. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that additional IL-1-independent immune signals ensure bystander cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment at later stages of Legionella infection. Together, these studies will define novel innate immune mechanisms employed by the host to surmount pathogen-encoded virulence activities. The proposed research will therefore provide vital insight into mechanisms of host defense that are utilized against broad classes of microbial pathogens and aid development of improved anti-microbial therapeutics and vaccines."
"9269842","Project Summary/Abstract  Multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a growing concern with increasing morbidity and mortality particularly for HIV-positive patients. The HIV/TB epidemic co-exists alongside increasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. The dual burden of infectious and non-communicable disease leads to a unique pattern of multi-morbidity, the presence of 2 or more chronic diseases. MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients are particularly vulnerable to diseases such as hypertension or diabetes which increase cardiovascular risk. Few studies have explored multi-morbidity focused on CVD risk factors among patients with MDR-TB/HIV co-infection. The purpose of this study is to characterize the multi-morbidity of CVD risk factors among HIV and MDR-TB co-infected patients and to determine the association of CVD risk score, estimations of the burden of multi-morbidity, and social determinants of health with MDR-TB treatment outcomes. This proposed study is a secondary data analysis of a large cluster randomized controlled trial of nurse case management to improve outcomes among MDR-TB patients in South Africa [R01 AI104488-01A1, PI: J. Farley]. The specific aims among the HIV-positive subset of this MDR-TB protocol are: (1) to determine the prevalence of CVD risk factors (e.g. diabetes, elevated BMI, smoking and hypertension) along with the frequency of elevated CVD risk score; (2) to explore the impact of individual and combined CVD risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension on 6-month negative treatment outcomes (i.e. death, loss to follow-up or treatment failure) through sub-group analysis; and (3) to explore the association of multi-morbidity to 6-month negative treatment outcomes. This project is guided by a modified WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions model specific to infectious and non-communicable disease multi-morbidity. Secondary data analysis will be completed for the MDR-TB/HIV co-infected subset of patients enrolled in the parent study by March 2017 based on study variables collected by the parent study. A non- laboratory CVD risk score validated in a South African population will be the primary measure of CVD multi- morbidity burden. This study will help to better describe the prevalence and impact of CVD multi-morbidity on this already vulnerable population of MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients. It is aligned well with the Office of AIDS Research NIH priorities to understand co-morbidities among HIV patients and the NINR strategic mission to improve health outcomes and health services. This training plan will begin a program of research designed to understand the complex interactions between conditions such as HIV, TB, and CVD risk factors from a socioecological framework and develop interventions to improve the lives of this patient population."
"9172229","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of host defense, and although they are used clinically to treat a number of diseases, their precise mechanisms of action remain to be completely understood. IFNs induce the transcription of a subset of genes called IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that are responsible for complex biological effects. Only by understanding the function of individual ISGs will the molecular basis of IFN antiviral activity be realized. Expression of one ISG, ISG54/IFIT2, promotes apoptosis, and the broad objectives of this proposal are to determine the protective role of ISG54 in innate immunity and in viral latency. Mice have been generated with a targeted deletion in the ISG54 gene, and these mice have increased susceptibility to latency establishment by murine ?-herpesvirus 68.  Host defense mechanisms are uniquely challenged by herpesviruses which evade innate and adaptive immune controls to establish chronic, life-long infections. There is a need to elucidate the dynamic interface between virus and host in order to harness the action of host defense mechanisms in the development of novel therapeutics. The ?-herpesviruses, Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, are associated with morbidity and mortality worldwide resulting from lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma, carcinoma, and sarcoma, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. Therapeutic intervention of latent infections is medically challenging. Since these viruses are species-specific, methods to study immune control are limited. The closely related murine ?-herpesvirus 68 provides a vital, small animal model system to dissect virus-host interactions that determine the pathogenic outcome in a natural host. The specific aims of the proposal are designed to evaluate the protective role of ISG54 both in an animal model of infection and in tissue culture systems, and to discover the molecular mechanisms of ISG54 that trigger apoptosis. Specific Aim 1: Establish the role of ISG54 at the host-pathogen interface. Murine models of disease have been invaluable to understand the role of the innate immune system in controlling pathogens. The ISG54 knockout mouse will be used to determine the mechanisms by which ISG54 regulates latent infection of the MHV-68 model pathogen. Specific Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanisms of ISG54/IFIT2 action. Expression of ISG54 promotes mitochondrial apoptosis, and it is known that ISG54 exists within the cell in large molecular complexes with other proteins. Studies are designed to provide mechanistic insight to the impact of ISG54 on pro-apoptotic factors and critical binding partners. An in vivo model of disease and in vitro systems will be used to dissect the molecular mechanisms of an IFN-induced host defense gene at the viral interface. Achievement of our objectives is expected to provide knowledge necessary to harness the action of ISG54 and fill the need for new therapeutic development."
"9172211","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Background Veterans with amputation are an important population facing considerable physical, social, and emotional challenges that can impede their reintegration into the community. We define community reintegration as activities and participation across a range of life roles including Relationship with spouse/significant other; Parenting; Education; Work; Social; Leisure; Spiritual/Religious, Civic; Self Care; Domestic Life; and Economic Life. While the majority of Veterans with amputation enjoy full and productive lives in these areas, studies have documented increased rates of psychological distress and role limitation within this population. Medical devices (i.e., prostheses designed to maximize balance and mobility) and psychosocial interventions (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapies) offer opportunities to further enhance community reintegration. Unfortunately, a lack of systematic data on the community reintegration of Veterans with amputation, including associated physical and contextual factors, hampers our ability to most effectively design and target future devices and interventions. Project Objectives This project is a novel collaboration between a group of psychologist clinician investigators with expertise in reintegration, qualitative (survey) methodology and quantitative methods and an accomplished group of biomedical engineers with expertise in amputation, prostheses, and mHealth technology. The overall goal of this collaboration is to generate systematic information about the community reintegration outcomes of Veterans with amputation needed to advance the development or refinement of interventions and technologies aimed at improving reintegration outcomes. The specific aims for this pilot (SPiRE) proposal are: Specific Aim 1: To characterize community reintegration and its associated physical (i.e., amputation and medical comorbidity) and contextual (i.e., psychological, environmental, and medical device) factors. Specific Aim 2: To obtain a deeper understanding of Veterans' experience of community reintegration and discover potential barriers and facilitators of community reintegration among Veterans with amputation. Project Methods This is a mixed-methods investigation of Veterans with major lower limb amputation who have received services from the Minneapolis VA Regional Amputation Center (RAC). Aim 1 will utilize a mailed survey of 425 Veterans with amputation identified through a RAC database. The survey will assess community reintegration with validated measures of social and community participation that are normed within disability and general population samples. It will also include important correlates of reintegration including measures of psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety, body image), physical (e.g., prosthetic use, pain) and environmental (e.g., social support) factors related to reintegration. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the independent contribution of each variable over and above demographic factors. Aim 2 will be addressed using data from qualitative interviews with a subset of Veterans (n=24) with varying levels of community reintegration stratified by service era. In-depth interviews will explore Veterans' perspectives on reintegration; aids and supports; perceived barriers and facilitators; perceived needs for medical and psychosocial services; and interest in and use of medical technologies related to reintegration. A rapid turn- around qualitative analytic approach will be used to extrac and summarize key themes. Results will be used to inform the development of new technological (e.g., prostheses, mHealth applications) and psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting and enhancing Veteran community reintegration."
"9182895","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to air pollution is associated with adverse health outcomes and people with pre- existing cardiovascular or respiratory disease are more susceptible. In particular, exposure to ozone is associated with exacerbations of asthma. There is also evidence from several studies that exposure to ozone is associated with the development of asthma, though these findings are not always consistent. Gene-environment interactions (GxE) have been proposed as an explanation for the inconsistency of the ozone -to-asthma association across studies. The investigators submit that by identifying these GxE in a mouse model of ozone-induced allergic airway disease (AAD) using an unbiased, genome-wide approach they can gain insight into the mechanisms by which ozone affects pulmonary and immune responses in the lung. To identify these GxE, the investigators will leverage a new mouse genetics resource, the Collaborative Cross (CC). The CC consists of a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from eight-way crosses using a diverse set of inbred strains and provides ideal features for studying GxE and identifying the underlying molecular processes. Based on prior studies showing that ozone primes the immune system towards an allergy-prone phenotype, the investigators have designed a study in which mice are first exposed to ozone (or filtered air), and then are subjected to house dust mite (HDM) allergen sensitization and challenge (ozone-to-HDM) through the airway. In Aim 1, the investigators will characterize population level variation and heritability of AAD phenotypes in response to ozone-to-HDM among 100 CC lines. Based on this distribution, they will identify strains that have extreme responses (high and low) to ozone-to-HDM. These strains will be used in Aim 2 to test whether responses to ozone alone (neutrophilia and airway hyper-responsiveness) predict response to ozone-to-HDM and whether known effects of ozone on several immune parameters (macrophage, CD4+ T-cell, and dendritic cell number and activation status) are correlated with response to ozone-to-HDM. In Aim 3, the investigators will identify novel genetic and genomic predictors of response to ozone-to-HDM using genome- wide approaches. Specifically, they will measure lung gene expression using RNA-sequencing, and identify quantitative trait locus (QTL) and gene expression QTL (eQTL). Finally, by merging the QTL and eQTL data, the investigators will identify candidate genes for QTL using advanced statistical modeling and bioinformatic approaches. In summary, this grant application utilizes innovative and yet feasible approaches to identify genes and pathways that mediate the effect of ozone on subsequent response to allergen, and the results will offer new avenues of research into the health effects of ozone."
"9114894","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Stroke is the leading cause of serious, chronic disability in adults worldwide. Over 750,000 new strokes occur in the United States each year accounting for over half of all acute neurological hospital admissions in both civilian and Veterans' hospitals. The most persistent stroke-related motor impairments affect the upper- extremity (UE)14. Among survivors, 73-88% present with sensorimotor impairments affecting upper-extremity function and 55-75% experience difficulty using the arm for activities of daily living activities. To date, upper- extremity rehabilitation fr post-stroke hemiparesis has produced highly variable outcomes revealing minimal genuine change in motor impairment or functional use of the affected arm. Our long-term goal is to restore UE motor function following stroke. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve our understanding of neural mechanisms contributing to inter-limb and inter-hemispheric transfer following non-paretic limb exercise to task failure. We will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe acute adaptations in cortical excitability, intracortical and inter-hemispheri circuits that accompany behavioral facilitation of the paretic hand. The work proposed in the current application will enable us to obtain three data elements that are critical to our current working hypothesis. We will: 1) investigate changes in intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition in both hemispheres following non-paretic limb exercise to task failure; 2) test behavioral effects on paretic limb function using a motor task involving manipulation and dexterity; 3) determine the persistence (i.e., time course) of acute neural and behavioral facilitation and its consistency over repeated sessions. Our results will inform regarding the mechanisms of inter-limb and inter-hemispheric transfer post-stroke and contribute development of a clinical intervention to be tested in future studies. The data obtained in this small study wil prevent failure of a larger, clinical investigation by enabling us to develop appropriately focused mechanistic hypotheses, understand the effects elicited and therefore project a sample size to afford appropriate statistical power in our future study. Ultimately, the work conducted in this small project and future studies will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiology of motor recovery following stroke, providing insight regarding the phenomenon of interlimb transfer and the associated mechanisms of neural plasticity.

"9170741","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Members of the genus Flaviviruses, such as West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue virus, are human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality in ever-widening geographic areas of the world. Currently, there are few vaccines and no available efficacious antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. A Mendelian dominant allele of the Flv gene that was first discovered in mice in the 1920's reduces the replication efficiency of all members of the genus Flavivirus so far tested and confers resistance to flavivirus-induced disease. Resistant mice display no symptoms even after an intracerebral injection of a flavivirus dose that kills 100% of congenic susceptible mice. Viral attachment and entry are not blocked but intracellular viral RNA levels and extracellular virus production are reduced in resistant cells. The Flv locus was subsequently identified as the Oas1b gene. Susceptible mice express a truncated Oas1b protein due to the presence of a premature stop codon. Replacement of the susceptible Oas1b allele by knock-in of the Oas1b resistance allele using targeted homologous recombination converted susceptible C57BL/6 mice to the resistant phenotype. Oas1b is a member of the 2-5A synthetase family but the products of both alleles of this gene are inactive synthetases. The unique flavivirus-specific antiviral activity of Oas1b is not dependent on the canonical RNase L pathway. The recent identification of cell partners for Oas1b has provided new directions for gaining an understanding of this novel, natural, flavivirus-specific antiviral mechanism. Preliminary data for one of the Oas1b binding partners, ABCF3, indicate that it is specifically involved in the flavivirus-resistance mechanism and that it may also be involved in regulating the canonical Oas-RNase L pathway. Functional contributions of the Oas1b binding partners to the flavivirus-specific resistance phenotype and for one of the partners, a contribution to a broad spectrum antiviral pathway will be studied under three specific aims. Aim 1: Characterization of the resistance phenotype in various types of cell cultures and functional analyses of the involvement of Oas1b partner proteins in the flavivirus resistance mechanism. Aim 2: Characterization of the resistance phenotype in mouse brains and analysis of the requirement of ABCF3 for the Oas1b-mediated, flavivirus-specific resistance phenotype in mice. Aim 3: Functional analysis of the interaction of ABCF3 with the active 2-5A synthetase Oas1a. This project will provide new knowledge about a novel, naturally-occurring, genetically-controlled, flavivirus-specific disease resistance mechanism in mice as well as reveal new information about the unique step in the flavivirus replication cycle that is affected by this resistance mechanism. This information is expected to identify new cell targets for the development of pan-flavivirus antiviral therapeutics. New insights about the regulation of the Oas-RNase L pathway will also be obtained."
"9172620","DESCRIPTION:      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) robustly predicts anger and aggression (Olatunji, Ciesielski, & Tolin, 2010), and U.S. Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans report that controlling anger and aggressive urges are primary readjustment concerns (Sayer et al, 2010). Trauma-related anger and aggression are associated with functional impairments that significantly limit community reintegration (Rodriguez, Holowka, & Marx, 2012) and that may persist for decades (Koenen et al, 2003). As more troops return from multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, there is an urgent and growing need for the development and testing of psychosocial treatment for anger and aggression in combat Veterans with PTSD. VA clinicians are doing their best to be responsive to Veteran's needs by offering anger management treatment to Veterans: A survey of clinical practices within the VA conducted found that 35-65% of VA PTSD specialists report providing anger management to their patients (Rosen et al., 2004). Yet to date only one randomized clinical trial (RCT), published in 1997, has investigated the efficacy of treatment of anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD (Chemtob et al., 1997).  A recent review noted that most researchers who have examined the effects of anger management interventions have not done so as part of a systematic program of research (DiGiuseppe & Tafrate, 2003). The proposed CDA-2 application outlines Training and Mentoring Plans that will provide the applicant with the foundation to establish a career systematically developing, testing, and refining treatments for PTSD-related anger and aggression in Veterans. The following specific Training Goals have been formulated: 1) To acquire the advanced skills in the development and evaluation of clinical interventions necessary to begin an independent research career within the VA; 2) To develop greater expertise in delivery of behavioral interventions to improve functional outcomes and community reintegration in Veterans with PTSD, anger problems, and aggression; 3) To acquire expertise in the development and evaluation of treatment innovations to help Veterans generalize treatment gains beyond the therapy setting; 4) To increase understanding of rehabilitation theory and methods in treatment practices and research; and 5) To achieve critical professional development milestones, including submission of a Merit Review proposal based on the pilot data generated from the CDA-2 project.  The Research Plan proposes a pilot feasibility trial for an RCT of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anger and Aggression in Combat Veterans with PTSD (CBT-A). CBT-A is a 12-week manualized group treatment protocol that has been designed to address the specific needs of combat Veterans whose PTSD-related anger and aggression interfere with effective community reintegration. The group was implemented with 4 male Vietnam Veterans with severe combat-related PTSD who had been referred for anger management treatment, and preliminary data were promising. The active comparison treatment for the pilot RCT will be group Present- Centered Therapy (PCT), a manualized treatment for PTSD that controls for treatment time, social support, and instillation of hope. The proposed research project will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize the differential effects of group CBT-A and group PCT on anger, aggression, and anger/aggression-related limitations to psychosocial functioning and community reintegration in combat Veterans with PTSD; and Aim 2: Evaluate study feasibility and treatment delivery procedures of an RCT comparing CBT-A to a PCT comparison condition. The results generated will guide the design of a full RCT to be funded by the end of the CDA-2 funding period. The research, training, and mentoring plans outlined here will provide the foundation for the PI's independent research career developing a systematic program of research in the treatment of anger and aggression among combat Veterans with PTSD. The availability of empirically-supported anger treatment would benefit the many Veterans with PTSD who return from combat reporting problems with anger and aggression."
"9148240","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   All presently available neural stimulation methods are either invasive or can only be moderately localized, and a neurostimulation method that could overcome these limitations would be invaluable for brain circuit investigation. Neural stimulation with magnetic resonance guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is a promising technology that can noninvasively excite or inhibit neural activity in well-defined discrete volumes of the brain, subsequently enabling investigation of brain circuits with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We seek to explore this brain stimulation method in the somatosensory and visual systems of non- human primates with the goal of quantifying and expanding the capabilities of MRgHIFU as a tool for understanding neural circuits. The significance of this proposal results from the potential for ultrasound to be used as an investigative tool for neural stimulation that can address the shortcomings of other available methods. The mechanism of action of ultrasound on neurons suggests that different acoustic pulses can selectively activate neurons based on their ion channel types, allowing for cells to be differentially stimulated. In our preliminary work, we have developed methods for measuring and subsequently optimizing acoustic beams using MRI and designed a transducer array that is optimized for stimulation of the macaque cortex. We will integrate this into a high-field (7T) human magnet and implement novel methods for transcranially focusing a small burst of ultrasound within the macaque cortex in a controlled manner. With this technology in place, we will leverage our background in behavioral and neurophysiological measurements in macaques to quantify effects at the macro-, meso-, and microscale in behaving animals. We will then use blood oxygen level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI) to map the S1 subregions of the brain during stimulation. Specifically, we will quantify the effect of acoustic parameters on BOLD fMRI and use ultrasound to inhibit or excite the skin tactile evoked response, while imaging the subsequent change in the BOLD signal. We will also use ultrasound to evoke activation patterns, and investigate the fine, middle, and long range circuits of the brain. Acoustic pulses will be designed to excite or inhibit neurons based on a newly validated model of the interaction of ultrasound with neurons. This model couples acoustically induced oscillation of cell membranes to the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation and may provide a method to differentially stimulate neurons based on their ion channels, which would be a very powerful and unprecedented neurostimulation technology. We propose simple experiments in a highly relevant animal that would test the utility of this model to design ultrasonic stimulation (either exciting or inhibiting) in localized regions and examine the BOLD fMRI signals resulting from such stimulation. The completion of these aims will expand the capabilities of MRgHIFU in conjunction with fMRI for investigating neural circuits, paving this way for this potentially important new approach to the assessment of brain function."
"8968534","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to reduce falls in older adults by improving their ability to recover equilibrium during a slip or trip. The proposed strategy is to use AMES, an FDA-cleared, non-invasive intervention that has been shown to enhance motor performance in able-bodied adults and to reduce sensorimotor impairment in both the upper and lower limbs of people with CNS injuries. Based on results from previous studies, we now hypothesize that the AMES intervention can reduce falls in near-frail older adults (ages 65-95 years) by increasing leg strength, reducing reaction time, and improving leg and axial motor coordination. This project has the following specific aims: (1) to modify the hardware and software of the AMES device to deliver the testing and training proposed in this study, and (2) to test the proof-of-concept, that 9 hours of AMES training on each leg is sufficient to reduce falls in the study participants receiving AMES. In the proposed proof-of-concept study, an AMES device will be used to train both legs of 10 near-frail older residents in the Arkansas Veterans' Home of Fayetteville (Test Group). Another comparable group of 10 participants will also be enrolled, but will not receive AMES training (Control Group). At baseline, all 20 participants will be able to ambulate independently, with or without assistive devices. All participants will be evaluated for sensorimotor impairments (i.e., ankle strength, ankle range of motion and joint position control, and ankle proprioception) and motor function (i.e., balance and gait) at the beginning and end of a 3-month period during which the Test Group will receive AMES training and the Control group will not. During this 3- month period and also in the 3 months that follow (i.e., for a total of 6 months), the incidence of falls in all participants will be tracked. Participants in the Test Group are expected to experience an increase in leg strength, a decrease in leg reaction time, and an improvement in leg proprioception and, in parallel, a reduction in leg impairment and improvement in leg function. Participants in the Test Group are also expected to experience fewer falls over the 6-month tracking period, compared to the number of falls in the Control Group over this same time period."

"9173018","?    DESCRIPTION:  Bacterial Infections are an important and emerging global healthcare issue. ?-Lactam antibiotics, one of the most important developments in modern medicine, have saved millions of lives and continue to serve as the major therapy to treat bacterial infections. The highly reactive four- membered ?-lactam ring is the key structure for dictating efficacy of this class of antibiotics. Unfortunately, bacteria are rapidly developing resistance to one or more of the most frequently used antibiotics. ?-Lactamase production and excretion is a major defense mechanism employed by several drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. For example, nearly 30% of hospital- acquired infections are identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains that are resistant to penicillin, methicillin and many other ?-lactam antibiotics, leading to serious infection problems for patients. Currently, vancomycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid are among the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Although these antibiotics are among the strongest of their classes, the high frequency use has resulted in their decreased susceptibility. Efficient antibiotics and/or antimicrobial agents are in high demand, but have limited success in fighting bacterial resistance. We discover a class of charged metallopolymers that exhibits synergistic effects against multidrug resistant bacteria by effectively lysing bacterial cells and efficiently disarming activity of ?-lactamases. Various conventional ?-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin-G, amoxicillin, ampicillin and cefazolin, are protected from ?-lactamase hydrolysis via the formation of unique ion-pairs between their carboxylate anions and cationic metallopolymers. There are at least three innovations involved in this project: (1) our approaches effectively prevent bacterial resistance by protecting and reinstating antibiotics; (2) more importantly our metallopolymer platforms eliminate the possibility of recurrence of bacterial resistance via disarming ?- lactamases and disrupting cell membranes; (3) these metallopolymers are non- or minimally cytotoxic for mammalian cells. Our research and discoveries could provide a new pathway to designing macromolecular scaffolds to regenerate vitality of conventional antibiotics to kill multidrug resistant bacteria and superbugs."
"9182898","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental arsenic contamination poses a major threat to public health, affecting over 140 million people in the US and worldwide. Epidemiological studies show a link between arsenic exposure and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), yet the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying this link remain poorly understood. At the cellular level, arsenic induces adaptive changes known as the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress response. The ER stress response is critically implicated in insulin dysregulation and impaired glucose homeostasis that are key hallmarks of T2DM. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that arsenic exposures cause diabetes by inducing the cellular ER stress response. To test this hypothesis and to elucidate the molecular and genetic mechanisms of arsenic-induced ER stress, we propose a multidisciplinary study with the following specific aims: 1) to perform genome-wide functional genetic screens to discover a comprehensive map of genes and genetic pathways that are critically involved in arsenic-induced ER stress, 2) to test the hypothesis that arsenic impacts glucose homeostasis (i.e. insulin production in pancreatic beta cells and glucose utilization in fat cells) through its functional modulation of ER stress genes, and 3) to identify genetic variants in the arsenic-specific ER stress genes and assess their association with T2DM in a human population. This integrative and multidisciplinary study will advance our understanding of the well-established yet poorly understood diabetogenic effects of arsenic exposure. The research will further strengthen the link between a widespread environmental toxin contaminant (arsenic) and T2DM--an increasingly prevalent and devastating human disease. Mechanistic insights gained from the study may ultimately lead to better strategies for the diagnosis, prevention and alleviation of T2DM caused by exposure to arsenic in the environment. Furthermore, our study on ER stress response will contribute to the understanding of other human diseases, in which etiology resides at gene-environment interactions that cause cellular stress and adaptive responses."

"9181415","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing evidence suggests that exposure to endocrine disruptors are associated with obesity and diabetes. One such endocrine disruptor, which humans are widely exposed to, is bisphenol-A (BPA). BPA production has increased in the last decade. Although animal studies demonstrate that BPA induces metabolic changes that lead to altered glucose homeostasis, no prospective human studies have examined the association between BPA and incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or gestational diabetes (GDM). GDM complicates 7 to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. and its incidence has increased 35-90% in the past decade. Women with GDM are at high risk of T2DM and their offspring are more likely to develop obesity and T2DM during childhood.  To assess a potential causal association between urinary levels of BPA in pregnancy and the onset of GDM, adverse changes in biomarkers of insulin resistance and liver enzymes, the proposed study will enroll 3,350 ethnically diverse pregnant women early in gestation and follow them prospectively until delivery. The baseline in-person study visit will coincide with the routine integrated screening blood test (10-13 weeks). The visit will include a blood draw for markers of insulin resistance and liver enzymes, urine specimen collection, anthropometric measurements, and questionnaires to assess exposure to BPA and other covariates. Women will be asked to mail a second urine specimen one month later (14-17 weeks). We will average the 2 measurements of BPA to help account for variability in the exposure. During the routine screening for GDM (24-28 weeks) additional blood samples will be collected for measurements of markers of insulin resistance and liver enzyme. Given the high cost of measuring BPA and metabolic biomarkers (glucose, insulin, adiponectin, GGT and ALT); we will obtain these measurements from 300 GDM cases and 600 controls to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study (cases will be matched to controls on age, race-ethnicity and gestational age at the GDM screening). This nested case-control study will address the following hypotheses: a) higher early pregnancy urinary levels of BPA are associated with an increased risk of GDM (Aim 1); b) higher early pregnancy urinary levels of BPA are associated with adverse changes in adiponectin and insulin levels and the liver enzymes GGT and ALT (Aims 2 and 3); c) markers of insulin resistance and liver enzymes partially mediate the association between BPA and GDM (Aim 4); and d) higher urinary levels of BPA will be associated with an increased risk of having a LGA infant, and the association may be partially mediated by GDM (Aim 5). This study will allow for the examination of potential mediating factors and exploration of the mechanisms underlying the association between BPA exposure and GDM risk and to address an important public health concern: the potentially harmful effects of BPA on pregnancy glucose metabolism and diabetes. Findings from this study might help in developing policies for the regulation of BPA use and be translated into prevention strategies for diabetes."
"9182897","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  DNA helicases are ubiquitous and vast in number, serving important roles in various facets of chromosome metabolism, including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. We have been interested in a unique class of helicases called the RecQ family, with five distinct members in humans. Genetic defects in three of these helicases, viz., BLM, RTS, and WRN, give rise to human syndromes associated with cancer predisposition. Importantly, genetic ablation of RecQ5 also engenders cancer susceptibility in mice. Thus, the RecQ helicases are clearly important for genome maintenance and cancer avoidance. The BLM helicase, mutations in which being the cause of the radiation-sensitive and cancer-prone disorder Bloom's syndrome, functions in two critical stages of homologous recombination (HR)- mediated chromosome damage repair, namely, in the resection of DNA double-strand breaks and the dissolution of the double Holliday Junction, a late HR intermediate. Defects in BLM and its partner proteins thus lead to impaired initiation of homologous repair, frequent sister chromatid exchanges, and chromosome aberrations. Even though RECQ5 has not yet been associated with a human disease, its ablation in mice results in cancer susceptibility. RECQ5-deficient cells exhibit DNA damage sensitivity, elevated sister chromatid exchanges and HR events, and are prone to chromosomal rearrangements upon genotoxic stress. RECQ5 physically interacts with the RAD51 recombinase and displaces RAD51 from DNA. These results implicate RECQ5 as a tumor suppressor that acts by preventing inappropriate HR events via the disruption of RAD51-DNA nucleoprotein filaments. In this renewal project, we will strive to delineate the multi-faceted role of BLM in HR repair and regulation, and to also define the mechanism underlying the novel role of RECQ5 as an anti-recombinase."
"9170956","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are life threatening and constitute a large health-care burden. Modulation of host immune responses is one paradigm used by pathogens to initiate and prolong infections. Preliminary data demonstrate that P. aeruginosa can degrade the potent immune signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its precursor sphingosine. S1P degradation would allow P. aeruginosa to alter the host immune response, which could have profound effects on progression of infection and the pathogenesis of disease. Described in this proposal is a previously uncharacterized transcription factor that regulates P. aeruginosa gene expression in response to S1P and sphingosine and is required for their degradation. Deletion of this transcription factor reduces P. aeruginosa virulence in vivo, highlighting the importance of this pathway during infection. Characterization of the detection and metabolism of sphingosine by P. aeruginosa will be a concrete contribution to understanding of sphingosine-related compounds in bacterial biology and pathogenesis. The long term goal is to understand the role of P. aeruginosa S1P and sphingosine metabolism during the course of lung infection. In pursuit of this long-term goal, the overall objectives of this application are to characterize the recognition and degradation system used by P. aeruginosa to respond to S1P and determine the impact of S1P degradation on P. aeruginosa virulence in the lung. The central hypothesis is that P. aeruginosa detection of S1P induces genes necessary for S1P degradation, which promotes virulence. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Characterize S1P and sphingosine-dependent transcription in P. aeruginosa~ (2) Identify the components of the S1P degradation pathway~ and (3) Test the impact of S1P degradation on P. aeruginosa infection. The goals of Aim 1 are to determine the ligand and promoter-binding specificities of the sphingosine-responsive transcription factor by promoter mapping, DNA binding, and reporter assays, and determine its contribution to the sphingosine regulon using microarray analysis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify the P. aeruginosa S1P phosphatase and the enzymes that degrade sphingosine using genetic screens, metabolite tracking, and in vitro enzymatic assays. Finally, the goal of Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that the reduced virulence of the transcription factor mutant is due to lack of S1P degradation, versus regulation of genes unrelated to degradation, using a mouse model of lung infection established in the applicant's lab. This proposal is innovative because it will advance understanding of a previously uncharacterized sphingosine detection and metabolic pathway, which may be used by P. aeruginosa to detect the host and interfere with a potent host signaling pathway. The proposed research is significant because it will expand understanding of the metabolic links between bacterial pathogens and the host, perhaps leading to novel antimicrobial or anti-virulence therapies."

"9177744","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most retroviral infections result in indefinite viral persistence with an undetectable or inefficient anti-virus immune response. Poor immune reactivity has made the elucidation of protective anti-retroviral pathways an incredibly arduous endeavor. There are, however, rare individuals capable of mounting a potent anti-retroviral immune response, and the study of these individuals has allowed dissection of the protective responses. For example, some Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals termed `long-term or elite non-progressors' are able to initiate and maintain robust anti-viral responses via specific genetic mechanisms. Whereas studies of retrovirus resistance in humans are complicated by genetic diversity, inbred mice offer an experimentally tractable alternative for mapping mammalian resistance and susceptibility genes. Two examples of such models are mice from the C57BL/6J (B6) and I/LnJ strains, which successfully constrain retroviruses via production of neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses. Whereas the gene responsible for controlling Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) in B6 mice has been identified (apobec3), the gene underlying retrovirus resistance in I/LnJ mice remains unknown. We have previously described a virus infectivity controller 1 (vic1) locus, containing a recessive retrovirus resistance-conferrng gene in I/LnJ mice and mapped it to Chromosome 17. Unlike apobec3, vic1 confers resistance to two distinct retroviruses, MuLV and Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). Although an initial poly-isotypic anti-virus immune response is observed in susceptible mice, it is short-lived and does not class-switch to an IgG2a response as it does in resistant ILn/J mice. Unlike virus-susceptible mice, I/LnJ mice infected with either retrovirus produce virus-neutralizing Abs, sustain this response throughout their life, and prevent infection of progeny by coating secreted virions with anti-virus Abs. Using congenic and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic approaches, we fine- mapped the vic1 locus to a 32.9Kb region between 34,211,575 -34,244,528 Kbs. A non-classical major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) gene, H2-Ob (Ob) mapped within the region was identified as the gene encoding for Vic1 by virtue of its known function, unique polymorphism and a phenotype rescue experiment. Peptide loading of MHCII molecules in the endosomes of antigen presenting cells (APCs) is catalyzed by H2-M. The evolutionally conserved Ob encodes the O? molecule that together with O?, comprises the heterodimeric H2-O molecule. H2-O is a MHCII mimic and binds to H2-M thereby inhibiting MHCII peptide presentation. The biological relevance of H2-O inhibition of MHCII peptide loading is poorly understood. Importantly, the role of H2-O during the immune response against any pathogen is completely unexplored. The successful completion of aims described in this application will reveal the mechanism by which the MHC-like molecule, H2-O controls the immune response to retroviruses."
"9182821","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epoxides are three membered cyclic ethers which can be toxic and mutagenic. They are degraded by enzymes known as epoxide hydrolases (EHs), which add water to epoxides to yield more water soluble diols. EHs are widely known for metabolizing xenobiotics, and this project advances our understanding of their fundamental structure, biochemistry and regulation. The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is the most abundant and active of the EHs in mammals, and it is largely involved in the hydrolysis of endogenous epoxides on natural fatty acids (EpFAs). Since EpFAs are powerful chemical mediators previously shown to reduce inflammation, hypertension, heart failure, and pain, their hydrolysis by the sEH can give rise to disease states. In this project we will test the hypothesis that the levels of EpFA and sEH are influenced by environmental factors, dietary status, and disease states. We also will test if decreasing sEH activity increases EpFA resulting in improved health. In Aim I, we will investigate the biochemistry of the sEH, as well as the microsomal EH (largely responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotics) and the newly discovered EH3. We will determine the relative roles of the sEH, mEH and EH3 in hydrolysis of bioactive EpFA. These biochemical and structural studies will allow prediction of the biological effects resulting from genetic alterations in human sEH. Anti-microbials in some hand soaps and some drugs are powerful inhibitors of the sEH while other environmental chemicals and drugs are powerful inducers. We will determine how these materials alter biologies regulated by the sEH and EpFA. Aim IIA is expanding analytical methods for regulatory lipids altered by disease states, environmental chemicals and drugs. These methods are being used to address the influence of environmental chemicals and nutrition on the sEH. The biochemical tools from Aim I and the analytical tools from Aim IIA will be used in Aims IIB-D to investigate how changes in the sEH and EpFA alter three separate biologies. In IIB we demonstrate that inhibition of the sEH blocks convulsions and reduces perception of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. With pain, inflammation and hypertension, we have shown that sEH inhibitors are more effective in the presence of epoxides of omega 3 rather than omega 6 fatty acids. With an increase in the use of omega 3 lipids as nutraceuticals and value added ingredients, an appreciation of their health effects is critical. We recently demonstrated EpFA from omega-3 and -6 precursors have opposite effects with sEHI on angiogenesis, allowing sEH inhibitors to reduce tumor growth and metastasis when combined with omega 3 EpFA (Aim IIC). This raises the possibly of new cancer therapeutics but cautions that omega 3 lipids could slow wound healing. Aim IID addresses how sEH inhibitors block hepatic fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride. We will test the hypothesis that there are common mechanisms underlying the largely beneficial biological effects of reduced sEH activity. The results of this project will illustrate the importance of man' total environment, including both xenobiotic exposure and nutrition, on health."
"9179665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in biomedical sciences, effective treatment options remain limited for patients suffering from neuropsychiatric diseases. While the underlying etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear for majority of the human cases, it has become increasingly clear that early neurodevelopmental defects can be a contributor to behavioral sequelae later in life. Recently, neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation abnormalities have been described in mouse models of human neuropsychiatric disorders. The postnatal rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) niche around the lateral brain ventricles is a specialized environment housing GFAP+ astrocytes functioning as neural stem cells (NSCs), producing mainly GABAergic interneurons. Postnatal SVZ neurogenesis is regulated by NSC-intrinsic mechanisms, interacting with extracellular/niche-driven cues. It is generally believed that these local effects are responsible for sustaining neurogenesis, though behavioral paradigms and disease states have pointed to possibilities for higher-level modulation. It is currently unclear if activity states from groups of neurons, or discrete neural circuits can directly control postnatal SVZ neurogenesis. We have identified acetylcholine (ACh) release by neuronal terminals into the SVZ niche. Our preliminary results have uncovered a previously undescribed population of cholinergic neurons, projecting their processes directly onto SVZ NSCs. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of these novel cholinergic neurons resulted in measurable electrical current induction in SVZ NSCs and concurrent changes in the rates of neurogenesis. We plan to further explore these observations by determining the following: 1) which higher-level brain regions provide excitatory drive to induce ACh release in the SVZ; 2) what are the molecular mechanisms required in SVZ NSCs downstream of ACh activation to promote neurogenesis; and 3) which are the SVZ niche cellular structures/organizations that can transform neuronal firing frequencies into NSC proliferation and increased neurogenesis. Our study proposes to explore a direct connection between neuronal activity from cholinergic neurons and postnatal SVZ NSC proliferation. To make this research question tractable, we have developed new mouse reagents, as well as optogenetic and live-imaging platforms to directly measure the interactions between neuronal activity patterns and SVZ neurogenesis. We believe these findings will have a positive impact by vertically advancing our functional understanding of postnatal SVZ neurogenesis control by circuit-level activity, with potentially important implications for cholinergic circuit dysfunctionin neuropsychiatric diseases."

"9171940","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to identify novel mechanisms that regulate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). ILC2 are a recently discovered population of lineage-negative lymphocytes that produce Th2 cytokines in response to epithelial cytokines IL-33 and TSLP. ILC2 contribute to an asthma phenotype in animal models and are present in human lungs. Specifically, we hypothesize that the RNA-binding protein RBM3 controls human and mouse ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and innate type 2 lung responses through Th2 cytokine mRNA stabilization. We will administer allergen, IL-33, and TSLP challenges to the airways of WT and RBM3 knockout mice and assess lung ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and proliferation, as well as levels of BAL eosinophils, epithelial mucus production, peribronchial infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness. We will also perform ILC2 adoptive transfer studies and generate RBM3 deficient IL-13 reporter mice to define the role of RBM3 in ILC2 during allergen, IL-33, and TSLP-induced airway inflammation. We will perform in vitro studies with purified ILC2 from WT and RBM3 knockout mice as well as human RMB3 siRNA knockdown ILC2 stimulated with IL-33 and TSLP and assess levels of ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and proliferation. Further, we will perform mRNA stability assays to determine whether RBM3 controls ILC2 function by stabilizing Th2 cytokine mRNAs. We expect to find that RMB3 promotes ILC2 Th2 cytokine mRNA stability and controls ILC2 Th2 cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. The novelty of the proposed studies includes use of novel reagents (RBM3-/-, RBM3-/-RAG2-/-, and RBM3-/-/YFP-IL-13 reporter mice) and uncovering a novel pathway (RNA binding protein) regulating a recently discovered cell type (ILC2) that contributes to allergic inflammation. Importantly, the discovery of molecules that regulate ILC2 function may reveal novel therapeutic targets to reduce ILC2 activation in asthma and allergic disease."

"9170955","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Using structural approaches (cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography), we will investigate the mechanisms used by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to enter host cells by engaging two receptors (decay accelerating factor and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor). CVB3 is a human pathogen that causes myocarditis, pancreatitis, and has been implicated in the onset of juvenile diabetes mellitus.

Of particular interest is a novel entry intermediate that has never been observed (Aim 1). This particle has been isolated with fingerlike density projections extruding from the capsid, and these densities are hypothesized to be peptides used to anchor the particle to the host membrane. We will investigate the capability of this new particle (and other entry intermediates) to bind receptors and infect the host. In addition to conventional structural studies made with purified virus and recombinant receptor proteins in solution (Aim 2), the full-length receptor will be anchored onto a lipid bilayer disc to form virus-receptor complexes for an in situ asymmetric study (Aim 3). This approach simulates the physiological binding event, in which the virus interacts with receptors at a single, focused region on its capsid. Preliminary results with this asymmetric approach suggest the virus behaves differently when interacting with a few membrane-bound receptors compared to many soluble receptors. Specifically our in situ A-particle retains an intact genome (as the A-particle does in an infection) and undergoes different protein rearrangements compared to particles that are treated with soluble receptors or heat. The proposed study is directed at understanding the structural alterations that an enterovirus capsid must undergo to uncoat after successfully finding and attaching to the receptor in situ."
"9172644","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus infections have a major impact on human health and the threat of pandemic infections remains imminent. Antibody inducing Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines are available, however protection is suboptimal and requires annual reformulation of the vaccine. IAV can escape neutralization by preexisting antibodies due to the high rate of mutation in the primary targets of neutralization (hemagglutinin, HA and neuraminidase, NA) and due to its capacity to recombine in non-human hosts. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, memory CD8 T-cell specific for epitopes located in conserved regions of IAV proteins like the internal components nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase A and matrix protein can confer protection. Recent human challenge studies and longitudinal analyses during the 2009 H1N1 IAV pandemic support the notion that cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells are capable of ameliorating disease when pre-existing antibodies are absent. As most humans carry a small number of these broadly protective memory CD8 T-cells, increasing the number of these cells through boosting is an attractive strategy to bolster their protective capacity. However, memory CD8 T-cells constitute a very heterogeneous population and little is known about how boosting or multiple antigen exposures effects CD8 T-cell mediated protection against IAV, For instance, we have recently reported that the type of booster agent significantly affects the localization and protective capacity of the resulting memory CD8 T-cell population (Sl?tter et al, 2013). Therefore, our long-term goal is to determine optimal memory CD8 T-cell characteristics for protection against IAV and to understand how such memory populations can be generated. In turn, these studies will provide crucial information to optimize broadly protective vaccines for IAV. Specific Aim 1.  Determine the molecular mechanisms regulating CXCR3 expression in memory CD8 T  cells to enhance airway localization.  Specific Aim 2. Determine the impact of repetitive IAV infections on the generation of airway---surveilling, tissue resident and circulatin memory CD8 T cells and their relative contribution in protection from IAV."

"9181401","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manganese (Mn) is a potent neurotoxin. We hypothesize that PARK2, a strong Parkinson's disease (PD) genetic risk factor, alters neuronal vulnerability to modifiers of cellular Mn status, particularly at the level of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the basis of Mn-induced neurotoxicity and to identify mechanistic-based neuroprotective strategies to mitigate human Mn exposure risk. Our approach will utilize a novel high-throughput assay of intracellular Mn levels to identify small molecule modifiers of cellular Mn status and neurotoxicity. Genetic modifiers of Mn transport and toxicity will be defined and translational studies of existing and newly identified genetic and small molecule modifiers of Mn toxicity will be performed utilizing a primary human neuronal model system based upon human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology. Aim 1 will identify lead compounds that alter neuronal Mn transport and toxicity in vitro using striatal and mesencephalic murine neuronal cell lines and in vivo using C. elegans. Aim 2 will delineate functional pathways that regulate Mn transport and toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that human neuronal models of PD exhibit increased sensitivity to perturbations of cellular Mn status. These specific aims hold the promise of delineating common initiator signals for the modulation of Mn neurotoxicity, shedding light on mechanisms and susceptibility associated with exposure to this metal. This dual-PI proposal is bolstered by its use of innovative state-of-the-art complimentary approaches in diverse model systems."

"9246681","African Americans (AAs) exhibit higher incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer (PCa) than  whites. Although much of the disparate cancer burden can be explained by differences in social determinants of  health, a significant portion of this disparity remains after controlling for these factors. The studies proposed here  address the urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the more aggressive PCa biology in  AA men, to manipulate these mechanisms for therapeutic application and to determine the importance of these  mechanisms for response to current therapeutic strategies.   At Duke Cancer Institute (DCI), we have identified novel alternatively spliced genes in AA versus white  PCa and have shown that AA variants track with more aggressive cancer invasion characteristics of PCa in AA  men. We have also identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms located in splicing regulatory regions of  such genes that associate with PCa risk, aggressiveness and survival. Subsets of these genes are androgen  receptor (AR) targets, relevant given the role that AR signaling plays in PCa progression, use of anti-androgen  therapy and association of AR signaling with PCa health disparities. In parallel, at North Carolina Central  University (NCCU), we have interrogated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which operates in a  regulatory loop with AR, thus having therapeutic implications for race-related PCa. Using the Bio-manufacturing  Research Institute and Technology Enterprise at NCCU, we identified 8 novel small molecule AMPK activators.   The proposed work is a joint translational science pilot project to further develop the existing NCCU-DCI  partnership, support focused collaboration in cancer research, enhance cancer research at NCCU and cancer  health disparities research at DCI and support the development of 2 junior faculty and a minority postdoc. Our  objectives are to 1) interrogate and modulate race-related AR target splice variants and 2) elucidate genetic  factors important for response to anti-androgen therapy among and between racial groups. Specifically, we aim  to 1) define the biological significance of modulating the levels of race-related AR target RNA splice variants on  PCa cell biology, using novel RNA therapeutics and small molecules, 2) define the biological significance of cis-  acting splicing elements of alternatively spliced AR target genes in AA PCa to alternative RNA splicing events  and AA race-related PCa cell biology, by expressing variants containing the AA or white genotype and assessing  alterations on splicing and PCa cell biology and 3) define the biological factors related to alternative RNA splicing  events and AMPK signaling that are critical for response to the anti-androgen, Abiraterone Acetate, among and  between racial groups, performing association analyses of correlatives with clinical parameters in a clinical trial.   The rationale for and impact of the work proposed here is that it will reveal molecular mechanisms that  can pave the way toward development of novel precision biomarkers for PCa risk, aggressiveness, therapeutic  response and/or survival prediction among minorities as well as precision therapeutics for PCa disparities."

"9181403","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manganese (Mn) is a neurotoxicant that is present in soil, air, and water. Investigations of occupationally- exposed groups, such as welders, provide an ideal opportunity to characterize dose-related dopaminergic system damage associated with Mn. Recent studies from our collaborating institutions demonstrate a high prevalence of Parkinsonism in workers with chronic exposure to Mn containing welding fumes and dopaminergic dysfunction on [18F] fluorodopa (FDOPA) PET. This study utilizes an established, well characterized cohort of welders with detailed exposure and clinical assessments, developed through NIEHS funded research projects. For this proposal, a cohort of 40 career welders with baseline FDOPA PET scans will undergo repeat PET imaging of the nigrostriatal dopamine system using FDOPA and first time imaging with the presynaptic dopaminergic radioligand [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) and the post-synaptic dopamine D2 receptor selective radioligand [11C]N-methylbenperidol (NMB). These workers will be compared to a second group of non-welder reference subjects who will be imaged at baseline and four years. The specific goals of this project are: 1) to investigate progression of dopaminergic dysfunction in welding exposed workers as evidence of progressive neurotoxicity, 2) to use the radioligand DTBZ to investigate the dose-response relationship with welding fume exposure as an indicator of the underlying etiologic relationship between Mn and damage to the presynaptic dopaminergic system, and 3) to use the radioligand NMB to investigate the dose-response relationship with welding fume exposure as an indicator of the underlying etiologic relationship between Mn and damage to the postsynaptic dopamine system. This proposal uses state-of-the-art imaging methods to investigate the health effects of a common environmental and occupational health hazard. The results of this study will have broad implications for public and worker health worldwide and will inform future community based studies of metal neurotoxicity. In addition, this study, in conjunction with our previously published data, will provide converging evidence of the role of Mn as a nigrostriatal neurotoxin. The methods described in this application represent cutting edge molecular and MRI techniques and the institutions and investigators are ideally suited for this unique epidemiology and imaging proposal."
"9173015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis leads to encephalitis (TE) and is one of the most common life threatening central nervous system infections in HIV infected patients. Although incidence as a result of cART therapy has decreased substantially, it continues to be a problem in countries with high prevalence of infection. It is believed that reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis occurs during advanced stages of HIV infection, when CD8 T cell response is compromised. In mouse model of encephalitis, we have reported severe dysfunctionality in memory CD8+ T cell population due to graded up- regulation of PD-1 (a well-known inhibitory molecule) expression on these cells. Although PD-1-PDL-1 blockade invigorated CD8+ T cell response, highly exhausted memory CD8+ T cells could not be rescued. Preliminary data for the proposal demonstrates that in addition to PD-1, CD8+ T cells from susceptible animals exhibited increased expression of other inhibitory molecules like LAG-3, 2B4 and CTLA-4. Thus blockade of multiple inhibitors may be needed to restore the functionality of memory CD8+ T cells. Further, to develop effective therapies against this chronic infection, mechanism responsible for CD8 dysfunction needs to be defined. The proposal has three specific aims. In aim 1, kinetics and pattern of multiple inhibitory receptors expressed by memory CD8+ T cells from infected animals will be performed. This will provide important information about the antibody cocktail needed for reversing the dysfunctionality in this population. In aim 2, the mechanism of memory CD8+ T cell dysfunction during chronic toxoplasma infection will be evaluated. Based on our preliminary findings, in this specific aim the mechanism involved in the IL-21 mediated maintenance of CD8+T functionality will be deciphered. Finally in the third aim, underlying causes responsible for decreased IL-21 response in animals susceptible to TE with reference to CD40 signaling will be performed. Information generated from these studies will be highly beneficial to develop therapeutic regimen that will enable to maintain robust CD8+T cell memory against chronic toxoplasma infection, which continues to be a serious problem for HIV, infected population."
"9172236","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pneumococcal vaccination is underused in underserved minorities, who are at greater pneumococcal disease risk. Two vaccines are available, the older pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). However, the optimally protective vaccination regimen is unclear, due to changing epidemiology and uncertain vaccine effectiveness; both should become clearer soon. Current CDC vaccination recommendations are complex and may not optimally protect the underserved, due multiple barriers to effective implementation. Vaccine uptake could improve with either better implementation of cur- rent recommendations or broader CDC recommendations that are easier to implement, which could have pro-portionately greater effects on the underserved. Clinical trials comparing these strategies are unlikely and, due to the moving target of vaccination-related epidemiologic changes and US Affordable Care Act (ACA) effects on vaccination rates, could be unhelpful. To investigate these issues, a systematic synthesis of available data and evidence-based projections with rigor- ous modeling of uncertainty is planned to assist policymaking and inform research resource allocation. Potential changes to decrease the complexity of pneumococcal vaccination recommendations (using PPSV and/or PCV13) will be modeled and compared to current recommendations implemented under programs to improve vaccination rates. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the public health impact on underserved minority populations of potential CDC adult pneumococcal vaccination recommendations, specifically addressing age-based vs. the more complex comorbidity-based use of vaccine; and 2) determine the public health impact and cost- effectiveness of implementation programs to improve vaccination rates in underserved minorities and persons <65 with high risk conditions, compared to potential CDC vaccination recommendations from Aim 1. Vaccination strategies will be compared via Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis to determine favored strategies and identify the most valuable areas for future research. Analyses will also innovatively use the CDC-recommended RE-AIM framework to evaluate implementation program options and explore interactions between ACA effects, potential CDC recommendations, and race-specific pneumococcal disease characteristics. Since CDC vaccination recommendation evaluations increasingly consider economic analyses, analysis results can be used, as they have previously, to assist vaccination recommendation decisions and potentially change vaccination policy to better protect the underserved."
"9171937","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poxviruses are highly unusual among DNA viruses in replicating solely within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. This physical autonomy from the nucleus is accompanied by genetic complexity: ~200 viral gene products regulate diverse aspects of the viral life cycle. Despite this genetic autonomy, the close relationship between cell biological processes and the progression of the viral life cycle is increasingly clear. Nowhere is this interplay more evident than during the morphogenesis of nascent virions in the cytoplasm. The biogenesis of the poxvirus membrane is one of the most intriguing and puzzling questions in the field. Genetic analyses have identified the F10 protein kinase, and the A6, A11, A30.5, H7 and L2 regulatory proteins as essential mediators of crescent biogenesis. In their absence, membrane diversion and crescent formation are defective, but little is known about how they coordinate and induce membrane egress from the ER. Likewise, when the major membrane proteins A14 or A17 are repressed, crescents do not form, but large numbers of ~25 nm vesicles accumulate in the cytoplasm. Thus, they are essential for the shaping, stability and elongation of nascent membranes. Their role in mediating these processes remains unknown.  Our long-term goal is to fully understand poxviral membrane biogenesis. Our current objectives are to identify host proteins that enable the assembly and egress of viral ER exit sites, to understand the mechanism by which the viral regulatory proteins mediate this process, and to evaluate the dynamic interaction of A14 and A17 with membranes. We will accomplish these objectives by using genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to pursue three complementary Aims. Aim I: Analysis of the role of host proteins and membrane trafficking systems in viral morphogenesis. We will identify and analyze host proteins that are either substrates of the F10 protein kinase, associated with viral membrane intermediates, or important for viral membrane biogenesis. Aim II: Analysis of the A6, A11, A30.5, H7 and L2 proteins and their contributions to crescent biogenesis. This aim is focused on characterizing the biochemical properties of these 5 regulatory proteins, assessing their interaction with each other, with membranes, and with host proteins, and gaining insight into how they direct and facilitate membrane biogenesis. Aim III: Assessment of the association of A14 and A17 with membranes in vivo and in vitro. Using a variety of innovative in vitro and in vivo techniques, we will probe the topology of these proteins within membranes and test the hypothesis that they mediate membrane tubulation or heterotypic fusion."
"9192424","ABSTRACT. Malaria and other vector-borne diseases pose an immense burden on mankind. To date, control campaigns to stop transmission of the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria have relied on the distribution of drugs to treat those infected, and on the use of insecticide-impregnated bednets and indoor residual sprays to stop Anopheles mosquitoes from transmitting the infection. Historically targeting the mosquito vector with these insecticide-based methods has been our best weapon for controlling the spread of the disease, but mosquito populations are developing resistance to insecticides at an alarming rate, making disease control increasingly challenging. In the search for new powerful strategies aimed at controlling malaria-transmitting Anopheles populations, we can now exploit novel powerful genome engineering tools. In this project I am to use CRISPR/Cas technology in Anopheles gambiae to enable studies into critical aspects of mosquito basic biology and to enable a new generation of genetic control strategies. During my studies I have validated the function of CRISPR/Cas in A. gambiae and developed a powerful set of genetic engineering tools that I will use to study a novel crosstalk between reproduction and vectorial capacity, as well as to generate and test novel genetic control strategies for population suppression and replacement. Using CRISPR I have generated a line of mutant mosquitoes with large deletions in Zero Population Growth (ZPG), a gene critical for germ cell development. Resulting female mutants have atrophied ovaries while males show no sperm in the testes. In infection experiments with Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite, females that are unable to develop eggs become less infected with parasites, suggesting a link between signaling from the ovaries and Plasmodium development. Therefore in this proposal I aim to elucidate the role of ovary-based signaling on P. falciparum development (Aim 1A). Furthermore I aim to explore the potential for the ZPG mutant spermless males to be used in Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) for population suppression campaigns (Aim 1B). CRISPR/Cas can also be used to facilitate gene drive systems capable of spreading desired traits to fixation in natural mosquito populations. Using my expertise in this technology, in Aim 2 I will develop an ?evolutionarily stable? gene drive system to robustly spread desirable traits to facilitate the fight against malaria. This drive system will guarantee drive spread by targeting two essential genes clustered together in the A. gambiae genome, making incorrect drive copying inviable. Further the system will be easily editable to enable testing of a wide variety of drive architectures and different anti-malarial or sterilizing cargoes. The findings of this project will be instrumental for expanding our knowledge of mosquito biological processes shaping vectorial capacity, and will expand the genetic toolkit available for the manipulation of wild Anopheles populations."
"9178624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neutralizing antibody responses to influenza infection and vaccination is highly variable in the population which can be explained by differences in health status, exposure history, and polymorphism of immune response genes. Since protection is also correlated with neutralizing antibody titers, any role that immunoglobulin germline gene polymorphism may play in this variability is important to establish, but has been difficult to investigate due to the use of numerous V, D and J genes in the genesis of immunoglobulins and the enormous combinatorial diversity that results from the pairing of rearranged VH and VL genes. However, the discovery of biased usage of the IGHV1-69 germline gene in antibodies targeting the stem domain of (HA) hemagglutinin (HV1-69-sBnAbs) has provided a unique opportunity to investigate any biological role that IGHV1-69 germline gene polymorphism might have in the anti-influenza antibody response. Importantly, HV1-69-sBnAbs mostly originate from the IGHV1-69 51p1 allele-like group that encodes a conserved CDR-H2 Phe54 that serves as major anchor residue with HA. Here we present an association analysis between IGHV1-69 polymorphism and the frequency of stem reactive Abs by using blood samples and clinical data obtained from an NIH H5VN04 vaccine trial. Our data shows a remarkable effect of IGHV1-69 locus polymorphism on the serum BnAb titers to the HA stem. Analyses of their expressed Ab repertoires have also provided evidence that copy number variation (CNV) also impacts IgM HV1-69-sBnAb responses. Results of heat map analysis show that there may be a shift in global IGHV germline gene usage in individuals based on the IGVH1-69 genotype. We propose that underlying genetic variation within the human IGHV1-69 locus might explain a significant fraction of inter- individual variation to influenza vaccination. Here we plan to enroll a cohort o 100 adult healthcare workers to participate in a study to examine the effects of IGHV1-69 polymorphism in shaping the BnAb response to seasonal influenza vaccination. Three blood specimens will be obtained from each subject, pre-vaccination, day 7 post vaccination (plasmablast peak) and at 32-56 days post-vaccination (memory B cell pool). In Aim 1 pre vaccination blood samples will be used to study the role IGHV1-69 locus polymorphism in shaping global IGHV germline gene utilization and in establishing the anti-influenza BnAb memory B cell pool. Genotyping will be by SNP and copy number variation (CNV) and phenotyping by serologic MN, HAI, HA binding studies, anti- HA single B cell cloning and antibodyome analysis. In Aim 2 heterogeneity at the IGHV1-69 locus will effect global germline gene utilization in the BnAb response to seasonal influenza vaccination. We propose that there is a direct genotypic-phenotypic relationship at the IGHV1-69 locus with regard to an individual's capacity to mount an anti-influenza BnAb response. This study is designed to provide the first evidence of this linkage. This new information on the role of IGHV polymorphism in influenza immunity can be used translationally to predict and monitor vaccine responses and to design vaccines to achieve universal responsiveness."
"9173432","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood diagnoses are chronic and devastating with respect to costs to the individual and the healthcare system, and are more prevalent than any other class of disorders. When these disorders present concurrently, the significant public health implications and societal costs are intensified. Despite high rates of comorbidity and underlying mechanistic similarities between treatment protocols, single disorder evidence- based psychotherapy protocols for these disorders have traditionally been recommended to treat emotional disorders sequentially. Moreover, when clinicians are presented with complex case presentations, they are often unprepared to treat them and move away from evidence-based approaches, potentially increasing the burden on the mental health system. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is an innovative transdiagnostic protocol with promising evidence for successful treatment of emotional disorders, both for standalone and comorbid presentations, including the classification of not otherwise specified (NOS) disorders. To date, there have only been efficacy trials of the UP, which limit generalizability and do not address the larger public health impact and effectiveness in routine clinical care settings with both psychiatric and medical comorbidity. To address this critical limitation, the applicant proposes a pilot feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability study of the UP in patients with diverse psychiatric and medical comorbidity to manualized supportive therapy within a hospital. The deployment focused model (DFM) will inform design and statistical analyses. An additional aim includes determining the feasibility, acceptability, perceived fit and satisfaction of the UP in clinic settings through surveying and interviewing stakeholders in the system that are implementing the UP through the study. Consultation with stakeholders can minimize the time required to collect and assess fit within the larger system and, therefore, minimizes the time lag between science and practice in routine care settings. This study addresses an important public health concern by examining the effectiveness of the UP in a new population as a strategy for treatment of common and debilitating mental disorders in routine care settings. Furthermore, the proposed research aims will complement a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator with expertise in implementation science and effectiveness research. Results from the study will provide important information about whether or not this efficacious treatment can be effective, efficient, and ready for implementation in routine care settings in which psychiatric and medical comorbidity are common. This study will also serve as a model of deploying efficacious treatments into generalist clinics."
"9181407","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to environmental toxins can elicit epigenetic changes with the long-term effect to modulate transcription, leading to long-lasting effects that alter disease susceptibility, drug efficacy, and even the rate of aging. The mechanisms by which environmental conditions are translated into changes in the epigenetic landscape are poorly understood. The investigators have discovered a new epigenetic transcriptional memory in response to H2S exposure in C. elegans. H2S is a common environmental toxin, and is the second most common cause of occupational deaths from inhaled gas, behind only carbon monoxide. In this research project, the investigators will leverage the power of C. elegans genetics to test the hypothesis that environmental toxins such as H2S alter the epigenetic landscape. They will measure transcriptional responses associated with specific H2S exposures that have differential phenotypic effects, and will delineate how epigenetic effects associated with the response to H2S alters transcriptional response to subsequent toxin exposure. Their preliminary data show that the conserved ATP- dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme SWI/SNF is required for the long-lasting memory of H2S. The investigators will measure the genomic localization of SWI/SNF components and determine when and where the complex is required to test the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling underlies the transcriptional memory of H2S. Finally, the investigators have isolated new mutations that disrupt the normal epigenetic response to H2S. They will use the power of C. elegans molecular and genetic biology to identify the genes and pathways that mediate the long- lasting effects of H2S exposure. Together, these studies will reveal fundamental features of how cellular responses integrate with epigenetic factors to coordinate long-term effects of environmental stimuli in animals. Moreover, this research project will facilitate career enhancement and mentoring that will fully integrate the Principal Investigator's lab with the excellent environmental health science community at the University of Washington."
"9116618","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are well-known environmental contaminants, but the observed toxicity and mutagenicity of complex environmental samples cannot be explained solely by the activity of known parent PAHs. PAH derivatives, such as NPAHs, are receiving increasing attention as potential important toxicants. However, there are many NPAHs, termed 'novel', which are predicted to be in the environment, are not yet commercially available, and have uncharacterized toxicity. The objective of this proposal is to determine if the novel NPAHs are present in the environment, and to investigate their developmental toxicity in a high throughput in vivo system. The overall hypothesis is that novel NPAHs are present in the environment and that they will generate adverse biological responses in the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model in a structure-dependent manner. This hypothesis will be tested by completing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify and measure novel NPAHs in the environment Aim 2: Define the bioactivity of NPAHs in the high throughput embryonic zebrafish model Aim 3: Determine metabolites produced from in vivo metabolism of NPAHs in the embryonic zebrafish model These aims will be completed by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the detection of novel NPAHs in the environment, as well as toxicity screening and metabolism studies using the zebrafish model. In order to collect data with the highest human relevance, a transgenic zebrafish model will be utilized which expresses nitroreductase (an enzyme found in humans, but not zebrafish, which is responsible for the reduction of nitro functional groups). These studies will advance the field of environmental health by providing new data streams to allow for a more accurate assessment of potential health impacts resulting from environmental NPAH exposures, and will provide impetus to study some of the identified compounds in other systems."
"9172233","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mature B-lymphocytes undergo class switch recombination (CSR), a deletional-recombination reaction that replaces the constant region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule for one of a set of downstream constant region genes. This changes the class of the expressed antibody from IgM to IgG, IgE or IgA, each of which has distinct effector functions. CSR occurs within and requires large repetitive sequences termed switch (S) regions that precede the constant region genes. CSR is initiated by AID (activation induced deaminase), a single-strand DNA-specific deaminase, that introduces U:G mismatches in transcribed S regions. Subsequent processing by components of base excision repair and mismatch repair pathways introduces DNA double- stranded breaks (DSBs) in S regions. DSBs between two distinct S regions are synapsed and then ligated by end-joining. DSBs serve as obligatory intermediates of CSR; however, DSBs also constitute one of the most toxic lesions that can occur in a cell. A single unrepaired DSB can lead to cell death or can participate in chromosomal translocations, the hallmarks of many types of cancer, including lymphomas. Thus, CSR requires not only the generation but also efficient repair of DSBs. In this proposal we test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of AID plays an essential role in the generation of DSBs. We also explore the hypothesis that the DNA damage sensor ATM participates in inducing AID phosphorylation and repair of DSBs during the process. Impaired CSR leads to impaired ability to respond to pathogens while aberrant CSR is one of the major underlying factors in the ontogeny of B cell lymphomas. Our studies will thus have major impact on both immunodeficiency syndromes and B cell lymphomagenesis."
"9186451","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental exposure and endogenous metabolism both give rise to the alkylation of DNA, and DNA alkylation represents the major mechanism of action for a number of commonly prescribed cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, assessing how alkylated DNA lesions compromise the flow of genetic information by altering the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication and transcription and how these lesions are repaired will provide important knowledge for understanding the implications of DNA alkylation in the etiology for developing human diseases. Such knowledge will also form the basis for developing better strategies for cancer chemotherapy. The emphasis of this application is placed on a group of alkylated thymidine lesions which have been shown to persist in mammalian tissues or have been detected at substantially elevated levels in lymphocyte samples of humans exposed to cigarette smoke. We will employ an innovative and multi- pronged approach, including synthetic organic chemistry, mass spectrometry-based bioanalytical chemistry, and molecular biology to achieve a molecular-level understanding about how the under-investigated group of alkylated thymidine lesions impede DNA replication and transcription in cells, and induce mutations in these processes. We will also assess the implications of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair pathways in the repair of these lesions in cells. The outcome of the proposed research will bring our understanding of this largely overlooked group of alkylated DNA lesions to a significantly higher level."
"9174855","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      We propose a randomized, controlled trial of a telephone-based, brief insomnia treatment in primary care in order to accomplish the goal of improving psychosocial functioning in post-deployment Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans who meet criteria for Insomnia Disorder. The primary outcome for the trial will be psychosocial functioning, with insomnia severity serving as the secondary outcome. Additional goals include evaluating durability of treatment gains and obtaining feedback from participants about the utility and feasibility of the proposed insomnia treatment.  One hundred Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with Insomnia Disorder will be randomly assigned to either Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI; one 60-minute and one 30-minute in-person encounter, and two 20-minute phone-based encounters) or a Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training control group (manualized relaxation training delivered by two in-person and two phone sessions, matched to the BBTI condition for therapist time). Prior to randomization, participants will complete clinician-administered, mental health diagnostic interviews at baseline (and post-treatment). Psychosocial functioning, insomnia severity, and other related self-report measures will be completed at baseline (pre-treatment), mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up (active treatment group only). Sleep parameters (e.g., sleep diaries, rest activity) will be completed with a sleep diary mobile application and the Basis wristband (Basis Science Inc., San Francisco) and associated mobile application that tracks sleep cycles and sleep and waking movement, which will be provided for each participant. One week of sleep parameters data will be collected at baseline as well as post-treatment (and at 6-month follow-up for active treatment group only). Both groups will also collect sleep parameters data during the four-week intervention period.  We will conduct post-treatment evaluations with the experimental group to help determine the utility of BBTI as well as how the intervention may be improved for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. Veterans who received BBTI will complete a feedback questionnaire that will inquire about various aspects of the treatment. The goal is that 75% of Veterans will report that the treatment is feasible and acceptable in various domains, as measured by a rating of three or higher on a five-point Likert scale. Veterans who complete BBTI also will be asked to participate in a 30-minute feedback interview reviewing ratings of each of the domains, as well as most and least helpful aspects of the treatment, data which will be audio recorded and coded. These post- treatment interviews with Veterans will yield suggestions on how the treatment can best be improved for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans and be implemented in primary care settings. Trained coders will be asked to categorize areas identified by Veterans as helpful and areas noted as needing improvement until no new categories are identified (e.g., thematic saturation). These suggestions will be systematized and used to prepare the treatment for implementation with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans in primary care. This trial will provide useful information regarding rehabilitative outcomes, and it will yield specific information that will allow us to modify BBTI, ensuring a tailored product based on Veteran feedback."
"9185317","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long-term human exposure to inorganic arsenic induces lung and other cancers. The molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. Our preliminary studies show that arsenic increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inhibits miR-199 and miR-148 expression, and increases ERBB2, PKM2, NF-kB, HIF-1 and IL-8 expression in lung epithelial cells. Arsenic treatment also induces cell transformation, tumor growth and angiogenesis. We hypothesize that arsenic suppresses miR-199/148 expression through the induction of NOX2, p47phox, ROS; and DNMT1 expression; and miR-199/148 downregulation regulates carcinogenesis (cell transformation, tumor growth, and angiogenesis) through targets: ERBB2 and PKM2/NF-:B. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanisms of arsenic in suppressing miR-199 and miR-148 expression through NOX2/p47phox/DNMT1 induction, ROS generation; and miR-199/148 downregulation in turn regulates ERBB2 expression and PKM2/NF-kB interaction. We will investigate: 1) whether arsenic suppresses miR-199 and miR-148 expression through the induction of NOX2, p47Phox, ROS, and DNMT1; 2) whether arsenic induces ERBB2 and PKM2 expression by miR-199/148 downregulation; 3) what regions of PKM2 bind with NF-kB p65 subunit for regulating IL-8 and HIF-1 expression. Aim 2 will investigate the roles of miR-199/148 downregulation in inducing ERBB2 and PKM2/NF-kB expression for regulating cell transformation and tumor growth. We will determine: 1) whether arsenic induces cell transformation and tumor growth through ROS- and DNMT1-induced miR-199/148 downregulation; 2) whether ERBB2 and PKM2 are key direct targets of miR-199/148 for regulating arsenic-induced transformation and tumor growth; and 3) whether PKM2/NF-:B interaction plays an important role. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanisms of arsenic-induced angiogenesis through miR-199/148/ERBB2/PKM2/NF-kB axis for inducing HIF-1 and IL- 8 via paracrine effect using animal models. We will also determine whether secretion of IL-8 will induce tumor angiogenesis through functional IL-8 receptors in endothelial cells (paracrine effect) using chimeric tumor model. This proposed study would provide an important paradigm shift in understanding how miRNAs regulate arsenic-induced tumor growth and angiogenesis through ERBB2 and PKM2/NF-kB axis. Given the important roles of ERBB2, PKM2, NF-kB, HIF-1, and IL-8 in different types of cancers; the proposed studies would be important for future studies on mechanism-based prevention and treatment for arsenic-induced cancer as well as other human cancers."
"9180624","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects mid-life and older adults. There are two forms of disease, familial (FALS) and sporadic (SALS), respectively comprising 10% and 90% of cases, respectively. The genetic causes of FALS have been linked to mutations in several genes such as superoxide dismutase, TDP-43, FUS, optineurin, ubiquilin 2 and C9ORF72. The etiology of SALS, however, remains elusive. A few years ago our laboratory found that there were polymorphisms in genes for enzymes called paraoxonases that were associated with SALS. These enzymes detoxify certain pesticides and toxic agents, and thus became the first environmentally related genes linked to ALS. Further studies of the paraoxonases and apolipoprotein L1 in the plasma indicate that their levels are significantly elevated in SALS patients. These proteins are found on specific high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that have several functions including lipid and cholesterol transport and protecting lipoproteins from deleterious oxidation. Similar particles are also found in the cerebrospinal flui (CSF). Thus, in this proposal we further characterize the protein composition of selected HDL species in the plasma and CSF of SALS patients using high throughput technologies. We can now, for the first, time determine how certain HDL proteins change in a neurodegenerative disease and if they are linked to the disease process. We will also determine whether the genes for HDL-associated proteins contain variants that are associated with risk of SALS and whether these changes are related to alterations in HDL protein levels. Mechanisms of the deleterious effects of these changes will be studied in cell culture and genetically engineered mice. Results from this work will open paths to therapies to rescue potential dysfunctional HDL found not only in neurodegenerative disease such as ALS but also in more common cardiovascular and metabolic diseases."
"9171366","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immune responses to harmless antigens, and in one form or another, affect 1 in 4 Americans in the United States with a disproportionate increase especially among children with asthma and food-related hypersensitivities. While malleable genetic and environmental components play an important role, immunological aspects associated with cellular and humoral aspects of atopy remain major risk factors underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases and allergic inflammation in general. Among the immune cells implicated in allergic disease, few have received in recent years the level of attention given to dendritic cells (DC) and basophils. DCs are best known for their capacity to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) that induce immunological responses by presenting antigen to T cells. In mediating this activity, DCs play an important role in both the priming of adaptive immune responses and in the induction of peripheral tolerance. Ancillary studies in mice now indicate that basophils also possess APC capability that is most important in initiating the Th2 responses that are hallmark in allergic diseases. However, it remains unclear in humans whether specific DC subtypes (and/or basophils) preferentially support allergen-reactive Th2 responses, and whether/how these might be altered by immune-based intervention. Thus, three aims are proposed: Aim 1 addresses the general hypothesis that specific DC subtypes induce phenotypically and functionally distinct allergen-reactive T cell responses. In particular, experiments investigate plasmacytoid and myeloid DC (pDC and mDC, respectively) as well as basophils for their potential to differentially induce T cell responses in dust mite allergic subjects. Since new evidence points to basophils playing a role in modulating DC activity rather than acting as APCs, then this hypothesis will also be investigated. Aim 2 addresses the hypothesis that pDC, mDC, and basophils are differentially primed by innate immune stimuli (e.g. TLR ligands) and by specific cytokines (IL-3/IL-33 vs. IFN- ?) to differentially induce allergen-reactive Th2 and/or Th1 cell responses. Finally, Aim 3 addresses the hypothesis that successful Standard Immunotherapy (SIT) alters the capacity of DC subtypes (and basophils) to promote allergen-specific Th2 cell responses. In particular, our preliminary data show that SIT improves TLR9-dependent innate immune responses in DC that are impaired in allergic disease. We further predict that this increased activity will parallel with increases in IgG4 blocking activity, the induction of allergen-specific Tregs, and clinical improvement. Our unique ability to investigate human DC and basophils makes this application highly innovative, and increases the probability that novel, significant, and clinically relevant findings will be discovered."
"9181406","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hypoxia, DNA repair, and gene silencing.  Hypoxia is a key feature of solid tumors that confers radiation resistance, stimulates angiogenesis, promotes metastasis, and is linked to poor prognosis. With the support of this grant, we have shown that hypoxia is also a driver of genetic instability via down-regulation of critical DNA repair genes. In the past funding period, we have discovered that hypoxia can also induce durable silencing of the BRCA1 and MLH1 promoters via specific epigenetic factors. In recent preliminary studies, we have further determined that hypoxia can lead to silencing of the pro-apoptotic BIM gene and resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib, in lung cancer cells. The broad, long-term goal of this renewal application is to elucidate the impact of hypoxic stress on carcinogenesis and cancer biology, with a focus on DNA repair and gene silencing.  In Aim 1, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxic stress drives epigenetic change to cause gene silencing, with a focus on the MLH1 promoter. We will determine promoter elements and regulatory factors that mediate silencing, and we will use a facile selection-based shRNA screen to identify key targets for reversal of this process. We will also assay for the impact of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment on gene silencing during tumor growth in vivo. Next, since heavy metals are known human carcinogens that can induce hypoxia-related pathways, in Aim 2 we will ask whether exposure to heavy metals can also drive gene silencing and/or down-regulate DNA repair. In Aim 3, we will build on novel preliminary results suggesting that growth of lung cancer cells in hypoxia can promote resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, gefitinib, in conjunction with silencing of the pro-apoptotic factor, BIM. We wil test specific hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms, and, guided by Aim 1, we will identify strategies to prevent or reverse this resistance.  The proposed work will elucidate key pathways of gene silencing and DNA repair regulation in response to hypoxia (and possibly to carcinogenic heavy metals) that may underlie critical steps in carcinogenesis, genetic instability, tumor progression, and resistance to radiation and other cancer therapies. Identification of strategies to prevent or reverse these pathways may provide the basis for new approaches to cancer prevention and therapy."
"9180709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the mechanisms that specify the fate of the germline, a fundamental problem in developmental biology. In all animals, the founder cells of the germline (primordial germ cells) display two conserved characteristics: they possess germ granules, RNA granules specific to the germline, and they express members of the Nanos family of RNA-binding proteins. The goal of this proposal is to understand how germ granules and Nanos function together to specify the fate of primordial germ cells. In preliminary work, we have found that PGCs that lack Nanos activity prematurely activates the expression of ~1000 genes normally expressed in oocytes and somatic cells, a phenotype also seen in mutants that lack the Polycomb Repressive Complex. Specific Aim I will identify the mechanisms used by Nanos to prevent this massive gene mis-regulation. We have already identified one promising candidate Nanos target: LIN-15B, a likely component of the DRM transcription factor complex that activates gene expression in oocytes. Specific Aim II will examine the role of a new group of germ granule proteins we recently characterized. The MEG proteins form stabilizing scaffolds around the central cores of each germ granule. Our genetic analyses indicate that the MEGs, but not the proteins in the core, are essential for PGC fate. We will investigate how the MEGs, predicted to be intrinsically-disordered with no recognizable domain, function with Nanos to specify PGCs. Two technical breakthroughs support this application. First we have worked out methods to isolate PGCs in large enough numbers to determine their transcriptome by RNAseq. We will use this method to define how Nanos and germ granule proteins affect the PGC transcriptome at a genome-wide level. Second we have developed a highly efficient genome editing method, using CRISPR/Cas9, that allows us to mutate, tag, delete and replace any gene of interest in just 4 days. This method gives us unprecedented genetic and biochemical access to the genes and proteins that are the focus of this application."
"9181335","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application focuses on the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes devastating diseases in humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa. There are no vaccines, and therapeutic drugs have serious side effects and decreasing efficacy. Thus, there is a pressing need for research to better understand the biology of these human pathogens and the mechanisms they use to survive within their hosts. T. brucei undergoes a complex life cycle between the mammalian host and the blood-feeding tsetse fly vector, which among others involves changes in cell morphology, surface coat composition, metabolism, signaling pathways and gene expression. Consequently, these parasites have evolved adaptations to allow for their survival in both the gut and salivary glands of the tsetse fly, as well as in the bloodstream of their mammalian host. By overexpressing a single RNA-binding protein (RBP6) in non- infectious trypanosomes, we recapitulated in vitro the events leading to acquisition of infectivity in the insect vector, including the expression of metacyclic variant surface glycoproteins (mVSGs). At present, little is known how mVSG gene expression is activated and how the expression is switched to bloodstream-form VSGs, once the parasite enters a mammalian host. One major goal of this application will be to examine how trypanosomes receive instructions to begin synthesizing the mVSG coat, how each cell expresses a single mVSG, and how mVSG expression is repressed and switched to the expression of bloodstream-form VSGs. We will apply a number of high-throughput approaches to monitor the chromatin structure of mVSG genes during developmental progression and test whether a second RNA-binding protein (RBP10) is a facilitator of [m]VSG expression. Primary transcripts and mature mRNAs will be monitored using RNA-Seq, the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase I will be surveyed by global run-on-sequencing (GRO-Seq) and transcription factor binding will be gauged by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with Illumina sequencing (ChIP-Seq). A second emphasis will be on RNA interference (RNAi). Since our discovery of RNAi in T. brucei in 1998, this pathway has been a focus of our investigations, which have led to the finding that RNAi functions both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and to the identification of five core RNAi genes. We will employ different approaches to address the question what defines the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), i.e. what other cellular factors functionally interact with the RNAi machinery, and how the levels of Argonaute are regulated. Finally, we will further address the biological function of RNAi by determining the RNAi targets during the T. brucei developmental cycle, which is now possible with our newly developed differentiation system."

"9174893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is an emerging tick-borne zoonosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech), an obligatory intracellular bacterium. The essential virulence factor of Ech is its entry into human monocytes through the route permissive for its replication. To advance our basic understanding and permit development of new therapies, our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate Ech infectious entry. Our recent study revealed that Ech uses EtpE (Entry triggering protein of Ehrlichia), a unique surface-exposed outer membrane protein to engage the human cell surface glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored protein DNase X, which induces its entry into host cells to establish prolific infection. How EtpE binding to DNase X triggers infectious Ech entry is unknown. Our preliminary data revealed CD147, hnRNP-K, and N-WASP interact with the EtpE-DNase X complex. Thus, our hypothesis is that EtpE-DNase X binding anchors and activates N- WASP via CD147 and hnRNP-K to elicit spatio-temporal actin polymerization that drives Ech entry. In this application, we will pursue two aims to understand how EtpE binding to DNase X drives infectious Ech entry. Specific Aim 1 is to identify the EtpE-interacting host proteins and their mechanistic contributions to EtpE- triggered Ech entry and infection. We will analyze 1) whether CD147 and hnRNP-K are required for EtpE- coated bead entry, and Ech entry and infection of host cells and mice including use of mice with conditional Cre/LoxP CD147 knock-out in macrophages; 2) the spatio-temporal recruitment profiles of CD147 and hnRNP- K at entry foci of Ech and of EtpE-coated beads, by live-cell/intravital fluorescence microscopy; 3) proteins involved in the EtpE-host protein interaction, using a) tandem affinity purification and b subtractive multidimensional protein identification technology; 4) the determinants/kinetics of the binding of CD147 and hnRNP-K to the EtpE-C-DNase X complex, by fluorescence resonance transfer, in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and in vitro binding assays, using defined domains and mutant proteins; and 5) monocyte tropism using human neutrophils and a granulocyte-tropic obligatory intracellular bacterium. Specific Aim 2 is to elucidate mechanisms to coordinate the spatio-temporal N-WASP activation at Ech entry foci. We will analyze 1) recruitment of N-WASP at entry foci of Ech and of EtpE-coated beads in a DNase X, CD147, and hnRNP-K-dependent manner; 2) requirement of N-WASP for entry of Ech and EtpE-coated beads, and infection of host cells and mice including the use of conditional Cre/LoxP N-WASP knock-out in macrophages; 3) requirement of DNase X, CD147, hnRNP-K, and N-WASP for EtpE-triggered polymerization of pyrenyl-actin in vitro; and 4) the spatio-temporal recruitment profiles of N-WASP and F-actin to entry foci of Ech and EtpE- coated beads, using live-cell imaging. If our hypothesis is proven, EtpE would be the first bacterial molecule described to activate N-WASP through a unique protein complex for infectious entry. The identified pathways will provide a platform for developing new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against Ech."
"9171942","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantifying Environmental Variables Affecting Airborne Influenza Transmission In most temperate climates, influenza prevails in cold, dry winter months. However, in some temperate and tropical regions, influenza epidemicity is correlated with extremes of precipitation, not dryness, and can circulate at low levels essentially year-round or appear in uni- or bi-modal annual outbreaks. How environmental variables affect influenza circulation in the human population remains poorly understood, in part because the science behind airborne respiratory virus transmission crosses disciplinary boundaries between the biomedical and physical sciences, encompassing fields as diverse as virology, physiology, epidemiology, fluid mechanics, aerosol science, and climatology. Here we seek to understand how individual environmental variables - such as temperature, humidity, and airflow - cumulatively affect the transmission probability of influenza viruses in a representative mammalian experimental system. The theoretical framework behind these studies is a novel quantitative model, based upon data gathered in experimental guinea pigs, which attempts to characterize the impact of the environment on influenza virus transmission between infected and susceptible hosts. This project bridges the gap between virology and engineering in bringing together three co- investigators with relevant and complementary skill sets: Dr. Nicole Bouvier, a physician-scientist with extensive experience in the transmission of influenza viruses among guinea pigs; Dr. William Ristenpart, an engineer with expertise in the application of high-speed imaging technologies to investigations of complex fluid dynamics; and Dr. Anthony Wexler, an authority on aerosol transport who has developed novel techniques for high-resolution imaging of aerosol deposition in the rodent respiratory tract. Our preliminary theoretical modeling has generated innovative interpretations of the experimental data, yielding three testable hypotheses, which form the basis of this proposal: (1) Influenza virus transmission probability will decrease with increased airflow speed, (2) transmission probability will decrease with the degree of turbulence, and (3) transmission probability will increase with the time integral of the viral concentration within the inoculated animal. Rigorously controlled laboratory studies, designed to isolate a single variable for analysis while others are held constant, will provide a quantitative framework for understanding the cumulative effects of temperature, humidity, airflow velocity, turbulence, and position on the transmission of human influenza viruses in a relevant animal model. Quantifying these environmental variables, individually and cumulatively, will enable their extrapolation to larger environments and time scales, with the potential to transform our understanding of the epidemiology of seasonal and pandemic influenza."
"9170744","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunization rates for recommended childhood vaccines have consistently been high, with childhood series completion near 80% by 19-35 months. However, these high immunization coverage rates do not fully account for delays or refusals of early childhood (i.e., less than one year of age) vaccine uptake. Overall, the proportion of children not receiving all recommended vaccines or whose parents are consistently limiting visit-level vaccine administration is increasing. Children who do not receive all recommended vaccines are at greater risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, which can lead to development of severe sequelae, hospitalizations, and death. Additionally, despite evidence showing the effect of vaccinating pregnant women in reducing disease among infants too young to be fully vaccinated, maternal immunization rates remain low. We developed and pilot tested a novel, innovative, evidence based, and comprehensive immunization intervention at the Practice, Provider, and Patient (P3) levels to meet the diverse and complex information needs of mothers. This P3 intervention included components such as use of practice-level vaccine champions, expanded reminder-recall systems, and provision of practice-level immunization rate feedback (practice-level interventions); physician peer-delivered training related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination recommendations, and vaccination system logistics, as well as standardized talking points for use when recommendation vaccination (provider-level interventions); and an interactive tablet computer (iPad) education application for pregnant women to view while waiting for care (patient-level intervention). Our pilot testing found this P3 intervention to be well received by providers and patients and indicated a few areas where the intervention could be improved. In the proposed project, we will develop and evaluate an improved version of the P3 intervention, to be called P3+. Improvements to the initial P3 framework will be based on findings from the original evaluation project as well as additional formative research. We will then evaluate the P3+ intervention in a geographically and socio-demographically diverse set of obstetrician- gynecologist offices in Georgia (community-level practices) and Colorado (offices of the Kaiser Permanente Colorado managed care organization). The research will be led by Multiple PIs who have extensive experienced in understanding and addressing barriers to vaccine uptake. The proposed evaluation will address vaccine uptake both for pregnant women and for their children, through 24 months of age, to test the hypothesis that increasing acceptability of vaccines during pregnancy will lead to positive changes in acceptance of vaccines for children."
"9172227","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complement is a part of innate immunity and plays a key role in host defense. However, if not properly regulated, activated complement can cause inflammatory injury. Recent works have identified complement as a major pathogenic pathway in many human immunological and inflammatory diseases. Among them, dense deposit disease (DDD) is a rare kidney disease caused by dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement activation. DDD is characterized by the presence of electron- dense deposits within the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney. Known also as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN type II), DDD belongs to the recently introduced pathological entity called C3 glomerulopathy whose definition is glomerular pathology characterized by C3 accumulation with no or limited immunoglobulin deposition. Approximately 10% of DDD patients also develop vision problems with dense deposits underneath retinal pigment epithelial cells that resemble drusen deposits in the eyes of age-related macular degeneration patients. Prognosis of DDD is poor since current treatments are largely nonspecific and about 50% patients eventually progress to end stage renal failure. Mechanistic and therapeutic studies of human DDD have been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. We have recently generated a robust mouse model of DDD displaying both kidney and retinal pathologies. The objective of this application is to use this novel mouse model to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of complement-mediated kidney and retinal injury in DDD and to test the activity of various anti-complement agents in preventing or reversing the kidney and eye pathologies. Our long term goal is to better understand how dysregulated AP complement leads to DDD and other complement-mediated inflammatory disorders and to provide proof of principle for developing novel anti-complement therapies for such human diseases."
"9379975","Project Summary  Differences in pragmatic (i.e., social) language are the language deficit most robustly associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP, a constellation of subclinical features in relatives that parallel in quality the defining characteristics of ASD and are believed to reflect genetic liability in clinically unaffected relatives). Findings from the initial award period indicate that retrospective, longitudinal measures of childhood language and cognitive development in parents, together with our battery of psycholinguistic and computational linguistic measures of pragmatic ability, measurable in individuals with ASD and their parents, are highly promising markers of ASD endophenotypes that can be targeted in genetic, neurobiological and treatment studies. This competing renewal builds significantly on these findings and our related work, in three important ways. First, given striking findings that parents' early rates of language and cognitive growth in childhood predict the BAP in adulthood, and ASD severity in the next generation (i.e., their children), we expand our study design and methods significantly, to investigate a unique and more expansive archival database of retrospective developmental, cognitive, social, behavior and personality measures available on a cohort of grandparents and parents of individuals with ASD, from high school through young adult years. These rich resources, together with our existing longitudinal data on parents' grade school testing records (which we will continue to collect), will afford an unprecedented look at developmental profiles through childhood and young adulthood (prior to having a child with ASD) that may predict genetic risk of ASD. We also further investigate the biological basis of our candidate pragmatic language endophenotypes through analysis of auditory brainstem response related to an expanded battery of pragmatic language in ASD families. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of these candidate endophenotypes in families of individuals with ASD through measurement of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, which is the protein product of FMR1 (implicated in ASD symptomatology), with strong connections to the auditory brainstem, and which preliminary data show may relate to pragmatic language features in family members of individuals with ASD."
"9380404","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goals of this proposal are to identify the early manifestations of lung disease among the WTC workers and volunteers, as well as investigate their risk factors.

In order to validate the findings from the chest CT scans obtained from 2002-2011 (2870 studies in 1710 workers), we will prospectively perform paired inspiratory-expiratory, low- dose, gated CT scans and spirometry on a set of 800 participants over the 4 years of the grant, to determine the prevalence of lung cancer, emphysema, fibrotic and Interstitial lung disease, small airways disease (including air trapping). We will select individuals for whom there would not be a clinical indication to test some of the secondary hypotheses, to update a previous study, and to allow case-control studies with the retrospective cases (most of whom had respiratory symptoms, spirometric abnormalities, or chest radiographic abnormalities, or any combination thereof)."
"9191301","Project Summary This prospective clinical cohort study will examine the association of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation and subsequent patterns of condom-use and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men who have sex with men (MSM). The cohort, comprising ~ 600 MSM, 18 years and older, who initiate PrEP and receive services from a sexual health clinic in San Francisco, will be followed quarterly for 12 months. PrEP, in the form of Truvada, is a once daily pill, which is simple to use with low toxicity and good efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV acquisition. While PrEP addresses protection against HIV transmission, it does not provide any protection against other STIs, MSM are disproportionally affected by STIs, and rates continue to increase in this population8-10. This study will examine condom-use change and STIs in a high risk population of MSM taking PrEP. It will provide information on potential disease prevention strategies and health promotion messages that encompass social and individual influences on safe sex practices. In this study, the theories of Sexual Scripting and Reasoned Action will be used as a framework to guide the understanding of the social and individual influences on voluntary risk behavior and sexual practices among MSM. The aims of this study are: 1) To examine the associations between levels of risky behaviors in a cohort of MSM prior to initiating PrEP versus those behaviors over 12 months subsequent to initiating PrEP; 2) To identify changes in condom use and examine reasons for change; and 3) To determine changes in risk behaviors in MSM who are initiating PrEP using biological assays to measure the frequency and type of STIs. After frequencies and descriptive analyses are completed, multilevel logistic regression models will be used to predict the associations of risk behaviors before and after initiation of PrEP with demographic variables. Latent variable growth modeling (LGM) will be utilized to describe growth curves for condom use and STIs in order to understand not only the average change but also individual variations. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a sample of 10-20 individuals to enrich our knowledge and understanding of the social influences and individual motivations that may be affecting condom-use. This study will capture sociodemographic data among PrEP users, their reasons for using PrEP, and the societal, psychological and behavioral influences on condom use and subsequent changes in STIs during a real-world implementation of a PrEP health program. Information gathered in this research will fill a knowledge gap on MSM using PrEP, condom-use and STIs. It will lay the foundational work for the development of a sexual health intervention for MSM on PrEP in order to improve condom use behavior and decrease STI rates. This study will be completed with the support and expertise from my interdisciplinary mentorship team. Drs. Portillo, Carrico, Boyer, Milo-Santos have a wide range of advanced knowledge in sexual health, MSM, risk behavior, statistical methods, qualitative and quantitative research and are committed to my successful training as a nurse researcher."
"9182889","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inherited trinucleotide repeat (TNR) instability, (i.e. expansions and deletions/contractions) is associated with more than 40 human familial neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Non-inherited somatic TNR instability may be involved in the development of these diseases in the general public. No effective treatment for TNR- related diseases is yet available, partially because of a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We have recently discovered that DNA base damage and base excision repair (BER) initiate and modulate somatic CAG repeat expansion and deletion by inducing single-strand DNA (ssDNA) breaks and promoting the formation of GC self-base-pairing hairpins. This indicates a new role of DNA base lesions, ssDNA breaks and BER in modulating TNR instability. To explore the potential of DNA damage and BER as new targets for the prevention and treatment of TNR-related diseases, in this project we seek to understand how environmentally and chemotherapeutically induced ssDNA breaks and their inefficient repair are involved in somatic TNR instability during BER. This goal will be achieved by pursuing three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to determine if the accumulation of environmentally and chemotherapeutically induced DNA base lesions and ssDNA breaks can preferentially lead to CAG repeat instability in a site-specific manner. Site-specific accumulation of the ssDNA breaks in CAG/CTG repeat tracts induced by environmental toxicants and chemotherapeutic agents such as vinyl chloride and temozolomide will be determined. The unique patterns of ssDNA break accumulation induced by DNA-damaging agents will be correlated with repeat expansion and deletion to identify damage- specific position effects on CAG repeat instability. The effects will be further examined under imbalanced levels of BER enzymes and cofactors to determine if TNR instability can be modulated by compromised BER efficiency. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that inefficient BER facilitates CAG repeat deletion by promoting the formation of multiple non-B-form DNA structures. This will be done by determining if inefficient DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases (Pol  genetic variants, Pol ?) can facilitate the accumulation of a template hairpin and promote TNR deletion. Aim 3 is to determine if TNR expansion and deletion can be prevented by efficiently disrupting non-B-form DNA structures through BER protein-protein interactions and functional coordination. This project addresses the fundamental mechanisms underlying DNA damage-induced somatic TNR instability by dissecting the interplay among environmental and chemotherapeutic DNA damage, BER, and TNR instability. The results will provide important new insights into how exposure to environmental and chemotherapeutic stresses may influence the development and progression of TNR-related human diseases in the general population, and how these adverse effects can be prevented by DNA damage repair. This will help to identify novel targets for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TNR-related diseases, and provide new information for risk assessment of environmentally and chemotherapeutically induced genotoxic effects."
"9178643","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpesviruses are endemic within the human population, and cause a wide range of life-threatening diseases. Members of the beta-herpesvirus (?-HV) and gamma-herpesvirus (?-HV) subfamilies are extremely problematic in immunocompromised individuals, leading to severe congenital disorders and a variety of cancers. During the herpesviral replication cycle, viral genes are expressed temporally in an ordered cascade, with timing linked to appropriate life cycle stage needs. Following viral genome replication, a group of viral genes termed late genes (L) are robustly activated and produce proteins necessary for progeny virion assembly and egress. Mechanisms governing L gene expression in the ?-HV and the ?-HV largely remain a mystery. However, shedding light on this aspect of herpesviral biology has become a high priority, in part due to recent discoveries demonstrating that mutants impaired in this final viral transcription cascade cannot produce progeny virions. An understanding of the regulatory features critical for L gene transcription may therefore reveal robust new targets for antiviral strategies. Our data demonstrate that late gene transcriptional regulation is unique, as it incorporates both molecular mimicry and selective recruitment of key host transcriptional machinery in a manner not previously observed in viral or host gene expression. Thus, the focus of this grant is to define the composition and regulation of this novel gene expression complex, as well as reveal how it may globally impact gene expression in infected cells."
"9175943","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The VHA has identified pain management as a high priority. Data document that perhaps a majority of Veterans receiving care in VHA, including OEF/OIF/OND [[and women]] Veterans, report the presence of pain.  CLBP, in particular, is among the most prevalent and costly of all disorders treated in VHA. Among the most promising therapies for reducing pain and improving functioning among persons with CLBP are low cost and low risk non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise and behavioral interventions. Despite evidence supporting their effectiveness, access barriers often prevent Veterans from receiving these interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that behavioral interventions, including those for persons with CLBP, can be delivered successfully via the Internet. Development of a viable Internet-based delivery platform to facilitate Veteran access to such interventions for CLBP offers an important solution to several access barriers. Within VHA, the availability of MyHealtheVet offers an ideal platform for hosting a pain self-management intervention.   The primary objectives of the proposed study are to: (1) develop an integrative, Internet-based, Veteran-centered behavioral intervention, the Veteran Pain Management Resource Center (VPMRC) for CLBP, and (2) examine preliminary efficacy, usability, and satisfaction of this intervention in a representative sample of Veterans with CLBP. To achieve these objectives, a [[24-month]] pilot study with two phases is proposed. During Phase I, the VPMRC will be developed and feedback from 15 Veterans with CLBP and an Expert Panel of pain management clinicians will be used to modify the program. As currently envisioned, the  VPMRC will serve as a resource to help Veterans learn and practice adaptive behavioral and cognitive pain  coping skills such as relaxation and stress reduction methods, exercise and structured physical activity, and  activity pacing, among others. During Phase II, a pilot feasibility trial of the VPMRC will be conducted to test the preliminary efficacy and usability of, and satisfaction with the VPMRC. Fifty-five Veterans with CLBP will be recruited for Phase II. All participants will continue to receive their usual care from VHA providers. During [[the 10-week]] therapeutic window, weekly telephone calls from research staff will serve to cue and monitor participants' use of the Internet program. At [[ten]] weeks post-baseline, participants will be formally reassessed.   Planned statistical analyses will test the hypothesis that Veterans who engage in the VPMRC program will demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in pain-related functional interference as measured by a 0.6 point decrease in individual scores on the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory-Interference Scale, relative to baseline. Additional analyses will test whether participants are more likely to report clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity and improvements in fatigue, sleep, and mood, relative to baseline.  Participants are also hypothesized to report high levels of interest and credibility, use of, and satisfaction with the VPMRC. The Phase II quantitative outcomes data will further assist with modification and revision of the VPMRC. If the project is successful and demonstrates preliminary efficacy, further evaluation of efficacy via randomized controlled trial, followed by dissemination and implementation efforts, may increase access to pain self-management treatment and increase effectiveness of care for Veterans with CLBP.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is among the most prevalent and costly disorders among Veterans receiving care in VHA facilities. Behavioral interventions such as exercise and cognitive behavior therapy are known to be effective for CLBP but are often not readily available or easily accessed. The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop and test the preliminary efficacy and usability of and satisfaction with an integrative, Internet-based, behavioral pain self-management program, the Veterans Pain Management Resource Center (VPMRC), in Veterans with CLBP. The VPMRC will be designed and built to be compatible with MyHealtheVet (MHV). If successful, the long term objective is to migrate the VPMRC to the MHV platform to provide widespread and easy access for Veterans across VHA, regardless of geography or other access barriers."
"9247037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) constitute a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social-communication function, repetitive behaviors, and a restricted range of interests. ASD affects approximately 1 in every 88 individuals and the incidence appears to be rising. Within ASD, there exists wide phenotypic heterogeneity in adaptive function, cognitive and language abilities, and neurological comorbidities, leading many to refer to these various disorders as 'the autisms'. Therefore, two key questions emerge: (1) Despite phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, does ASD have common neurobiological signatures? (2) Can such neurobiological signatures be studied in vivo in humans? Answers to these questions would represent a significant step forward in our understanding of ASD, as well as our ability to diagnose and treat this condition. We have recently developed a new technique for the analysis of resting state fMRI data based on mapping propagated intrinsic brain activity. When applied to fMRI data obtained in high-functioning adults with ASD, the new method appears to be more sensitive than conventional functional connectivity analysis in detecting focal brain abnormalities. The objective of this project is to apply this new technique to fMRI data collected in young, typically developing children, as well as children who develop ASD. Preliminary results indicate that our method detects changes, at the group level, in the temporal structure of intrinsic activity in 6-month-old children who subsequently develop clinical ASD. This finding is consistent with recent post-mortem pathology evidence of disrupted cortical organization in individuals with ASD very early in life, perhaps even in utero. The intimate relationships between the temporal structure of intrinsic activity, neuronal plasticity, and early brain development provide a strong theoretical basis for this investigation. Specific questions to be investigated include: (1) what is the earliest age at which patterns of propagated intrinsic activity in childre with ASD differ, at the group level, from typically developing children? (2) Are different brain regions affected by ASD at different ages? Answers to these questions may illuminate the neurobiological basis of ASD. By investigating the causes and developmental trajectory of ASD, our project is directly in line with the first two objectives of the NIMH strategic plan. We will aso explore how patterns of propagated intrinsic activity change over the course of typical early development to gain a better understanding of the neural correlates of normal developmental milestones. Characterization of normal development could inform future investigations of other neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9318655","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40% of the world's population is at risk of contracting malaria and drug resistance is a constant problem; thus, identification and characterization of new targets for development of antimalarial drugs with different modes of action is critically needed. Moreover, the activity of new drugs against gametocytes, the transmission stage of malaria, is recognized as a priority in the efforts to eradicate malaria. The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is a promising source of malaria-specific targets because: a) it occurs through the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in malaria parasites present in the apicoplast and is absent in humans; b) isoprenoid downstream products differ from those in the human host; and c) isoprenoids are involved in a wide variety of vital biological functions. Most of our knowledge about isoprenoid biosynthesis comes from studies performed in the asexual intraerythrocytic stages only. However, it is unknown: a) if isoprenoid biosynthesis occurs during gametocytogenesis, b) if the isoprenoid repertoire is similar to that present in the asexual stages and c) what the role of the isoprenoids are during gametocytogenesis. We hypothesize that isoprenoid biosynthesis is present in gametocyte stages and is essential for gametocytogenesis. In addition, we have identified a novel pathway for menaquinone biosynthesis, an isoprenoid product. Thus, the overarching goal of this application is to study isoprenoid biosynthesis in the malaria gametocyte stages and to characterize the menaquinone biosynthesis in the malaria parasites. To address these aims we will mainly use 13C-metabolic labeling in combination with state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analysis. Building on these studies, the long- term goal of this proposal is to identify novel targets and to validate known targets in gametocytes for future drug development to cure malaria and stop its transmission."
"9185238","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) is a treatable neurogenic sensorimotor speech disorder that is characterized by a slow rate of speech, difficulties in speech sound production, and prosodic abnormalities. The severity of AOS can vary from minor speech sound distortions to an inability to produce any meaningful speech. In 2005, Duffy found AOS was the primary diagnosis for 7.6% of 6101 cases of neurologic motor speech disorders. However, more recent data revealed AOS was the primary diagnosis for 12.2% of individuals with communication disorders, but AOS tends to occur more frequently as a secondary communication disorder in conjunction with aphasia (Duffy, 2007).  There are sufficient data to support the statement that behavioral treatments for AOS result in improvements in speech production even when AOS is chronic (Wambaugh et al., 2006; Ballard et al., in press). Although, there are a number of different interventions for AOS that have been associated with positive treatment effects, there are no studies that have directly compared treatment approaches.  The purpose of the proposed research is to examine the effects of two treatment approaches on speech production involving speakers with chronic AOS and aphasia. The planned investigation is designed to examine the acquisition, maintenance and generalization effects of each treatment. One approach, electropalatography (EPG) uses visual biofeedback in conjunction with articulatory-kinematic treatment and the other approach, sound production treatment (SPT) is one of the most systematically studied articulatory-kinematic treatments for AOS.  A combination of group and single-subject experimental designs will be utilized. Ten participants with chronic AOS and aphasia will be assigned to one of two treatment groups (5 per group). One group will receive EPG treatment followed by SPT and the other group will receive the treatments in the reverse order (SPT followed by EPG treatment). Each participant will receive treatment administered in the context of a single-subject, multiple baseline design across behaviors. A baseline phase will be conducted with each participant, followed by application of either EPG treatment or SPT. A two week period of no treatment will follow the first treatment. During this period, extended baselining of the untrained behaviors will occur to ensure stability of responding prior to the second treatment. After the two week period, the second treatment will be applied to the remaining set of behaviors. Follow-up testing of all behaviors will occur at 2, 6, and 10 weeks after the cessation of all treatment.  The outcomes of interest will address changes in trained behaviors, untrained behaviors (i.e., generalization effects), maintenance of trained and untrained behaviors, speech intelligibility, and patient-rated communicative functioning."
"9190335","Repetitive mild closed head injury (rCHI) is a common form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) among military personnel in both combat and non-combat missions. rCHI can result in sustained cognitive decline and neurobehavioral changes (such as anxiety and depression-like behaviors) [1]. More recently rCHI has also been linked to the formation of a neurodegenerative condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is pathologically characterized by protein aggregate deposit found in the cortex and other brain regions, post-mortem. Two major proteins found in these CTE protein deposits are microtubule-associated protein Tau and TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) [2-5]. Patients with CTE may show symptoms of dementia, such as memory loss, confusion, anxiety, depression and aggression, which generally appear years or decade(s) after the occurrence of neurotrauma. The Central Hypothesis to be tested is that chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral changes following repetitive mTBI (rCHI) is closely linked to post-injury Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy development. In addition, the proposed work will not only allow us to test this hypothesis, but also enable us to validate novel CTE biomarkers tests as well as to examine a novel Tau, TDP-43 proteinopathy-based immunotherapy strategy towards improvement of chronic neurobehavioral deficits. Three specific aims are proposed in this application to address the central hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will subject wildtype mice to repetitive close head injury (rCHI) and follow them from subacute to chronic period (up to 18 mo.) to characterize cognitive and neurobehavioral changes, overall neuropathology and their correlation with time-dependent CTE-like Tau/P-tau and TDP-43 protein accumulation /proteinopathy signatures in brain tissue and biofluid. In Specific Aim 2 we will subject human-tau (hTau) transgenic mice and TDP-43 overexpressing transgenic mice to rCHI and follow them from subacute to chronic period to examine if they develop worsened cognitive and neurobehavioral changes, neuropathology and accelerated, exaggerated Tau/TDP-43 proteinopathy signatures in brain tissue and biofluid. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we will combine our learning from rCHI models in Aim 1 & 2 to test potential effects of Tau/P-Tau and TDP-43 immunization as novel immunotherapy for reducing rCHI-induced Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy load and mitigating chronic cognitive, neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes in wildtype, hTau, TDP-43 transgenic and/or hTau/TDP-43 double transgenic mouse lines. This proposed systemic study will advance our understanding of the neurobehavioral (anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunctions) and their potential linkage to the biochemical/protein changes of aggregation-prone proteins such as Tau and TDP-43 (proteinopathy) and CTE- like neurodegenerative cascade during the chronic phase of TBI. Such knowledge can translate into the ability for VA to devise better management tools and improved Veteran patient care. Our findings will also help us better diagnose chronic TBI including ultrasensitive biofluid-based Tau/P-tau and TDP-43-biomarker tests. Furthermore our research also points to a novel and promising immunotherapeutic strategy to treat such conditions. Taken together, these are all significant biomedical advances consistent with the research mission of the NF/SG VHS and VA and meet the full intent of the RFA. Importantly, the learning from this rodent studies and the immunotherapy approach can rapidly translate into clinical studies with Veterans who are at risk of developing post-TBI CTE. "
"9205176","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Title: Effectiveness of Zonisamide in the Treatment of Alcohol-Dependent Veterans ABSTRACT: Veterans have a high prevalence of alcohol dependence (AD), and those with AD also have a high rate of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses. Zonisamide is an extremely promising medicine for treating AD and managing other clinical problems including psychiatric disorders. Zonisamide is an affordable, generic anticonvulsant with unique actions on the major neurotransmitter systems involved in alcoholism, and it has neuroprotective effects. We recently completed a randomized, placebo- controlled pilot study of zonisamide in treating AD that showed significant reductions in heavy drinking, overall drinking, and alcohol craving. Zonisamide was very well tolerated in this study. In this application, we propose a larger (N = 160), 14-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, effectiveness study of zonisamide in reducing heavy drinking and improving outcomes in a representative population of heavy-drinking veterans with AD. We describe zonisamide's potential to break through the barriers in the treatment of veterans with AD as well as its unique pharmacology that brings innovation to alcoholism treatment. An inexpensive, hypothesis-driven, exploratory, translational, pharmacogenetic component adds to the innovation and will work towards optimizing outcomes and personalizing treatment for veterans."
"9110896","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Poorly controlled anger is a common problem with often devastating effects in veterans who have served in a warzone. Adverse consequences include increased risk for divorce, domestic violence, job loss and instability, and other serious impairments in family, social, and occupational functioning. Recent evidence indicates that anger and aggression are likely to be problems for a significant proportion of veterans of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF; Operation New Dawn, OND) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF). A survey of reintegration problems among 754 OEF/OIF combat veterans receiving VA Medical care showed that anger was the most commonly reported problem, with 57% reporting increased problems in controlling anger. Despite encouraging evidence for efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions in treating anger in civilian samples, much less is known about the efficacy of such treatments for anger problems in military personnel following exposure to war zone trauma. Promising preliminary findings for individually based cognitive behavioral treatment have been reported, and there is evidence that a group anger management treatment delivered by teleconferencing is as effective as the same treatment delivered in person, but to date there is not a single adequately powered randomized trial designed to test the efficacy of an anger treatment compared to an active control condition in veterans. Building on findings from our randomized pilot study, the objective of the current proposal is to conduct a randomized clinical trial with sufficient statistical power to test the effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioal intervention (CBI) that has been adapted from an existing treatment (Anger Control Therapy; Novaco, 1994, 2001) for the treatment of anger problems in OEF/OIF/OND veterans, compared to a manualized supportive therapy intervention (SI) control condition. One hundred and twenty OEF/OIF/OND veterans reporting significant problems with anger will be randomized to receive 12 individual sessions of one of the two study conditions. Outcomes including measures of anger and aggression; interpersonal, social and occupational functioning; and quality of life will be assessed during and at the end of treatment and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. Exploratory analyses will examine 1) whether a diagnosis of PTSD impacts treatment effectiveness and 2) potential mediators of treatment outcome with CBI."
"9180623","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major clinical challenge is the realization that common diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerotic heart disease, and even some cancers that used to be considered as adult-onset pathologies may actually have their origins during early periods of human development. The cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the conjugation of pharmaceuticals, environmental chemicals, hormones, cholesterol, and bile acids. Our long term goal is to understand how differences in SULT1C expression during the stages of development might impact drug efficacy and safety as well as susceptibility to environmental carcinogens and modulators of metabolic processes. Our short-term goals are to determine the expression pattern and regulators of SULT1C expression and to elucidate substrates and inhibitors of SULT1C metabolism. Unlike other xenobiotic- metabolizing enzymes, SULT1Cs are predominantly expressed during fetal life and are known to bioactivate xenobiotic molecules to toxic and carcinogenic intermediates. However, the role(s) of the SULT1C enzymes in endogenous metabolism and physiology are, as yet, uncharacterized. Our discovery that SULT1C genes are regulated by lipid- and xenobiotic-sensing transcription factors defines an unforeseen role for SULT1C enzymes at the heart of human development and metabolic signaling while also indicating that SULT1C enzymes operate at the interface of the physiological and xenobiotic environments. The hypothesis is that (1) the human SULT1C genes are differentially expressed in liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine and during development, (2) expression of these SULTs is differentially regulated by nuclear signaling mechanisms that include the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the liver X receptor (LXR), the vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?), and the xenobiotic-sensing receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and (3) certain sterols and/or bile acids are endogenous substrates for the SULT1C enzymes. To test this hypothesis, the four specific aims of this proposal are to, (1) Determine the expression of human SULT1C2, SULT1C3, and SULT1C4 in fetal, infant, and adult tissue from liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine, (2) Define the mechanisms that control transcription of human SULT1C2, SULT1C3, and SULT1C4 in cellular models of liver, kidney, and intestine, with emphasis on regulation by lipid- and xenobiotic-sensing transcription factors, (3) Define the mechanism(s) that regulate SULT1C2 transcription during hepatic differentiation, and (4) Identify the structure-function activity and inhibition relationships of the human SULT1C enzymes. This project will shed new light on human SULT1C gene expression, regulation, and function. It is essential to obtain this understanding since the SULT1C enzymes likely play important physiological roles during development and, due to their distinct abilities to bioactivat toxic and carcinogenic compounds, are primed to promote disease susceptibility during critical windows of vulnerability."
"9174895","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ligand-dependent transcription factor ROR?t regulates the development and functions of lymphocytes, including Th17 cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) that have central roles in mucosal barrier protection and in mediating multiple autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Targeting of ROR?t by small molecule inhibitors is a strategy that has been successfully validated in animal models and is being developed for therapeutic application in human autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. Although many of the targets of ROR?t and other key transcription factors involved in Th17 cell differentiation have been identified, the roles of ROR?t in the gene regulatory programs of other cell types, e.g. thymocytes, ILC3, and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, have not been studied, nor have the roles of the closely-related ROR? isoform that is expressed outside of the immune system. A better understanding of how ROR?t executes cell type-specific functions may facilitate development of better strategies to selectively inhibit its activities in the desired cells and tissues. We have ued genetic and proteomics screens to identify molecules that contribute to ROR?t-dependent target gene regulation in Th17 cells, either indirectly or directly by associating with ROR?t complexes. Molecules identified in both screens include nuclear pore proteins that have been recently implicated as having roles in the nucleoplasm as well as the nuclear envelope. We propose to study the roles of Nup98 and Nup153, proteins that interact with ROR?t and contribute to the expression of a large number of ROR?t target genes. In preliminary studies, we have identified mutations in ROR?t that abrogate interaction with Nup153. Mice with one of these mutations have impaired Th17 cell induction but normal T cell development. We will extend our studies with Th17 cells, and also study the role of the ROR?t-nucleoporin interactions in differentiation and function of TCR-??-17 cells and ILC3 and in the development of lymphoid tissue inducer cells and thymocytes. For the first aim, we will characterize the biochemical basis of the interaction of ROR?t with Nup153 and Nup98 and will determine how this interaction influences formation of ROR?t transcriptional complexes and the DNA occupancy of each factor in polarized Th17 cells. We will also examine the effect of ligand binding on association of ROR?t with its partners, taking advantage of small molecule antagonists and our finding that Nup98 regulates enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, which may thus influence endogenous ligand availability. In Aim 2, we will introduce relevant mutations into the mouse germ line and examine the effect on chromatin accessibility and gene expression programs in Th17 cells generated in vitro and in vivo and in other ROR?t-dependent cells. In Aim 3, we will use mice with the various point mutations in ROR?t or its partner proteins to determine the effects in models of Th17-mediated autoimmune disease or ILC3-dependent barrier protection. Together, these studies will help in the design of better screens for cell type-selective targeting of ROR?t functions."
"9246682","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), one of the most lethal forms of breast cancer, accounts for ~15% of all  breast cancer deaths. IBC is particularly devastating in disadvantaged minority women who have both a higher  incidence and poorer survival. Gene expression profiling of IBC tumors has identified the hedgehog(Hh)/GLI1  pathway as higher in patients with aggressive and relapsing IBC. We have previously demonstrated that GLI1  is highly expressed in IBC cells derived from an aggressive primary IBC tumor, and that down-regulation of  GLI1 in these cells decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and reduced migration. The objective of  the proposed research is to identify those genes that are critical for GLI activation and function, including those  that are both up- and downstream in of GLI1, to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying or  driving IBC. The hypothesis to be explored is that GLI1 and the genes that it regulates promote the growth and  survival of IBC, and that identifying these genes may lead to the elucidation of novel targets. The long-term  goal is to inform novel approaches for anti-tumor efficacy in IBC. This objective will be met by applying an  innovative approach that includes utilization of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq),  genetically engineered cell lines and human IBC tissue samples. This will become accomplished by the  following Aims: 1) To identify gene expression differences between low and high GLI1 expressing IBC models  including drug resistant and GLI1-antagonist treated IBC models. Differences in gene expression patterns will  be determined by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). 2) To confirm and validate those  gene expression differences by qRT-PCR analysis including a comparison of IBC and non-IBC cell lines. To  assess overlap of those differentially expressed genes with African American patient derived non-IBC cell  lines. We will assess GLI1 expression and the expression of a subset of differentially expressed target genes  identified in Aim 1 in archival IBC patient and control tissue samples accessed from the Duke Biospecimen  Repository and Processing Core by immuno-histochemistry, and gene expression analysis. To define  functional roles for these target genes, a subset will be knocked down by shRNA or knocked out using  CRISPR/Cas9 and effects on IBC growth and survival will be determined. 3) Selective pharmacological  inhibitors will be used to assess the role of previously identified pathways in activating GLI1 in IBC and non-  IBC. We assess effects on IBC cell biology in a panel of functional and phenotypic assays. This proposed  research will further the collaboration between Duke and NCCU on IBC and will support the development of an  under-represented minority postdoctoral fellow performing research focused on transcriptional profiling of GLI1  activation pathways in IBC. Completion of these Aims will provide mechanistic insights into the consequences  of GLI1 activation and antagonism in IBC, the downstream pathways involved and inform novel approaches for  anti-tumor efficacy in IBC with the long term goal to translate new therapies for IBC into the clinic."
"9379214","Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. Translational Research, a bidirectional process focused on translating basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) was developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes."
"9180678","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence indicates that several mammalian C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) in innate immune cells function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for sensing fungal infections, and trigger multiple signaling cascades leading to expression of various pro- inflammatory cytokines and anti-microbial proteins. In our previous studies, we have found that Dectin-2 and Dectin-3, two CLRs, form a heterodimeric complex on innate immune cells and function as a PRR for sensing fungal infection. Although many studies have been focused on characterizing the activation event of CLR signaling in response to fungal infection, it is not very clear whether CLR proteins and their signaling are negatively regulated i response to fungal infection. In our preliminary studies, we have revealed two important aspects of negative regulation of CLR signaling. First, we found that Dectin-2 and Dectin-3, two CLRs involved in sensing fungal infection, were rapidly downregulated in macrophages following fungal challenging, and this downregulation is triggered by signal-induced ubiquitination through a Cbl- b-dependent mechanism, and the ubiquitinated Dectin-2/Dectin-3 appears to be degraded through a lysosome-mediated process. Second, we found that stimulation of Dectin-2/Dectin-3 can effectively induce JNK activation, but instead of playing a positive role, JNK1 activation negatively regulates CLR-induced CD23 expression that is involved in modulating anti-fungal immune response. Therefore, based on our compelling and exciting preliminary data, we propose 1) to determine the molecular mechanism by which Cbl-b regulates the degradation of Dectin-2/Dectin-3 in response to fungal infection; and 2) to characterize the molecular mechanism by which JNK1 is negatively involved in anti-fungal immune responses. Together, these lines of investigation will characterize two important mechanisms that negatively regulate host innate immune system against fungal infection, and will provide the molecular insight for designing novel therapeutic agents by modulating host innate immune system against fungal infection."
"9172654","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although specific language impairment (SLI) is a developmental language disorder, researchers have increasingly identified non-linguistic cognitive deficits among children with SLI. In particular, skills reflecting executive functions ca be weak in this disorder. These skills, which are higher-order cognitive processes that control attention, thought, and action are necessary for regulating behavior, and have been found to be crucial for later school and career success. Despite its potential importance in SLI, investigation of executive function has been fragmented, leaving clinicians without an integrated view of this area, which could influence how these children are managed. The Integrative Framework Model provides a means for understanding executive functions as a set of related but separable components including working memory, inhibition, and shifting. These skills undergo rapid development during the preschool and therefore, this period represents an important developmental timeframe during which to identify delays in children's executive functioning. Evidence of executive function deficits has led to speculation that these underlying cognitive deficits may exacerbate, or even account for, the characteristic language problems of SLI. The first goal of the proposed research is to test executive function in preschoolers with SLI and typical language within the context of the Integrative Framework Model of executive functioning using a battery of verbal and non-verbal tasks that measure general attention, working memory, inhibition, and shifting. This model posits that executive function comprises related but separable components that develop hierarchically. The second goal of this research is to identify the relationship between children's executive functioning and their language-learning ability. Studies 2 and 3 will examine whether executive function skills account for a significant amount of variance in children's performance in two domains that can be impaired in SLI: learning novel lexical items and grammatical learning. This relationship will be explored in both typically developing children and children with SLI in order to determine if children in both groups are relying on the same executive function components when completing language-learning tasks. Establishing which components of executive function are problematic for children with SLI and identifying the relationship between executive functioning and language-learning are vital for understanding how cognitive deficits in SLI may relate to disordered language development and whether these factors should be considered in efforts to improve treatment outcomes for individuals with SLI."

The University of Illinois at Chicago is the largest institution of higher education in Chicago, and has been one of the fastest growing comprehensive universities in the nation. During the last decade the College of Medicine made growing, dedicated investments in both PhD and MD-PhD training. The curriculum for MSTP students includes the major portions of the medical school and graduate college curricula in a manner designed to minimize duplication and provide an integrated physician-scientist education. Most Medical Scientist Training Program students pursue PhD training in one of the five basic science departments of the College of Medicine, or in the interdepartmental Neuroscience program that is housed in the College. But, some can and do select training with investigators located among several programs in other colleges, including the Bioengineering Department in the College of Engineering, and graduate training programs in the School of Public Health and in the College of Pharmacy. All participating departments and programs have rigorous, well-established graduate training programs, careful supervision of students, many NIH-funded investigators, and many connections to clinician-scientists. In academic year 2011-12 there are 46 students in the program. The value of physician-scientists to biomedical research is widely recognized, as is the need for programs to bolster the number of such researchers. Compared to other physicians, MD-PhDs stand out for their scientific insight into bedside problems, and as innovative champions of progress in medicine. MD-PhD programs are a major source of the nation's physician-scientists, and arguably provide the best route to such careers."
"9246796","Project Summary Vibrio vulnificus is a natural inhabitant of coastal waters, including the US Gulf. The bacterium causes severe life threatening infections after consumption of contaminated seafood (especially raw oysters) and from wounds contaminated by seawater. Among food-borne pathogens, V. vulnificus is most notable for its high rates of hospitalization and death and its negative economic impact. Indeed, V. vulnificus accounts for 72% of deaths from Vibrio illnesses despite causing only 13% of infections. Although infections are rare, the number of serious infections has been increasing globaly due to climate change that has caused a rise in the number of days amenable to growth of V. vulnificus in coastal waters and the geographical area amenable to the pathogen. Attempts by various agency to warn and protect citezens by implementation of new policies or issuing warnings have met with resistance for it effect on the shellfish harvesting industry and the tourist economy. Thus, the study of V. vulnificus pathogenesis has become both a food safety and public policy priority. A significant virulence factor of V. vulnificus is the large Multifunctional-Autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTXVv). This toxin is comprised of long repeat regions that are associated with cellular necrosis, but this activity is not sufficient for virulence. Rather, virulence is associated with ?effector domains? that are translocated across host plasma membrane by repeat regions, and then released to the cell cytosol by inositol hexakisphophate induced autoprocessing. Bioinformatics studies reveal that different clinical isolates of V. vulnificus express distinct forms of the toxin, with five different variants assembled from eight different MARTX effector domains. To date, the mechanism of action of five of these domains has been determined. In this project, we will investigate the mechanism of action of the remaining effector domains found in clinical isolates. Further, we will study the relative toxicity of different variants of MARTXVv toxin in pathogenesis by the food- borne route of infection."

"9171941","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the importance of mast cells (MCs) in innate and acquired immunity, their development and recruitment into the skin is not well understood. Our findings suggest that the skin microbiome has a strong influence on migrating and, in particular, maturing MCs in the skin. Based on our preliminary data, we have demonstrated that bacterial products at the skin surface participate in the regulation of MC antimicrobial functions, homing to the skin, and help them respond to their survival growth factor, SCF. Even more important is the ability of the microbiome to induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype on human MCs that contributes to maintaining skin homeostasis, which helps avoid unnecessary inflammation. Antibiotic exposure, and a pseudo-aseptic environment, have the potential to alter the skin microbiome selectively and may be the cause of the increasing incidence of human disorders such as atopic dermatitis. We hypothesize that bacterial products, increase mast cell recruitment and are responsible for maintaining high levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and a low pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. A humanized mouse model system will enable the simultaneous study of both human MC migration pathways and TLR innate immune responses in a genetically adaptable organism, thereby translating our findings to human skin. We propose the following: a) Determine whether bacterial products from the skin microbiome are required for normal mast cell localization and function. The use of germ free and antibiotic treated mice will allow us to test whether disruption of the normal skin microbiome results in improper localization and function in vivo and whether reconstituting the microbiome can reverse these effects. Because human MCs may have a different sensitivity to the microbiome, we will test our findings on human MCs (huMCs) to provide a foundation for future translational research. b) Clarify the signaling pathways that are responsible for MC sensing the skin microbiome and how activation of these pathways affects MC function. We will focus on characterizing the MC receptors involved in sensing bacterial byproducts. The aspects to be studied: 1. Commensal activity directly on MC receptors (TLR ligands), 2. Commensal activity on keratinocytes that generate ligands (SCF, IL-1, and S1P) for MC receptors, and 3. Commensal activity on Endothelial cells (SCF) that generate ligands for MC receptors. c) Determine how MC interaction with the microbiome modulates intracellular pathways in skin MCs and affects their function. Our preliminary data show that bacterial byproducts modulate huMCs maturation and activation through NF-kB, S1P and intracellular sphingokinases (Sphks) pathways to produce S1P; we have found that LTA and other commensal fractions induce the expression of specific miRNAs that interfere with TLR-NF-kB signaling."
"9174894","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 integrase (IN) has an essential, multifunctional role in virus replication and serves as an important therapeutic target. During the early stage of HIV-1 replication IN catalyzes the covalent insertion of viral cDNA into the host chromosome. This process is mediated by cellular chromatin associated protein LEDGF/p75, which both markedly enhances integration efficiency and preferentially guides HIV-1 integration to actively transcribed genes. Structural interactions between HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 have been well characterized, but until recently little was known about how LEDGF/p75 recognizes select chromatin sites. During the past funding cycle we have elucidated structural and mechanistic basis for preferential and tight binding of the PWWP domain, the key chromatin binding module of LEDGF/p75, to cognate mononucleosomes (MNs). In particular, we have demonstrated that cooperative binding of the hydrophobic cavity and basic surface of LEDGF PWWP to the histone H3 tail containing trimethylated Lys36 (H3K36me3) and DNA wrapped in MNs is essential for high-affinity binding of LEDGF/p75 to chromatin. These studies will now be extended in aim 1 to characterize the interplay between full-length LEDGF/p75, H3K36me3 epigenetic marks, and HIV-1 integration sites in vitro and in infected cells. Aim 2 of the present application will focus on testing the hypothesis that HIV-1 IN plays an active role during the viru particle maturation. The rationale for this notion was provided by previous findings that certain substitutions in the IN coding region or addition of allosteric IN inhibitors induce eccentric maturation of virus particles. A hallmark of this eccentric phenotype is the mislocalization of the ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in mature virions. While infectious virions contain RNPs embedded within the capsid core, the eccentric particles have RNPs localized between the empty or translucent capsid core and the particle membrane. These experiments have highlighted a potential role of IN during the late steps of virus maturation. However, little is known as to how IN could contribute to proper particle morphogenesis. Here, we present our preliminary data showing that HIV-1 IN interacts directly and with high affinity with highly structured viral RNA segments in vitro and in virus particles. These preliminary findings suggest previously undescribed roles of HIV-1 IN during virus particle maturation and provide compelling rationale for our structural and virology studies proposed in aim 2. The proposed experiments are expected to fill the critical gap in our knowledge of how multifunctional IN contributes to the late stage of HIV-1 replication."
"9379215","Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. Translational Research, a bidirectional process focused on translating basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) was developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes."

"9334980","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Initiation of the eukaryotic chromosome replication is a tightly regulated multi-step process. Failure to ensure once and once only initiation event per cell division cycle can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Central to the replication initiation is the origin recognition complex (ORC) that recognizes the chromosomal origins of replication. With the help of replication initiator Cdc6 and replication licensing facto Cdt1, ORC recruits and loads the Mcm2-7 helicase onto DNA, forming a highly stable Mcm2-7 double hexamer. This completes the first milestone - formation of pre-replication complex (pre-RC). A series of subsequent events culminate to formation of pre-initiation complex (pre-IC) and leading cell to enter into the S phase. X-ray crystal structures have been reported for key proteins involved in prokaryotic replication initiation, but little is known about the structures o the corresponding eukaryotic complexes. This is so because the eukaryotic replication initiators assemble into large and transient complexes, which have been exceedingly difficult for crystallography. Recent advance in hardware and software has made cryo-EM an ideal approach to studying these complexes at much improved resolution. We therefore propose to study how the pre- Replication Complex is established by cryo-EM. This work will advance our knowledge in the initiation of eukaryotic chromosome replication."
"9182822","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Misrepair of DNA damage is a hallmark of tumor cells. DNA damage can occur from many endogenous and exogenous sources including environmental toxicants. Alkylation damage caused by a myriad of industrial and consumer based sources is pervasive in the environment. DNA alkylation leads to replication stress and DNA damage. If DNA is alkylated during replication, then the replication fork can collapse and many repair mechanisms can be utilized to repair the damaged DNA. How a cell commits to a specific repair pathway is not completely understood. In budding yeast, the Shu complex is critical in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) created by processing of replication forks damaged by DNA alkylating agents. This complex is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and contains the Rad51 paralogues, proteins that are structurally similar to the central DNA repair protein Rad51. In this study, the investigators aim to elucidate the role of the yeast and human Shu complexes in repair of DNA alkylation damage at a replication fork. They are testing the hypothesis that the Shu complex is a critical key regulator of error-free DNA repair by shuttling DNA intermediates into homologous recombination pathway through its unique protein-protein interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of the Shu complex proteins leads to repair by alternative error-prone repair mechanisms. The investigators will test the model that the Shu complex plays an essential role in the DNA repair pathway choice by 1) characterizing the association of the Shu complex with a damaged replication fork and the importance of its protein-protein interactions at the fork and 2) solving the structure of the Shu complex DNA binding subunits while bound to a replication fork-like substrate. These studies will elucidate how the Shu complex interactions with DNA and its protein-protein interactions direct these DNA intermediates into distinct repair mechanisms. Using what is learned in yeast to quickly and efficiently identify key substrates, residues, and protein targets, the investigators will expand their studies into human cell lines where they will investigate the role of the human Shu complex and RAD51 paralogues in repair of alkylation damage caused by environmental toxicants. The investigators will specifically characterize mutations and small nucleotide polymorphisms in the hRAD51 paralogues, which may make these individuals hypersensitive to DNA alkylators and could therefore increase cancer risk. Collectively, these studies will provide key insights into the role of the Shu complex in repair of DNA alkylation damage and elucidate how this complex promotes error-free DNA repair to prevent genetic instability. In addition, the investigators will identify at-risk individuals harboing mutations in these important genes that may be more sensitive to DNA alkylation damage and therefore susceptible to human disease."
"9180716","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project investigates how short- to medium-term climate variability affects population well-being and migration across a wide spectrum of development and urbanization. The project focuses on China over a period of rapid transformation (1989-2014). Social data will be derived from two large-sample longitudinal household surveys that have measured health, economic status and population mobility across China during this time period. These social data will be linked to high-resolution gridded climate data in order to measure population exposure to precipitation and temperature over 1-24 month time scales. Multivariate regression models will then be used to measure the effects of climate variability on well-being and migration while accounting for nonlinear relationships and a variety of potential spatial and temporal confounders. These analyses will be extended to reveal which populations are most vulnerable to these effects, and whether these effects have increased or decreased over time and with urbanization. This research will represent an important advance in the measurement of climate vulnerability, and will contribute directly to the global conversation about vulnerability to future climate change."
"9174897","Abstract. Immune tolerance expands to accommodate foreign paternal antigens expressed by the developing fetus during pregnancy. This vital process requires sustained expansion of a dedicated immune suppressive maternal CD4+ T cell subset, called regulatory T cells (Tregs), whereas blunted maternal Treg accumulation occurs in spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications linked with fractured fetal tolerance. This necessity for maternal Tregs is reinforced in animals where even partial transient depletion from expanded pregnancy levels disrupts fetal tolerance and triggers fetal wastage. One important, but relatively uncharacterized feature of Tregs lies in their antigen specificity. Like other T cells, individual Tregs have defined specificity, and T cell receptor stimulation is required for activating their suppressive properties. By combining tetramer enrichment for tracking rare CD4+ T cells based on defined specificity and the use of transgenic mice that ubiquitously express defined model antigens to sire pregnancy in non-transgenic females that transforms model antigens into surrogate fetal antigens, our initial studies show pregnancy primes robust expansion of maternal Tregs with fetal specificity. By extending this analysis after parturition, maintenance of maternal Tregs with pre-existing fetal specificity, and their more robust re-accumulation with fetal-antigen re- stimulation in subsequent pregnancies were also revealed. In turn, sharply increased resiliency against fetal wastage during secondary compared with primary pregnancy coincides with this expanded pool of fetal- specific memory Tregs. These results highlighting potential protective memory features for maternal Tregs are in agreement, and may provide a scientific basis to explain human partner-specific protective benefits of prior successful pregnancy against complications in subsequent pregnancies. Nonetheless, despite this association, what remains unknown is whether fetal-specific memory Tregs confer protection against fetal wastage. Addressing these critical gaps in knowledge require new strategies for in vivo manipulation of maternal Tregs with defined fetal specificity. Our overall hypothesis is that maintenance of maternal memory Tregs requires ongoing stimulation by fetal cells that establish microchimerism in mothers after pregnancy. In turn, depletion of microchimeric fetal cells allows the necessity of memory Tregs in protection against fetal wastage during later pregnancies to be investigated. Furthermore, if postpartum maintenance of regulatory tolerance is restricted to antigens expressed by microchimeric fetal cells, the transient pregnancy-induced remission and swift postpartum recurrence of organ-specific autoimmune disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis) may reflect inadequate expression of tissue restricted self antigens by fetal microchimeric cells. Therefore, accomplishing these aims are of exceptionally high significance for unraveling the fundamental biology of Treg with regards to memory and antigen-specificity, as well as establishing the scientific framework to explain epidemiological features of human pregnancy complications and shifts in autoimmune disease severity after parturition."
"9189958","Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect 1 in 10 children in the US and rates are increasing at an alarming rate. Gene-environment interactions are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are often posited as one mechanism by which genes and environment interact to influence individual NDD risk; however, there is a paucity of experimental data in direct support of this mechanism. The goal of my research is to address this gap in the literature by testing the hypothesis that PCB 95 interacts with heritable mutations in Ca2+ signaling at the level of DNA methylation to modulate Wnt2-dependent dendritic growth and plasticity. To test this hypothesis, I will model a gene-environment interaction relevant to ASD by combining exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 95, an environmental neurotoxicant, and mice with a CGG repeat expansions in the premutation range (<200 repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1), which is the single most frequent monogenetic cause of neurodevelopmental impairments, or a novel double knock in (KI) mouse carrying a gain of function mutation in the ryanodine receptor (RyR1T486I) and Fmr1 premutation. The rationale derives from the following published observations: (1) Ca2+ dysregulation and dendritic arborization are characteristics of many NDDs; (2) developmental exposure to PCB 95 increases Ca2+ signaling and Wnt2-dependent dendritic arborization; (3) the gain of function mutation in RyR1T486I and CGG repeat expansions in Fmr1 both enhance intracellular Ca2+ and dendritic arborization. The specific aims are: (1) Test the hypothesis that PCB 95 disrupts dendritic growth in vitro by decreasing nuclear DNMT3B and Wnt2 DNA methylation and these effects are amplified in Fmr1 premutation and KI mouse neurons. (2) Test the hypothesis that DNA methylation serves as a convergence point for PCB 95, and heritable mutations in Ca2+ signaling, combined effects on dendritic growth and plasticity in vivo. This project will yield novel mechanistic data regarding not only the developmental neurotoxicity of PCBs, which are a current risk to the developing human brain, but also the role of the epigenome, specifically DNA methylation, in gene- environment interactions that confer risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. This information is urgently needed to inform rational strategies for minimizing NDD risk by mitigating relevant exposures in susceptible populations and for identifying novel therapeutic targets. This research experience combined with the training plan developed in consultation with my Sponsor and Co-Sponsor will enhance and extend my predoctoral training and provide me with not only the research tools but also the professional skills required to transition to independence and realize my career goal of becoming an independent investigator in environmental epigenetics."
"9172208","DESCRIPTION       The purpose of this CDA-1 proposal is to provide Dr. Naomi Bramhall with the support and mentorship necessary to make the transition from basic science research to clinical research of noise-induced hearing loss. Dr. Bramhall's previous research has focused on hereditary hearing loss and hair cell regeneration, but as a certified audiologist, she is eager to shift to clinical hearing research. This proposal will provide Dr. Bramhall with the tools and experience necessary to engage in clinical research and generate data which will be used in applying for future funding such as the CDA-2, will guide her path towards independence as a clinical researcher. Her primary mentor for this proposal is Dr. Dawn Konrad-Martin and Dr. M. Charles Liberman is a co-mentor.  Loud noise exposure is routinely experienced during military service and hearing loss is the second most common service-related disability among Veterans. Individuals with hearing loss and poor speech discrimination ability often have little success with  hearing aids because amplifying sound improves the audibility, but not the clarity, of the speech signal. Loud noise exposure may result not only in damage to outer hair cells, but also lead to auditory neuronal degeneration. Neural loss can result in decreased word recognition (Schuknecht 1994) and may explain why many Veterans have poorer speech discrimination than would be expected based on their ability to detect tones, particularly in noisy environments. Mice show rapid degeneration of auditory nerve peripheral terminals followed by a slow degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons over a period of several months following loud noise exposure, even when their pure tone auditory thresholds recover completely (Kujawa and Liberman 2009). The subpopulation of neurons most vulnerable to noise exposure consists of the low spontaneous rate fibers (Furman et al. 2013), which have a high sensitivity threshold and respond to higher intensity sounds. This neuronal loss is correlated with a decrease in the amplitude of the first wave of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Age-related reduction in the amplitude of wave I has been demonstrated in humans (Konrad-Martin et al. 2012) and is consistent with temporal bone studies showing auditory neuronal loss with age (Makary et al. 2011), suggesting this metric of auditory neuronal survival is also applicable to humans. Previously, quantification of the degree to which auditory neuronal survival influences speech understanding has been difficult due to limitations in measuring auditory neuronal loss in humans, which could only be accomplished through post-mortem temporal bone studies.  The main objectives of this proposal are to use electrophysiological methods to 1) determine if decreased ABR wave I amplitude is associated with noise exposure in humans and 2) examine the impact of noise exposure and decreased wave I amplitude on auditory perception. Our hypothesis is that noise exposure will be associated with decreased wave I amplitude, consistent with animal studies, and that this change will be correlated with decreased speech recognition at high sound levels, difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise, and decreased tolerance to loud sounds. Developing the ability to assess auditory neuronal survival with existing clinical tools and advancing our understanding of the specific auditory perceptual deficits resulting from neuronal loss will help guide future treatment options for Veterans suffering from hearing loss."
"9181414","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We advance the hypothesis that hepcidin regulates manganese metabolism. Accumulating evidence from in vitro studies suggests that ferroportin, the target of hepcidin regulation, plays a role in the transport of manganese. Our in vivo studies of Hfe-/- mice strongly support this idea. We will directly test its function in manganese metabolism using flatiron (ffe+/-) mice as a genetic model of ferroportin deficiency. While ferroportin function in iron export by intestinal enterocytes and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system has been established, its activity has yet-to-be fully explored in hepatocytes where the exporter also is highly expressed. We hypothesize that in the liver, ferroportin functions in biliary excretion of manganese, a known homeostatic pathway that clears excess metal from the body. Based on our model, we speculate that circulating manganese levels are suppressed during inflammation by hepcidin, an idea that is well-supported by known host-pathogen interactions. Finally, we will determine the mechanism responsible for increased olfactory manganese absorption we have observed in Hfe knockout mice. The original new ideas forming the basis of our research will have a powerful sustaining influence on the field of metal metabolism by creating new paradigms to explain the molecular basis for manganese homeostasis."

The School was formed to train doctors who are citizens of Botswana with the hope of  retaining them in country. In prior years, medical students were educated outside the country at the government's  expense; however, less than 15% returned to Botswana. The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) established  collaborations with the Government of Botswana and UB in 2001, which is referred to as the Botswana-UPenn  Partnership. The partnership focuses on building health care capacity in clinical care, education, and research in  Botswana. The goals of this Core are to enhance the education of UB SoM trainees and faculty in clinical  research methodology focused on cervical cancer, and to provide scientific and career mentoring for trainees and  faculty who apply for pilot grant funding. To achieve these goals: 1. We will introduce a career-mentoring program  at UB for faculty and students interested in biomedical research. No such mentoring program currently exists at  UB. Entry into the career-mentoring program will be based on those trainees and faculty who submit a pilot grant  application. All applicants will be offered career mentoring independent of their success in obtaining pilot grant  funding. We distinguish career mentors from scientific mentors in that career mentors are often senior faculty with  successful careers that do not necessarily share scientific interests with their mentees. One senior faculty member  from UB and another from Penn will be identified as career mentors. 2. We will organize an annual educational  workshop in biomedical research methodology for UB faculty and medical trainees We will focus on teaching at an  introductory level about the skills required for biomedical research with an emphasis on epidemiology,  pathogenesis and treatment of cervical cancer, which is the central theme of this application. Lectures will target  UB medical students. Masters of Medicine (MMed) residents working on a research thesis, and UB faculty  interested in biomedical research. 3. We will initiate a mentored pilot grant program that links a UB faculty  member with a UB MMed resident and/or medical student and a scientific mentor from Penn. We are particularly  interested in supporting pilot grant applications that include as a team member UB medical students enrolled in a  novel year-out program for biomedical research funded by the Botswana Government. We will devote one day of  the annual workshop to lectures on manuscript and grant writing, to supervising the faculty and trainees as they  begin to prepare their pilot grant applications, and to helping applicants identify suitable scientific mentors at Penn  for their projects. We will establish performance measures to monitor the success of our programs. The 13-year  commitment of Penn faculty in Botswana and the collegial relationships that have emerged are positive indicators  that this Core will succeed in achieving its research and mentoring goals."
"9256858","PROJECT SUMMARY  The worldwide incidence of obesity and type II diabetes has risen alarmingly over the past few decades. The World Health Organization now estimates that 347 million people are diabetic, and that diabetes- related deaths will rise by 50% over the next 10 years, making it the 7th leading cause of death.1 A hallmark of diabetes is pancreatic beta cell failure, wherein beta cells are unable to secrete enough insulin to maintain normoglycemia. Many mechanisms have been suggested as the cause of this failure, but more recently, dedifferentiation has been identified as a common pathogenic mechanism in murine, primate, and human diabetes. Targeting dedifferentiation as a therapeutic measure is particularly attractive since dedifferentiating beta cells should theoretically be amenable to ?redifferentiation.? However, the causes of dedifferentiation remain unknown. The proposed project seeks to examine whether cytochrome b5 reductase isoform 3 (Cyb5r3) can play a role in this process. Cyb5r3 was identified as a differentially expressed transcript in dedifferentiating beta cells. Moreover, loss of Cyb5r3 was specifically linked to decreased FoxO1 function, a hallmark of beta cell dedifferentiation. Finally, loss of the related isoform Cyb5r4 in mice is known to cause early-onset diabetes independent of insulin resistance. My preliminary work has already established that Cyb5r3 is a direct transcriptional target of FoxO1, and that it is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial basal respiration and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro. I hypothesize that Cyb5r3 is critical to normal beta cell function in vivo, and that its loss contributes to beta cell dedifferentiation.  I will therefore describe two Specific Aims that seek to further characterize the role of Cyb5r3 in beta cells. First, I propose to corroborate my preliminary data by establishing a Cyb5r3 gain-of-function model, which I predict will partially reverse insulin secretory defects in diabetic mouse islets. I will also study how Cyb5r3 loss-of-function impairs mitochondrial respiration and insulin secretion by examining mitochondrial complex function. Second, I am generating mice lacking Cyb5r3 specifically in beta cells, a model I have termed ?B-Cyb5r3.? The B-Cyb5r3 mice will undergo thorough metabolic phenotyping (e.g. glucose and insulin tolerance tests, hyperglycemic clamp studies), as well as histopathological and functional assessment of islets and beta cells, which we expect will reveal a beta cell-specific defect in insulin secretion. In summary, this comprehensive set of experiments will not only contribute significantly to my development as a scientist but may also prove valuable to the treatment of diabetes."
"9169940","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social communication is at the heart of successful, healthy social interactions in humans. Social communication deficits are characteristic of several mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Dysfunction in reward neural systems, including opioid neural systems, has been pro- posed to contribute to social communication deficits characteristic of these disorders, yet little research has focused on the role of reward neural systems in social communication. Furthermore, it is not clear why communication deficits associated with these disorders are observed in some but not other social contexts. One possibility supported by pilot data in a songbird model system is that communication in distinct social contexts is rewarded by distinct mechanisms. The long-term goal of the principal investigator is to identify the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for communication produced in distinct social contexts. The objective of this application is to identif the role of reward and opioid neuropeptides in the medial preoptic nucleus (mPOA) in communication in distinct social contexts. The mPOA regulates affiliative social behavior and communication, and opioid release in mPOA induces reward. In a songbird model, sexually-motivated communication (SMC) can result in immediate external reward (e.g., courtship song results in copulation). In contrast, general social communication (GSC) occurs in social groups in a non-sexual, affiliative context and does not result in immediate overt reward (e.g., copulation), suggesting GSC is linked to intrinsic reward. The central hypothesis sup- ported by strong preliminary data is that GSC is stimulated and maintained by an individual's intrinsic reward state induced by opioid release in mPOA. In contrast, SMC may be reinforced primarily by conspecific responses to song. Four specific aims based on strong pilot data in a songbird model system are proposed 1) to determine the extent to which opioid markers in mPOA relate to individual differences in GSC and SMC using Western immunoblots and quantitative real time PCR in starlings singing in distinct social contexts; 2) to determine the extent to which opioid markers in mPOA relate to intrinsic reward associated with GSC and SMC using conditioned place preference, a standard measure of reward; 3) to determine the extent to which opioids stimulate GSC and SMC using site-specific opioid pharmacological manipulations in mPOA; 4) to determine the extent to which opioid antagonists disrupt the link between reward and GSC by examining effects of opioid pharmacological manipulations in mPOA on song-associated reward measured using conditioned place preference. Results will elucidate links between opioids, reward, and communication produced within distinct social contexts. The research is innovative and significant because it will provide novel insight into neural mechanisms underlying the motivation to communicate and ways in which distinct reward mechanisms function to shape socially-appropriate behavioral interactions. Findings will reveal mechanisms that facilitate communication in select social contexts."
"9173430","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in treatment, severe mental illness (SMI) remains common, chronic and difficult to treat. SMI is defined as having at least one mental disorder that lasts for 12-months and leads to substantial life interference. Sleep and circadian dysfunctions are among the most prominent correlates of SMI, yet have been minimally studied in ways that reflect the complexity of the sleep problems experienced by people with SMI. In SMI, sleep and circadian dysfunction undermines affect regulation, cognitive function and physical health, predicts onset and worsening of symptoms and is often chronic even with evidence-based SMI treatment. Prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused-they have treated a specific sleep problem (e.g., insomnia) in a specific diagnostic group (e.g., depression). However, real life sleep and circadian problems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in SMI where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Accordingly, we aim to test the hypothesis that a Trans diagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) will improve functional impairment, disorder- focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. We will recruit participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems. The elements of TranS-C are efficacious across SMI in research settings with research-based providers. The next step is to test TranS-C in community settings with community-based providers. Accordingly, we propose to conduct an 'efficacy in the real world' randomized controlled trial within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS), the CMHC for Alameda County. Alameda County is the most ethnically diverse county in the Bay Area. We will recruit 120 adults diagnosed with SMI and sleep and circadian dysfunction within ACBHCS. Individuals will be randomly allocated to TranS-C (n = 60) or 6-months of Usual Care followed by Delayed Treatment with TranS-C (UC- DT; n = 60). TranS-C is modularized and delivered across eight 50-minute, weekly, individual sessions. All participants will be assessed before, immediately following treatment and again 6 months later. Mediation analyses will examine whether improved sleep and circadian rhythm functioning mediate improvements in primary outcomes. Moderation analyses will examine if intervention efficacy is related to previously reported risk factors including demographics, symptom severity, medications, site, and season of treatment as well as psychiatric and medical comorbidity. This application is responsive to NIMH priorities focusing on implementing effective services in the community as well as treatments that are personalized, generalizable and not constrained by diagnostic criteria. RDoC is addressed by recruiting participants across diagnoses and defining sleep and circadian dysfunction broadly. The 'sleep-wake' and 'biological rhythms' constructs from the Arousal and Modulatory Systems domain are intervention targets and outcome measures. Our long-term objective is to establish the potential for widespread dissemination of TranS-C."
"9181405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High indoor allergen and pollutant levels have repeatedly been linked to asthma morbidity, especially among urban children, who have among the highest asthma morbidity in the US. However, environmental intervention trials for asthma have typically compared an environmental control strategy (ECS) to no intervention, a design that does not reflect the recommended approach to asthma management, which includes ECSs in conjunction with titration of controller medication. As a result, it remains unknown whether the addition of an ECS to controller medication titration results in improved asthma control, and therefore a reduced controller medication requirement. Another unanswered question is whether the addition of an ECS to controller medication titration results in greater reduction of allergic inflammation than medication titration alone. ECSs may have a greater effect on allergic inflammation than controller medications because ECSs target the most upstream point of the asthma inflammatory pathway by reducing pro-inflammatory environmental exposures, while controller medications target a downstream point of this pathway. Surprisingly, it is also unknown whether the improvement in asthma in ECS trials is mediated by reductions in allergen levels and/or reduction in pollutant levels. Understanding the factors that mediate the effects of an ECS on asthma is important for refuting, or supporting, a causal role for indoor allergens and/or pollutants in asthma morbidity, and also for optimizing the design of ECSs to target the most influential factors. We therefore hypothesize that the addition of an individually-tailored, multi-faceted ECS to guidelines-based controller medication titration will result in less controlle medication requirement and allergic inflammation than controller medication titration alone among urban asthmatic children. We will test this hypothesis and identify the factors that mediate the clinical effects of the ECS with a parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial of ECS plus controller medication titration vs. controller medication titration alone. Our aims are: (1) T determine the effect of the addition of ECS to controller medication titration on controller medication requirements and allergic inflammatory biomarkers, and (2) To determine whether reductions in particulate matter (PM) and/or indoor allergens mediate the effects of an ECS on asthma. This proposed trial will answer a pivotal question because if ECSs do not provide additional benefit in the context of treatment with controller medication, the role of ECS in asthma management should be downgraded. On the other hand, if ECSs do indeed reduce controller medication requirements, greater emphasis should be placed on the importance of ECSs in asthma management, studies should be conducted to identify best ECS practices, and policies should be changed to require third party payers to cover ECS costs."
"9170957","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium species, the etiologic agents of malaria, kill nearly 1 million people annually. They initially infect the liver as sporozoites, then they replicate as liver stages within hepatocytes to generate exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate symptomatic blood stage infection. These preerythrocytic stages of infection are clinically silent and were thought to not provoke a significant innate immune response. Yet, recent findings from our group and collaborators have shown that preerythrocytic stages induce a pronounced innate immune response in the liver. The mechanisms by which these complex parasites induce an innate immune response and the downstream effects of these responses on parasite infection remain poorly defined. Understanding the innate immune response to this eukaryotic, intracellular pathogen is important in its own right but also a critical missing piece in the puzzl to understand the development of sterilizing adaptive immunity engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Therefore, we propose to identify which innate immune responses are activated by wild-type and attenuated Plasmodium preerythrocytic parasites and to determine how these innate immune responses influence protective adaptive immune responses. Using gene expression analysis and functional assays, we have shown that liver stage infection induces an innate immune response mediated by type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. We have also shown that lymphocytes infiltrate the liver within days following infection and that this infiltration is strongly dependent on type I IFN (IFN-1) signaling. Furthermore, this innate response reduces the initial infection. These results indicate a link between IFN-1, lymphocyte recruitment, and subsequent innate parasite elimination. Our preliminary data also shows that this IFN-1 driven innate response shapes the adaptive immune response that is engendered by whole parasite immunizations. This we demonstrate with mice deficient in key IFN-1 signaling molecules, which surprisingly, are better protected by whole parasite immunizations. In this proposal, we intend to further delineate the generation and consequences of an IFN-mediated innate immune response to Plasmodium liver infection. In Aim 1 we will identify the host-parasite interactions that initiate this IFN-mediated innate immune response and identify the cell types in the liver that respond to IFN. In Aim 2 we will characterize cell-specific responses withi the liver following infection and identify cytokine and chemokine receptors that are necessary for innate lymphocyte infiltration. Additionally, we will evaluate the cellular mechanisms by which these innate cells eliminate liver stage parasites. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate how IFN-1-mediated signaling influences the development of adaptive immune responses engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Understanding the nature of the early innate immune response will reveal how a complex eukaryotic parasite engages early host immune defenses. Equally important, it will also identify innate molecular pathways to target for improvement of adaptive immune responses after vaccination that aims to protect against malaria infection."
"9131541","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The VA recognizes pain as the 5th vital sign in healthcare delivery, encouraging advancements in the assessment and management of pain in Veterans. Due to both ongoing military conflicts and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, a growing number of Veterans are living with amputations. Among this group, many report a phenomenon called phantom limb pain, a form of pain experienced in the amputated limb of the Veteran that is often chronic, debilitating, and resistant to standard biomedical pain therapies. Developing effective alternative treatments for phantom limb pain can potentially improve the quality of life and functional status of these Veterans. In a previous VA-funded clinical trial, this team of investigators completed the first comparativeness effectiveness study for phantom limb pain that evaluated mirror therapy, a behavioral treatment with promise for the treatment of phantom limb pain. In the current proposal, we aim to advance mirror therapy to the next stage of development by developing an immersive virtual reality treatment that incorporates the effective components of standard mirror therapy while also addressing the known weaknesses of mirror therapy. For example, in standard mirror therapy, only patients with unilateral amputations can perform the exercises and the person needs to carry the mirror in order to perform the therapy. Using a virtual reality platform, we can circumvent these limitations by immersing Veterans in a highly portable simulated environment in which they can perform mirror therapy exercises irrespective of amputation pattern. We will also address important questions about the relative benefits of virtual reality treatments for pain in this study. At present, it is unknown if it is te nonspecific elements of virtual reality that produce pain reduction benefits or if it is more speciic features of the virtual reality environment. We will evaluate these questions using a protocol in which patients are randomized to either the virtual reality equipment over one month treatment periods or to a matched standard behavioral mirror therapy treatment. The objective of this two year study is to develop an develop a portable and user friendly virtual reality treatment platform for treating phantom limb pain and evaluating its feasibility among a group of Veterans."
"9207353","DESCRIPTION:      Objective: Fibrous tissues of the musculoskeletal system are plagued by their poor intrinsic healing capacity. In this proposal, we focus on the knee meniscus, a tissue critical for proper load transfer, and for which current repair strategies do not restore function. To address this clinical need, we have devised a novel strategy employing anisotropic biodegradable composite nanofibrous scaffolds that serve as an inter- positional device and enhance meniscus repair. The objective of this study is to develop nanofibrous scaffolds capable of releasing multiple agents over different temporal scales, and thus, positively impact the entire healing process. Research Design: This proposal will utilize a novel class of composite nanofibrous scaffolds (developed during the first funding cycle) that have varying degradation profiles and release kinetics of bioactive agents targeted to different phases of healing and repair. These release profiles will be tuned to first 'enable' repair by rapidly and locally degrading the dense extracellular matrix at the injury site to allow cell migration and new tissue formation. Second, these scaffolds will selectively recruit progenitor cells to the wound interface, to accelerate and  sustain the repair process. Finally, the scaffold will provide biochemical factors over a longer-term to 'direct' cell phenotype and promote matrix production. The synergistic interactions of these different adjuvants to repair will be investigated in a large animal meniscus defect model. Methodology: We will develop and characterize composite nanofibrous scaffold systems that permit release of factors from the fibers themselves or from encapsulated microspheres. This novel scaffolding technology allows for the inclusion of several fiber populations with different degradation profiles and for the release of multiple bioactive factors with varying temporal release profiles. Scaffolds will be utilized in a model of meniscus repair in adult sheep and compared to suture repair controls at early (2, 4, and 8 weeks) and longer term (16 and 48 week) time points. Evaluation criteria will include meniscus and cartilage histology, micro-computed tomography, and mechanical properties. Findings: We will develop composite nanofiber-based engineered scaffolds to enhance meniscus repair in an ovine model. We will show enhanced cellularity and integration with local matrix degradation at the injury site. We will  also show increased recruitment of progenitor cells as well as improved matrix production with staged biofactor delivery. The synergistic effects of these treatments will be assessed relative to  the current standard of care. Clinical Relationships: If successful, these studies and new technologies will set the stage for clinical translation and treatment of human meniscal pathology. These novel scaffolds can be directly utilized in clinical procedures to enhance meniscus repair. Impact/Significance: The proposed research is highly relevant to the mission of the Veterans Health Administration since it will advance the health of veterans suffering from meniscus injuries resulting from military trauma, injury or from degenerative diseases. If successful, the proposed therapy will improve the quality of life of such individuals."

"9192629","Project Summary/Abstract Delayed childbearing is increasingly common in the industrialized world. In 2013, 15% of babies in the United States were born to women older than 35 years and 3% to women older than 40 years, a dramatic increase from only 8% of births to women older than 35 and 1% to women older than 40 years in 1988. Pregnancies to older women are at increased risk for adverse outcomes compared to pregnancies among younger women. Unfortunately most previous studies in this area have dichotomized maternal age, giving stakeholders the mistaken impression that a threshold between `older' and `younger' ages for childbearing exists at age 35 or 40. Moreover, women who have a first live birth at an older age have shorter inter-pregnancy intervals compared to women at younger ages. Short inter-pregnancy intervals (<18 months) are associated with increased risks of many important adverse pregnancy outcomes. When planning the next pregnancy, older women have to balance the potential risks associated with short intervals against their increasing age with longer intervals. The optimal inter-pregnancy interval for women who delayed their first pregnancy has not been identified. For many women, age at pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for which preconceptional counseling tools are needed. For those women who have already delayed childbearing, pregnancy spacing for subsequent pregnancies is a modifiable risk factor for which evidence-based recommendations are needed. As delaying childbearing has great public health implications, it is critical for the evidence to be presented in informative and clearly interpretable formats for public health messaging at a population level. This study will address shortcomings in the literature regarding the relationship between age at pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes and will identify the optimal inter-pregnancy interval for parturients older than 30. The following three aims will be achieved: i) Estimate the absolute risk of 14 pregnancy outcomes according to 1-year increments of maternal age at pregnancy to identify the dose-response relationship; ii) Use a causal framework to estimate the proportion of the effect of age at pregnancy on outcomes that would be eliminated by preventing complications of pregnancy among older mothers; iii) Identify the optimal inter-pregnancy interval for women who had a first birth older than 30. This study will be conducted using birth registry data from British Columbia (Canada) and the United States. These are ideal data sources for this study, with sample sizes that enable examination of rare outcomes and a granular analytic approach for maternal age. Pregnancy outcomes have large effects on the health of a population. As more women delay childbearing, the relationship between age at pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes will have increasingly greater effects on the population's health. It is thus critical that risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes are well understood in the academic literature and effectively communicated to stakeholders."
"9319988","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parasitic flatworms (tapeworms and flukes) infect humans and livestock, causing a variety of diseases with pathologies that range from benign to deadly. These parasites have complex life cycles and remarkable capacity for growth, reproduction, longevity, and repair/regeneration. Despite their complexity and variations in their life cycles, parasitic flatworms share common features: perhaps most notably, they possess pluripotent adult somatic stem cells. Studies from free-living flatworms have shown that these stem cells (called neoblasts) are critical for normal tissue homeostasis, sexual reproduction, and regenerative capacity. Cytological studies revealed that parasitic flatworms maintain neoblasts, and recent molecular studies indicate that there are shared neoblast regulatory genes conserved among flatworms. Our long-term goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets against neoblasts that have the potential to treat multiple parasitic flatworm diseases. Our current objective is to identify and validate neoblast regulatory genes that are conserved among parasitic flatworms and that are necessary for parasite growth and/or reproduction. We have identified a suitable laboratory model (the rat intestinal tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta) that is amenable to gene discovery and functional validation in a high-throughput manner. We hypothesize that there are parasite-conserved neoblast regulatory genes critical for parasite growth and/or reproduction. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following two specific aims: (1) to identify genes that are conserved among parasitic flatworms and expressed in neoblasts; and (2) to functionally screen for regulators of parasite neoblasts that are required fo growth and/or reproduction. Neoblast-enriched genes will be identified using RNA-sequencing comparison of normal and neoblast-depleted H. diminuta. Candidate genes will be validated for co-expression in neoblasts by in situ hybridization. Using publically available genome and transcriptome assemblies of flatworms that infect humans and livestock, we will compile a candidate list of parasite-specific, neoblast-enriched genes. For functional validation, we will take advantage of our ability to culture H. diminuta in vitro. We have successfully established an in vitro regeneration assay and screening procedure to monitor tapeworm growth and development to reproductive maturity. We will establish methods to knock down expression of candidate genes from Aim 1 coupled to our in vitro regeneration assay to identify genes that are required for parasite growth and reproduction. These studies are innovative because we have designed a high-throughput and unbiased approach to uncover and functionally validate parasite-specific genes as regulators of parasite health, using H. diminuta as a model. The proposed work is significant, as we will identify high-confidence targets with the potential for broad efficacy against multiple parasite species. Together, our studies will fill important gaps in functional genomic studies of parasitic flatworms and have the potential to identify new therapeutic targets."
"9188781","Veterans are particularly susceptible to neuropathic pain originating from combat wounds, surgery and diabetes. The long-term goal of this project is to find a cure for neuropathic pain that represents its true reversal and not just palliative measures. This goal can be achieved by investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of pain latent sensitization, a rodent model that reproduces key features of chronic pain disorders: indefinite duration and episodic presentation triggered by stress. Latent sensitization can occur following a variety of stimuli: inflammation, skin incision and nerve injuries that cause neuropathic pain. It is characterized by a period of hyperalgesia followed by a period of pain remission in which pain is generally absent but may reappear as pain episodes. This is due to the fact that the remission phase of latent sensitization does not represent a return to normality but an anomalous state in which pain is suppressed by a compensatory activation of opioid receptors. This is revealed by a return of pain (?reinstatement?) upon administration of opioid antagonists, which are without effect in normal animals or humans. The latent sensitization model emerged from the work of several research teams on opiate-induced hyperalgesia and its interaction with injury and stress. Only recently has the importance of latent sensitization as a model for chronic pain become clear, and there is only one study on its relevance for neuropathic pain. This project will investigate the mechanisms of latent sensitization in neuropathic pain. The Specific Aims are: 1) study the role of opioid receptors and stress in neuropathic latent sensitization; 2) determine whether the remission phase of latent sensitization is mediated by opioid release or by -opioid receptor constitutive activity; and 3) study the role of NMDARs and the adenylyl cyclase / protein kinase A pathway in neuropathic latent sensitization. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) -opioid receptors, ?-opioid receptors and ?2A adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord mediate anti-hyperalgesia during the remission phase of nerve injury-induced latent sensitization; 2) -opioid receptors located in primary afferent terminals contribute to the remission phase of latent sensitization; 3) stress reinstates pain hyperalgesia during the remission phase of latent sensitization; 4) -opioid receptor constitutive activity, and not sustained opioid release, mediates pain remission; 5) pain sensitivity in latent sensitization is maintained by a positive feedback loop in which NMDARs and the adenylyl cyclase / protein kinase A pathway activate each other. This project will use a multidisciplinary approach to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, a spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain will be used in rats and mice to identify the receptors that suppress pain sensitivity in the remission phase. Using transgenic mice with selective deletion of -opioid receptors in nociceptive primary afferents, we will determine whether the -opioid receptors that suppress pain are located in primary afferents. We will also investigate how stress reinstates pain during the remission phase. In Aim 2, we will determine whether the anti-hyperalgesia produced by -opioid receptors is due to their constitutive activity by using patch-clamp recording from primary afferent neurons to measure their inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. The alternative hypothesis, that -opioid receptors are activated by sustained opioid release, will be tested using knock-out mice in the three genes that encode opioid peptides. In addition, opioid release will be measured as -opioid receptor internalization. In Aim 3, the interaction between NMDA receptors, adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A during latent sensitization will be studied in primary afferent neurons using calcium imaging and patch-clamp. The activating phosphorylation of NMDA receptors by protein kinase A during latent sensitization will be measured with Western blots. Finally, NMDA receptor antagonists and inhibitors and activators of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A will be used to delineate the signal pathway that maintains latent sensitization. This will identify targets to develop medication to reverse neuropathic pain."
"9051954","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a non-invasive, high resolution imaging strategy to assess both biodistribution and cellular uptake of polymer carriers in vivo. Polymer-drug conjugates have great potential as anticancer agents, due to improved pharmacokinetics as a result of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, their efficacy relies not only on their increased accumulation in the tumor tissue, but also their ability to subsequently deliver their therapeutic payload to intracellular targets. As such, it is hypothesized that the ability to optimize endocytic efficiency - the fractin of conjugates in the tissue that is actually internalized by cells - should lead to better and more  clinically relevant polymer-drug conjugates. However, there is no straightforward, generalizable means to non-invasively assess cellular uptake of polymer-drug conjugates in preclinical models. In order to address this shortcoming and test this hypothesis, a novel imaging strategy is proposed that uses an activatable fluorophore that is triggered upon endocytosis of the polymer-drug conjugate. The proposed design uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and a lysosomally-degradable peptide in order to create an activatable system. Specifically, a donor fluorophore and quencher are conjugated to the polymer-drug conjugate, but are separated by peptide substrate for lysosomal enzymes. Prior to endocytosis, the dyes are in close proximity, and exciting the donor will not induce fluorescence. However, upon encountering the lysosomal enzyme, the peptide will be cleaved, breaking the link between the dyes and freeing them to diffuse apart. The donor fluorophore will then emit a bright fluorescence upon excitation. The ability of this system to report endocytosis in vitro and in vivo  will be evaluated. To conduct the in vivo imaging, fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) will be used to obtain non-invasive whole-body 3- dimensional imaging in a small animal model, quantitatively imaging probes at picomolar levels at depths greater than one centimeter. In parallel, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging will provide information on polymer biodistribution. Then, chemotherapeutics and targeting moieties will be incorporated into the polymer design to produce a new polymer theranostic (therapeutic + diagnostic) system. Ovarian carcinoma will serve as a model disease target to validate the utility of imaging results for preclinical evaluation of polymer-drug conjugates. The ability of the proposed imaging strategy to inform selection of optimized therapeutics and enable prediction of their efficacy will  be evaluated."
"9192172","Project Summary In this research project, we propose to perform task-based optimization of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with respect to acquisition scheme using acquisition tailored image reconstruction algorithms. DBT is quickly being adopted in clinics alongside conventional 2D mammography for breast cancer screening. Mammography is inherently limited by the overlapping of 3D structures in a 2D image of the breast, allowing morphology indicative of breast cancer to be hidden by dense structures or mimicked by the superposition of overlapping tissues. DBT addresses this issue by providing 3D information via a limited- angle, tomographic approach. While the potential advantages of DBT have been widely demonstrated in the literature, optimization of the modality with respect to acquisition scheme remains an active area of research. A number of task-based optimization studies in DBT have been performed over the past decade, but these have typically confined their attention to a single reconstruction algorithm. The proposed work addresses this issue by performing a task-based comparison of acquisition schemes while employing acquisition-tailored reconstruction algorithms designed using task-based, objective metrics. Both traditional and advanced sparsity-exploiting reconstruction algorithms will be employed for this purpose. Through tailoring of the reconstruction algorithms, the work can also be expected to provide an objective improvement in image quality in the acquisition schemes considered. The specific aims of the proposed project are: (1) investigate traditional DBT reconstruction algorithms with varying acquisition scheme, (2) investigate sparsity-exploiting optimization-based DBT image reconstruction, (3) investigate and design DBT-specific image quality metrics for algorithm optimization, and (4) perform task-based assessment of acquisition-tailored algorithms with human observer studies. The first aim will address the tailoring of current image reconstruction methods to acquisition schemes of practical interest in order to establish a baseline for which to compare more advanced algorithms. The second aim will focus on the development and investigation of advanced, sparsity-exploiting, optimization- based DBT image reconstruction algorithms. This aim will involve both the development of efficient algorithms for, and the investigation of, these reconstruction techniques. In the third aim, task-based image quality metrics based on clinically relevant tasks in DBT will be developed for tuning of the previously developed optimization-based reconstruction algorithms, yielding acquisition tailored, advanced reconstruction algorithms. Lastly, in aim 4, task-based comparison of the acquisition tailored reconstruction algorithms will be performed with human observer studies."
"9191868","ABSTRACT  Primary sensory cortex, the first point of sensory processing within the cerebral cortex, receives input from both a ?primary? and a ?secondary? thalamic nucleus. Primary thalamic nuclei relay signals from the external world to primary sensory cortex. In contrast, secondary thalamic nuclei are densely interconnected with many other cortical regions and may therefore be involved in more advanced computations. While the role of primary thalamic nuclei in sensory responses is well understood, secondary nuclei remain under-studied. Lesions in secondary thalamus render subjects unable to notice and choose important objects. These secondary thalamic nuclei may encode representations of behaviorally relevant objects (e.g. those predicting reward outcomes).  The goal of this proposal is to determine what information is encoded in the projection from secondary thalamus to primary sensory cortex and how this input influences cortical responses. A well-characterized and genetically tractable model system, the mouse whisker system, will be used. In mice, the posterior medial nucleus (POm, somatosensory secondary thalamus) is in a promising position to influence neural activity in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). POm sends axons to layer 1 of S1, where it contacts S1 neurons at their apical dendrites, computationally powerful segments of cortical neurons. Input to the apical dendrites can strongly potentiate the firing of S1 neurons and has been proposed as a mechanism for feedback from higher cortex to modulate activity in sensory cortex. This thalamic input could increase S1 responses to behaviorally relevant objects. Indeed, many studies have shown that neural responses in primary sensory cortex across sensory systems are enhanced for relevant stimuli, such as attended, rewarded, or punishing stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we will first design a behavior that manipulates the behavioral relevance of objects. Next, the calcium imaging of POm axons within S1 will determine if POm inputs to S1 are biased towards relevant objects. Finally, optogenetic silencing of POm axons during juxtasomal recordings of S1 cells will test whether POm input enhances S1 representations of behaviorally relevant objects. These experiments will elucidate how the projection from secondary thalamus to sensory cortex imparts behavioral meaning to cortical sensory responses."
"9174079","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission. MG pathology is attributed to the presence of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies, which target the AChR at the neuromuscular junction. Many patients remain medically refractory or have intolerable adverse effects to current therapies; thus, another agent for the management of MG is needed. Several recent studies, including one performed by our group, have demonstrated the benefits of B cell depletion via rituximab treatment in MG patients. The NINDS-NeuroNEXT is conducting a multicenter randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase II clinical trial evaluating the therapeutic effect of rituximab for MG. We have exclusively partnered with this trial so that we can first, improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of B cell depletion in MG and second, so that fundamental questions regarding human autoimmunity can be addressed. Specimens prior to, during and after treatment are under collection for our work. This study presents a unique opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific components that directly participate in the immunopathology of the disease. Our mechanistic studies will test the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying clinical benefit involves a reservoir of T cell-dependent, autoreactive memory B cells that supply a population of antibody secreting cells and is critical to MG autoantibody production. Rituximab eliminates this reservoir of memory B cells; then the newly formed B cell compartment is reshaped such that autoantibody production is diminished. To test this hypothesis, we have developed/applied assays to measure B cell tolerance defects, describe the repertoire of the B cell compartments and the B cell subsets that produce MG autoantibodies and characterize the antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying the treatment of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases with rituximab. This proposal is directly relevant to the human disease and is in clear alignment and relevance to the mission of the NIH. That is, this translational research focuses on studying the human disease with human-derived cells. Furthermore, the importance of studying MG is magnified by its service as a model for antibody-mediated disease. Innovative, novel technology such as next generation sequencing and antigen-specific T cell assays will be applied to answer fundamental questions. The study is designed to elucidate the pathogenic role of major immunological components in MG, that is the contribution of B and T cells, including an investigation of fundamental autoimmune mechanisms, namely B cell tolerance and T cell pathogenic phenotypes. Through studying MG cell-mediated immunology we will further define the events that both initiate and propagate this disease that will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of autoimmune disease."

"9373778","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children."

"9193646","Summary Tech-1 Technology Component 1 describes essential work on existing custom software. This work will add new functionality to the Xenbase database and allow us to represent both anatomical and gene expression phenotypes from Xenopus experiments using an EQ syntax as well as with GO annotations. These aims will be achieved though software development at multiple levels of the Xenbase system, from building the database support for phenotypes all the way through to user interfaces. To build this we will use logic from other MODs, that like Xenabse use a GMOD/Chado schema and we will adapt the web-application and interface code that we have already established for gene expression. Our experienced development team, along with the new hires outlined in this proposal, will build phenotype representation into Xenbase in a 2 year time frame. We will add representation of phenotypes as changes in gene expression levels within another year. Adding content and collaborating with external resources to maximize the impact of these data in understanding the molecular basis of human disease will take an additional 2 years."
"9171938","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) represents a diverse population of cells responsible for maintaining and regenerating the hematopoietic system. Maintaining the proper function of these cells, and particularly the long-lived self-renewing hematopoietic stem cell, is essential for health and survival. In HIV disease there are serious deficits involving hematopoietic function that cannot simply be explained by HIV-1 infection of T-cells and macrophages. It has been hypothesized that HIV-1 can directly infect HSPC leading to hematopoietic dysfunction. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that HSPC express the receptors necessary for HIV-1 infection and recent studies demonstrating direct infection of HSPC by HIV. It has also been demonstrated that HIV can establish a latent infection in HSPC, suggesting that HSPC could serve as an important reservoir for HIV-1 in drug treated individuals. However, the conclusions of these studies are disputed since they are based principally upon in vitro or ex vivo HIV-1 infection of HSPC. We propose to address the hypothesis that HSPC can be infected and function abrogated by using a model system, the BLT mouse model, which more closely mimics natural HIV-1 infection in the bone marrow (BM).  Investigation of HIV-1 infection of HSPC further requires the recognition that HSPC are not a uniform population. It has been known for decades that the majority of HSPC purified experimentally from bone marrow represent precursor cells that are destined to differentiate to specific lineages. Only a small fraction of these cells represent true hematopoietic stem cells which have the ability to self-renew indefinitely as well as give rise to the committed progenitor cells. In addition, our recent studies of HSPC in non-human primates demonstrate that even long-lived stem cells have different behaviors in regards to their contribution to hematopoietic output and their relative distribution to lymphoid versus myeloid progeny. Thus, it is critical that studies of HIV-1 infection of HSPC should investigate the consequences of infection upon individual HSPC rather than the entire population. This can be accomplished by a method known as clonal tracking, whereby individual HSPC are genetically marked by integrating lentiviral vectors and then tracked after transplant and repopulation. By combining clonal tracking with FACS separation of hematopoietic cell sub-populations, we can investigate the consequences of HIV infection on the behavior of HSPC clones and their progeny. We have used this methodology effectively to study the behavior of HSPC clones in non-human primates and propose to extend this methodology to the impact of HIV-1 infection upon HSPC."

"9318800","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is one of the largest contributors to disease burden in the United States with an annual incidence of 550,000 cases and mortality of 42% within 5 years after diagnosis. An improved understanding of left ventricular (LV) remodeling that comprises the substrate for progression of HF is critical for the delineation of novel pathways and therapeutic targets, and for the identification of biomarkers to predict and track LV remodeling to allow for the initiation of early and effective therapy in patients at risk or worsening HF. This is an area of unmet clinical need because our current understanding of remodeling is incomplete, and risk- stratification strategies lack adequate specificity and sensitivity. MicroRNAs (miRNA) and other non-coding RNAs have been implicated in human heart disease, and their recent discovery in plasma has led to the hypothesis that extracellular RNAs may mediate disease-specific signaling, and spurred their development as biomarkers and disease reporters. Based on the initial findings of our and other laboratories that extracellular RNAs can both predict and play an important role in LV remodeling in HF patients, the objective of this proposal is firstly, to delineate the role of newly discovered as well as previously reported extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) in mediating LV remodeling. Secondly, we aim to characterize these ex-RNAs as prognostic biomarkers in HF patients that can be easily imported into the clinic to identify at-risk patients. The group of investigators in this proposal, spanning multiple disciplines within cardiovascular and ex-RNA research will test the central hypothesis that (1) ex-RNAs can predict LV remodeling (a surrogate endpoint) as well as clinical outcomes in patients with HF; (2) ex-RNAs can function not only as disease reporters, but also as mediators of LV remodeling in animal models; and (3) these ex-RNAs can be therapeutic targets in validated animal models of heart disease. The findings resulting from this proposal would identify novel pathways and therapeutic targets in HF, and lay the platform for more effective and targeted HF treatment based on prognostic biomarkers and disease reporters."
"9170095","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wrist-worn Sensors for Tele-Rehabilitation of the Hemiparetic Upper-Extremity: Stroke and other causes of central nervous system damage can result in debilitating loss of motor control that is often more pronounced in one limb than the other. Using or attempting to use the affected limb during activities of daily living, despite considerable difficulty, stimulates neuroplasticity and motor function recovery. BioSensics, in partnership with the Motion Analysis Laboratory at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, will develop wrist-worn sensors for motor retraining after stroke. Our simple technology will encourage affected limb use during the performance of activities of daily living, will remind patients to perform daily prescribed motor control exercises in the home environment, and will assess the quality of limb movement during these exercises. We hypothesize that adding long-term monitoring and biofeedback using wrist-worn sensors to traditional therapies will improve motor ability following stroke; particularly in cases where a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy is not feasible due to insurance coverage, lack of transportation, geography, or other limiting factors. The proposed device is the only telehealth system designed to encourage usage of the affected limb during activities of daily living. Many technologies exist to remotely monitor movement using wearable sensors, but none address the specific needs of patients with hemiparesis. Therefore, there is a significant opportunity to develop a first-to-market technology in this space. The team we have assembled for this collaborative project includes engineers, clinicians, and scientists from BioSensics (a privately held biomedical technology development company) and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (the largest provider of rehabilitation medicine in New England). During Phase I of this Fast-Track SBIR project we will develop the wrist-worn sensors and test algorithms for assessing the quality and quantity of upper-limb movement in the home environment based on acceleration measured by these sensors. During Phase II we will develop the telehealth infrastructure for the proposed system, including a home base station that receives daily movement summaries from the wrist-worn sensors and uploads the data via WiFi or LAN to a HIPAA compliant server, and a website that clinicians can use to visualize data and remotely set patient specific exercise regimens and activity goals. We will also conduct a usability study and a clinical study at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The clinical study will compare rehabilitation outcomes between 30 patients with upper-extremity hemiparesis following stroke who receive standard care and supplemental home-based therapy and 30 patients who receive the same intervention but use the proposed system. There is a significant commercialization potential for the proposed technology due to 1) the size of the market, 2) the disruptive nature of our first-to-market technology, and 3) the ongoing national push for a transition from the current fee- for-service healthcare model to accountable-care-organization standards. We will have a market-ready device by the completion of Phase II with plans for a market launch during Phase III, pending FDA approval."

The county has consistently had one of the highest asthma hospitalization and emergency room visit rates in the state for school-aged children. The California Environmental Health Tracking Program- a program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the California Department of Public Health, and the Public Health Institute- are partnering with Comit? C?vico Del Valle and the University of California, Berkeley to conduct a community-engaged project to reduce air pollutant exposures in this region and improve the health of its residents. The goals of the project are to: (1) Engage community members to define and map local hazards and assets to highlight factors contributing  to cumulative exposures, community vulnerability and resilience; (2) Deploy a network of inexpensive real-time air monitors which will relay data to the internet for immediate  information on pollution levels; (3) Use state of the art land use regression modeling to develop the most accurate and detailed picture  possible of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 exposures throughout the County for identification of hot spots near  vulnerable populations; (4) Develop a public health action plan for reducing exposures, improving health, and ensuring project  sustainability; and (5) Conduct an evaluation of the project, including partnership processes, community involvement in the  research, and resulting public health actions. This project utilizes innovative approaches with the potential to provide sustainable public health benefits and ultimately serve as a model for community-engaged environmental health action. First, the project will augment traditional practices related to air quality monitoring by utilizing community expertise, priorities and direction to inform the placement of low cost air quality monitors. It will also develop novel methods to combine data from the low-cost monitors with existing data sources to create high spatial and temporal resolution maps of air pollution. Finally, the project will enhance a community-initiated online mapping tool with air quality data from the monitors. This project will ultimately build community capacity by developing skills related to asset/hazard mapping, air monitor site selection, and research and action related to hazards and environmental health."
"9246380","African Americans (AAs) exhibit higher incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer (PCa) than  whites. Although much of the disparate cancer burden can be explained by differences in social determinants of  health, a significant portion of this disparity remains after controlling for these factors. The studies proposed here  address the urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the more aggressive PCa biology in  AA men, to manipulate these mechanisms for therapeutic application and to determine the importance of these  mechanisms for response to current therapeutic strategies.   At Duke Cancer Institute (DCI), we have identified novel alternatively spliced genes in AA versus white  PCa and have shown that AA variants track with more aggressive cancer invasion characteristics of PCa in AA  men. We have also identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms located in splicing regulatory regions of  such genes that associate with PCa risk, aggressiveness and survival. Subsets of these genes are androgen  receptor (AR) targets, relevant given the role that AR signaling plays in PCa progression, use of anti-androgen  therapy and association of AR signaling with PCa health disparities. In parallel, at North Carolina Central  University (NCCU), we have interrogated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which operates in a  regulatory loop with AR, thus having therapeutic implications for race-related PCa. Using the Bio-manufacturing  Research Institute and Technology Enterprise at NCCU, we identified 8 novel small molecule AMPK activators.   The proposed work is a joint translational science pilot project to further develop the existing NCCU-DCI  partnership, support focused collaboration in cancer research, enhance cancer research at NCCU and cancer  health disparities research at DCI and support the development of 2 junior faculty and a minority postdoc. Our  objectives are to 1) interrogate and modulate race-related AR target splice variants and 2) elucidate genetic  factors important for response to anti-androgen therapy among and between racial groups. Specifically, we aim  to 1) define the biological significance of modulating the levels of race-related AR target RNA splice variants on  PCa cell biology, using novel RNA therapeutics and small molecules, 2) define the biological significance of cis-  acting splicing elements of alternatively spliced AR target genes in AA PCa to alternative RNA splicing events  and AA race-related PCa cell biology, by expressing variants containing the AA or white genotype and assessing  alterations on splicing and PCa cell biology and 3) define the biological factors related to alternative RNA splicing  events and AMPK signaling that are critical for response to the anti-androgen, Abiraterone Acetate, among and  between racial groups, performing association analyses of correlatives with clinical parameters in a clinical trial.   The rationale for and impact of the work proposed here is that it will reveal molecular mechanisms that  can pave the way toward development of novel precision biomarkers for PCa risk, aggressiveness, therapeutic  response and/or survival prediction among minorities as well as precision therapeutics for PCa disparities."
"9193645","Summary: Through high quality curation we aim to integrate the wealth of Xenopus data into a single easily accessible computer framework that accelerates research, and facilitates the translation of this large amount of information into meaningful knowledge. The data in Xenbase must be comprehensive, accurate and up to date. Xenbase contains many different data types including; genomes and gene models, DNA, RNA and protein sequences, gene names and symbols, gene expression patterns, gene function, anatomy, orthology, reagents (MOs and antibodies), investigator information, phenotypes and disease associations. This data comes from the published literature, direct community submissions and from other databases (e.g. NCBI, JGI, OMIM). In order for the information in Xenbase to be computer readable, we index and annotate data using ontologies and standardized procedures that are the accepted best practices as shared across major model organism databases (MODs). This allows Xenopus data to be compared to other animals and to human disease gene and phenotypes. The majority of the curation effort is to read and annotate the published Xenopus literature. Xenbase contains a corpus of ~46,000 Xenopus papers, mirroring PubMed, but to date only about 10% of these have been curated, primarily for gene expression patterns. Preliminary analysis indicate that ~11,000 uncurated papers are likely to contain valuable high priority data and about 1,300 new Xenopus papers are published each year. In the Curation Component we will annotate this Xenopus research data."
"9181418","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is directed at the study of gene-environment interactions regulated by the Ah receptor (AHR) during embryonic development and at their consequences in adult disease. Human exposure to organ chlorinated Ah receptor ligands, such as dioxin, has been epidemiologically associated with a number of toxicological outcomes and diseases, of which developmental abnormalities and mortality from cardiovascular disease are preeminent. While prevailing scientific evidence suggests that these outcomes are mediated by AHR activation, the molecular mechanisms by which AHR ligands exert their effects in humans remain to be identified. We propose to identify these mechanisms and to provide a biological test of the causal connection between AHR, fetal exposure to dioxin and cardiovascular disease. Our immediate objectives are, (i) to determine if developmental exposure of mice to TCDD or ablation of the Ahr gene causes cardiac changes associated with physiological deficits in adult life; (ii) to assess if these changes result from modifications to he the normal heart-specific developmental epigenetic program; (iii) to characterize gene-gene-environment interactions that exacerbate cardiac disease resulting from known haploin sufficiency caused by mutations in genes that regulate cardiac development; and (iv) to use computational tools to build causal relationships between variant cardiac epigenetic programs, gene expression regulatory changes, and TCDD exposure in utero. We have found that the AHR coordinates a complex regulatory target network during development responsible for attainment and maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. Key in this network is Nkx2-5, coding for a cardiac homeobox transcription factor that lies genetically upstream of multiple genes essential for heart development. Nkx2-5 is repressed by TCDD-dependent AHR activation in mouse ES cells and in differentiating mouse embryos. In humans and mice, NKX2.5 polymorphisms cause NKX2-5 haploinsufficiency associated with congenital cardiac malformations which, in independent epidemiologic studies have been associated with maternal exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls during pregnancy. We propose to explore the hypothesis that exposure to dioxin during development redirects endogenous AHR functions towards toxic/adaptive responses that depress expression of NKX2-5 and its target genes and disrupt cardiomyocyte differentiation, recapitulating the congenital cardiac malformations and adult cardiac disease resulting from NKX2.5 haploinsufficiency in humans. Congenital cardiac disease is the most common type of human birth defect, the leading cause of neonatal/infant mortality, and a major source of adult cardiac insufficiency. Results from this work will establish the role of AHR in cardiac development and in mediating in utero toxicity and heart disease, characterize how in utero exposure to an environmental agent, TCDD, affects the epigenetic programing of heart development, and identify gene-environment interactions that may aggravate heart disease susceptibility."
"9172662","DESCRIPTION         This study will explicitly compare the effects of a 12-week progressive exercise training program on 1) the clinical symptoms of chronic pain and PTSD, 2) pain threshold and tolerance, and 3) anti-stress, anti- nociceptive neurohormones such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and allopregnanolone/pregnanolone (ALLO) in veterans with chronic pain/PTSD compared to healthy comparison participants. The revised study design includes a baseline cardiopulmonary exercise assessment (CPX) that will inform the exercise prescription for a 12-week progressive exercise training program, comprised of three 30-45 minute exercise sessions per week (walking or running, depending on the ability/capacity of the participant). Exercise sessions will be initially supervised by an exercise physiologist in the Clinical Studies Unit (CSU) at the VA Boston Healthcare System and then each participant will transition into the home. Weekly telephone calls by the PI will provide additional motivational support and assistance with problem solving. Implementation of the prescribed exercise regimen will also be supported by the use of heart rate and actigraph monitors programmed for the participant to achieve their prescribed heart rate range (HRR). Finally, an endpoint maximum load exercise assessment will occur at week 13 in order to track measurable change for both psychological and neurobiological factors and to delineate their impact on pain indices and PTSD symptomatology. Both maximum load exercise tests will be performed in accordance with guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology. Measures of pain, pain tolerance (via the cold pressor test) will be implemented 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after exercise testing as well as at a midpoint check-in at which self-report questionnaires will also be repeated. Based on the PI's earlier research, the role of exercise motivation and self-efficacy on changes in perceived pain and pain tolerance will be correlated with changes in NPY and ALLO levels, pre and post exercise. It is anticipated that differences in biological responses to aerobic and anaerobic exercise between healthy participants and those with chronic pain/PTSD will predict differences in the psychological and pain-reducing benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Once identified, such factors could be augmented by modification of the exercise regimen in order to help enhance the ant-stress hormone levels for the pain/PTSD population and experience clinically significant reductions in their symptoms. In order to obtain sufficient power as well as accounting for an expected drop-out rate of 18-20%, the proposed recruitment is 30 participants per condition (total of 60 participants). Data from this pilot work will be used to compute effect sizes in support of a future clinical trial incorporating individually prescribed exercise regimens and a motivationally based exercise behavior change intervention aimed at reducing pain and PTSD symptoms in our Veterans. Advanced education and training is sought by this CDA-2 award applicant in four broad areas: 1) psychophysiology of chronic pain and PTSD with a sub-focus on sex differences, 2) the neurobiology of chronic stress, PTSD, and pain, 3) exercise physiology and 4) the neuropsychology and neurobiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The combination of didactic and experiential training in these areas will serve the PI's long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist/practitioner in the VA focused on development of improved treatments for health conditions co-morbid with PTSD such as chronic pain and mild TBI. In the shorter-term, this CDA-2 will allow the PI to develop a more effective, motivationally based, exercise behavior change protocol that fosters long- term exercise compliance in patients with chronic pain/PTSD. This intervention will be used as an adjunct to cognitive interventions for these disorders to be further developed and studied via a larger VA, NIH, or DOD- funded grant for which the PI will apply in years 4-5 of the CDA2."
"9278972","Abstract: Veterans are vulnerable to develop complex forms of addictive disorders characterized by the presence of coexistent psychiatric conditions, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood disturbances. Furthermore, the high frequency of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among veterans convey an additional risk to develop refractory forms of substance use disorders probably related to the traumatic disruption of prefrontal circuits mediating reward attribution, impulse control, and emotional regulation. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are frequently observed among veterans and exert a detrimental effect on community reintegration during the post-deployment period. Acknowledging the significance of AUD, the VA is devoting extraordinary efforts to develop adequate treatment strategies. For instance, the Quad Cities VA Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) will offer a rehabilitation alternative to the growing number of veterans with AUD in Iowa, Illinois and Northern Missouri. The implementation of this program gives a unique opportunity to evaluate treatment outcomes and to identify specific factors that moderate treatment response. In the present study we will examine treatment outcomes of an IOP administered during a 12-week period. All patients will receive an empirically validated psychosocial intervention and appropriate treatment of coexistent psychiatric conditions. With regard to pharmacological treatment of AUD, we plan to randomize patients to receive either sodium valproate or naltrexone, a standard of care active comparator. The objectives of this study are to determine: 1) whether the presence of prefrontal brain damage will be associated with poorer response to the IOP, 2) if valproate is more effective than naltrexone to treat AUD in this group of patients with severe psychiatric comorbidity and TBI exposure, and 3) if completion of the IOP will be associated with good psychosocial outcomes at 6 months follow-up. This is a double-blind active-controlled randomized clinical trial. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, followed weekly for 12 weeks and evaluated at 6 months. Our primary outcome variable will be time to relapse to heavy drinking. Secondary outcome measures will include proportion of heavy drinking days, severity of PTSD symptoms measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, severity of depressive symptoms measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and psychosocial outcome measured by the Community Integration Questionnaire. Other assessments will include baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing the assessment of memory and executive functions."
"9174852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of this project is to determine whether arthroscopic meniscectomy in degenerative meniscal tears is beneficial from a clinical and scientific viewpoint relative to a non-meniscectomy surgical control. Arthroscopic meniscectomy is among the most commonly performed orthopedic surgical procedures in the VA system and nationally. 80% of patients in our practice having knee arthroscopy for meniscus tears have been in the 45-70 years age group and 53% of these patients had degenerative meniscal tears without a large unstable flap. These data are comparable of arthroscopic meniscectomy data drawn in other settings. However, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the short term benefits and the long term consequences of arthroscopic meniscectomy in patients with degenerative meniscus tears. Degenerative meniscus tears are associated with osteoarthritis, and it is known that within two years of surgery, arthroscopic debridement for osteoarthritis is no better than placebo in relieving pain and restoring function. Longer term, meniscectomy has been shown to be associated with elevated risk of osteoarthritis development, raising the concern that meniscectomy can actually be harmful. It has also been shown by our group that patients with clinically successful arthroscopic posterior medial meniscectomy have significant change in the rotational motion of the knee during walking. Rotational changes at the knee follow soft tissue damage and have been implicated in the causes for cartilage degeneration.  Thus there are critical unanswered questions regarding the clinical benefit as well as the scientific basis for arthroscopic meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal tear. To address these questions this project will conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, and controlled study of arthroscopic meniscectomy in patients between the ages of 45 and 70 with stable degenerative meniscus tears. In this study, the control group will be a group of patients having arthroscopic lavage of the joint, but no debridement of a stable degenerative meniscus tear. The Aims will address clinical (self-reported) and scientific outcomes (functional) of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the time frame lasting up to two years after surgery. Aim 1: Test the clinical benefit of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the setting of a stable degenerative meniscus tear.  Hypothesis 1a: There will be significant differences in WOMAC scores between the Meniscectomy and the Non-Meniscectomy/Lavage Groups at 12 months after surgery.  Hypothesis 1b: The WOMAC scores of the Non-Meniscectomy/Lavage group will not be inferior to the WOMAC scores of the Meniscectomy group at 12 months after surgery Aim 2: Test the functional effect of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the setting of a degenerative meniscus tear.  Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to arthroscopy and meniscectomy will have greater changes in tibio- femoral rotation, knee adduction moment, and knee flexion moment at 12 months following surgery when compared to subjects randomized to arthroscopy and lavage. We will also pursue other exploratory aims that are oriented towards understanding and characterizing the progression of incipient osteoarthritis from a clinical, biological, and radiographic standpoint. This prospective coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach will provide an important clinical and scientific assessment of arthroscopic meniscectomy that will improve treatment planning for degenerative meniscal tears. It will also provide new insight into incipient arthritis, yielding important information that will impact future patient care."
"9195735","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a serious chronic illness that affects many children worldwide. Exposure to cockroach allergen in early life can lead to allergic sensitization and increase the risk of developing asthma. However, the underlying immune mechanisms and genetic etiology remain unclear. Recent advances have demonstrated that members of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family functionally interact with allergens and are critical in controllng immune response. This offers a novel avenue to investigate their biological role in allergic responses and their genetic effects. In this regard, CD206 (MRC1), encoding mannose receptor, a major member of the CLR family, has been shown to mediate Bla g2 (cockroach allergen) uptake. Specifically, our ongoing study has led to a novel observation that CD206 is highly expressed in human monocyte-derived fibrocytes, unique cells expressing both hematopoietic cells (CD34, CD45, MHC class II) and stromal cells (collagen I and III), and functionally interacts with Bla g2. Our preliminary studies have also provided initial evidence supporting a role of CD206 in mediating cockroach allergen -induced allergic responses in a mouse model of asthma. Furthermore, our genetic analysis has demonstrated a significant association for sequence variants in CD206 and asthma in two independent populations. The stage is thus set to critically evaluate the functional significance of the cockroach allergen-CD206 axis in allergic responses. HYPOTHESIS: CLRs, particularly CD206 expressed by fibrocytes, may play a pivotal role in allergic responses to cockroach allergen. Aim 1 proposes experiments to investigate the functional interaction of cockroach allergen and CD206 in fibrocytes. We will use a well-established ex vivo model to investigate the CD206-mediated cockroach allergen induced fibrocyte maturation, activation, and antigen presenting cell (APC) function in T cell proliferation and polarization (Th1/Th2/Th17) by using gene silencing and receptor blocking approaches. Aim 2 proposes experiments to determine the role of CD206 and fibrocytes in cockroach allergen-induced inflammation and airway remodeling. We will use mouse models of cockroach allergic asthma to test whether CD206 deficient mice are protected from cockroach allergen-induced airway inflammation, and to study the role of fibrocytes in regulating both airway immunological and fibrotic responses and the modulatory effects of CD206 on fibrocyte function. Finally, Aim 3 proposes studies to assess association between sequence variants in CD206 and cockroach sensitization and to determine their role in gene expression and function. We will identify genetic variants in CD206 using targeted deep-sequencing and test their associations with cockroach sensitization among African Americans. We will then test for gene-environment interactions to determine the effect of cockroach exposure on the association with cockroach sensitization. We will finally determine the role of CD206 genetic variants in regulation of gene function. This will provide novel insights into the role of cockroach allergen-CD206 axis in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and offer an opportunity for novel therapies."
"8091703","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award Melodie L. Weller, PhD Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. It is the second most common autoimmune disease with predominance noted in females compared to makes (9:1). Strong evidence exists supporting a viral etiology of SS, but as of yet a direct cause and effect relationship has not been established. It is our hypothesis that more than one virus may be able to trigger the development of SS. To get a better picture of the viruses present in salivary glands of SS patients, we used a custom viral microarray chip to identify virus profiles in the salivary glands of SS patients and healthy volunteers. Using this platform, we have identified a distinct cohort of SS patients positive for Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Our preliminary data has revealed not only the presence of HDV sequence in salivary glands of a subset of SS patients, but also the presence of HDV antigen. Making this viral profile more unique, these patients have tested negative for Hepatitis B virus antigen and antibody, the only known helper virus of HDV. This proposal aims to define the role of HDV in SS and determine if a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists between expression of the HDV antigen or genome and altered salivary gland function. In vitro studies will evaluate the impact of HDV antigen or genome expression and cellular function in salivary gland cell lines. Next, in vivo studies will evaluate expression of HDV antigen and genome in mouse salivary glands. Evaluation of an autonomous HDV infection in an intact system will define the ability of HDV to initiate a SS-like phenotype. The third aim of this grant will deliver a test to detect low-level HDV infection specifically in salivary gland tissue and identify correlations between levels of HDV in salivary gland and those identified in serum or saliva. Identification of HDV sequence and antigen in the salivary glands of pSS patients is a significant discovery in the field of Sjvgrens syndrome research and stands to greatly impact the current therapeutic approaches used to treat this autoimmune disease."
"9174858","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Between 2001 and 2010, more than 130,000 active service members received diagnoses of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, with annual incidence rates more than doubling over this period. Over 68,000 days of lost duty time were attributed to disc degeneration-specific diagnoses. Military training and operations are inherently physically demanding, placing military service members at increased risk for IVD degeneration and related neck and back pain. Among Veterans, chronic back pain accounts for over 70 percent of chiropractic visits and in many cases is directly connected to their period of service. Despite the prevalence and soaring costs, there is no specific treatment that restores physiological functions of the diseased IVD.  The objective of this pilot study is to confirm that young allogeneic articular chondrocytes, especially those induced to overexpress growth factors (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein, BMP-7) are effective in repairing the degenerating IVD. Articular chondrocytes would be an appropriate cell source because they already have a phenotype similar to that of the IVD cells, and, unlike native disc cells, have greater potential for clinical translation through allogeneic transplantation. Young chondrocytes will be used here because a body of literature supports the notion that young cells possess more regenerative capacity than older cells by rejuvenating host tissue via trophic factors. Our team has pioneered the development of a rabbit IVD-injury model which is ideally suited to evaluating cell-based therapeutics.  Our preliminary data have shown that young allogeneic articular chondrocytes injected into the center of the injured rabbit IVD survived and reduced inflammation of the host tissue. In the proposed study, hydrogels with distinct properties will be assessed as scaffold that may prevent leakage from the injection needle track and enhance biomechanical properties of the repaired IVD. The injectable implants shown to mimic the native NP in mechanics will be more likely to induce the appropriate phenotype in the cells as the disc is loaded in vivo. Specifically, our group has developed hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels conducive to preservation of chondrocyte phenotype and growth, which solidify at body temperature and are thus ideal for injection therapies. We have also tested a triple-interpenetrating-network (TIN) hydrogel that enhances biomechanical properties of the repaired IVD. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that transplanting articular chondrocytes seeded in hydrogels will repopulate the IVD thus reducing inflammation and enhancing biomechanical properties by providing trophic factors and synthesizing extracellular matrix. Two specific aims are proposed, to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will compare the HA and TIN gel in supporting transplanted articular chondrocyte survival and reducing host inflammatory responses in the rabbit IVD-injury model. The hydrogel that best supports cell survival and reduces host inflammation will be further tested. In Aim 2, we will determine the therapeutic effects of young articular chondrocytes on injured mature rabbit IVDs. The effects of chondrocytes (native or overexpressing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7) on the host IVD inflammation, biomechanical properties, and tissue structure will be determined.  We expect that IVDs repaired with chondrocytes seeded in hydrogel will show improved biomechanical properties, decreased inflammation, and improved morphology. These studies in the rabbit will lay the groundwork for clinical studies that will test if transplanted chondrocytes  are effective in reducing disc degeneration and back pain, thus benefiting patients."
"9177689","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adapting behavior and cognition to meet changing environmental demands is critical for optimizing wellbeing. Previous research has identified an important role for the neuromodulator dopamine, particularly with respect to its effects on the striatum, in regulating cognitive flexibility, that is, the ability to flexibly update the contentsof working memory and relevant goals. Variability in the striatal dopamine system has been associated with alterations in cognitive flexibility, and indeed, a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including attentional deficit disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction are characterized by abnormalities in both dopaminergic neurotransmission and cognitive control. Importantly, both appetitive and aversive motivation are thought to phasically increase and decrease, respectively, the release of dopamine into the striatum, thus raising the possibility that motivational context may differentially impact cognitive control processes. Recent  work has demonstrated that reward motivation increases cognitive flexibility, but only in individuals with higher baseline levels of striatal dopamine. Research examining the impact of aversive motivation on cognitive control has been much more limited; in one study, threat of punishment was associated with reduced updating of working memory content, suggesting that aversive motivation may bias individuals away from cognitive flexibility and toward cognitive stability. However, to date, no work has explicitly examined the role of baseline dopamine system function in mediating the influence of aversive motivation on cognitive control processes or the frontostriatal circuitry that supports them. By exploiting genetic variants known to impact the striatal dopamine system, and using a targeted psychopharmacological intervention, the proposed fMRI experiment seeks to fill this gap by examining the effect of striatal dopamine variability on patterns of brain activation and cognitive flexibility in the face of aversive motivation. A second aim of the proposed research is to characterize the role of the habenula in moderating the impact of an aversive motivational context on cognitive control processes. The habenula is a small region of the epithalamus that has recently been implicated in inhibiting striatal DA release in response to potential punishment; if inhibition of striatal DA resulting fro aversive motivation impacts the frontostriatal circuitry supporting cognitive flexibility, the habenula may provide a critical linkage between motivation and cognitive control. Together, the proposed research will expand our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to individual differences in the relation between motivation and cognition. Further, results of this work may inform our understanding of cognitive control abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant DA neurotransmission and of the impact of both therapeutic and illicit drug use on aspects of cognitive control."
"9171939","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever, prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5- 80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities. Originally identified in Russia and he Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses Hazara, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. Currently, there is no vaccine or prophylactic available for treatment of CCHF or other any other nairovirus related diseases. Recent reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located within the nairovirus genome and implicated its possible involvement in down-regulation of the Interferon type 1 immune response through cleavage of post-translational modifying proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15). As a result, it has been suggested to be a virulence factor. This proposal will determine whether dual deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities are conserved functions of this subclass of proteases in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, these experiments will gain insight into their mechanism of recognition for Ub and ISG15 allowing greater predictability of currently unknown vOTUs. The proposal will also seek to evaluate a potential correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence of the nairoviruses in question. The resulting information will also provide critical insight into the role of vOTUs ply in viruses that may ultimately have practicality in the development of prophylactics targeting vOTUs."

"9223641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Summary of Proposed Study Background: Alcohol abuse and dependence represent a spectrum of maladaptive behaviors with enormous public health impact, especially for the U.S. veteran population. Depressive symptoms are frequently comorbid with alcohol use disorders, but despite their frequent use in clinical practice, clinical trials with serotonin reuptake inhibiors (SSRIs) for alcohol use disorders have been unsuccessful. In clinical trials, a divergence in response to treatment with SSRIs among different subtypes of alcoholics is seen (less severe Type A vs. more severe Type B alcohol dependence). Type A alcoholics show decreased drinking behavior in clinical trials with SSRIs, whereas type B alcoholics show increased drinking. The literature does not offer an explanation for this divergence, and therefore, it is no clear how these research findings can be applied clinically. Alcohol research is well- suited to a veteran population because of the high proportion of veterans with alcohol dependence.  Program Objectives: The nominee has a strong background in clinical addiction psychiatry, and he seeks to accomplish two objectives through the proposed training program: 1) to become an expert in the field of human alcohol addiction research, and 2) to learn techniques of PET research. The nominee's work environment at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center, in collaboration with colleagues at UCLA provides an ideal infrastructure for this training. He will be mentored by renowned experts in these areas, Arthur Brody M.D., and Edythe London Ph.D. The mentors have several NIH and VA grant-funded ongoing studies in alcohol and other addictive disorders research with strong ties to the VA PET research infrastructure. The nominee plans to submit an NIH R01 and/or VA Merit Review grant toward the end of the award period. Long term, he plans to found an independent research career studying neuropharmacological approaches to treating and understanding substance use disorders, focusing primarily on alcohol.  Design: This project proposes to study 20 individuals in each of 3 groups (Type A alcohol dependence, Type B alcohol dependence, and healthy control subjects) for a double-blinded, placebo- controlled, within-subjects, outpatient study with iv citalopram (40 mg and saline, in counter-balanced order) and [18F]fallypride PET scanning. The project aims: 1) to determine the change in striatal dopamine receptor D2/3 receptor availability (measured as binding potential for the radiotracer) with iv citalopram (40 mg) as compared to iv saline by [18F]fallypride PET scanning; 2) To determine whether iv citalopram (40 mg) affects measures of cue-induced craving for alcohol compared to a blinded saline iv control infusion; and 3) to assess whether changes in striatal D2/3 receptor availability with iv citalopram (40 mg, compared to iv saline control) are related to measures of craving for alcohol among subjects.  Description of Intervention(s)/Treatment(s): Interested participants will be recruited through phone screening. Qualified participants will be invited to participate in a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI scan) for PET scan registration purposes, and two day-long experimental sessions at WLAVA, where they will undergo infusions with iv citalopram (40 mg and saline, double blinded). After each infusion, participants will undergo assessment of measures of mood and both baseline and cue- induced craving for alcohol. Subsequently, participants will undergo [18F]fallypride PET scanning (~90 min) to assess striatal D2/3 receptor availability. After completion of both infusions and PET scans, participants will be discharged from the study."
"9173421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder constitutes a substantial proportion of the burden of illness among veterans. However, current PTSD treatments are not effective for all, and a significant number remain symptomatic despite pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. As a result, there has been increased interest within the military and VA in Complementary and Alternative Medicine approaches, such as yoga, to improve symptoms without requiring direct verbal processing of the trauma. Yoga provides an innovative approach to calming hyperarousal, reducing numbness/avoidance, and improving self-regulation of emotions, while cultivating physical and emotional well-being. Because of this unique approach to the biological, psychological, and social dimensions of PTSD, we believe that yoga interventions are poised to meet the demand for more effective PTSD treatment options for veterans. Recent research indicates that yoga interventions can be delivered successfully to individuals who have PTSD and have potential to reduce clinician rated and self-reported overall PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety. However, few studies exist that have evaluated yoga for PTSD and they have involved small sample sizes and are either uncontrolled or waitlist/usual care controlled. Also, there is much variation among studies in the style and components of yoga interventions. Thus, a randomized controlled trial of a standardized, traditional, holistic yoga intervention is urgently needed to inform VA policy makers and clinicians of the potential benefits of yoga as an adjunct to currently available PTSD treatments. OBJECTIVE: The overall goal of this project is to compare the effects of a 16-week Holistic Yoga Program (HYP) with a 16-week Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP) on PTSD and related symptoms and outcomes. This project has three specific aims: 1) to compare the effects of the interventions (HYP vs. WLP) on overall PTSD symptom severity; 2) compare the interventions' effects on PTSD-specific symptoms (anger, sleep), PTSD-related symptoms (depression, anxiety, pain) and related outcomes (well-being/quality of life); 3) to manualize the Holistic Yoga Program and training process for experienced yoga teachers to deliver HYP to individuals who have PTSD in order to facilitate future study and dissemination efforts. METHODS: Our study sample will include 232 outpatients with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of PTSD, recruited from the Roudebush VA Medical Center as well as metropolitan area mental health clinics/clinicians and military/veterans' organizations, who will be randomly assigned to receive the Holistic Yoga Program (HYP) or the Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP). The HYP will involve a standardized 16-week intervention consisting of: 1) in-person group yoga class taught by a yoga instructor registered through the Yoga Alliance at least at the 200 hour level; 2) classes will include yoga postures, breathing practices, deep muscle contraction practices, relaxation practices, and teacher-led discussions to exchange lessons learned, and introduce relevant aspects of yoga philosophy; 3) guided yoga postures, breath and relaxation practice audio recordings for home-use; and 4) a Participant Handbook to reinforce concepts taught during in-person sessions. The WLP is an attention control comprised of low intensity physical activity and didactics about wellness topics that will also encourage home practice and provide a Participant Handbook to reinforce concepts taught during in- person sessions."
"9174041","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A primary impairment associated with post-stroke hemiparesis is the failure to make rapid graded adjustment of muscle force (i.e. muscle power) within the context of purposeful complex synergies (e.g., coordination during walking). Not surprisingly, the impact of stroke on walking is significant, with less than 50% of survivors progressing to independent community ambulation. Even among those who achieve independent ambulation, significant residual deficits persist in balance and gait speed, with ~75% of persons post-stroke reporting limitations in mobility related to walking. Muscle weakness is the most prominent motor consequence among the nearly 6 million survivors of stroke living in the United States and the strongest predictor of functional disability in this large clinical cohort. To date, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to muscle dysfunction in hemiparetic subjects are largely unstudied. Moreover, evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions aimed at attenuating impaired muscle function and the ensuing functional consequences in the post-stroke population is equivocal and viable therapeutic options to remediate hemiparetic muscle weakness remain among the most pressing challenges for biomedical research. We propose that impaired muscle power (the product of muscle strength and velocity) generation is causal of functional (walking) disability post-stroke. In addition, coordination deficits are also critical determinants of functional performance. We have developed a comprehensive theoretical framework that defines and measures the factors underlying disordered muscle function and coordination and will apply this framework to Post-stroke Optimization of Walking using Explosive Resistance (POWER) training. Our goals over the four year funding period are to 1) quantify neural and muscular adaptations that contribute to impaired muscle power generation post-stroke; 2) assess effects of POWER training on neural and muscular adaptations in paretic and non-paretic muscle; and 3) determine the relationship between changes in neural and muscular adaptations following POWER training and locomotor improvements. Innovative aspects of the proposed work include the novel training intervention; the advanced magnetic resonance assessments; as well as the unique measure of the coordination that we propose. It is our belief that: a) neural and muscular adaptations following stroke are associated with impaired muscle power generation as well as locomotor ability, b) POWER training attenuates functional deficits by addressing the underlying neural and muscular elements and c) functional improvements following training are predicated on improving the most prominent neural and muscular contributors to muscle power generation. If correct, the data generated will provide an entirely new level of evidence regarding the effectiveness of this novel intervention strategy on improving functional performance as well as the importance of peripheral muscle properties as predictors of locomotor ability post-stroke."

"9237777","Project Summary/Abstract Using the pneumococcus as a model, our lab has revealed many features of the biochemical basis of the inflammatory response to bacteria in the brain. How the pneumococcus traffics across the blood brain barrier is shared by other meningeal pathogens. We determined how neurons die by apoptosis during infection and revealed the role of cell wall/TLR2 in host damage. The important discovery of this application is the opening of a new area of pathogenesis at the maternal/fetal interface that will inform new aspects of cell wall/TLR2 effects in the brain. We have determined that cell wall, a universal pathogen associated molecular pattern, circulates in the bloodstream of pregnant mice and traverses the placenta to the fetal brain. The response of fetal neurons is not the well characterized inflammation and neuronal death of the postnatal setting but the exact opposite: neuroproliferation without inflammation. This response involves two new activities of cell wall: 1) induction of cell proliferation without inflammatory signaling via TLR2, and 2) remodeling of embryonic brain anatomy and changes in postnatal behavior. An understanding of the details of this new biology, to be investigated in this application, represents both novel bacterial pathogenesis and an avenue of high potential for tangible medical impact.  We propose in Aim 1 to undertake detailed neuroanatomical assessment of the changes in brain architecture and define the window of neuroproliferation in embryogenesis. In Aim 2 we will characterize the signaling cascades initiated by cell wall to induce neuroproliferation, including via TLR2 and novel sources of PI3 kinase and induction of the neuronal transcription factor FoxG1. This will link innate immune receptors to nuclear transcription factors for the first time. Aim 3 will determine how cell wall released during the treatment of maternal sepsis recapitulates the neuroproliferation seen in the model of prenatal IV cell wall exposure of the mother. We will define the consequences to postnatal behavior of prenatal neuroproliferation."
"9085129","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      A common procedure to restore lateral pinch strength to persons with C5/6 tetraplegia is to transfer the distal tendon of the brachioradialis muscle to the tendon of the paralyzed flexor pollicis longus muscle (Br to FPL). Conventional post-surgical care is not well defined and some individuals are discharged before receiving a directed therapy program due to limitations in hospital stay. After surgery, the transferred Br is not fully activated to perform pinch tasks. Undoubtedly, this is one factor that leads to a range of functional outcomes, despite a successful surgery, that may be addressed by a focused re-training program. The mechanism(s) underlying successful re-training of the transferred muscle to perform a new task are unknown and may involve both motor and neural adaptation. Recent evidence suggests that task-based therapy can result in improved upper limb function by strengthening the existing neural connections and/or forming new ones. The proposed study will assess the neural response to a task-based therapy program for muscle re-education for Br to FPL tendon transfer recipients. This proposed pilot project is a critical step towards the broader objective to improve  functional outcomes of tendon transfer procedures in tetraplegia. The purpose of the study is to obtain pilot data consisting of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional performance measures to evaluate neural predictors and correlates of successful muscle re- education after tendon transfer. The participants will have chronic cervical SCI and have received a tendon transfer or meet the surgical criteria for transfer surgery. Patterns of neural activity from Br to FPL transfer recipients will be assessed (i) in those with poor versus good outcomes and (ii) before and after participating in the task-based therapy program designed to improve voluntary activation of the transferred Br in functional pinch tasks. Functional performance measures include quantitative electromyographic (EMG) measures of voluntary activation of the transferred Br, maximum effort pinch force in selected functional tasks, and a self- reported performance measure. The specific objectives are to: evaluate muscle re-education after Br to FPL transfer in individuals with good and poor outcomes, and to determine if the pattern of neural activity after the training program is comparable to those individuals wit higher pinch force measurements. The task-based training program is part of an ongoing study to improve Br to FPL surgical outcomes and preliminary results indicate positive changes in pinch force production and activation of the transferred Br in coordination with proximal muscles during functional tasks. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have become important tools for understanding plasticity in the neuromuscular system and for assessing the neural changes in response to novel interventions. We propose that a directed task-based training program after Br to FPL transfer will drive neural changes that impact functional (pinch) ability. Establishing this relationship will allow for increased understanding of the mechanisms of successful interventions in patients and will suggest brain based dynamics that could be the focus of future treatments, such as biofeedback or brain stimulation. A more effective post-surgical rehabilitation program will lead to improved long-term functional outcomes following tendon-transfer in patients with both acute and chronic spinal cord injuries. These data will be used towards a broader study design for a prospective investigation of the effects of a focused rehabilitation intervention. Information gained from the proposed pilot  study will be used to develop hypotheses and statistical power to guide a full-scale study to evaluate the capacity for improving surgical outcomes through task-based training."

"9121639","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to use new advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technology to elucidate the structures of, at high-resolution, a range of functional states of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) ion channels, and to use complementary functional and biochemical assays to validate our findings and hypotheses driven by our solved cryo-EM models. iGluRs are responsible for the majority of excitatory neurotransmission, and are implicated in a wide range of pathologies, from neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, to epilepsy and stroke-induced trauma. Current design of therapeutics targeting the range of iGluR functional states that dictate these different disease states is hindered by a lack of information describing iGluRs outside of a closed-channel state. This research will directly address the need for new views into these functional states by using cryo-EM based methods, which will allow crystallographic barriers in analyzing iGluR states to be overcome. Using state-of-the-art cryo-EM techniques, high-resolution cryo-EM of iGluRs will be established. With fluorescence-based construct screening strategies, new targets for isolating separate structural states in iGluR function will be identified. Namely, how auxiliary proteins interact with/regulate iGluRs and iGluR gating will be targeted. After cryo-EM analysis, data will be probed using advanced electrophysiological techniques and biochemical interrogation. The methods used in this project will serve as a foundation for investigating functional states across ion channel families, and may provide a much-needed template for structure-based drug design of new molecules targeting iGluR states."
"9270983","Project Summary Many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) recognize structurally discrete sites on the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), such as the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), the strand C of variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), the N332 supersite at the base of variable region 3 (V3), and the membrane- proximal external region (MPER). Crystallography and electron microscopy (EM) have revealed how these bNAbs interact with individual epitopes, engineered Env domains, and gp140 trimers, providing a rational basis for vaccine design. The scaffolding method has been used to design novel antigens in hope to elicit epitope- specific, bNAb-like B cell responses. In this R01 application, we will combine the latest structural findings with novel technologies in protein design, B cell engineering and knock-in mouse, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of B cell repertoire to develop and assess epitope-focused vaccine candidates for three bNAb epitopes. The specific aims (SAs) of our R01 proposal are: (1) to design epitope-focused immunogens for three sites of HIV-1 vulnerability. We hypothesize that the N332 supersite of V3 base, the trimeric V1V2 apex, and MPER can be presented by scaffolds and nanoparticles in their bNAb-bound conformations. In a preliminary study, we have designed a panel of antigens based on various principles such as epitope scaffolding, particulate display, and Fc presentation. We have performed structural and antigenic profiling for a subset of antigens with positive results, and will screen the whole panel of antigens to facilitate rational selection; (2) to assess epitope-focused immunogens in bNAb-presenting B cell lines and knock-in mice. We hypothesize that successfully designed epitope-focused immunogens can activate engineered bNAb-expressing B cells and elicit robust responses in bNAb knock-in mice. Previously, we have developed mouse B cell lines expressing CD4bs-, V1V2- and N332- specific bNAbs and b12 knock-in mouse, which were used to assess rationally designed HIV-1 immunogens. We will develop PGT145-, PGT121/128-, and 10E8-expressing B cell lines and knock-in mice and use these tools to assess epitope-focused immunogens selected in Aim 1; (3) to assess the trimer-prime/epitope-boost strategy and B cell responses in NHPs. We hypothesize that a gp140 trimer will elicit NAbs to diverse epitopes and sequential boosts with epitope-focused immunogens will direct B cell responses to the target epitopes. In our preliminary study, we have tested the epitope-focusing effect and neutralization for selected N332 antigens in C57BL/6 mice. Previously, we have conducted a longitudinal study of B cell responses to an HIV-1 gp140- foldon trimer in non-human primates (NHPs). Here, we will first test the trimer-prime/epitope-boost strategy in mice for different epitopes and then assess the immunogenicity and B cell responses in NHPs. In addition to serological assays, we will use antibody NGS to monitor the temporal B cell responses. Our proposed studies thus constitute an innovative and practical research project to develop epitope-focused HIV-1 vaccines."

"9182891","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type I interferon (IFN) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and increased expression of IFN-? inducible genes are argued to be central to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The type I IFN gene signature is associated with more severe disease in SLE and several other systemic and organ- specific autoimmune diseases. This suggests that there are significant disease subgroups in which less severe disease may be due to type I IFN independent mechanisms. The scarcity of experimental data on the mechanisms of type I IFN independent autoimmunity is a significant barrier to our understanding of the totality of the autoimmune disease process and its treatment. Our studies of the systemic autoimmunity resulting from exposure to mercury reveal the mild disease in this model to be independent of type I IFN. Mercury exposure in humans also results in a mild expression of systemic autoimmunity. Less fulminant systemic disease has also been observed with other xenobiotics and drugs. Thus mercury-induced autoimmunity may offer a suitable animal model to study type I IFN independent autoimmunity, the mechanisms of which may be applicable to multiple environmental agents. Based on our preliminary studies we hypothesize that in type I IFN independent autoimmunity innate immune responses are mediated by endosomal TLRs via NF-?B activation leading to proinflammatory cytokine production and NF-?B dependent synergy with IFN-? resulting in enhanced expression of IFN-? induced genes. We propose to address this hypothesis in four specific aims:- Aim 1) Are dendritic cells (DCs) essential for type I IFN independent autoimmunity?, Aim 2) Do endosomal Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathways mediate type I IFN-independent autoimmunity?, Aim 3) Is proinflammatory cytokine expression in type I IFN independent autoimmunity regulated by NF-?B?, and Aim 4) Is proinflammatory IL-1? required for IFN-? dependence of type I IFN independent autoimmunity? Answers to these questions will provide insight into the multiplicity of pathogenic pathways leading to systemic autoimmunity and broaden the conceptual foundation upon which autoimmune disease research is based."

The candidate has completed research and clinical fellowships that prepared her for an academic career studying perinatal social epidemiology and is currently a full-time faculty member in the Department of Neonatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The candidate is a core member of the Division of Newborn Medicine at Harvard Medical School serving as an Instructor in pediatrics, which is the standard entry level academic position at Harvard. This K23 award will provide her with the structure and support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) assess the role that arsenic plays in fetal growth; (2) assess the role arsenic plays in the DNA methylation of genes involved in fetal growth such as inflammatory cytokine genes and the glucocorticoid receptor gene, and explore whether arsenic affects fetal growth through such epigenetic mechanisms; (3) gain expertise in environmental toxicology and environmental epigenetic analyses; and (4) learn the administrative skills needed to manage a large cohort study so that transition to an independent research career running her own birth cohort is accomplished. The candidate's goal is to examine the role the toxic chemical environment plays in birth outcome disparities in the US. To achieve these goals, Dr. Burris has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Robert Wright, MD MPH, Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Environmental Health who is an expert in pediatric environmental health and toxicology, and co-mentor Andrea Baccarelli, MD PhD, the Mark and Catherine Winkler Associate Professor of Environmental Epigenetics, who has expertise in epigenetic analyses. Although chemicals like arsenic are known to affect birth outcomes and known to affect DNA methylation, it remains unknown whether DNA methylation mediates arsenic-birth weight associations. The study proposed is designed to test the hypothesis that arsenic impairs fetal growth, that arsenic causes alterations in the DNA methylation of inflammatory cytokine genes and the glucocorticoid receptor gene. The candidate will explore whether DNA methylation disturbances mediate arsenic-birth weight associations. These analyses will be performed within a previously established, currently funded cohort in Mexico City (ELEMENT) directed by Dr. Wright. The candidate will use the abundant resources available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Harvard Catalyst (Clinical and Translational Science Center) and the Harvard School of Public Health to obtain the training and coursework necessary to supplement the practical training attained through these analyses to become an independent investigator with a research program studying the environmental impact on birth outcome disparities."
"9173431","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral inhibition/social reticence (BI/RET) is one of the most stable dispositional characteristics reported in childhood. Early BI/RET is often reinforced and exacerbated by children's reciprocal interactions with parents across development. Importantly, stable BI/RET places young children at subsequent risk for diagnosable anxiety disorders (namely, social phobia) during adolescence and adulthood and this risk is moderated by (a) overly directive/controlling parenting and (b) the child' lack of socal and emotion-regulation skills. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct and evaluate a full-scale, randomized controlled trial during which we will randomly assign 150 45-60 month old children and their parents to either the Turtle Program (combined adapted Parent Child Interaction Therapy and Social Skills Facilitated Play (PCIT and SSFP) or to a less intensive, 6-session parent psychoeducation group, the best available treatment for preschool BI. The Turtle Program components highlight the development of skills to intervene in the reciprocal cycle of parent-child and peer interactions that contribute to the development of anxiety. Importantly, the group- based nature of SSFP provides a social context in which parents can practice behavioral skills with their child while being coached by the therapists. This trial will examine mediators an moderators of treatment response. Outcome measures (collected at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year follow-up) will include parent and teacher ratings/questionnaires of child anxiety symptoms/disorders, temperament, and social functioning; observational measures of parenting and children's social behaviors in the classroom; and heart rate physiology (a biological index of emotional reactivity and regulation)."
"9050918","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is the period in which individuals are most likely to initiate the consumption of drugs of abuse. The onset of drug use during adolescence, however, also confers the highest risk of progressing from recreational use to addiction. This suggests that drug exposure during the critical window of adolescence may interfere with ongoing neuronal development and cause behavioral changes which facilitate subsequent substance abuse and addiction. However, there is still a significant lack of knowledge about the mechanisms accounting for these age-dependent effects of drug exposure. To address this gap in our knowledge, it is important to understand (1) the mechanism underlying the interaction between drugs of abuse and the adolescent brain, (2) how these interactions disrupt the development of neuronal circuitry, and (3) the resulting long-lasting changes in addiction-relevant behaviors. The guidance cue receptor DCC has recently emerged as a key molecular player in the adolescent organization of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, and expression of DCC is regulated by adolescent exposure to drugs of abuse. Exposure to the stimulant drug of abuse, amphetamine, during early adolescence disrupts the development of dopamine input to the medial prefrontal cortex of mice via alterations to DCC signaling. The long-term goal of the studies proposed here is to determine if amphetamine in adolescence reroutes dopamine axons to the medial prefrontal cortex from limbic regions by disrupting DCC-mediated guidance events, and identify the enduring consequences on prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive behavior. These neurobiological and behavioral alterations may underlie heightened vulnerability to progress to addiction in individuals that initiate drug use in adolescence. The experiments will employ neuroanatomical, gene transfection, and behavioral techniques in a mouse model to assess three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether amphetamine in adolescence increases prefrontal cortex dopamine innervation by promoting the rerouting of mesolimbic dopamine axons during adolescence. Aim 2 will assess whether DCC signaling is the molecular mechanism by which amphetamine in adolescence reroutes mesolimbic dopamine axons to the prefrontal cortex. Aim 3 will determine the role of DCC in mediating the long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent mesocorticolimbic dopamine reorganization.  The results of the proposed research will move the field toward a clearer understanding of the mechanisms accounting for the age-dependent effects of drug exposure on addiction vulnerability. These results could be used to facilitate development of individualized prevention and treatment strategies aimed at adolescent drug users, who are at heightened risk to progress to addiction."
"9176010","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This proposal describes experiments designed to understand the mechanisms involved in the control of recovery from bacterial infections. To recover from an infection and return to homeostasis, the host must activate mechanisms capable of controlling the damage caused by pathogen virulence factors, inflammation, and a potentially toxic antibiotic exposure. Failure to properly recover from infections manifests in the form of recurrent infections, inappropriate wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders. The mechanisms involved in pathogen recognition and immune activation have been very well studied, but the cellular and systemic responses involved in recovery after an infection is cleared are not well defined. We have established a Caenorhabditis elegans model of acute infection and antibiotic treatment for studying biological changes during the resolution phase of an infection. We found that genes that are markers of innate immunity are downregulated upon recovery, while genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, redox regulation, and cellular homeostasis are upregulated. Using gene expression profiling, in silico analysis, and reverse genetic approaches, we have linked to the control of recovery from infection to the function of conserved transcription factors, including th GATA transcription factor ELT-2, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, and the Nrf transcription factor SKN-1. The proposed experiments will explore the general hypothesis that neural GPCRs and cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act on non-neural tissues to regulate recovery from infection at the organismal level. Given the conserved nature of GPCR-mediated signaling and the conservation of the transcription factors involved in the control of recovery, the proposed studies should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms used by metazoans to control recovery from bacterial infection at the whole animal level."
"9173286","Project Summary/Abstract We present a substantially revised application in response to our reviewers' concerns. Major issues that were addressed include: (a) description and steps to accomplish planning activities; (b) standardization of rehabilitation treatments; (c) measurement of compliance and content of rehabilitation; (d) rehabilitation expertise of our team and ensuring a balance of surgical and non-surgical investigators; (e) outcome measures selection and follow-up duration; (f) assessment of willingness of patients to participate in a randomized trial; (g) sample size justification, and; (h) statistical analyses. Shoulder symptoms accounted for 11.5 million ambulatory care visits in 2010 in the United States. Rotator cuff tears are one of the leading causes of shoulder pain and disability, and accounted for an estimated 272,148 ambulatory surgeries in 2006. Despite the substantial public health and economic impact of rotator cuff tears and their treatments, there is lack of evidence on a head-to-head comparison of surgery versus non-operative treatment. The urgent need for research in this area and a well-designed randomized controlled clinical trial is highlighted by multiple authoritative agencies including the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and in Cochrane reviews. Our multi-disciplinary team is in a unique position to conduct a randomized controlled trial of operative versus non-operative treatments for atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients' ?50 years of age. We propose recruitment from six (6) high volume sites that form part of a large multi-center consortium called the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON). Using this infrastructure, we propose to recruit 400 patients with atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears and randomize them to either operative or non- operative treatments with the goal to compare pain and function in these two groups at one (1) year follow-up. We will also study effect modification by rotator cuff tear size and patient age. Prior to conducting such a large scale randomized trial, the U34 grant would provide us the needed funding to: (a) Draft a manual of operations and procedures (MOOP); (b) Finalize study questionnaires and forms; (c) Finalize operative and non-operative intervention standards of care; (d) Set up physical therapist referral database by zip code; (e) Obtain IRB approval from all trial sites; (f) Set up and test REDCap database for secure data storage and online randomization; (g) Train all site personnel to standardize recruitment, study procedures, and data collection, and; (h) Set up a data and safety monitoring board. During the U34, we will perform a pilot study to assess homogeneity and compliance with rehabilitation protocols, and validate patient self-report of rehabilitation frequency and compliance with clinical records. We will assess willingness of patients to participate in a randomized trial of operative versus non-operative treatment for rotator cuff tears. Thus, the U34 is critical to accomplish the subsequent randomized clinical trial."
"9270749","Project Summary/Abstract HIV initially assembles as a non-infectious, immature particle that must undergo a maturation process to become infectious. Assembly and maturation involve large-scale rearrangements of the viral capsid. These large-scale rearrangements, in turn, are associated with programmed local conformational changes in capsid protein segments termed molecular switches. In these studies, we will use structural, biophysical, and other complementary approaches to understand the structure of the immature HIV-1 capsid and how a molecular switch spanning the CA-SP1 region of the HIV-1 Gag protein controls immature virus assembly and maturation. We propose to: (1) Test the hypothesis that the CA-SP1 junction folds into a 6-helix bundle that undergoes reversible and cooperative unfolding and folding within immature virions to regulate access of the viral protease during maturation. We will also determine how small molecule maturation inhibitors like bevirimat disrupt this process by binding and stabilizing the 6-helix bundle. We will also initiate experiments to understand how Gag-Gag interactions change during the early stages of maturation. (2) Elucidate the detailed molecular organization of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. In particular, we will determine the high resolution details of how the outermost set of Gag-Gag interactions (mediated by the CA-NTD domain) are organized within the immature particle. We will also test the hypotheses that interactions between the CA-NTD layer and the underlying CA-CTD layer are important for proper assembly and may be part of a structural network that links two molecular switches that flank the CA region. Finally, we will also analyze the immature Gag lattices of other retroviruses, in order to elucidate the general nature of switch-mediated Gag assembly. If successful, these studies will lead to a thorough understanding of the immature capsid structure of retroviruses, how local conformational transitions translate into large-scale capsid rearragenements during retroviral assembly and maturation, and how small molecule inhibitors may be deployed to disrupt capsid rearrangement."
"9181404","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COPD is a leading cause of death in the US and worldwide and patients suffer high morbidity. A better understanding of contributing factors to the progression and burden of this pervasive disease is critical. Despite population-based epidemiological evidence suggesting exposure to ambient air pollutants causes increased hospitalizations and mortality from COPD, there is very little known about the impact of exposure to air pollutants on the progression of disease. For example, the extent to which exposure to air pollution accelerates lung function loss and contributes to patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and dyspnea in COPD remains largely unknown. SPIROMICS is a unique NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of COPD phenotypes and markers of disease which plans to enroll 3,200 subjects at seven sites across the US. A subgroup of participants will also record daily symptoms over one year. We propose to add state-of-the art air pollution exposure assessment to determine individual-level outdoor and indoor air pollution exposure for all SPIROMICS participants, providing an extraordinary opportunity to understand effects of air pollutants on COPD morbidity and progression. For Specific Aim 1a, we aim to determine the impact of long-term outdoor air pollution exposure on COPD morbidity, including lung function decline, patient reported outcomes, and exacerbations by employing sophisticated spatio-temporal air pollution prediction models, supplemented with cohort-specific outdoor monitoring data, to precisely predict participants' ambient exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), light absorbing or black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2)) and link with existing health outcomes collected as part of the SPIROMICS study. For Specific Aim 1b, we aim to determine the effect of indoor air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, NOx, SO2, O3, BC and secondhand smoke) on COPD morbidity by conducting indoor air monitoring in a subset of participants' residences. These data will be combined with validated questionnaire data collected on the entire cohort to model indoor exposure for all participants. Personal monitoring will be used to assess measurement error. For Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether short-term changes in outdoor air pollution are associated with day-to-day changes in symptoms and exacerbation risk in 300 subjects recording daily symptoms over a one- year period. For Specific Aim 3 we will examine airway macrophage black carbon content from induced sputum as a biomarker of air pollution (PM2.5 and BC) and determine its association with clinical and subclinical measures of disease severity and prognosis. Our study builds on an established network of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. Findings from this study can provide information to guide public policy and clinical management for individuals with COPD."
