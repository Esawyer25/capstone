"9248451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to provide a framework to understand how a simple, innate behavior emerges from the activity of the nervous system. For this, we will apply a battery of molecular genetics techniques and imaging technologies to study the circuit mechanisms underlying temperature preference in Drosophila -a system ideally suited for a comprehensive genetic and molecular dissection of neural circuits and behaviors. We have recently shown that temperature is represented by a map of activity created by sensory afferents at the first relay station in the fly brain. We now propose to study how this map is processed by central neural circuits and transformed into directed behavior. To accomplish our overall objectives, we will use a combination of targeted photo-activation of GFP, GRASP, ChR2-mediated circuit mapping and genetic expression of effector molecules to: 1) Identify ascending neuronal populations receiving temperature information and representing it to higher brain centers. 2) Study their tuning and properties, and narrow our search to the key pathways that mediate temperature navigation and preference. 3) Determine their connectivity to higher brain centers, study the transformation of stimuli at each station in the circuit and eventually track the descending pathways that control behavior. This work is expected to contribute to our general understanding of the wiring logic of the neural circuits that control innate behavior in animals, and potentially provide insights on how genetic conditions which affect wiring can result in compromised circuit function and altered behavior."
"9441330","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the beginning of the epidemic ~30 years ago, almost 60 million people have been infected with HIV and 25 million have died of HIV-related causes. According to UNAIDS and WHO, ~33 million people are currently living with HIV, close to 3 million new infections have been diagnosed and 2 million deaths have been attributed to AIDS-related causes since 2008, including ~500,000 children born with HIV. Although important progress has been made in preventing new HIV infections and prolonging the lives of HIV+ individuals with antiretroviral therapy, the numbers of people infected and living with HIV continues to increase in different geographic areas and among new demographics. The opportunity to avert or change the course of HIV-1 infection and subsequent development of AIDS exists. New technological approaches to scientific research abound in the environment provided by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and its Harvard Medical School affiliated institutions where important new vaccine strategies are currently in development in AIDS research and AIDS-related disorders. The design of effective vaccines and drugs is evolving rapidly. However, a detailed understanding of the HIV-1 virus and how it interacts with the human immune system is essential. A critical component of this effort is the training of young investigators to be well-versed in both basic and clinical sciences, who will dedicate themselves to these objectives long-term. Our mission is to train basic and clinical scientists capable of conducting independent high-quality research using the diverse disciplines of immunology, cell biology and virology.  Long-term scientific training programs are critical to this effort to limit he consequences of HIV-1 infection, curtail the epidemic through prophylaxis of HIV-1 transmission and halt the progress of this disease with a broad-spectrum vaccine. These primary considerations led to the development of this training program in 1990, which is directed by Harvey Cantor and supported by a renowned group of faculty mentors comprised of leading investigators in diverse fields. Through its affiliation with the Harvard Medical School, the Training Program is further enhanced by its affiliation with the Harvard CFAR and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. In this application, we describe the progress and achievements of this program during its tenure and outline objectives for its continuation over the next five years."
"9286699","GABA and glutamate are the main inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain. Activity-dependent redistribution of glutamate receptors contributes to excitatory long-term synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. A similar redistribution of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) has been shown to occur in neuronal culture, but the functional significance of this process in intact brain circuits remains unclear. Our goal is to better understand the role that GABAA receptors play in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory. We have developed photoswitch chemicals that allow light to reversibly block GABAA receptors with high spatial and temporal precision and absolute specificity for a specified mutant ?-subunit. Here we focus on receptors containing either the broadly- expressed ?1-subunit, or the hippocampus-enriched ?5-subunit. To enable photo-control of endogenous receptors, we have developed knock-in mice with photoswitch-ready version of ?1 or ?5 replacing their wild-type counterparts. Using these mice and novel intrabody probes that light-up or disrupt GABAARs scaffolds, we will evaluate where ?1- and ?5-GABAARs are in neurons, how they contribute to synaptic function, and what role they play in synaptic plasticity. Aim 1 is to map the distribution of the two GABAA types in hippocampal neurons. This includes determining whether they are expressed in proximal to distal dendritic gradients, determining whether they are aggregated at synapses or dispersed extrasynapatically, and determining their individual contributions to inhibitory synaptic transmission from different identified inhibitory interneurons. Aim 2 is to investigate how neuronal activity alters the distribution of GABAARs. This includes using the photoswitch as a stable tag to evaluate whether activity alters the lifespan and lateral mobility of the receptors on the plasma membrane. Aim 3 is to investigate how GABAARs alter excitatory long-term synaptic plasticity. This includes investigating the impact of the GABAARs on induction of long-term potentiation and depression and NMDA receptor signaling. The knowledge gained from this work will fill a gaping hole in our understanding of brain function and may reveal new treatment strategies for memory disorders and other neurological diseases. !"
"9310918","ABSTRACT Starr County is a poor Texas-Mexico border community that is 98% Mexican American and has the highest diabetes-related death rate in Texas. In previous Starr County studies, we tested interventions culturally tailored for Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Each study participant was supported by a family member who also received program benefits; 70% of these supporters did not have diabetes. Compared to the control group, fewer non-diabetic supporters in the experimental group converted to diabetes by 12 months post study entry. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of our culturally tailored DSME intervention that will be adapted for preventing, or at least delaying, diabetes onset in Mexican Americans with prediabetes. The intervention will involve: 1) 12 2- hour weekly group educational sessions that emphasize eating and preparing healthy Mexican-American foods and increasing physical activity; 2) 15 2-hour bi-weekly/monthly support group sessions on problem solving the barriers to adopting healthier lifestyles; and 3) 3 booster sessions held at 6-month intervals. We will integrate aspects of the Diabetes Prevention Program, as well as motivational interviewing, and prior to intervention testing, we will conduct focus groups with key individuals in Starr County to confirm the strategy and obtain community support. Intervention effectiveness will be examined using a randomized, repeated measures, pretest/posttest control group design, with an ?enhanced? usual care control group. We will enroll 300 Mexican Americans with verified prediabetes from rosters of ongoing Starr County genetic studies. Groups of 10 will be constituted according to the area of the county in which people live; each group will be randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Growth curve analysis, using multilevel models, will be used to compare intervention effects on health outcomes over time. We hypothesize that participants in the experimental group, compared to the control group, will have better health outcomes (A1C, FBG, lipids, BP, physical activity, dietary intake, and anthropometric variables [BMI, waist circumference]) at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline, as well as lower rates of converting to T2DM (OGTT) by 36 months. This study is a significant step in our plan to develop effective culturally tailored health programs for populations at high risk for T2DM."
"9275974","The Epidemiology and Genetics (E&G) Core provides a central focus to translate the findings from clinical and cellular studies to applications in ongoing epidemiologic studies. The Core fosters new epidemiologic initiatives that draw on the clinical and biologic developments from other components of the BNORC. Further, the Core provides a center for training and development of expertise among statisticians who provide consultation to other studies within the BNORC. In contrast with other cores, the E&G Core provides most of its services through consultation and analysis of data sets. It provides consultation on study design, on the analytic approaches to data from clinical trials and epidemiologic and genetic studies, and the presentation of results.  To provide these services, the core conducts a regular working group in obesity research where data plans, preliminary analyses, and research results are presented. Core faculty also meets one-on-one with researchers. Programming support is also provided to studies lacking the necessary expertise.    In the last competing renewal, we expanded the core services to include genetic epidemiology and statistical analysis of obesity and related phenotypes. These services have contributed to the discovery of genetic variants for the common form of obesity through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To date, more than 50 genetic loci have been convincingly associated with obesity. These discoveries have substantially enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of energy balance and obesity and have provided potential new targets for obesity prevention and treatment. However, these loci confer only a modest effect  size and do not add to the clinical prediction of obesity. There is increasing evidence that epigenetic regulation of gene expression may contribute to an individual's predisposition to obesity and its related chronic diseases and may also explain part of the 'missing heritability'.  In particular, fetal undernutrition has been associated  with increased risk of obesity and diabetes and these effects are likely to be mediated by DNA methylation due  to intrauterine or earty childhood exposures rather than changes in genotypes. To address this challenge, we  propose in this renewal application to expand the core's services by expanding the pool of longitudinal  datasets available and the core faculty expertise (Dr. Chavarro -nutntion and reproductive epidemiology- and  Dr. Baccarelli -epigenetics) in order to facilitate research aimed at identifying epigenetic contnbutions to the  developmental ongins of obesity and its related phenotypes.  The E&G Core builds on the large cohorts of men and women that have been established to relate lifestyle  factors, including diet, anthropometric characteristics, and exercise, to the incidence of major illnesses and  subsequent mortality. These cohorts include the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Nurses'  Health Study (NHS), the NHS II, and the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a cohort of adolescents and young  adults (based at Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women's Hospital). New cohorts that will  be made available through the BNORC include the NHS 3 and the nutritional component of the EARTH Study  (based at MGH). Additional cohort studies that are available to core members include the Framingham Heart  Study (based at Boston University), the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (based at Tufts University and  Northeastern University), and the Black Women's Health Study (based at Boston University). The  investigators have developed analytic and data management software to facilitate the analysis of large  volumes of information in a cost-effective manner. In addition, these cohort studies have collected more than  200,000 plasma and 300,000 DNA samples for biomarker and genetic analyses."
"9187811","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the United States, diagnosed in approximately 14,500 Americans each year, and is responsible for 2% of all cancer deaths (SEER.cancer.gov). MM is an incurable malignancy of antibody-secreting plasma B-cells whose etiology is poorly understood. Chromosomal translocation t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.33) is associated with shorter overall survival and is found in 15% of MM patients. The candidate oncogene WHSC1 (MMSET) at 4p16.3 encodes a histone methyltransferase over-expressed as a result of the t(4;14) in MM cells. Surprisingly, over-expression of WHSC1 cDNA's failed to transform cell lines or to induce any phenotype when expressed in mice. We identified ACA11, an orphan box H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) encoded hosted within WHSC1 at 4p16.3, to be up-regulated in cell lines and MM patient samples harboring t(4;14). ACA11 modulates oxidative stress, contributes to MM cell growth and confers resistance to chemotherapy. ACA11 is a novel oncogenic non-coding RNA and is also expressed in other cancer types.  Mutations that cooperate with t(4;14) in myeloma initiation are unknown, but chromosome 13 deletions (Del(13)) are highly correlated with the t(4;14) in MM. Del(13) is found in 85-94% of patients with t(4;14) and associated with poor prognosis. We mapped a minimally deleted region in MM patient samples to the retinoblastoma (RB1) gene at 13q14. Our model is that ACA11 expression cooperates with RB1 loss to cause poor-prognosis MM. We propose to characterize the role of ACA11 in multiple myeloma. Specific Aim 1: Cooperation between ACA11 and the histone methyltransferase WHSC1. We hypothesize that ACA11 cooperates with MMSET protein expression in myeloma pathogenesis and that WHSC1 histone methyltransferase activity is required for cooperation. We will co-express wild-type WHSC1 or HMT-dead WHSC1 alone or with ACA11 in cell lines and mice. Specific Aim 2: Aim 2: How does ACA11 affect levels of ROS and sensitivity to chemotherapy? What domains and partners of ACA11 are required for these effects? Our data suggest that ACA11 modulates reactive oxygen species and resistance to chemotherapy in myeloma. We will determine which residues of ACA11 are required for this function. We hypothesize that ACA11 RNA binding residues will be dispensable for ACA11's oxidative stress function, but that ACA11's protein-binding domains will be critical. Specific Aim 3: ACA11-mediated malignant transformation in the context of Rb1 deletion. The long arm of chromosome 13 is deleted in 50% of all MM patients, and in 90% of patients with the t(4;14). We hypothesize that RB1 loss cooperates with the t(4;14) in myeloma pathogenesis. We will test the effects of ACA11 and WHSC1 expression on B-cell development, oxidative stress and transformation in the context of Rb1 deficiency. Lastly, we will [identify target genes of t(4;14) by RNA- sequencing patient samples.] A betting understanding of how the t(4;14) contributes to myelomagenesis has broad implications to cancer biology and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to patients with poor-prognosis MM."
"9461969","Summary Montana and neighboring Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states include a high proportion of vulnerable pediatric populations, but these populations have limited to no opportunities for inclusion in multi- site clinical trials. The IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) is being created to provide access for underserved and rural populations to state-of-the-art clinical trials and to transfer findings that will benefit the health of all children. The focus of ISPCTN trials will be varied but priority will be given to the four focus areas of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program which include: 1) upper and lower airway disease; 2) obesity; 3) pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; and 4) neurodevelopment. Through this cooperative agreement the Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site (MPCTS) will be a partner member of the ISPCTN. In coordination with the ISPCTN Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC), MPCTS will be a participating recruitment location for ISPCTN Steering Committee-approved multi-site clinical trials. To accomplish this goal the Missoula, Montana based MPCTS team will be led by a board-certified pediatric scientist-investigator and supported by a pediatric-trained Research Nurse Coordinator, a Data Manager and database support. MPCTS will also utilize a part-time nurse at each of two collaborating healthcare centers in Billings, MT and Kalispell, MT. As with the primary Missoula healthcare center, these partner healthcare centers are the specialty and subspecialty pediatric care providers for their respective regions. Collectively these locations serve as the main referral sites for pediatric specialty care in Montana as well as communities in the neighboring IDeA states of Wyoming and Idaho. MCPTS will enhance pediatric recruitment capabilities at these and other sites by leveraging existing IDeA programs in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho to engage health providers and reach out to vulnerable communities. Beginning in year two of this cooperative agreement MCPTS will participate in one or more multi-site pediatric clinical trial(s). Our evaluation plan will be conducted on a continuous basis to assess program effectiveness and to identify opportunities for continuous quality improvement to ensure that the MCPTS meets the needs of our regional pediatric populations by facilitating improved access to cutting-edge pediatric clinical research."
"9316186","Project Summary Aberrant RNA modifications, especially methylations and pseudouridinylations, have been correlated to major diseases like breast cancer, type-2 diabetes, and obesity, each of which affects millions of Americans. Despite their significance, the available tools to reliably identify, locate, and quantify RNA modifications are very limited. As a result, we only know the function of a few modifications in contrast to the more than 100 RNA modifications that have been identified. Mass spectrometry (MS) is an essential tool for studying protein modifications, where peptide fragmentation produces ?ladders? that reveal the identity and position of modifications. However, a similar approach is not yet feasible for RNA as in situ fragmentation techniques that provide satisfactory sequence coverage do not exist. One way to circumvent this issue is to perform prior chemical degradation so that well- defined mass ladders can be formed before entering the spectrometer. However, the structural uniformity of ladder sequences generated by the prerequisite RNA degradation is unsatisfactory, complicating downstream data analysis. We have spearheaded the development of a two-dimensional LC/MS-based de novo RNA sequencing tool by taking advantage of predictable regularities in LC separation of optimized RNA digests to greatly simplify the interpretation of complex MS data. This method can simultaneously sequence up to three distinct RNAs of up to 30 nucleotides, as well as identify, locate, and quantify a broad spectrum of modifications in the RNA sample. We hypothesize that this MS-based RNA sequencing method could be further optimized to become a robust, easy-to-use, and broadly-applicable de novo sequencing approach, and that such a platform would be a highly useful and innovative tool that can complement existing next-generation RNA sequencing protocols for in-depth functional study of chemical modifications carried by endogenous RNAs. In this application, we propose to (a) reduce the RNA loading amount to a minimum threshold at which de novo sequencing of endogenous RNAs becomes practicable (Aim 1), (b) develop a streamlined data analysis/sequencing generation algorithm that will enhance the robustness of our sequencing method (Aim 2), and (c) provide proof-of-concept examples of the method?s usage in de novo sequencing of endogenous RNA samples (Aim 3). The proposed work is significant because it will bring the power of MS-based laddering technology to RNA, thus providing a method comparable to analysis of peptide modifications in proteomics that can reveal the identity and position of various RNA modifications. This project is highly innovative as successful accomplishment of the proposed work will 1) allow the MS-based platform to routinely sequence cellular RNA automatically and in a de novo fashion, 2) broaden its utility across a wide range of applications from research to biotech industries, and 3) eliminate the need for complementary DNA strand synthesis and permit the establishment of a complete, unambiguous spatiotemporal and quantitative profile for a wide variety of structural modifications in RNA samples."
"9232213","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Managing challenging behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can profoundly improve quality of life for children and families. However, many families lack access to research-based treatment, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA). This study is a randomized trial comparing outcomes of treatment for ASD using either a standard Functional Analysis Plus Functional Communication Training (FA+FCT) package or a pragmatic version that offers a briefer, less time-intensive model of FA+FCT. Both types of FA+FCT are provided via telehealth in family homes to maximize generalizability to real-life settings. Providing ABA through telehealth makes an effective treatment accessible across geographic barriers so that no child is excluded based on where they live. The study also examines key family factors that influence successful outcomes. Objectives: The main objective of this study is to determine the most efficient way for families to reduce problem behavior in their children with autism. The study has 3 primary aims: (1) To assess outcomes for ABA telehealth by assigning children to either a Pragmatic FA+FCT group or to a group receiving Standard FA+FCT. Outcomes will be compared based on the percent reduction in problem behavior, communication increases, time to achieve outcomes, treatment fidelity, family acceptance of treatment, and generalization and maintenance of treatment gains. (2) The study will assess the relation of family factors to treatment efficacy and acceptability by assessing parent stress, mood, and social support in relation to outcomes. (3) Cost effectiveness will be assessed in relation to the treatment methods used and the efficiency of ABA telehealth. Methods: The study will include 102 children who are 18-83 months of age, have a confirmed ASD diagnosis, and have serious behavior problems requiring treatment. Thirty-six children will receive intervention in each of three states: Iowa, Georgia, and Texas. Study design is a randomized trial using an intent-to-treat analysis. Half of the sample will be randomized to Pragmatic FA+FCT and half to Standard FA+FCT. Treatment will be provided via telehealth using FCT, which is a function-based ABA technique in which parents are trained to be therapists under the direction of behavior consultants. Study procedures typically are completed within 6 months, and follow-up assessments occur 6 months after treatment completion. Data analyses include comparisons between assessment groups, single-case designs examining responses in individual children, cost analyses, and regression analyses of the effects of family factors on outcomes. Impact: Our prior research shows that problem behavior can be reduced by over 90% in most children with ASD after 4-6 months of telehealth treatment. If Pragmatic FA+FCT can reduce problem behavior at rates comparable to Standard FA+FCT, then treatment can be started sooner and families can achieve successful outcomes at lower cost. Although pragmatic FA+FCT provides less behavioral information, it may be more resistant to treatment relapse because it does not involve reinforcing high rates of problem behavior."
"9243186","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request five years of continued support for the longitudinal study of cognitively normal persons with two, one, or no copies of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ¿4 allele, the major late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility gene. This study utilizes an extensive battery of brain imaging, fluid biomarker, cognitive, and other measurements. Our program includes a cohort of 35 ¿4 homozygotes, 50 ¿4 heterozygotes, and 75 ¿4 non-carriers to permit detection, tracking, and scientific study of preclinical AD in persons at three levels of risk and set the stage for the accelerated evaluation of preclinical AD treatments. It also includes a cohort of 15 ¿4 carriers and 30 ¿4 non-carriers from the Latino community to help establish the extent to which our findings are relevant to this understudied minority group. Persons in each genetic group were demographically matched and initially late middle-aged; their current age is 67 years (range 49-81). And, all participants have had genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. During the proposed funding period participants will have PET measurements of regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRgl) and fibrillar amyloid-¿ (A¿) deposition, an expanded magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) battery, serum and plasma samples drawn and stored, and an extensive battery of clinical, neuropsychological, functional, and behavioral tests every two years. At least half will have longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples drawn, stored, and assayed every two years. For nearly two decades our overriding goals have been to characterize the biomarker and cognitive measurements associated with preclinical AD and provide a foundation for the accelerated evaluation of promising prevention therapies. With the growing number of participants progressing to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to AD, we will begin to characterize the extent to which different biomarker and cognitive measurements predict subsequent rates of clinical progression. With an expanded arsenal of biomarkers and data analysis tools, we will further characterize the biological processes involved in the predisposition to AD. With our preclinical endophenotypes and complementary datasets, we will help clarify relationships between genetic risk factors and potentially dissociable elements of AD. With an expanded data and sample sharing program, we will provide an accessible worldwide resource to advance the study of preclinical AD. With this foundation of participants, samples, and longitudinal data, we will prepare for the evaluation of an A¿-modifying agent in cognitively normal APOE ¿4 carriers and help to advance a new era in AD prevention research."
"9459435","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate: I am an infectious diseases epidemiologist committed to reducing HIV incidence in resource- limited settings through combination HIV prevention. My career goal is to be an epidemiology professor with a robust combination HIV prevention research portfolio. As an epidemiologist with behavioral science exposure, I am well positioned to achieve this goal. However, to compete successfully for R01 funding, I would benefit from a brief period of mentored training and research. I have extensive experience in the design and analysis of behavioral research, but limited experience in the design and delivery of theory-driven behavioral interventions. In a two-year mentored phase, both my training and research activities will focus on cultivating skills for designing and delivering theory-driven behavioral intervention. I have assembled an exceptional team of mentors to support this goal: Dr. William C. Miller (primary mentor), Dr. Mina Hosseinipour (primary co- mentor), and Drs. Nuala McGrath, Carol Golin, and Suzanne Maman (co-mentors). All members of the team have prolific scientific accomplishments and extensive experience in the design, implementation and evaluation of combination HIV prevention approaches in sub-Saharan Africa. They are committed to supporting me and collaborating with each other. Mentored Phase Research (K99, years 1-2): In sub-Saharan Africa, strategies to increase HIV testing among men and engage them in HIV prevention, care, and treatment are urgently needed. Such engagement can have treatment benefits for HIV-infected men, prevention benefits for HIV-uninfected men, and treatment benefits for their HIV-infected female partners. Option B+, Malawi s program for providing immediate, lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to all HIV-infected pregnant women at the time of diagnosis, is a promising setting for engaging male partners in care. Within Option B+, I will develop an intervention that uses contract partner notification to recruit male partners and then engage them in a couple-based intervention with their HIV-infected female partner (Aim 1). The intervention will be guided by formative research and the dyad-level Interdependence Theory and aimed at improving linkage to care for HIV-infected male partners, preventing HIV acquisition for HIV-uninfected male partners, and promoting cART retention for HIV-infected female partners.     Independent Phase Research (R00, Years 3-5): I will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=500 couples) to assess intervention effectiveness at one year. I will assess whether the intervention increases HIV testing and linkage to care among HIV-infected male sex partners (Aim 2); identifies HIV-discordant couples, and decreases the likelihood of HIV exposure for HIV- uninfected male sex partners (Aim 3); and improves cART retention and viral suppression for all female partners (Aim 4). Future Directions: The R00 results will inform an R01 with longer-term viral suppression and HIV-incidence outcomes. I will transition from a mentored postdoctoral research associate to an independent investigator capable of designing behavioral interventions and leading combination HIV prevention trials."
"9221378","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following traumatic brain injury (TBI) there is copious release of oxygen radicals that damage proteins, DNA and cell membranes ultimately resulting in long-term neurological disabilities. Our laboratory has shown that K+ channels, which are key to neuronal excitability and survival, are substrates of free radicals. In particular, we showed tht oxidation of KCNB1 (formerly Kv2.1), a K+ channel abundant in brain, induces neuronal death by apoptosis via a Src tyrosine kinase mediated pathway. We have identified a FDA-approved, blood-brain barrier permeable drug that directly impinges on this apoptotic pathway. KCNB1 plays a major role in determining the intrinsic excitability of neurons of the cortex and hippocampus. This implies that-following traumatic injury-oxidized KCNB1 channels and/or the other components of the signaling pathways activated by their oxidation may contribute to loss of brain function. The broad goal of this project is to address the role of oxidation of KCNB1 channels in traumatic brain injury in vivo and in vitro. We will evaluate the mechanism by which oxidized KCNB1 channels contribute to neuronal death, their potential contribution to the tissue damage that occurs following traumatic brain injury and the therapeutic potential of a FDA-approved drug. Experimental testing will be carried out in mice, including a transgenic mouse expressing a KCNB1 variant resistant to oxidation and cultured primary neurons. As no effective pharmacological treatment exists for traumatic brain injury, our proposal to test the role of oxidation of KCNB1 represents a critical step forward in determining whether KCNB1 and other components of the signaling pathways activated by its oxidation, such as Src tyrosine kinases, represent bona fide drug targets for limiting the cellular devastation that accompanies traumatic brain injury. In addition, this research will add important insight into both the regulation and th downstream pathways impacted by the channel."
"9402438","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High concentrations of readily chelatable (mobile) Zn2+ are found in various brain regions, yet the details of zinc signaling pathways in areas such as CNS development, learning and memory formation, and motor and sensory function, remain elusive. These dynamic pools of mobile Zn2+ may be tracked using fluorescent zinc sensors and are the focus of many studies aimed at understanding the function of zinc- enriched neurons; however, few have attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Zn2+ during neurogenesis or clarify zinc signaling pathways in motor and sensory functions.      To address these deficiencies, we propose the development of a category of zinc-selective sensors that combine the advantages of tunable small molecule sensors and genetically encodable tags. We will design, prepare, and characterize reaction-based small molecule-protein hybrid fluorescent zinc sensors for targeting subcellular organelles and cell membranes. Specifically, we will prepare a reaction-based hybrid green fluorescent zinc sensor for targeting the mitochondria, nucleus, cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum in proliferating and differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and use it to map mobile Zn2+ pools in NPCs at discrete locales. Hybrid probes will be characterized in vitro using purified proteins and functionalized small molecule sensors, protein tag-expressing genes cloned to include subcellular targeting sequences, and in cellulo imaging carried out to monitor sensor localization and relative endogenous zinc levels. We will also develop a red-emitting reaction-based hybrid probe for quantifying mobile zinc in NPCs. This will be approached through the design, preparation, and characterization of a protein tag fused to a fluorescent protein, followed by in cellulo fluorescence microscopy for calibration and then endogenous Zn2+ quantification. Finally, we will develop a novel cell-surface displayed hybrid fusion protein for probing synaptic zinc because imaging zinc transmission with high spatiotemporal resolution requires novel sensors that can be localized to neuronal cell surfaces. We will employ a transmembrane protein fused to a protein tag that can be coupled with an extracellular zinc sensor for imaging in cell culture, and with collaborators, in brain tissue slices of relevance to auditory function.      This study will be of great importance to the fields of bioinorganic chemistry and neuroscience by providing novel sensors that will be utilized to directly probe mobile zinc signaling pathways in various neurobiological platforms and which can then be built upon to address various broader biological questions."
"9338251","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to explore the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie cholinergic control of spatial attention. Patients with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and ADHD, typically exhibit dysregulation of attention and gaze control, abnormal modulation of gamma (25-60 Hz) oscillations in local field potentials, and dysfunction of cholinergic signaling. We hypothesize that the co- occurrence of these four symptomatic phenomena reflects that they are mechanistically related. We will test this hypothesis by studying the properties of cholinergic neurons that lie at the heart of the midbrain stimulus selection network, where these four phenomena converge. We will use a combination of sophisticated behavioral, in vivo electrophysiological, and in vitro slice approaches. In Aim #1, we characterize quantitatively the causal role of these cholinergic neurons in the control of attention and gaze in chickens trained to perform selective attention tasks; in Aim #2, we parameterize and quantify the information they encode in the context of these attention-demanding tasks; and in Aim #3, we use in vitro slice techniques to reveal the synaptic mechanisms they employ to control the power and duration of gamma oscillations. This critical, cholinergic circuit element is spatially segregated from other circuit components in bird (uniquely). Our experiments take advantage of this spatial segregation in birds, to selectively record from and manipulate this critical circuit element in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesize that the action of these neurons is essential to the generation of selection signals that are issued by the midbrain for controlling spatial attention and gaze; preliminary data support this hypothesis. The results from our experiments will illuminate the role of cholinergic mechanisms in the generation of selection signals. Discovering these mechanisms will give insight into the symptoms and causes of diseases that involve these four phenomena, as well as suggest avenues for improved diagnosis and rational treatments of those symptoms."
"9327807","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Serotonin (5-HT) signaling in brain reward circuits modulates drug-seeking behavior. Specifically, 5- HT6 receptors provide excitatory signals to medium spiny neurons that make up the direct and indirect pathways, the two main outputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These receptors are localized to the primary cilia of neurons, signal through type 3 adenylyl cyclase (AC3), and play a key role in drug reward and reinforcement. How the 5-HT6 receptor and its downstream signaling components influence drug taking via reward circuitry remains unclear. Our lab has shown that increased expression of 5-HT6 receptors specifically in indirect but not direct pathway results in a decrease in cocaine self-administration by increasing the sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Thus, 5-HT6 receptors appear to influence cocaine reinforcement in a pathway-selective manner. However, overexpressed receptors may have altered the subcellular distribution and cilia- specific localization of 5-HT6 receptors. The proposed experiments will further test the pathway specificity by knocking out endogenous 5-HT6 receptor signaling in a pathway-selective manner. This proposal seeks to determine the exact nature of how endogenous 5-HT6 receptors regulate cocaine self-administration, and whether cilia-specific signaling plays a role in addiction-like behavior. Aim 1 will create a Cre-dependent CRISPR-Cas9 viral vector targeting the 5-HT6 receptor gene to enable pathway-specific knockout of the receptor with an intersectional viral strategy. Aim 2 will investigate the pathway-selective influence of 5-HT6 receptor signaling on cocaine self-administration in rats by disrupting expression of this receptor in the direct or indirect pathway neurons selectively. Behavioral economic analysis of cocaine taking will deepen our understanding of how these receptors modulate cocaine intake, reinforcement, and motivation. Aim 3 examine the molecular mechanism by which 5- HT6 receptors regulate cocaine-seeking behavior by disrupting AC3 signaling in a pathway-specific manner. This will allow us to validate the link between AC3 and 5-HT6 receptor function, and provide novel insights into the effects of cilia-specific signaling on cocaine self-administration. The novel intersectional knockout approach in this proposal has broad implications for addiction research, as well as neuroscience in general, and provides a training plan that enables the expansion of my current knowledge and repertoire of molecular and behavioral techniques. Together, these three Aims, along with the other elements of my training plan, could inform new treatments for addiction, prepare me to become an independent clinician-neuroscientist, and address my desire to conduct research that spans the translational gap between basic neuroscience and the devastating impact of addiction in families and society."
"9217135","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Little is known about the incidence, prevalence, and predictors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in populations living traditional pre-industrial lifestyles similar to those experienced over human pre-history. This information is critical to determine whether AD is a byproduct of modern environments. Compared to age-matched industrialized populations, Tsimane exhibit: a) delayed atherosclerosis progression over their lifetime; b) low prevalence of diabetes and hypertension; and c) a near absence of atrial fibrillation, stroke and myocardial infarctions. At the same time Tsimane experience high rates of infection and inflammation throughout life. The two major goals of this proposal are to: 1) measure rates of cerebral atrophy and cognitive decline in association with atherosclerotic and inflammatory burden, APOE genotype and schooling, and 2) generate estimates of the prevalence and incidence of all-cause dementia and AD. Our central hypothesis is that compared to Westerners, the low rate of atherosclerosis among Tsimane will be paralleled by a slower rate of cerebral atrophy, and reduced age-related cognitive impairment. We will test the alternative hypothesis that infection and inflammation are associated with accelerated rates of cerebral atrophy and cognitive impairment.  To test these predictions we propose the following specific aims, utilizing a panel study design, state-of-the-art bioimaging technology, and a representative sample of 1,310 Tsimane adults aged 40+, which comprises ~85% of the population in that age range: Aim 1 is to conduct longitudinal assessment of cognitive impairment and dementia with measurement of physical activity between assessments; Aim 2 is to conduct anatomic neuroimaging of the brain related to cognitive impairment, AD and other dementias; and Aim 3 is to investigate the epidemiology of brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, AD and other dementias.  This research is time-sensitive, as Tsimane are modernizing at an accelerating rate. It may be our last chance to study the natural history of AD, cerebral atrophy and cognitive impairment with a large sample in a population living a subsistence lifestyle, similar to pre- historic populations, with low rates of CVD and high rates of infectious disease. The multi- disciplinary approach will leverage 14 years of Tsimane research, including data on atherosclerosis in four arterial beds, heart disease, infection and inflammation, physical activity level, and cognitive performance. If rates of cerebral atrophy and cognitive impairment are lower among aging Tsimane, despite their high systemic inflammation and limited schooling, those findings will have important implications for our understanding of AD in the US."
"9256392","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammation is a key and invariant pathological feature of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, and the impact on disease progression and neurodegeneration remains an area of active investigation. In this Program Project we propose 5 Projects and 2 supporting Cores. Each Project investigates how inflammation drives brain pathology in AD and how select AD risk factor genes (identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)) contribute to the progression of inflammation-driven pathogenesis. The common mechanistic thread linking the Projects is the idea that inflammation and beta-amyloid (Aß) impair endosomal trafficking and autophagy, which ultimately drives neuronal dysfunction, impaired synaptic plasticity, and deteriorating cognitive health. The team leading the projects has a long history of collaboration and major contributions to the AD field. Project 1: Intracellulr amyloid accumulation, innate immunity and pathogenesis. Charles Glabe, Project Leader. Project 1 proposes that the accumulation of intracellular Aß contributes to pathogenesis by activating an innate inflammatory cascade that represents a futile attempt to degrade or eliminate Aß via activation of autophagy. Project 2: Inflammation and Aß Impair BDNF Signaling and the Regulation of Synaptic Plasticity, Carl Cotman, Project Leader. Project 2 proposes that inflammation and Aß compromise synaptic plasticity and neuronal viability by impairing, endosomal trafficking and neurotrophic factor signaling, in particular BDNF-TrkB. Project 3: Linking Aß and tau pathology through IL-1ß signaling: relevance of changes in protein trafficking and clearance mechanisms for the disease progression. Frank LaFerIa, Project Leader. Project 3 proposes that a cascade exists by which Aß species provoke inflammation, which subsequently drives tau pathology. Project 4: Neuroprotection vs. neuroinflammatlon induced by complement proteins and receptors. Andrea Tenner, Project Leader. Project 4 will define the molecular basis of C1q dependent neuroprotection and the functional consequences of CR1 gene polymorphisms, a risk factor for AD. Project 5: PICALM, oligomeric Aß and inflammation in neurovascular pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease, David Cribbs, Project Leader. Project 5 investigates how Aß and inflammation affect cerebrovascular function, and incorporates AD risk factor genes that are linked to inflammation/endosomal processing."
"9248863","PROJECT 1: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Approximately 5% of patients of with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) develop symptoms before age 65 in the absence of a known autosomal dominant mutation. Patients with non-familial early-onset AD (EO-AD) show greater deficits in executive function, attention, language and visuospatial abilities and relatively spared episodic memory compared to patients with late-onset AD (LO-AD). Non-amnestic and hippocampal-sparing AD phenotypes are far more common in patients with EO disease. Accurately diagnosing AD in EO patients is challenging due to the atypical clinical presentations and overlap with non-AD dementia, and misdiagnosis rates are high even at expert centers. Molecular and neurodegenerative biomarkers are likely to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis, but few studies have addressed their performance in patients with EO disease - results from LO-AD studies may not generalize to EO populations because of differences in degenerative patterns and reference ranges. Furthermore, patients with EO-AD may harbor unrecognized susceptibility factors that lead to disease onset at such a young age. While the apolipoprotein E ?4 allele is strongly correlated with young age-of-onset, it is present in only ~50% of EO patients, suggesting that additional mechanisms of vulnerability have yet to be discovered. Leveraging on the strength of the UCSF ADRC in recruiting and characterizing patients with early-onset AD, this study will apply detailed clinical phenotyping, multi-modal neuroimaging and novel genetic approaches to optimize early-stage diagnosis and to elucidate mechanisms of vulnerability in EO-AD. We will evaluate 100 mildly impaired (CDR 0.5-1) early-onset (estimated age of onset ?65) patients recruited from the Clinical core. All patients will meet NIA-AA criteria for MCI or probable AD and demonstrate evidence of AD pathology based on a positive amyloid (florbetapir) PET scan. Comparative data from 100 matched normal controls (NC) and 75 non-AD dementia patients will be acquired via the Clinical and Imaging cores. Aim 1 will test the diagnostic performance of (1) CSF and (2) hippocampal versus cortically-based MRI biomarkers in distinguishing EO-AD from NC and non-AD dementia. Aim 2 will build on preliminary data suggesting that ApoE4 modifies the phenotype of EO-AD, testing the hypothesis that ApoE4 carriers will show greater memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy and lower amyloid compared to E4 non-carriers. A hypothesis-generating Aim 3 will apply novel genetic tools to study vulnerability factors in EO-AD, hypothesizing that: (1) ApoE4-positive and E4-negative patients will show differential gene expression patterns in peripheral blood, reflecting involvement of distinct biological pathways; and (2) by screening EO-AD patients with a gene chip that includes ~250,000 rare, protein-altering genetic markers, we will identify novel risk variants in genes implicated in AD pathogenic pathways. Overall, this project will facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of EO-AD, and will further our understanding of susceptibility factors associated with pre-senile disease onset."

His research interests are in the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering.   His graduate thesis work involved a molecular biology approach for improving endothelial cell retention to vascular grafts.  This led to his postdoctoral work which involves an engineering approach for improving capture and retention of endothelial cells to vascular stents and grafts.  His postdoctoral work also involves a tissue engineered cardiac valve project to explore both biological and biosynthetic approaches. The candidate's immediate career goal is to transition from mentored to independent research by completing his postdoctoral training and beginning a tenure track faculty position at a major research university.  This will require focusing his current projects into a novel research direction while also receiving additional training that will be needed to successfully complete the current and future projects as an independent investigator.  The K99/R00 mechanism is the ideal means of achieving this goal.  The candidate's long term career goal is to establish an independent and extramurally funded research program within the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering in order to meaningfully improve patient care and train the next generation of scientists, physicians, and engineers.

This biomaterial is expected to have a wide range of important applications for targeted delivery of cells, drugs, and proteins.  The proposed work will then use a novel biomaterial to fabricate novel cardiac valves capable of magnetic endothelialization.  The valves will be tested for mechanical, magnetic, and thrombogenic properties in vitro.  The valves will then be tested for clinically-relevant outcomes including function, thrombus formation, and calcification in an ovine implantation model.  These valves are expected to demonstrate proof of concept for magnetic endothelialization of valves."
"9299138","Project Summary / Abstract Molecular recognition touches virtually every aspect of biomedical research, from the discovery of new therapeutic leads that selectively modulate a target's function to the development of new diagnostic tools. One- bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library synthesis and screening has the potential to source and discover such ligands cheaply and efficiently. However, the process is plagued by the selection of false positive beads displaying ligands that do not recapitulate their tethered binding behavior once liberated from the bead surface. All combinatorial library screening must therefore incorporate hit re-synthesis, purification, and solution-phase binding assays for validation, making the investigation of false positives resource intensive to the point of negating the efficiency of the combinatorial library synthesis and screening. Directly screening each library member for solution-phase target binding would alleviate the burdens described above, but such technology does not yet exist. This proposal will explore polarization-activated droplet sorting (PADS), which will be capable of performing ultra-miniaturized picoliter-scale solution-phase fluorescence polarization (FP) assays on each library member during primary screening. DNA-encoded combinatorial library beads will be prepared with fluorescently-labeled ligand linked to the bead via photocleavable linker, distributed into target- containing microfluidic droplets, photochemically cleaved from the bead in flow, assayed in droplets for binding by laser-induced FP, and sorted if the FP threshold is exceeded. Validation of PADS will involve examining various positive control authentic ligands and their known targets (e.g., streptavidin/biotin, pepstatin A/HIV-1 protease) and proceed to a known case of a false positive discovered in the development of a screen for CCR5-mimetic ligands of the HIV-1 gp120/CD4-Ig complex. PADS will be assessed for its ability to differentiate the authentic ligand from the known false positive in these droplet-scale solution-phase binding assays. The successful development of PADS will allow screening of diverse (>105 members) small molecule OBOC libraries for authentic binding, requiring negligible amounts of target. PADS will integrate the efficiency advantages of DNA-encoded combinatorial library synthesis and miniaturized screening to provide a highly scalable platform for the discovery of new molecular tools and therapeutic leads."
"9391908","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuation application is to provide advanced training to predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows in the fundamentals of neuronal plasticity in the aging nervous system. The program has three key features: 1) Academic bridging - A principal focus will be to provide the students and fellows with concepts and research experience that address problems at the interface of basic and clinical problems in aging. This bridging will be reflected in the faculty participating in the program, the trainees admitted to the program, and the structure of the training program itself. Courses, seminars, annual scientific retreat, and co-sponsorships by basic scientists and clinical researchers of trainees will bring together these bridging concepts and research practice. 2) Life span development - We believe that the aging process is part of a life span process, which should and can be investigated as part of a continuum from birth to death. Many conceptual and practical problems presently being addressed in early development are translatable to late stage aging. This translation of ideas and approaches from studies of development and adult plasticity will be a feature of the program. We believe that investigations of neuronal plasticity are at the very core of understanding late stage aging of the nervous system, since age-related decline often reflects a decrease in neuronal and functional plasticity. In this program, we will encourage the participants to address these age-related aspects of plasticity, disease, and neurodegeneration. 3) Multi-disciplinary - By its very nature, Neuroscience and Aging are multi-disciplinary fields of investigation. The modern neuroscientist is required to understand and use methods and techniques from the full range of biological disciplines and beyond. The faculty in this program (46 at current time) represents technical expertise in the fields of Molecular Genetics, Protein Chemistry, Cell Biology, Neurophysiology, Systems Analysis, Pharmacology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Computational Neuroscience, and Clinical Neurology. The students (six per year at second year of training and beyond) are drawn from the Neurosciences Graduate Program, a highly regarded program with strong participation from UCSD and the neighboring institutions, including Salk, Scripps, and Sanford-Burnham Institutes. Postdoctoral trainees (six per year) are drawn from the laboratories of the same participating faculty members. Our goal is to train students and fellows to be able to work and think effectively in several of these areas and will be achieved by providing them a forum for instruction, discussion, and interaction; in so doing, they represent the next generation of neuroscientists who will contribute to the advancement in aging research."

"9249661","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Airway eosinophilia is an important marker of asthma severity, risk of exacerbation, and response to therapy. Based upon the current understanding of the function of eosinophils (EOS), the preliminary data and studies accomplished over the previous funding cycle, form the basis for the hypothesis that EOS play a pivotal role in asthma pathophysiology by enhancing airway inflammation and remodeling. The studies in this PPG renewal application are designed to answer clinically important questions formulated to take maximum advantage of our collective expertise and resources. They will allow us to address critically, comprehensively and interactively the role of EOS in allergic airway inflammation using ex vivo and in vivo experiments in human subjects complemented, as appropriate, by focused use of cell lines and animal models. Project 1 will investigate key EOS functions including promoting IL-17 responses and enhancing fibroblast (Fb) function via expression of SEMA7A, which leads to promoting myoFb differentiation and generation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The Th2 skewed environment in the asthmatic airway promotes the expression of periostin, an important marker of allergic inflammation. The proposed studies in Project 2 will determine how this ECM protein interacts with EOS to enhance their survival, mediator release, and response to EOS-active cytokines. Studies will define the requirements for periostin generation in the airway and recognition by the EOS integrin alphaMBeta2. Finally in Project 3, the molecular mechanisms regulating the pro-fibrotic cytokine, TGF-Beta1 signaling in EOS and Fb will be investigated focusing on the role of Pin1 interaction with proximal Smads as well as PI-3-K and Akt. Our group discovered that up-regulation of isomerase Pin1 is an essential step in the TGF-Beta1 signaling pathway and seek to determine how Pin1 influences Smad6 and Smad3 including the role of Akt and PI-3-Kgamma in this process. It can be argued that few other centers, if any, around the world are capable of doing the clinical studies needed to retrieve airway EOS and at the same time have the experience necessary to critically dissect EOS biological functions to the same level of sophistication that our group is capable of doing. The collaborative studies among the three laboratories and the rich clinical research experience will allow us to move back and forth from ex vivo to in vivo experiments to better understand the role of EOS in modulating allergic airway inflammation and remodeling. Given the prominence of eosinophilic inflammation in a significant proportion of severe asthma patients, these advances will have direct implications for the patients most affected by this very common illness."
"9242061","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sudden unexplained death (SUD) is a tragic event at any age. The incidence of SUD between the ages of 1 and 35 years is 1-3 events per 100,000 person-years. In addition to loss of life, SUD may herald increased risk for sudden death in surviving first-degree relatives. Genetic disorders of heart rhythm (e.g., channelopathies) and myocardial function (e.g., cardiomyopathies) are blamed for approximately 25% of SUD cases. Screening first-degree relatives of a SUD victim for genetic disease may identify additional family members at risk for sudden death. We propose a three-tiered research study designed to uncover the prevalence and mutational spectrum of channelopathies and cardiomyopathies among cases of sudden death collected by the Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Case Registry that occur in the absence of epilepsy and have a high likelihood of having a cardiac etiology. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to perform whole genome sequencing of 500 SDY cases coupled with targeted bioinformatics analysis of genes with known involvement in congenital arrhythmia susceptibilities or inherited cardiomyopathies. Whole genome sequencing yields more uniform coverage of coding sequences than exome sequencing and offers opportunities to enable studies of analysis of noncoding variation. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to perform experiments to elucidate the functional consequences of SDY-associated genetic variants in cardiac ion channel genes, especially SCN5A, KCNQ1 and KCNH2. These experiments will generate data essential for assigning the likelihood of pathogenicity for a large class of anticipated variants predisposing to SUD. Finally, In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the frequency with which pathogenic variants in genes associated with congenital arrhythmia susceptibility and cardiomyopathy are inherited from a parent rather than arising de novo. Ascertaining the rate of transmitted versus de novo mutations in SUD cases has important implications for public health and family counseling. As part of our experimental plan, we will also identify new SDY cases through our existing collaboration with Medical Examiner's Offices in Chicago and surrounding counties in Illinois, thereby adding value to the registry and ensuring robust accrual of SDY cases that can be shared across the research network."

"9312552","SUMMARY The NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program aims to provide high- priority studies of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders (HLBS) with high-quality genomic data. This year, the program will deeply sequence >60,000 genomes to characterize DNA sequence variation at scale. It is expected that >400 million genetic variants will be identified. In later phases, it is expected that rich genomic assays will be applied to an equally large number of samples. In a pilot phase, these additional assays will include ~3,000 transcriptomes, ~2,000 methylation profiles, and ~2,000 metabolomics profiles. Data on this scale opens up many opportunities for discovery and analysis but also poses significant challenges. RFA-HL-17-011, entitled ?NHLBI TOPMed Program: Integrative Omics Approaches for Analysis of TOPMed Data (U01)? is intended to stimulate development of computational and statistical methods and tools that enable innovative and scalable analyses genomic resource. Our group has a long history in the development of specialized, state-of-the- art methods and tools for the processing and analysis of large genomic datasets. We have a history of leadership in varied resources, ranging from the Mouse HapMap Project, to 1000 Genomes Project, to ENCODE, and including the NHLBI?s TOPMed program. In this application, we propose to develop innovative and practical methods to enable informative genomic analysis at scale. These methods encompass computational tools to rapidly scale deep GWAS, statistical methods for robust and powerful integrative omics analysis, and visualization methods for integrative interpretation of omics genetics results. We will implement these methods into cost-effective, easy-to-use, and well-documented software packages that facilitate understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in HLBS disorders. A key component of the proposal is the deployment of these tools on commercial clouds, providing accessible interface to investigators without direct access to a local high-throughput compute and data storage facility. The resulting tools will empower a wide range of scientists to run best-in-class methods to accelerate discovery of new treatments for HLBS disorders."
"9209799","PROJECT SUMMARY The interaction between Hsp70s and cellular membranes is a new and largely uncharacterized function of these indispensable molecular chaperones. We hypothesize that the interaction between Hsp70s and lipids is a critical step for their membrane-associated functions, and that lipid-binding provides them with the necessary specificity to localize and function at different membranes during cellular stress and disease conditions like cancer. The interaction of Hsp70s with lipids suppresses tumor growth, induces cell death, activates the immune system, stabilizes membranes, and regulates nutrient recycling (microautophagy). This interaction depends on the lipid environment, is mediated by multiple types of molecular forces, and is altered by nucleotide binding. Furthermore, Hsp70s are differentiated with respect to their lipid-binding function. However, the conditions under which Hsp70s interact with lipids in human cells and the amino acid residues responsible for binding remain mostly unknown. To answer these two fundamental questions we propose two specific aims. First, we will determine the conditions that favor the interaction of HspA1A, the stress-inducible Hsp70 in humans, with lipids. For this task we will use several human cell lines, which will be subjected to different treatments that alter membrane lipid composition. The interaction of HspA1A with lipids will be assessed using pull-down assays, cellular imaging in the presence or absence of known lipid-binding proteins and fluorescent lipids, subcellular fractionation, and cell surface biotinylation. Furthermore, a targeted lipidomics approach will be used to authenticate HspA1A native lipid ligands. Second, we will identify and characterize the amino acids that mediate the HspA1A-lipid binding, and elucidate the molecular mechanism of this interaction. For this task, several amino acids, which will be predicted using computational techniques and observations from the literature, will be mutated. The mutational effect on the binding of recombinant HspA1A to lipids will be quantified using the liposome sedimentation method and Surface Plasmon Resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, the mutational effect on HspA1A function and stability will be determined by assessing alterations of the chaperone function. Finally, the mutational effect on the lipid-binding properties of HspA1A will be verified in human cells using fluorescently labeled HspA1A and a combination of pull-down assays, imaging, and subcellular fractionation. This proposal will provide fundamental knowledge that will allow us to test the effects of loss-of-function mutations in human cells and identify their physiological implications. If validated by these experiments, our lipid-binding specificity hypothesis will allow us to further elucidate this novel property of Hsp70s, which has critical associations with the cellular stress response, membrane biology, and disease conditions like cancer. Furthermore, this project will train multiple non-traditional and first-generation undergraduate and master level students, and will prepare them to enter companies, research labs, and advanced academic programs."
"9409120","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The t(4;14) chromosomal translocation found in 20% of multiple myeloma (MM) cases leads to a shorter survival rate in an already incurable disease. The candidate oncogene overexpressed from the t(4;14) translocation, WHSC1 (MMSET), is unable to transform cells in culture or drive tumorigenesis in mice on its own. Examination of a 2 MB region around the t(4;14) breakpoint revealed the overexpression of a 125 bp orphan H/ACA class non-coding RNA, ACA11, which was confirmed to be up-regulated in t(4;14) MM cell lines and patient samples. Further preliminary studies demonstrate ACA11 localizes to the nucleolus as part of an small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. In addition, ACA11 overexpression reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to oxidative stress and increases cell survival in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that the overexpression of ACA11 in t(4;14) MM reduces ROS-induced cell death leading to the development and/or progression of MM. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which ACA11 exerts its inhibitory effects on ROS-induced cell cycle inhibition and cell death in t(4;14) MM cell lines. We hypothesize that the overexpression of the ACA11 snoRNA in t(4;14) MM results in the altered splicing of specific RNA transcripts involved in the cellular response to ROS. These selected transcripts will encode either RNA or proteins critical for B-cell survival in MM. Therefore, ACA11 and its associated snRNP's will be potential novel targets for MM treatment or diagnosis. Three specific aims of the grant are proposed: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ACA11 must interact with snRNPs to exert its inhibition of oxidative stress induced cell death Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that ACA11 regulates ROS levels through modulating splicing of  snoRNAs from ribosomal protein transcripts Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that overexpression of ACA11 leads to an inhibition of nucleolar  stress-induced, p53-regulated ROS production"
"9441067","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenetic studies provided insight into molecular basis of tens of childhood neurological diseases but in the context of intellectual disabilities an autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) the challenge is how one can explain, similar phenotypes in face of vastly different molecular perturbations. This led to the proposal that the observed behaviors result from some shared patterns of circuit dysfunction. There is a pair of disorders with overlapping phenotypes that presents a unique opportunity to explore circuit-level disruption of homeostasis and its sequelae, particularly for learning and memory: Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked MECP2, and MECP2 duplication syndrome, caused by duplications (or triplications) of the gene. The mechanism accounting for overlapping phenotypes in two syndromes with opposite molecular defects (and transcriptional alterations) remains mysterious. My preliminary data show that both loss and gain of MeCP2 function leads to increased cross-correlations of spontaneous calcium activity and increased sensitivity to GABA blockade in acutely isolated hippocampal slices. This hypersynchrony is caused by an imbalance of excitation and inhibition in the hippocampal circuit. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the malfunction of the hippocampal CA1 circuit in mouse models of RTT and MECP2 duplication syndrome and to explore the possibility of intervention and rescue. I hypothesize that loss and gain of MeCP2 function generates similar patterns of malfunction (circuitopathies) in canonical neural circuits, and that these circuitopathies can be rescued by restoring the imbalance of excitation and inhibition. To address this hypothesis, I propose three specific aims: (1) Elucidate the cellular mechanism underlying the malfunction of hippocampal CA1 circuit caused by MeCP2 dysfunction; (2) Determine how the circuit in hippocampal CA1 responds during learning tasks in Mecp2 mutants; (3) Determine whether altering cellular excitability acutely or chronically can rescue circuit malfunction in MeCP2 disorders. Given that circuit function is what eventually determines behavior, these studies will elucidate the circuit-level mechanism accounting for overlapping phenotypes of Rett syndrome and MECP2 duplication syndrome. It will also reveal the circuit's response to a hippocampal dependent learning behavior and uncover potential correlations between circuit malfunction and behavioral deficits. The data will provide insights into the value of manipulations at the circuit level and might lead to the design of new therapeutic approaches. Research proposed in the K99 mentored phase (year 1 and 2) is concentrated on generating multiple genetic mouse lines to elucidate the cellular mechanism of circuit malfunctions caused by Mecp2 mutation and establishing in vivo calcium imaging with a miniature head-mounted microscope on freely moving mice performing a learning task, all of which will be carried out with the supervision of Dr. Huda Y. Zoghbi and Dr. Stelios Smirnakis. During this phase, I will acquire training on new skills to directly prepare me for a career as an independent research scientist through scheduled weekly lab meetings, mentor supervision and discussion sessions, attending weekly departmental seminars, journal clubs and retreats, participation in joint lab and co- institutional meetings, attendance and participation at national scientific conferences, and enrollment in formal courses. The R00 Independent phase (year 3 to 5) will focus on determining how the circuit in hippocampal CA1 responds during learning tasks in Mecp2 mutants and explore the rescue of Mecp2 disorders. During this phase, I will continue an active relationship with my mentors through scheduled phone conversations and email. I will rely on their input and advice towards hiring lab personnel, budget development, and developing a successful R01 grant application."
"9450926","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing body of scientific literature indicates that sensory processing in the nervous system incorporates not just bottom-up analysis of sensory information that originates from the sensory organs but also top-down expectations about the organization of the sensory world that derive from previous sensory experience. In the olfactory system the first convergence of bottom-up and top-down projections occurs in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb, where optical imaging techniques now permit the visualization of presynaptic calcium signaling and neurotransmitter release from olfactory receptor neurons (the very first neurons in the olfactory system) in awake mice that are smelling odors and learning about their environment. The olfactory system is thus a uniquely powerful model system to study the synthesis of top-down and bottom-up information. Remarkably, in preliminary experiments we have found that this primary sensory input is strongly modulated by the mouse's expectations about olfactory stimuli, as established by prior sensory experience during the imaging session. For instance, if an odor is always presented after a warning tone cue, the unexpected presentation of that odor without the tone evokes much less presynaptic calcium influx and less neurotransmitter release from the olfactory nerve than when the odor follows the cue. This effect appears to occur via a GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release from these synapses. Because the output of the receptor neurons themselves is modulated by expectations, these data suggest that there is actually no purely bottom-up information in the olfactory system at all. This has profound implications for our understanding of neural representations of olfactory stimuli and will inform our understanding of other, less experimentally tractable sensory systems. This proposal confirms and extends these findings by testing the nature of the expectations (e.g. is the expectation odor-specific?), their time course (e.g. are expectation effects anticipatory?), and their neural mechanisms (e.g. are descending projections to the olfactory bulb necessary during the establishment of the expectation or only for detecting unexpected outcomes?). Further experimentation is designed to reveal the perceptual consequences of these neural changes (e.g. do expected odors smell stronger than unexpected odors?) and whether the difference in neurotransmitter release from receptor neurons is necessary for these perceptual effects to occur. Importantly, this work will be designed and analyzed in the context of information theory, a formal theory that allows the quantification of how expected or surprising a given stimulus is and thus provides testable quantitative predictions for assessing the neurophysiological and psychophysical consequences of expectation. These results should provide an essential step in understanding how cognition can play a role in perception as early as the first neurons in a sensory system."
"9041644","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this basic research grant proposal the long-term objective is to develop a non-invasive method to objectively assess the quality of oocytes and embryos. The immediate goal is to determine whether subcellular motility can be used as a biomarker to evaluate viability using the pig as a model. Assisted reproductive technologies are powerful tools for treating infertility; unfortunately, the success rate of such technologies is rather low. A major reason responsible for the low efficiency is the lack of methods to reliably assess the developmental potential of oocytes and embryos. Therefore, a non-invasive method that would ensure the selection of only the best oocytes for in vitro fertilization or the highest quality embryos for transfer into surrogates would be highly desirable. Our central hypothesis is that intracellular motion provides a sensitive and specific suite of biomarkers that, when detected by Biodynamic Imaging, can predict developmental potential. To address this hypothesis three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to determine whether intracellular motion of oocytes is an indicator of their viability. Aim 2 is to define the correlation between subcellulr motion of embryos and their developmental competence. Aim 3 is to establish whether successful fertilization can be identified by monitoring motion in the ooplasm following gamete fusion using Biodynamic Imaging. Accomplishing these aims will lead to the development of a much-needed method for the selection of the best oocytes and embryos that has important applications in the field of assisted reproduction."
"9274743","Project Summary/Abstract The Boston University Department of Chemistry seeks NIH support to acquire a MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) instrument for the Charles River Campus (CRC). This instrument would enable investigators on the CRC to advance their research in life processes (chemistry, biochemistry and biology) and allow their investigations to move into new areas that would enrich student and postdoctoral training. The instrument's capabilities would enhance active research projects involving the quantification of protein-protein and protein- ligand interactions as well as the identification of protein conformation changes that occur in multi-subunit protein complexes as a function of redox state or allosteric activation. The requested instrument is critical to the research programs of eleven Major Users (Professors Allen, Beffert, Beeler, Brown, Caradonna, Elliott, Harris, Ho, Perlstein, Porco and Whitty). The MST instrument will play a pivotal role in BU's expansion of its life science in biophysical research. The University's commitment is demonstrated by its investment in the infrastructure for supporting multi-user research instruments and by its provision of salary for full time technical support. In 2006, BU completed construction of the 5,500 sq.-ft. Chemical Instrumentation Center (CIC), which was designed with specific space and support staff designated for biophysical instrumentation. The quantitative chemical biology areas that rely on biophysical characterization methods to understand the interactions between molecules continue to grow within the departments, including five of the seven most-recent hires in chemistry and in biology. The requested instrument will enhance our biophysical capability on CRC to meet the current and evolving research needs of the faculty and students. The CIC's Director, Dr. Norman Lee, will manage the usage and finances of the requested instrument and Dr. Jeffrey Bacon, a biophysical instrumentation specialist will operate, maintain and provide user training on the requested instrument. The CIC has a demonstrated management plan for the instrument's usage, financial supervision and scientific oversight, including a nine-member Advisory Committee with representatives from users and non-users. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the laboratories of the users will use this instrument extensively as part of their research. This training of young scientists will facilitate their research objectives, while providing them with additional technical skills for succeeding in their future professional careers."
"9329220","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is the most commonly inherited form of brittle bone disease, which is characterized by a wide-ranging severity from mild phenotypes to severe congenital lethality. OI is commonly caused by mutations in the two genes that encode type I collagen but recent studies have shed light on several recessive OI cases resulting from abnormalities in collagen synthesis, secretion and/or folding. One of the most well-studied forms of recessive is caused by mutations in the prolyl 3- hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) complex (consisting of cartilage associated protein [CRTAP], P3H1 and cyclophilin B [CypB]), which are essential for prolyl hydroxylation of type I procollagen, and failure to do so results in defective collagen cross-linking. In addition, we and others have recently identified several families that developed progressive bone fragility and congenital joint contractures (i.e. recessive OI and Bruck syndrome) due to loss-of-function mutations in FK506 binding protein 10, 65 KDa!(FKBP10), which encodes the ER-chaperone protein FKBP65. To understand the function of FKBP10, our laboratory previously generated Fkbp10-null mice which displayed connective tissue abnormalities and reduced collagen cross-linking. While the global Fkbp10 knockout mice phenocopied certain aspects of the human disease condition, they unexpectedly resulted in embryonic lethality. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the tissue specific functions of FKBP10 in regulating tendon homeostasis. In other types of recessive OI, the biochemical modifications of collagen are altered, in particular by P3H1. Additionally, studies on Crtap knockout mice have revealed that collagen abnormalities alter cell signaling, which is the predominant mechanism underlying disease. I hypothesize that tissue-specific loss of FKBP10 negatively affects type I collagen cross-linking and alters cell signaling within the tissue microenvironment, ultimately resulting in OI and Bruck syndrome. I aim to test this hypothesis by determining the effects of tissue specific Fkbp10 removal on the molecular, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of tendons. The experiments proposed in this training plan is critical for establishing both unique and common mechanisms of disease, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for patients with OI and Bruck syndrome as well as other types of OI cases. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is the recipient organization of this fellowship because recessive OI and Bruck syndrome are characterized by abnormalities in both skeletal and connective tissues."
"9252377","Malaria exerts the largest burden on global health of any disease caused by a eukaryotic parasite, and is  responsible for approximately 600,000 deaths a year. Recent gains have been made in controlling malaria,  but the proclivity for malaria parasites and their Anopheline mosquito vectors to evolve resistance to drugs  and insecticides means that tools are needed to preserve the efficacy of existing therapeutics and control  measures, and that investment in basic research is necessary to keep development pipelines stocked with  new candidate drugs, vaccines, and insecticides. We propose to advance these efforts by coupling  innovative applications of genomic technologies with key questions in the fields of malaria transmission,  pathogenesis, and therapeutics. Our projects were specifically designed to leverage resources and expertise  not commonly found outside of genome sequencing centers, and involve collaborations with leading  investigators in the field. We will employ 16S sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing, and GWAS to  test a hypothesis that mosquito innate immune genes play a role in shaping mosquito microbiome  communities, which have been demonstrated to affect vectorial capacity (Aim 1). We will employ extremely  sensitive single-cell transcriptomic profiling to bridge a key knowledge gap in the cues that cause P.  falciparum parasites to commit to sexual differentiation, which is essential for transmission (Aim 2). We will  create de novo assemblies of unprecedented quality to explore the heretofore uncharacterized genomic  dark matter' of Plasmodium subtelomeres, where important antigenic gene families mediating pathogenesis  reside and evolve (Aim 3). Finally, we will employ hybrid selection to enrich and sequence Plasmodium DNA  from a critical 10 year longitudinal collection of clinical malaria samples from northwestern Thailand, a region  where resistance to the current first line drug therapy (artemesinin) has recently arisen (Aim 4). We  hypothesize that changes in allele frequency associated with resistance will be detectable in a longitudinal  selection screen. The work we propose will not only push the frontier of malaria genomics into bold new  territories, but generate empirical and analytical approaches applicable to a broad range of diseases."

The most recent renewal (Years 31-35) proposed to reinvigorate this long term successful T32 by shifting the emphasis of training from predominantly clinical research to one providing translational neuroscience research training. We can now report that this transition has been highly successful as evidenced by a number of metrics: recruitment of translational neuroscience investigators, including increased numbers of M.D., Ph.D. trainees, female trainees, minority trainees, and trainees with disabilities; high rates of first grant fundig of graduates; research quality (as measured by the impact factor of journals in which appointees have published), and; successful placement of graduates. The achievements of T32 MH16084 have been mirrored by a substantial expansion of the Faculty of the Translational Neuroscience Program within the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, and a corresponding increase in the number of outstanding applicants, such that the annual number of eligible applicants has exceeded our slots 10-fold. As a result, we look to expand the number of postdoctoral trainee slots in the current application to a total of five. This will afford opportunties to these many outstanding candidates and provide a greater critical mass for translational neuroscience training activities. All trainees benefit from our established training program in translational neuroscience which has been designed to provide practical training in techniques and strategies such that trainees' resulting research can be translated across multiple levels of discovery. Trainees with prior basic neuroscience training further receive clinical exposures designed to help them develop fluency in the clinical, pathophysiologic, and pathologic manifestations of mental illness, and; clinically trained individuals enhance their fluency in basic neuroscience knowledge. In addition, our trainees benefit from the development of individualized training plans and from participation in our highly successful Career and Research Development curriculum. T32 MH16804 continues to be led by Robert A. Sweet, M.D., a senior translational neuroscience investigator with a record of outstanding mentorship of translational neuroscience investigators. Dr. Sweet will be supported by new Co- Director, Mary L. Phillips, M.D., M.D. (Cantab), a senior clinical and translational neuroscience investigator and  acclaimed mentor of imaging neuroscience investigators. Our Program Faculty has been enriched by a number of investigators who bring many additional state of the art approaches to translational neuroscience studies of mental illness. By combining the strong track record in the successful training of psychiatry researchers established during the past 34 years with the emphasis on new discovery and new methodologies developed during the past 4 years of funding, T32 MH16804 is now poised to impact the field by preparing an expanded cohort of translational neuroscientists to make transformative discoveries in psychiatry."

"9249665","The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which airway exposure to allergic stimuli primes peripheral blood eosinophils (EOS) to attach and extravasate into tlie lung to become effector cells contributing to the regulation of lymphocytes and fibroblasts thus contributing to ainway inflammation and remodeling in asthma. We propose that IL-3 stimulation of EOS contributes to Th17 lymphocyte development through EOS release of IL-1 p and production of factors relevant to tissue remodeling (Project 1). IL-3-stimulated EOS-derived production of semaphorin7A is hypothesized to activate fibroblasts to produce extracellular matrix (EClVI) components (Project 1). One of these components, periostin, may direct further recruitment of EOS from the blood to the airway (Project 2). Finally, airway ECM production is also regulated by EOS-secreted TGF-pi via signaling mechanisms involving the cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1 (Project 3). Mechanistic studies with peripheral blood EOS can be validated in vivo using the segmental allergen challenge model. The significance of the proposed research is that each project will contribute to the understanding of EOS biology in the asthmatic airway, potentially identifying several new drug targets that could modify the process of lung remodeling. To accomplish this and provide service to the projects. Core A is divided into the following Tasks: Specific Task 1 - To recruit and characterize allergic asthma subjects for participation in experimental protocols involving peripheral blood and airway EOS; Specific Tasl< 2 - To perform phlebotomy 4 days a week for the purification of peripheral blood EOS from patients with allergies or allergic asthma; Specific Tasl< 3 - To perform bronchoscopies with segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen (Ag-SBP) in subjects with asthma and obtain BAL fluid and endobronchial biopsies (Bx) before and after allergen challenge; Specific Task 4 - To perform basic processing and laboratory analysis of airway and blood samples that are not part of Core B, including immunohistochemistry, establishing fibroblasts cell lines from endobronchial Bx; and Specific Task 5 - To maintain high-quality HIPAA-compliant databases that includes subject demographic, clinical and physiologic characteristics, safety data, and basic BAL analysis, in addition to providing assistance in data retrieval, analysis, and presentation and to provide statistical support for all projects. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Given the central importance of EOS in the progression of asthma severity, this proposal will allow for a better understanding ofthe molecular basis of ainway remodeling and begin to develop a risl< signature that could be used for early detection of lung function decline. The ability to study newly recruited and activated ainway EOS in response to segmental allergen challenge maximally facilitates discovery translation."
"9258740","Project Summary Relapse to drug use even after extended periods of abstinence is a major obstacle in the rehabilitation of cocaine users. In rodents, experiments have consistently demonstrated that drug-seeking behavior, such as responding for cocaine-associated cues, progressively increases following abstinence from cocaine. A better understanding of the circuitry that underlies these abstinence-induced increases in drug-seeking behavior will be critical in developing hypothesis-driven therapeutic strategies for the prevention of relapse. Given the loss of control often observed in addiction, the prefrontal cortex, which exerts ?top-down? control on many downstream structures, has received a great deal of attention. However this region is highly heterogeneous, composed of many different neuronal subpopulations each with distinct patterns of afferent and efferent projections. To date, it has been difficult to ascertain what information is being encoded by projection-defined subpopulations during drug-seeking behavior, as well as how these populations contribute causally to increased drug-seeking following abstinence. The subpopulation of infralimbic (IL) neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is of particular interest, given the role of both of these structures in increased drug-seeking following abstinence. The proposed NRSA research plan will clarify the contribution of NAc-projecting IL neurons to increased cocaine-seeking behavior following abstinence by recording and manipulating activity specifically in this subpopulation of neurons. Specific Aim 1 will use cellular resolution calcium imaging to identify neural correlates of IL?NAc projecting neurons in rats during an extinction session to assess cue-induced cocaine- seeking. Behavior and neural correlates will be compared between rats before and after cocaine abstinence. Specific Aim 2 will use optogentics to examine the causal contribution of the IL?NAc projection to increased cocaine-seeking following abstinence. Rats will be trained to self-administer cocaine, and IL?NAc neurons will be optogenetically activated on a subset of trials during an extinction session to test cue-induced drug-seeking before or after prolonged abstinence. Drug-seeking will be compared between trials in which this pathway is activated versus trials in which it is not. By combining correlational and causal techniques, this research has the potential to provide novel insights for the development of relapse prevention therapies in clinical populations."
"9308575","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this project is to determine whether and how chronic psychosocial stressors might contribute to pre-clinical correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke in African-American women at midlife. It is well documented that older African-Americans have significantly higher rates of AD and stroke than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. However, in most studies of individuals over age 65, these disparities are already present, suggesting that factors responsible for the disparity occur much earlier in life. As the field has shifted to understanding the earliest changes in cognitive aging, the proposed project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate novel risk factors for adverse brain health in a recently funded study of vascular aging in African-American women aged 35-45. We will recruit a subsample of 100 African- American women of varying educational backgrounds from the parent study reporting high and low levels of chronic stress, respectively (N=50 from each group). Validated questionnaires will be utilized to measure overall chronic stress as well as chronic stressors known to be common among African-American women (i.e. discrimination, financial strain, neighborhood stressors and inadequate emotional support). Primary aims will compare high vs. low stress women on 1) measures of brain structure and vasculature (e.g. hippocampal volume and corticol thickness, microvascular disease, cerebral blood flow) using state of the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques; as well as 2) cognitive function, using a brief neuropsychological battery. We will also examine whether established (nocturnal blood pressure, arterial stiffness) and novel (regenerative capacity) markers of overall vascular risk impact these outcomes among African-American women in the target age range. The overall objective of this R21 project is to obtain effect sizes for a larger, prospective, R01- funded study. The long-term goal of this program of research is to understand the impact of and pathways through which chronic stress contributes to risk for AD and stroke in an understudied, yet vulnerable group of women."

"9313038","ABSTRACT Research Goals: To examine the role of treatment of insomnia on diabetes self-management behavior, symptom management (i. e. sleepiness and fatigue), and glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Data from this study will help inform a randomized clinical trial that will test a behavioral sleep intervention in this population. The long-term goal of this program of research is determine the effect of sleep disorders as a barrier to self-management and quality of life in populations with at risk for impaired health and well being and to develop behavioral interventions to improve symptoms and self-management. Career Development Goals: There are two career development goals: 1) to increase the applicant's knowledge and expertise in behavioral sleep medicine and 2) to provide sufficient time and increase skills as an effective mentor of doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. Research Project: Recent evidence supports that insomnia is a prevalent problem among persons with type 2 diabetes that may be associated with increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue, increased diabetes-related distress, decreased self-management behavior, and worse glycemic control. The main hypothesis of the current application is that a web-based cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (SHUTi) in persons with T2DM will not only improve their nighttime sleep, but also improve their ability to integrate diabetes education into their daily behavior and positively affect their glucose control compared to a web-based Information Control group. The aims of this study are to 1) obtain preliminary data to facilitate further hypothesis development and enhance the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial to examine if treatment of insomnia results in participant's being better able to integrate diabetes education into their self-management behavior and result in improved glucose control, 2) explore the associations among changes in insomnia severity, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, A1C and DSM behaviors, 3) explore average pre-intervention to post-intervention changes in insomnia severity, daytime symptoms (fatigue, sleepiness, mood) and DSM behaviors (diet and physical activity) in subjects treated with SHUTi + DSM compared to IC + DSM subjects at 3 months, and 4) explore sleep fragmentation as a potential physiological mechanism linking impaired glucose control (A1C) and sleep in subjects with insomnia and T2DM at baseline and 3 months. The proposed application is relevant to NINR's mission to: 1) support development of beginning and midcareer scientists, 2) to improve symptom science to reduce the effect of disordered sleep and prevent symptoms of illness and 3) improved the science of self- management by the development of innovative approaches to reduce barriers to the self-management of chronic disease."
"9260019","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is significant interest in the use of stem cells (SCs) as a therapy for myocardial repair after myocar- dial infarction. However, the survival of SCs, after transplantation to the injured myocardium, has been poor and will limit the beneficial effect of these therapies. Understanding how SCs interact with the injured post- ischemic myocardium will provide critical insight that can be used to optimize SC therapies.  The pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic, and pro-fibrotic milieu of the post-ischemic myocardium creates a hostile microenvironment that affects the function of transplanted SCs, limiting their survival. Cell death can occur due to apoptosis and/or necrosis, and in both scenarios mitochondrial dysfunction has been placed at the center of these events, with dysmodulation of their outer membrane potential, leading to initiation of the apoptotic/necrotic cascade. Thus, the mitochondria appear as a critical organelle that can determine the sur- vival of transplanted SCs.  The Principal Investigator has previously shown that reporter gene bioluminescence imaging (BLI) can be used to accurately and longitudinally monitor cell viability non-invasively. Recently, we have developed and validated a reporter gene-based imaging sensor to monitor the biology of the mitochondria, and understand the interaction between transplanted SCs and the ischemic myocardium. The hypothesis of this proposal is that the mitochondrial function of transplanted SCs, as a read-out of the interaction between the post-ischemic myocardium and SCs, can be monitored non-invasively, and that such imaging strategies can be adapted for clinical use. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that the interaction between the post-ischemic myocardium and transplanted SCs can be monitored non-invasively, using mitochondrial function as an indicator of the health of SCs. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that this mitochondrial function monitoring strategy can be applied to a large animal model of cardiac disease. Here, we will use molecular imaging strategies to study the interaction between SCs and the ischemic myocardium. Furthermore, we will provide proof-of-concept for the clinical translation of these strate- gies."
"9246415","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries."
"9260732","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes future work of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). The goal is to deconstruct the complete genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to determine how all inherited factors contribute to the AD phenotype. To this end we will identify, annotate, replicate, and validate all DNA variants that increase risk or protect against AD, determine what genes are connected to these variants, and evaluate the contribution of each to total AD risk. The rationale for the following genetics/genomics project is to: 1) Predict who will develop AD. 2) Fully reveal all AD genetics in all ethnic groups. 3) Understand the pathogenesis of AD. 4) Identify novel therapeutic targets for AD. Therefore, we will identify new genes/therapeutic targets for AD using methods that make use of data from not only genotyping arrays but also massively parallel DNA sequence approaches. Because much of what we know about AD genetics comes from Caucasians AD studies, we will focus future analysis on not only Caucasians but also on African Americans, Latinos, and Asians. To resolve AD genetics, we will: in AIM 1, use functional genomics to identify AD risk and protective variants in cis- acting regulatory elements, and identifying the genes affected by these CREs; in AIM 2, we will use in silico systems biology approaches to integrate information from all AD genes to identify interaction networks and pathways relevant to AD; in AIM 3, we will identify additional AD rare-variant genes using gene-based (including CREs) analyses. All ethnic groups will be analyzed by these methods; in AIM 4, we will perform whole exome sequencing on African American subjects to generalize findings made on Caucasians, to refine gene localization, to identify novel variants, and to identify novel genes found only in other ethnic groups. This will be followed up by targeted sequencing in African Americans and Latinos; in AIM 5 we will assemble and harmonize phenotypes available in multiple cohorts to identify subtypes of AD and genes associated with variants associated with those subtypes."
"9230820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2), which regulates the rate-limiting final step of glycolysis, is instrumental in tumorigenesis. In additionto its well-studied role in cell metabolism, PKM2 promotes cell proliferation though an unknown mechanism. Our recent published and preliminary data show that activation of EGFR results in PKM2 translocation into the nucleus, where PKM2 interacts with ?-catenin and mediates ?-catenin-transactivation. In addition, PKM2 phosphorylates histone H3 and Bub3, subsequently regulating gene transcription and cell mitosis, respectively. We hypothesize that PKM2 has an essential role in controlling gene expression and different phases of cell cycle progression, which is instrumental in EGFR activation-promoted tumor development. In Specific Aim 1, we will further elucidate the mechanisms underlying PKM2-mediated gene transcription and identify PKM2-regulated expression of genes in cancer cells by genome-wide screening. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms underlying PKM2-regulated chromosome segregation. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the role of PKM2- regulated gene transcription and chromosome segregation in EGFR-promoted tumorigenesis. We expect that our proposed research will provide important and previously unrevealed mechanisms of EGFR-promoted tumor development via nonmetabolic functions of PKM2. Building on our findings, therapeutic strategies targeting PKM2-regulated gene expression may be developed to enhance current EGFR-based cancer therapies."

Defects in these systems lead to metal ion metabolic disease and result in cellular, tissue, and systemic pathology. The iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway contains a conserved set of proteins that synthesizes Fe-S clusters, which are then distributed by a network of cluster transfer and conversion factors to hundreds of Fe-S dependent proteins. Here we focus on the structure of the eukaryotic Fe-S assembly complex and the mechanism of cluster biosynthesis. We show that a stable low activity Fe-S assembly complex can be activated by binding of the Friedreich's ataxia protein (frataxin; FXN), and that the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) has a moonlighting function as a component critical for the stability and function of the assembly complex. Further, our crystal structure of the core (NFS1-ISD11-ACP; called SDA) of the eukaryotic Fe-S assembly complex revealed a dramatically different architecture compared to the prokaryotic system that is stabilized by a novel ACP-lipid interaction with the hydrophobic core of ISD11. Here, we will build upon these paradigm shifting results to determine structural and dynamic information for binding accessory proteins to the SDA core of the Fe-S assembly complex, elucidate how ACP-lipid interactions modulate functional properties for the assembly complex, and provide mechanistic insight into FXN based activation and Fe-S cluster formation. This fundamental research will establish a framework for emerging genetic results and discoveries and provide a basis for understanding defects in iron-sulfur cluster metabolism relevant to human health and disease."
"9318651","PROJECT SUMMARY Portrayals of vaping in televised e-cigarettes ads, which are currently unregulated and broadcast widely, could adversely impact young adult smokers? use of conventional cigarettes by triggering urges to smoke, and more intensive smoking behaviors. There is little known about the causal links between exposure to vaping images in e-cigarette ads, urge to smoke a conventional cigarette, and objective measures of conventional cigarette smoking intensity. This lack of knowledge impedes efforts to protect young adults, who have the highest prevalence of dual-use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes (current smokers who also use e-cigarettes) and are the primary target of e-cigarette advertising. Our long-term goal is to generate more effective strategies to reduce smoking among young adults who have the highest prevalence of smoking. The objective of this study, which is the next step toward this goal, is to identify key factors within tobacco advertising that influence young adult smoking in order to inform targeted interventions. Our central hypothesis is that vaping portrayals have similar effects as smoking cues on urge to smoke and can promote more intensive smoking among young adult smokers. Our rationale for this hypothesis is based on cue reactivity research and theory. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized controlled experiment among young adult dual-users (current smokers who also vape) aged 21-30 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 3 video conditions to view: 1) e-cigarette ads containing vaping portrayals, 2) control e-cigarette ads edited to remove vaping portrayals, or 3) control neutral videos. Our specific aims are to demonstrate the causal link between vaping portrayals in e-cigarette ads and subjective measures of urge to smoke among dual-users (QSU-brief) (Aim 1) and demonstrate the causal link between vaping portrayals in e-cigarette ads and objective measures of smoking intensity based on puffing topography measures (Aim 2). The proposed research is innovative because it will be the first to apply a randomized controlled experiment to directly observe smoking behavior within the e-cigarette cue reactivity research paradigm, itself a newly emerging area of inquiry. This research is significant because it will provide the first causal evidence to examine whether specific content within e- cigarette ads directly increases smoking behavior among young adults, which addresses a priority research interest of the NIH-FDA Tobacco Regulatory Science Program (the impact of tobacco marketing). Impact: The successful completion of this study will provide evidence to determine whether vaping portrayals in e-cigarette ads promote smoking among young adults. This evidence will support the development and implementation of policy interventions, including advertising restrictions, as well as anti-smoking health communication campaigns that would mitigate harm to public health from e-cigarette ads."

"9294366","PROJECT SUMMARY Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition that affects 2 to 3% of Americans and is associated with substantial distress, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Research has also shown that a substantial proportion of individuals seeking treatment for OCD fail to respond. Given the negative impact of OCD, there is growing recognition for comprehensive models of the etiology and development of OCD that can better inform treatment and prevention efforts. Recent evidence from research employing multiple levels of analysis has shown a strong relation between disgust proneness and OCD. However, much remains unknown about the nature and function of disgust in OCD. A better understanding of the neural substrates of disgust proneness in OCD may aid ongoing efforts to improve treatment outcome. Preliminary research from our lab suggests that symptoms of OCD may be characterized by heightened disgust learning and a resistance to disgust extinction. The proposed research is designed to expand on this preliminary work by taking an endophenotypic approach to better understanding the neural basis of disgust learning and extinction in OCD. Such an approach may not only provide clues to underlying candidate genes contributing to OCD, but this approach may also point the way to a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms that interact to confer risk. To investigate the neural correlates of disgust learning and extinction as an endophenotype in OCD, the proposed study will measure brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance on a novel disgust conditioning task in 30 OCD patients, 30 of their unaffected first-degree relatives, and 30 unrelated matched controls. The specific aims will identify large-scale brain systems in which activation is associated with variation in disgust learning and extinction. Specifically, the investigation will examine the extent to which heightened disgust learning and a resistance to disgust extinction, occurring predominantly in patients and relatives, is associated with activation in the anterior insula. These aims are consistent with the Research Domain Criteria project (RDoC) recently launched by the NIHM and the findings have the potential to advance current understanding of the development of OCD above and beyond traditional approaches."
"9328279","Project Summary  Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a core cell contact and signaling pathway that is largely conserved from Drosophila to mammals, and is fundamental to early development and tissue organization in complex, multicellular organisms. The long-term goal of this study is to further our understanding of how central PCP protein, Celsr1, mediates adhesive interactions required for the establishment and maintenance of PCP. Acting orthogonally to apico-basal polarity, PCP is the collective and organized polarization of cells along a tissue plane. A striking example of PCP is the ordered alignment of body hairs on mammalian skin. Core components of this pathway include: Celsr (Flamingo/Fmi), Frizzled (Fz), Vangl (VanGogh/Vang), Dishevelled (Dvl), Prickle (Pk) and Diego (Dgo). A hallmark feature of PCP is the asymmetric localization of Fzd/Dv/Dgo and Vangl/Pk at cell borders within a junctional complex organized via intercellular interactions of Celsr, a large atypical cadherin and member of the GPCR super-family. Disrupting Celsr function in mice leads to a range of detrimental phenotypes including neural tube defects, abnormal hair patterning and embryonic lethality. Further, multiple Celsr mutations in humans have been associated with neural tube defects and diseases such as spina bifida and cardiomyopathies. While important developmental roles for Celsr at the tissue-level have been established with mouse and fly studies, an understanding of Celsr function at the molecular and cell level is lacking. To elucidate how PCP asymmetry is achieved, we need to define the mechanisms of Celsr1 extracellular adhesion. The mouse skin is an ideal model system to investigate the conserved mechanisms of PCP and our lab has recently established a spontaneously polarizing in vitro, organotypic model system for assaying PCP asymmetry and function. Super-resolution imaging techniques such as structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) further add to our robust toolbox to study epidermal PCP. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate how the principle PCP protein, Celsr1, mediates extracellular adhesion to coordinate functional PCP. We hypothesize that Celsr1 cadherin repeats mediate intercellular and lateral adhesive interactions required for asymmetrical PCP protein localization and function. Understanding how individual cell-cell interactions at the molecular level contribute to tissue structure and function will fill a substantial and fundamental knowledge gap in the PCP field. This proposal integrates molecular biology, biochemistry and advanced microscopy approaches to elucidate mechanisms of PCP asymmetry and function in vitro and in vivo. Completion of these studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms the regulate PCP in the mammalian epidermis at the most fundamental level and illuminate our conceptual understanding of PCP complex formation and function."
"9219500","PROJECT ABSTRACT Molecular and genetic analysis of novel Slicer-dependent miRNA pathways in blood  Most conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) are generated by a biogenesis pathway that deposits them into an Argonaute effector, guiding them to broad regulatory target networks. Amongst the cohort of four mammalian Argonautes, only Ago2 has catalytic ability to cleave transcripts, an enzymatic activity known as Slicing that underlies experimental RNA interference. Nevertheless, the endogenous biological usage of mammalian Slicing remains largely mysterious. Our previous and ongoing studies provide the unexpected perspective of multiple Slicing-dependent biogenesis strategies that generate both Dicer-independent and Dicer-dependent erythroid miRNAs. These data strongly support our hypothesis that a dominant usage of Ago2 catalysis is to generate specific conserved miRNAs in the blood system. Our extensive preliminary data are the basis of (1) a series of biochemical and genomic experiments to elucidate a novel Slicing-dependent miRNA biogenesis mechanism, (2) genetic studies of novel knockout animals of erythroid, Slicing-dependent miRNAs in normal development, blood homeostasis and leukemia, and (3) molecular genetic analyses that seek to connect dysregulated processes in Ago2-catalytically defective blood system to specific Slicing- dependent miRNAs. These studies will bring new insights on post-transcriptional control of erythroid development, homeostasis, and blood cancer, as well as pinpoint the functional basis of mammalian RNAi to the generation of erythroid-specific miRNAs."
"9467778","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to establish a series of nonhuman primate models for the investigation of human visual system disorders. Currently, the mouse is the predominant model system used in this field, largely due to our ability to generate genetically engineered animals for the study of specific diseases. However, despite their similarities with humans, mice and other rodents do not have a cone-rich macula, the region most critical for human vision. Therefore, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model system that more closely matches human will offer important new insights into disease processes and provide much improved opportunities for development and testing of novel treatments or preventions for specific eye diseases. Our initial sequencing results from ~200 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) indicate that the genetic diversity among macaques is much greater than among people. Among the macaques, we found many individuals carrying pathogenic mutations in known human retinal disease genes. Therefore, the macaque model represents a golden but currently untapped opportunity for innovative research. It is feasible to leverage existing infrastructure to generate a wide range of novel primate models (breeding lines with informative mutations) that will be invaluable for research concerning pathogenesis and the development of treatments. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and begin exploiting its potential, we propose to: Aim 1. Perform targeted sequencing of retinal disease genes in 1,600 individual rhesus macaques. Aim 2. Establish a mutational database for macaque eye genes. Aim 3. Generate multiple macaque models of human eye diseases. Aim 4. Characterize the phenotypes produced and begin testing of treatments of macaque models"

"9274428","Project Summary/Abstract:  Funding is requested for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible postitron emission tomography (PET) insert to upgrade an existing small animal 4.7T MRI scanner to allow for simultaneous MR-PET. The upgrade would result in the first small bore simultaneous MR-PET scanner in the northeast United States. The proposed instrument will be a crucial component in facilitating the development and synthesis of novel molecular imaging probes and for the identification of biomarkers for specific disease states and biological processes. The small animal simultaneous MR-PET scanner will serve a large NIH-funded user community encompassing a wide variety of biomedical disciplines. We currently serve users both within the MGH/Harvard/MIT system as well as from around the greater Boston/Cambridge region. While there has been an explosion of interest in simultaneous MR-PET molecular imaging, currently users do not have access to a small animal simultaneous MR-PET scanner in which to test, optimize, and validate new molecular imaging contrast agents. Our current clinical simultaneous MR-PET scanners do not have sufficient PET or MR resolution for small animal imaging and are oversubscribed with clinical studies in any event.  The requested equipment would greatly expand our capacity to serve the local NIH-funded user community, as well as offer an important facility for rapidly expanding the user base with molecular imaging interests. In particular, the proposed instrument would allow for testing and validating new molecular imaging probes, development of bimodal probes, and for performing combined advanced MR and PET studies of brain and cardiac structure and function. The molecular imaging upgrade will accelerate the current research of 15 NIH- funded research programs supported by 6 NIH Institutes, 1 DoD-funded program, and two institutionally funded projects. Projects requiring the PET insert and the MRI scanner upgrades include the development of PET or multimodal probes for studying (1) thrombosis, (2) pulmonary fibrosis, (3) cancers (brain, breast, colorectal, carcinoid, hepatocellular carcinoma), (4) response to tumor therapies, (5) chronic kidney disease, (6) hepatitis, (7) arthritis, (8) heart disease, (9) gulf war illness, (10) drug abuse, (11) neuroscience, and (12) stroke. The PET insert will also enable methodology projects that seek to improve the performance and accuracy of PET by combining MR measures to correct for motion and partial volume effects."
"9306482","Abstract  Colon cancer is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in United States of America. Chemoresistance (drug resistance) of tumors is the primary reason for the failure of chemotherapy and the major cause of mortality in colon cancer. The molecular mechanisms involved in chemoresistance or approaches to resensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota and microbial metabolites play a crucial role in the development and progression of colon cancer but their role in chemoresistance remains unknown. Towards this goal, we investigated the influence of commensal microbial metabolite, Urolithin A (UroA) on cancer chemotherapy. UroA is a microbial metabolite derived from ellagic acid and ellagitannins, which are major components of berries and pomegranate. Our preliminary data showed that UroA significantly reduced bacteria induced inflammation in macrophages and protected from lipopolysaccharide induced barrier dysfunction by upregulating junctional proteins in colon epithelial cells. More importantly, UroA significantly increased the chemosensitization of colon cancer cells to 5florouracil (5FU) by down regulating drug transporters and modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways. The combination therapy significantly reduced colony formation of colon cancer cells as well as blocked cancer cell migration. By screening several novel structural analogues of UroA, we have identified a potent compound, UAS03, which displayed increased chemosensitizing activities compared to UroA. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that ?UroA and UAS03 act as chemosensitizing adjuvants in 5-FU therapies through regulation of drug transporters and cancer stemness. The goal of the proposal is to determine the effects of microbial derived metabolites (UroA and its analogue UAS03) on colon cancer chemotherapy, especially 5FU resistant cancers. In aim1, we propose to identify the molecular target of UroA using bioactive biotinylated UroA; to determine the molecular mechanisms of UroA and UAS03 mediated chemosensitization of 5FU-resistance (5FUR) colon cancer cells. In aim 2, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of UroA or UAS03 in combination with 5 FU in preclinical colon cancer models. We will utilize both implantable (tumors generated by 5FUR colon cancer cells) and azoxymethane-DSS models. The successful completion of these studies will delineate regulatory mechanisms of microbial metabolite (UroA) mediated chemosensitization and offer better therapeutic options for colon cancer."
"9242615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in the United States is predominantly an asymptomatic disease characterized by mild hypercalcemia and elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Over the past 28 years, this research project has defined clinical, biochemical, densitometric, and histomorphometric features of PHPT. The project has also led to new insights into mechanisms of bone loss, with particular reference to PTH's actions at cortical and cancellous sites. We have also characterized new phenotypes of PHPT in patients whose serum calcium concentration is normal but in whom PTH levels are chronically elevated in the absence of any underlying secondary cause. Some of these patients already have indications of skeletal or renal involvement. Others, particularly those who are identified from community-dwelling subjects, are asymptomatic. In the renewal period, we propose to study further specific microstructural aspects of PHPT as they relate to cortical and trabecular compartments of the skeleton as well as to characterize further normocalcemic variants of PHPT. In hypercalcemic subjects, we will determine whether interventions such as surgery, denosumab (a RANK L inhibitor) or mechanical stress can reverse or ameliorate specific features that are present at baseline. The project is also designed to test the hypothesis that PTH is a regulator of both cortical and trabecular compartments of bone. State of the art techniques include: new approaches to non-invasive microstructural skeletal analysis with High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Tomography, Individual Trabecula Segmentation Analysis, and microfinite element modeling. With well-defined cohorts of PHPT and these new technologies and approaches, we are in position to define microstructural, elements of PHPT to an extent never before accomplished and with an array of methodologies that will be unique to this disease. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. to determine the extent to which trabecular and cortical indices are abnormal in PHPT; 2. to determine whether and to what extent abnormalities in skeletal microstructure are improved after parathyroid surgery, with denosumab; or after mechanical loading; 3. to determine the extent to which PTH regulates both cortical and skeletal compartments of bone. By the end of the renewal period, we will have fully characterized in PHPT: microstructural features of cortical and trabecular compartments of bone; their reversibility; and the role of PTH as a regulator of microstructural features of skeletl compartments. We will also have identified completely 2 variants of normocalcemic PHPT. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of PHPT and also be highly relevant to clinical management of this common metabolic bone disease."
"9248413","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmic drug therapy, response in an individual patient is highly variable with frequent AF recurrence. The limited success of drug therapy has been attributed in part to failure to target therapy to underlying mechanisms. Recent experimental work from our group and others in mouse models suggests that Ca leak via type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) Ca release channels is one important mechanism responsible for triggering paroxysmal AF. While Ca leak has been documented in atrial tissue from AF patients, the causal relationship to human AF remains controversial. Hence, proposed here will test our overarching hypothesis that leaky RyR2 channels confer AF risk that can be targeted therapeutically in humans. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that the R-enantiomer of propafenone is the most potent inhibitor of RyR2 Ca release among clinically approved antiarrhythmic drugs. R-propafenone was strikingly effective in suppressing Ca-triggered focal AF in calsequestrin null mice (Casq2-/-), whereas S-propafenone that largely lacks RyR2 blocking properties was significantly less effective. Since R- and S-propafenone are equipotent Na channel blockers and racemic propafenone is used clinically, the two propafenone enantiomers can be used as tools to determine the contribution of leaky RyR2 channels to AF risk in humans, enabling us to translate findings from mice to patients. In humans, common AF-associated 4q25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) are currently the strongest genetic markers of AF risk. While the functional effects of the SNPs remain controversial, our published data show that individuals carrying 4q25 risk alleles respond better to Class IC drugs flecainide and propafenone, both of which also inhibit RyR2 channels. In contrast, Class III drugs that lack RyR2 blocking properties were less effective in 4q25 carriers. These results raise the exciting possibility to be tested below that 4q25 risk alleles are markers for leaky RyR2 channels in humans with AF.  Hence, Aim 1 will determine whether Ca leak contributes to the underlying pro-arrhythmic mechanism in diverse mouse models with inducible AF: Pitx2 haploinsufficient mice (Pitx2+/-), mice carrying human AF mutations in the cardiac Na channel (Scn5a-D1275N) in the atrial natriuretic peptide (mut-NPPA), and in troponin T that causes atrial hypertrophy and fibrosis (TnT-F110I). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms predict response to drug therapy in mice. The clinical trial in Aim 3 will test whether results from murine AF models predict antiarrhythmic drug efficacy in humans with paroxysmal AF, and whether the 4q25 risk alleles can identify AF patients who will benefit from RyR2 channel block. Accomplishing the aims could provide proof of concept that mouse AF research is translatable to humans, and that drug testing at the time of AF ablation in the clinical EP lab may help individualize AF drug therapy."

"9277669","ABSTRACT Veterinarian-scientists provide critical disciplinary and technical expertise for advancing biomedical research. Due to their broad understanding of animal anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and disease, they possess key knowledge for cross-species comparative medicine and for experimentally-induced and naturally occurring animal models of human diseases. Veterinarian-scientists also provide contributions to human welfare through critical roles in One Health initiatives, including in global food security and in emerging and zoonotic diseases. Of importance is that approximately 75% of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are diseases of animal origin. However, the US National Research Council, an NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Working Group Report, and the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs have all emphasized that the veterinarian-scientist workforce is far underrepresented and underutilized in biomedical research. Reasons for this include limited access by veterinary students to biomedical research programs and appropriate training. The objective of our ?Veterinary Summer Scholars in Comparative Medicine? T35 training program is to provide direct biomedical research experiences to first and second-year veterinary students to increase the numbers of researchers in the veterinary-scientist pipeline. Our approach will consist of 1) providing opportunities to conduct biomedical research in an environment of collaboration and discovery provided by mentors who are basic and clinical-scientists, and 2) providing research training in the form of lectures and discussions focused on responsible conduct and ethics in research, experimental design and quality assurance, research communication, and career pathways in the biomedical sciences. New innovations described in this renewal application include increased opportunities for continued research experiences during veterinary school, as well as interprofessional interactions by our veterinary students with other health professionals to promote team-science.

"9301651","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human memory is essential for everyday living, shows robust trajectories of improvement across childhood, and is known to be impaired in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is substantial data in memory physiology in adults but a paucity of information on how this core human skill emerges in children. Further, noninvasive techniques used to probe the neural basis of human memory development are unable to measure both the spatial and temporal properties of memory at high resolution. Electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients with surgically implanted subdural electrodes for treatment of intractable epilepsy is a powerful tool for examining the neural basis of human cognition. ECoG provides the spatial and temporal resolution needed to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of memory during childhood. This is the first project that will focus on assessing the neural basis of memory in children using ECoG. In the patient cohort, memory will be assessed with both ECoG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This will generate a multimodal data set to study basic questions regarding the development of memory but can also address fundamental unresolved questions on the neural signals recorded with fMRI. Additional fMRI data collected from a large sample of healthy children will help us determine the age differences in activation and connectivity between the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), key regions in the memory network. The ECoG data from pediatric epilepsy patients will be used to contextualize those developmental findings with remarkably high spatial and temporal precision that is not available with noninvasive methods commonly used with children. Our central hypothesis is that increased communication between MTL and PFC underlies memory capacity across healthy development. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing: Specific Aim 1) Identify regional activation supporting memory in children using ECoG and fMRI; and Specific Aim 2) Identify inter-regional interactions supporting memory in children using ECoG and fMRI. Reliable ECoG measures for pre-surgical mapping of memory networks in children with intractable focal epilepsy undergoing resective surgery will ultimately be used to predict memory deficits following surgical resection. To that end, the investigators will determine whether the extent of surgical disruption of memory- related sites identified by ECoG activity predicts post-operative memory outcome (Specific Aim 3). Thus, findings from this project will provide crucial information for the future development of tools for pre-surgical mapping of memory networks in children with focal epilepsy. Such clinical applications will influence diagnostic and therapeutic surgical approaches, and ultimately improve quality of life in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy."
"9249040","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC) mediates salt reabsorption in the distal nephron (DN) of the kidney and is a key determinant of the blood pressure set point. With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases regulate NCC membrane trafficking, phosphorylation status, and activity. One member of this family, WNK1, is expressed in the distal nephron as two major classes of isoforms with opposing functions. Long isoforms of WNK1 that possess intact serine-threonine kinase activity (L-WNK1) stimulate NCC. In contrast, short kidney-specific WNK1 isoforms that lack a kinase domain (KS-WNK1) inhibit NCC by antagonizing L-WNK1. Prior work indicates that the balance of these kinase-active and -defective products controls NCC activity, effectively functioning as an isoform switch. The upstream mechanisms regulating WNK1 isoform balance, however, remain obscure. Our preliminary data suggest that aldosterone is a physiologically relevant stimulus that signals through the WNK1 switch to activate NCC-mediated salt reabsorption in the kidney. This proposal is driven by three novel observations: (1) First, in DN cell lines, aldosterone increases total WNK1 protein expression, but has a stronger effect on kinase active L-WNK1 than kinase defective KS-WNK1; this triggers downstream signaling events that increase NCC plasma membrane abundance and phosphorylation. (2) Second, WNK1 isoforms enriched at the protein level in the DN contain PY motifs- sequences which bind to Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose activity is suppressed by aldosterone. (3) Third, although KS-WNK1 transcript levels are high in the DN, it is an inherently unstable protein, and comparative studies with L-WNK1 indicate striking differences in steady state expression and protein turnover. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that aldosterone increases the total protein abundance of WNK1 isoforms in the distal nephron via Nedd4-2 inhibition, adjusting their ratio to favor increased L-WNK1 activity and NCC activation. To critically test this model, we propose to answer three questions about the regulation of WNK1 isoforms that remain incompletely addressed. First, how does the inhibition of Nedd4-2 by aldosterone regulate WNK1 protein expression and NCC activation? Second, why do L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 exhibit different protein turnover rates? Third, how does aldosterone affect the WNK1 isoform switch in vivo? Answering these questions should provide novel insights into the molecular basis of aldosterone action, NCC regulation, and blood pressure homeostasis. Completion of the proposed aims will therefore improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of essential hypertension and highlight new strategies for its treatment."
"9248315","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Release from jail marks a key transition in the life of the inmate. On the one hand, the days, months, and years ahead represent the promise of a fresh start, the possibility of the gold-standard outcome of incarceration: rehabilitation. On the other hand, it also marks the threat of tremendous psychological, relational, and economic challenge as one seeks to re-integrate into the community, not to mention the statistical likelihood of recidivism. Practitioners and scholars alike have long-sought to explain who thrives and who recidivates after release from jail, noting that a predictive window on the matter could give way to possible interventions aimed at improving individual, familial, and community well-being. The proposed project aims to examine community connectedness as one such explanatory variable. Does the extent to which incarcerated offenders, on the brink of release from jail, feel connected to two distinct communities-the community at large and the criminal community-predict both desirable and undesirable outcomes in the years following release? In addition, how do feelings of connectedness to each community change over time? Lastly, can community connectedness be effectively targeted by an existing restorative justice based victim impact intervention? These questions are at the center of the proposed analyses. This project will draw upon two existing longitudinal studies of jail inmates (n = 508, and n = 222). Inmates' connectedness to the community at large and the criminal community is assessed shortly after their arrival in jail, prior to release, and up to four years post-release. First, pre-release community connectedness will be used to predict functioning (e.g., substance dependence, employment) up to four years after release. Next, normative and individual level changes in feelings of connectedness to the community at large and the criminal community will be analyzed to better understand the malleability of community connectedness. Individual factors such as participation in group-based interventions (e.g., 12-step programs) during incarceration and returning to neighborhoods with high contextual risk (e.g., violence) are expected to contribute to individual changes in community connectedness. Lastly, changes in feelings of connectedness to the community at large and the criminal community will be examined in response to an existing restorative justice based Impact of Crime (IOC) intervention in a local jail. Specifically, this project will test the hypothesis that the IOC intervention results in posiive post-release adjustment (e.g., community functioning) due to changes in feelings of connectedness to the community at large and the criminal community. Factors such as substance dependence and psychopathy will be explored as moderators of this relationship. Ultimately, these findings will fill a substantial gap in the scientific literature on community connectedness among offenders and can inform correctional treatment and reentry services aimed at decreasing antisocial behavior and increasing adaptive functioning in the community."
"9250220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that disrupts proper motor movement and behavior. Motor movement is regulated by the striatum, which integrates excitatory inputs in the form of glutamate from the cortex and thalamus. While it is known that excitatory inputs to the striatum are specifically affected in PD, it has been difficult to precisely parse out whether cortical or thalamic inputs are responsible for these aberrant adaptations. Recent methodological advances in the field now provide the unique opportunity to directly examine if cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs are differentially modulated in PD, and what the mechanisms of these changes are. In this proposal, we employ the use of genetically modified mice and virus injections to allow for selective expression of blue-light activated channels (channel rhodopsin) in either corticostriatal (CS) or thalamostriatal (TS) terminals to the striatum. By simultaneously activating specific excitatory terminals and performing whole-cell patch clamp on identified principle striatal cells, our experiments will provide for a high-resolution assessment of the differential effects of CS and TS activation on striatal neurons. Combined with 2-photon laser microscopy, calcium imaging, glutamate uncaging and mouse genetics, this proposal aims to provide a unique, multi-faceted approach to study the excitatory connections in the basal ganglia, and the mechanisms of how PD states alter these connections. Based on our compelling preliminary findings, we propose the following three specific hypotheses: 1) The long-term plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in the striatum are differentially regulated based on pre-synaptic cell type (CS vs TS) and not post-synaptic cell targets, 2) CS and TS terminals input onto different regions of striatal neuron dendrites, causing for differential non-linear integration, and 3) Activation of different DA receptors and chronic dopamine depletion will result in bi-directional modulation of synaptic integration through specific downstream pathways. Our novel findings on synaptic plasticity and non-linear integration suggest that the study of striatal input compartmentalization is critical in understanding normal and aberrant striatal function. These studies will close this gap in our knowledge of striatal integration and create a new window into our understanding of PD, potentially providing better tools and novel therapeutic targets for the disease."
"9230333","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic gastric inflammation, typically caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), is the most consistent lesion  leading to cancer. During a well-choreographed interaction between H. pylori and the host, the progression  from chronic inflammation to cancer involves gastric epithelial changes with evidence of hyperproliferation and  the disruption of normal gland morphology and differentiation. Although H. pylori virulence factors are known  to interfere with signaling pathways in gastric epithelial cells, the identity of these target cells is unknown.  Abnormal differentiation (metaplasia) is associated with cancer and seems to reflect a permanent alteration in  the behavior of the stem cells, thus making the gastric stem cell a candidate H. pylori target. The objective of  this proposal is to identify the underlying mechanism by which H. pylori-host interactions trigger the disruption  of epithelial cell differentiation and thus the cascade leading to cancer. The acquisition of such knowledge is  the first step in a continuum of research required to achieve our long-term goal that is to understand the  pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastric cancer. The central hypothesis is that H. pylori primarily triggers  hyperproliferation of the stem cell compartment in both the fundus and antrum leading to aberrant epithelial cell  differentiation. Moreover we hypothesize that differences in fundic pathology triggered by H pylori are due to  differences in target cell activation in the fundus versus antrum. The hypothesis has been formulated on the  basis of preliminary studies produced in our laboratory demonstrating the first successful efforts to generate  three-dimensional human gastric organoids (hGOs) de novo through directed differentiation of human  pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). hGOs are antral in nature and can be used to effectively model the early  stages of H. pylori infection. The rationale for these studies is to acquire an understanding of the molecular  mechanisms by which H. pylori infection colonizes the stomach and induces disease. Acquiring such  knowledge may allow us to then develop techniques to disrupt bacterial colonization and thus prevent disease  progression. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis is tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)  What are the primary H. pylori target cells during infection of the antrum? and 2) What are the molecular  pathways that regulate development of fundic organoids? The hypothesis will be tested using genetic lineage  tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing. The research proposed is innovative, because it focuses on novel  approaches that will allow us to assay changes in gastric epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in  relation to the direct interaction with H. pylori. Conceptually innovative, the current proposal will identify novel  insights into the direct interaction between H. pylori and the host gastric epithelium independent of the immune  response. Moreover the current study has the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanism by  which H. pylori may alter the gastric stem cell fate. The proposed research is significant because it is expected  to provide knowledge that is crucial to our understanding of the role of H. pylori as a carcinogen."
"9453744","The promise of Precision Medicine in the United States can be most effectively realized on a large scale in the next decades if a research infrastructure is established and accessible to scientists across the nation and includes a large and engaged study population with comprehensive health and lifestyle histories linked to biospecimens and clinical data. Investigators from 4 integrated delivery networks (IDNs) spanning 7 states of the Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN, est. as HMORN in 1994), Henry Ford Health System and its partner Spectrum Health (HF-SH) in Michigan, Baylor Scott & White (BSW) in Texas, Essentia Health (EH) located in Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Idaho, and Meyers-Fallon Primary Care Institute (MF) located in Massachusetts, have come together to form the PRECISION MEDICINE TRANS-AMERICA CONSORTIUM for the HCSRN (TACH) for the purpose of recruiting, enrolling and retaining 10,000 patient volunteers, herein designated as Patient Partners, into the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program, at two of the sites in the initial 12 month period, with the potential to expand to even more HCSRN locations. The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) represents a major shift in the way research is conceptualized in the US. Rather than several small disease specific prospective studies, this major initiative develops the largest single prospective study involving patients and individuals with diverse sets of clinical histories, environmental exposures, demographics, genetic susceptibility, and beliefs about medical care. Furthermore, as opposed to researchers collecting data and restricting access to the outside scientific community, this study seeks to develop an open access structure whereby scientists can leverage the same data and infrastructure to make new discoveries and revolutionize medical care. Most importantly, this initiative seeks to engage participants as lifelong partners, such that by agreeing to share their data, Patient Partners will receive data and feedback on their own risk and protective factors for diseases. Finally, by combining all of these unique data sources, we can move towards tailoring treatments to patients. This, clearly, represents a new age of research, and our TACH network fully-supports and embraces this movement. We not only share the important philosophy of the NIH and the PMI, but have demonstrated this philosophy in our prior work. As we will describe, we have the resources, network, and experience to become a successful Regional Medical Center Healthcare Provider Organization (RMC-HPO) network in the PMI Cohort Program (PMI-CP). Our proposed TACH network draws upon the strengths of the HCSRN, a consortium of 18 large IDNs serving the vast majority of U.S. states. Our proposed network involves four HCSRN sites (HF-SH, BSW, EH, and MF). All participating HCSRN sites have a standard Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW), which has extensive clinical and demographic information for all members. This data infrastructure is extremely innovative for multisite studies. The VDW includes a combination of electronic health records (EHR) and insurance claims data, which allows the capture of nearly all health care utilization (~99%) within and outside of the system. Data on demographics, encounters, prescriptions, diagnoses, procedures, and enrollment are organized into uniform datasets using standardized variables and definitions across sites. The participating IDNs are all using the Epic EHR system, which is the largest and most commonly used EHR across the US ? over 52% of Americans now have an Epic health record. Epic employs a Care Everywhere feature, which allows systems to access EHR data from any Epic-using facility, with patient permission. All HCSRN sites are leading IDNs with affiliated health plans (Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare plans) and academic research centers. They have all collaborated for decades on multi-site research projects (see Past Performance Section), and are supported by federal infrastructure support, including (but not limited to) the NCI-funded Cancer Research Network (U24CA171524), NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (U19MH092201), Health Systems Node of the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (UG1DA040314), FDA-funded Mini-Sentinel, and NIA-funded AGING Initiative (R24AG045050), among many others. Populations vary by health system, but the demographic make-up is diverse and broadly representative of their local state?s general populations. Each site has experienced investigators, coordinators, informatics specialists, nurses, recruiters, medical and lab associates, statisticians, and other staff already in place and available to participate in the PMI-CP project immediately. This is essential, given that this project requires rapid recruitment and scale-up. The IDNs all manage many NIH projects, including numerous multi-site prospective studies and clinical trials. Over 100 multi-site trials and prospective studies have been externally funded across the HCSRN. As demonstrated in the ?Key Personnel Section,? investigators have vast expertise in a diverse range of disease areas (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, allergy, asthma, mental health, substance use, obesity, chronic pain, dementia) and research designs (e.g., experimental, prospective, case control, observational, and big-data EHR epidemiological studies) as well as in patient engagement, health informatics, and genetic research. All TACH sites employ NIH-funded investigators with extensive experience in recruiting and retaining sizeable numbers of research participants, in collecting biospecimens and self-report survey data, using electronic health record (EHR) data, e-consenting, coordinating multi-site data streams, and in collaborating with other health provider organizations and national centralized research cores. These IDN HPOs in the TACH network together provide comprehensive health services to over 9 million diverse patients each year. We will capitalize on our experience in recruiting and retaining large numbers of participants in epidemiological and clinical cohorts along with our patient-centered and process improvement approaches and expertise in managing multi-site EHR data, to efficiently maximize recruitment and retention, and foster true partnerships with the TACH PMI-CP Patient Partners, as well as nimbly identify and solve project problems as they arise, or make needed modifications."

"9247220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal metabolic diseases are known to alter the intrauterine environment, with potential for unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, such as birth defects. Among the most severe defects are neural tube defects, which occur more frequently in pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity or diabetes. We here propose that exposure to an adverse intrauterine environment affects embryonic development through epigenetic mechanisms. The overarching hypothesis for this proposal is that maternal diabetes induces changes in histone acetylation that mediate altered transcriptional responses after exposure, thereby increasing the risk for neural tube defects. We will test this hypothesis by focusing on H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, two hallmarks of active gene transcription. We propose to investigate the role of these chromatin modifications in the development of mesoderm, which we have shown to be disrupted during neural tube closure in two separate mouse models of diabetic pregnancy. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the contribution of changes in histone acetylation to transcriptional responses to maternal hyperglycemia; 2) Define the role of exposure-induced epigenetic changes in mesoderm development in an embryonic stem cell differentiation model; 3) Investigate how epigenetic editing of individual chromatin marks at specific genomic loci affects transcription and mesoderm differentiation from embryonic stem cells. This will be combined with optogenetic approaches to experimentally modify neural tube defect risk in mice undergoing epigenetic editing in vivo. The direct manipulation of specific chromatin modifications in cells and mice is novel in concept, and several technologies we propose to use are highly innovative. The long-term goal of this research is to uncover the molecular mechanisms through which adverse exposures during pregnancy cause birth defects, and increase the potential for adverse health outcomes later in life. Identifying the targets and pathways involved in the response to harmful intrauterine conditions, such as those in diabetic pregnancies, has high significance for the prevention and treatment of unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, such as neural tube defects."

"9349001","Abstract.  The most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 36.7 million people are living with HIV-1 infection worldwide and 25.5 million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS Fact Sheet 2016). Moreover, 70% of new infections annually are occurring in the same region of the world (UNAIDS. How AIDS Changed Everything; 2015). Since 2010, HIV incidence has declined by 14% in eastern and southern Africa and by 8% in western and central Africa, while HIV prevalence continues to rise as more people access antiretroviral treatment. Although treatment is likely having an important impact on slowing HIV transmission, alone it will not turn the epidemic on its head. HIV prevention remains critical to stem the tide of HIV. The UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for 2020 aim for 90% of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status, 90% of people who know their HIV-positive status being on antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of people on treatment having suppressed virus loads (UNAIDS. Fast- track: ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030; 2014). Current estimates for the African continent are that 29% of all those living with HIV have suppressed viral loads. Every step of the treatment cascade needs intensive investment: scaling up HIV testing access to diagnose those living with HIV, an immediate offer of antiretroviral treatment regardless of CD4 count, and retention in effective treatment to achieve viral suppression. Although there are many measures in place to tackle the HIV disease burden in Africa there remains much work to do in terms of training local physicians and scientists in regard to diagnosis, treatment, and management of individuals with HIV-1 infection, as well as in respect to evidence-informed public health responses and implementation science to determine the most cost-effective use of financial and human resources.  The 2017 INTEREST Conference, known as the ?African CROI? brings together scientists involved in HIV treatment, pathogenesis, and prevention research in resource-limited settings in Africa to share pivotal findings, promote collaboration, and transfer experiences across several fields and many continents. A prominent group of international experts in the field of HIV launched this focused international scientific meeting in Africa in 2007. Since then, 10 successful annual meetings have been convened in Uganda, Senegal (twice), Zambia (twice), Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon. Planning and organization of the conference is overseen by the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development. Catherine Hankins MD PhD chairs INTEREST?s international organizing committee (IOC) and is the Scientific Chair of INTEREST. The Local Chair for 2017 INTEREST conference is Sam Phiri MD PhD, Director of the Lighthouse Trust, Malawi.  The organizers of the 2017 INTEREST Conference will pursue the following objectives:  1) To showcase cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of HIV pathogenesis, diagnosis,  treatment, and prevention of HIV-1 infection.  2) To continue to foster the building of a community of African physicians and scientists who  discuss implementing local solutions for the management of patients living with HIV-1  infection and for the prevention of HIV transmission. ! !"
"9248844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 Mentored Career Development Award is to facilitate the transition of the individual to the role of an independent investigator y providing training and mentorship in the areas of glucose metabolism, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and type-2-diabetes (T2DM). Under the mentorship of Dr. David Holtzman, and in collaboration with Drs. Joseph Culver, Tamara Hershey, and Colin Nichols, the candidate will investigate the role of hyperglycemia on neuronal activity and functional connectivity as a function of age and pathology. Additionally, the candidate will receive extensive didactic and methodological training in the areas of small animal neuroimaging, KATP channel physiology, and AD-related research to help accomplish the goals set forth in the research application. Recent studies suggest that individuals with diabetes or those with elevated blood glucose levels have an increased risk for developing dementia or dementia due to AD; however, the mechanisms linking aberrant glucose metabolism, T2DM, and AD remain poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggests that acute increases in blood glucose levels have the ability to modulate amyloid-? (A?) levels in the brain, providing one explanation for the link between T2DM and AD. Yet it is unclear how age or pathology impacts the relationship between blood glucose levels, brain function, and A? metabolism. Moreover, our work suggests cerebral glucose metabolism is coupled with cellular excitability, neuronal activity, and A? metabolism via ATP-sensitive, inward rectifying potassium (KATP) channels; however, investigating whether chronic activation of KATP channels and increased cellular excitability is responsible for increased A? deposition warrants further study. To test the hypothesis that hyperglycemia regulates A? levels by KATP channel modulation and that this relationship is altered as a function of age and pathology, we will examine the following Aims: 1) Investigate the effects of hyperglycemia on neuronal activity, synaptic plasticity, and functional connectivity metabolism in a healthy brain as a function of normal aging. 2) Determine the effects of hyperglycemia on neuronal activity, network connectivity, and A? metabolism as a function of AD pathology using a genetic model of human APP overexpression. 3) Through the loss of KATP channel activity, we will uncouple glucose sensitivity from hyperexcitability in a mouse model of human APP overexpression and determine their effects on A? metabolism and neuronal activity."
"9360727","Mutations in Munc18-1 are associated with three infantile epileptic encephalopathies, but the mechanistic rela- tionship between mutations and these diseases is unknown. The long term goal is to clarify mechanisms by which specific synaptic dysfunctions trigger neurological disorders. The objective in this application is to deter- mine how mutations in Munc18-1 cause neuronal defects, and to identify rescue strategies to reverse such deficits. Munc18-1 (also called STXBP1, SEC1 in yeast, Rop in flies, and unc18 in worms) controls neuro- transmitter release at the synapse via binding to multiple effector proteins. Over 30 heterozygous de novo mu- tations have been identified in the Munc18-1 gene that cause the infantile epileptic encephalopathies Ohtaha- ra, West, and Dravet syndrome, but it is unknown how these mutations affect neurons and trigger three differ- ent diseases. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, is that mutations in Munc18-1 result in defects in its folding, stability and localization, and elicit same defects in wild-type Munc18-1. This loss of func- tional Munc18-1 subsequently impairs the function of its effectors and triggers synaptic dysfunction, which can be restored by stabilizing Munc18-1. The rationale for these studies is that understanding of how mutations in Munc18-1 trigger synaptic dysfunction in infantile epileptic encephalopathies will create opportunities for the development of novel therapies beyond the current, limited symptom-based therapy. Guided by strong prelimi- nary data, this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of disease-relevant mutations in Munc18-1 on protein stability; 2) Determine how Munc18-1 mutants affect the stability of its effec- tors and synapse function; and 3) Identify rescue strategies to stabilize Munc18-1 and restore its function. Un- der the first aim, stability, folding, aggregation and intracellular targeting will be quantified for Munc18-1 wild- type and mutants, combining purified recombinant proteins and primary neurons with biochemical and cell bio- logical techniques. Under the second aim, stability, interaction, and targeting of Munc18-1's effectors syntaxin- 1, Doc2, Mint1, Mint2, and rab3, as well as synapse integrity and function will be analyzed, using purified pro- teins, primary neurons, and in vivo mouse and worm models. Under the third aim, chemical and molecular chaperones will be employed to restore deficits in Munc18-1 and in synapse structure and function, using same paradigms as for aims 1 and 2. This research is significant, because it will clarify the molecular mecha- nisms underlying Munc18-1-linked epilepsies, and will have translational importance in the development of new rational treatments. This research is innovative, because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that Munc18-1 muta- tions cause synaptic dysfunction via a dominant-negative mechanism, 2) uses a multidisciplinary and system- atic approach that has not previously been used in this research area, 3) is technically innovative because of newly generated C. elegans strains, and 4) shifts focus from a symptom-centered perspective to an approach that focusses on understanding convergent underlying disease mechanisms that pivot on Munc18-1."
"9298302","Project Summary Alzheimer?s disease and related dementia (referred to collectively here as ?dementia?) is estimated to be one of the most costly health conditions in America, with most of the costs coming from long-term services and supports (LTSS) ? help with everyday activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, using the toilet, eating, and moving around ? much of which is provided by family. Almost 4 million adults 70 and over receive care from family and friends for cognitive impairment or dementia, and the need for this care will only increase as the nation grows grayer. Quantifying the need for and availability of family care for dementia, as well as quantifying the burden of care on individual caregivers, will help decision-makers adequately prepare for future shortages in the number of dementia caregivers and ensure the well-being of such caregivers. This work will use a variety of data sources and methods to examine the interplay between two trends that appear to be on a collision course: declining family size (lower supply) and increasing numbers of dementia cases (higher demand). Our key innovation is to link an existing demographic microsimulation model (MSM) with data on dementia incidence, thereby providing the first study to examine the future availability of family care for older adults with dementia. While there is some work modeling the demand side of care needs for dementia or other chronic disease incidence, the few studies of the supply side of family care are limited: they do not examine caregiving for dementia in particular, and most also incorporate only a limited definition of family care. We propose to build on a long-standing microsimulation model of expected kinship networks to develop a model of the supply of family care and to use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a subsample of HRS respondents ages 70 and over, in combination with published data on dementia incidence to develop a demand model of dementia incidence. We will link the two models using data from the HRS on the predictors of dementia care. Data from the HRS will also be used to identify groups at high risk of needing or providing care and on anticipated hours of care from different family members (e.g. spouses, biological kin, step-kin, etc.). Finally, the output of the linked models will be tested under different assumptions about how care patterns and demographic trends will change over time. This combination of information is critical for informing families and policymakers about anticipated shortages in dementia family care, as well as increases in the burden of care on individual family members in the U.S., which is expected to reach new heights as the baby boomers age."
"9244071","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Deficits across the domains of reward and cognition are defining characteristics of virtually all neuropsychiatric disorders, and have deleterious effects on functional recovery, disease chronicity, and morbidity. Development of effective treatments is hindered by the lack of well-validated preclinical measures of target engagement that are functionally similar across species. Capitalizing on a partnership among basic and translational neuroscientists with a strong track record of collaborations, the overarching goal of this UH2/UH3 application is to develop new translational assessments of reward and cognition in which the neurophysiological and behavioral metrics are identical across species. We will address this objective by modifying and validating assessments of reward learning, cognitive control, and cognitive flexibility, each of which is disrupted across illnesses. During the UH2 phase, we will modify and test existing human and rodent versions of a probabilistic reward task (PRT; reward learning), a flanker task (cognitive control) [alternative task: 4-choice serial reaction time task], a probabilistic reversal learning task (PRL; cognitive flexibility), such that task parameters are analogous between humans and rats. Additionally, we will record EEG data in both humans and rats during performance of each task. In both species, EEG data will be analyzed using several techniques, including frequency-domain multi-taper power spectral analyses, time-domain event-related potential (ERP) analyses, and cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses. In humans, distributed source localization analyses will focus on a priori regions, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; reward learning and cognitive control), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; cognitive control), and lateral orbitofrontal cortx (OFC; reversal learning); EEG electrodes in rats will be placed over homologous regions. We hypothesize that by increasing the congruence of task parameters, task-related behavioral and neurophysiological assays will be similar across species. The two tasks that show the highest neurophysiological (and behavioral) concordance between humans and rats will be advanced to the UH3 phase, in which the selected task(s) will be validated with pharmacological challenges. Specifically, reward learning, cognitive control, or reversal learning and their respective neurophysiological mechanisms will be probed after administration of either the dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist amisulpride, the serotonin neurotransmission enhancer vortioxetine, or the cognitive enhancer modafinil. Each pharmacological challenge is based on specific a priori hypotheses regarding neurobiological mechanisms underlying each behavioral construct. Ultimately, these studies will provide novel measures of reward and/or cognition in both humans and rats that show clear parallels in behavior and neurophysiology that can be manipulated with putative treatments across species. Such tasks will help narrow the existing translational gap between preclinical animal and human research and will promote the development of urgently needed treatments for reward and cognitive disorders."
"9250771","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On average, more than 1,800,000 sessions of hemodialysis are performed each week in the U.S. by more than 600,000 end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. A grave danger to any of these patients is Venous Needle Dislodgement (VND), a catastrophic and potentially deadly unintended removal of the needle pumping blood back into the body. Incident rate estimates vary widely, but in any given week, possibly more than 200 hemodialysis patients will suffer an incidence of VND. VND is a constant and ever-present danger that looms over each and every one of the ~100,000,000 hemodialysis sessions performed each year in the US alone. The entire industry is in dire need of an inexpensive, practical and widely applicable solution that can easily insure patient safety during hemodialysis.  To fill this need, Hemotek has invented the V-Needle, a disposable failsafe dialysis safety product that will protect hemodialysis patients from deadly bleed-out during incidences of VND. The V-Needle will be a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, and simple-to-operate system that will protect patients from the devastating effects of VND. In a Phase I SBIR study we conclusively showed the engineering characterizations that outlined the feasibility of manufacturing such a device. In this Phase II project, we now optimize that design and prepare the device for submission to the FDA for approval to market in the US: Specific-aim #1: Meet with the FDA to finalize a regulatory strategy and Begin documentation:  1.1) Prepare a pre-meeting report and Strategize with the FDA to solicit a regulatory plan  1.2) Begin FDA-mandated User Needs, Design Inputs/Output files for the Design History File  1.3) Conduct and document a Risk Management Strategy Specific-aim #2: Develop an optimized, alpha design for the V-Needle:  2.1) Decrease design complexity by reducing the number of moldable components required  2.2) Implement the V-Needle with an `arming' mechanism that will simplify initial insertion  2.3) Miniaturize the design so that the new product is within 25% of current needle-body sizes Specific-aim #3: Characterize and Assess the alpha V-Needle, iterate to beta:  3.1) Determine final V-Needle component materials and Establish biocompatibility  3.2) Quantify closing force, backpressure and flow using a custom benchtop flow apparatus  3.3) Establish human factors and other engineering criteria so the optimized V-Needle meets  intended user needs (via clinical staff/patient interviews)  3.4) Demonstrate that the alpha V-Needle protects against dislodgement in animals (dog) Specific-aim #4 Determine beta V-Needle safety and efficacy, translate to pre-production:  4.1) Assess clinical implementation via simulated use testing on training dummies  4.2) Demonstrate that the beta V-Needle protects against dislodgement in animals (dog) Specific-aim #5 Prepare and Submit a finalized 510(K) application to the FDA:  5.1) Collaborate with FDA consultants, The Experien Group, to prepare/submit a 510(K)  The internationally patent-pending V-Needle has the potential to save lives, improve patient care and provide priceless peace of mind for hemodialysis patients and care providers.

"9249483","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major objective of this proposal is to evaluate a multivalent fusion protein vaccine against lymphatic filariasis in a rhesus macaque model. Preliminary studies in macaque using a recombinant WbHAT vaccine plus alum showed that approximately 40% protection can be achieved against a challenge infection. Although this is significant, compared to our published findings using the same vaccine in rodent model, the values were substantially low. Vaccination trials using rBmHAT plus alum or rBmHAX plus alum in three rodent models showed that close to sterile immunity (95-97%) can be achieved. Thus, there is a significant difference in the degree of protection conferred following vaccination in th rhesus macaque and rodents. Analysis of the characteristics of the protective responses showed that in rhesus macaques the responses are predominantly Th2 with little or no Th1 response. A similar analysis in rodents and the human showed that balanced Th1/Th2 responses are critical for protection against lymphatic filariasis. This might explain the low protection observed in our rhesus macaque trial. In an effort to increase the Th1 responses towards the vaccine antigen and thus increase the rate of protection, in this application, we are proposing to use AL019 adjuvant, which is a combination of alum plus TLR4 agonist. Preliminary studies in rhesus macaque using AL019 as an adjuvant for rWbALT-2 showed that the adjuvant promotes both Th1 and Th2 responses and the rate of protection was doubled suggesting that AL019 is an excellent adjuvant for lymphatic filariasis vaccine in macaque. Therefore, in this application we are proposing an initial vaccination trial in macaque using rWbHAT and rWbHAX plus AL019 and down select the best formulation based on immunogenicity, safety, and correlates of protection. Selected vaccine candidate will be then further characterized and vaccination regimen will be optimized in a jird and hamster model. Finally the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of the selected vaccine formulation will be evaluated in detail in the macaque model. Several rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) have tremendously reduced the incidence of lymphatic filariasis in the endemic regions. Therefore, there is a need to maintain the momentum gained by MDA and leverage the success towards developing a sustained eradication strategy such as an effective vaccine for lymphatic filariasis. We have proposed three aims in this application. Specific Aim 1 is aimed at evaluating the immunogenicity of rWbHAT and rWbHAX in rhesus macaque and down select the best vaccine formulation for further development. Based upon our findings from rodent vaccination trial, either of the vaccines will be highly efficient as prophylactic vaccines. In Specific Aim 2 e will characterize the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of the down selected vaccines in a jird model. We decided to do these characterization studies in jirds mainly because of cost, time, repeatability, ability to accurately determine the parasite establishment, and the fact that bigger sample size are possible. Preliminary studies in the jirds showed that rWbHA, a major component of the two selected vaccine candidates have significant therapeutic activity. Thus, this aim will focus on characterizing the mechanism of the therapeutic activity and evaluate if combining the vaccine with anti-filarial treatment can achieve total clearance of the infection from infected jirds. Several studies show that hookworm infections coexist with lymphatic filariasis infection in the endemic regions. Therefore, this aim will also evaluate the effects of hookworm infections on the vaccine-induced immunity against lymphatic filariasis. Finally in Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of the down selected and optimized multivalent vaccine formulation in rhesus macaque model. We will also test if combining anti-filarial treatment with the therapeutic vaccination is beneficial. Similarly we will also test the role of hookworm infection in the development of vaccine-induced immunity in macaques. Overall, these studies are aimed at selecting the most effective vaccine formulation for possible testing in the human clinical trials."
"9314901","PROJECT SUMMARY A potential ban on flavored tobacco products is a policy option to reduce tobacco product initiation by youth and young adults. However, few studies examine its potential to reduce disparities in vulnerable populations due to tobacco advertising exposure, perceptions of flavored products, and differential use. The purpose of this study is to address how targeted marketing of FTPs may influence perceptions of, susceptibility to and initiation of tobacco in a vulnerable population (recruited from 3 wards within Washington, DC with the highest smoking rates, % African American, and lowest SES) (VP) vs. a non-vulnerable population (non-VP) of young adults in Washington, DC. It will address the potential of a policy ban or restrictions on flavored tobacco products to reduce tobacco and, ultimately, cancer disparities and enhance equity in the distribution of tobacco marketing risk. The current study will build on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), a model of cognitive processing of how advertising results in persuasion. The ELM suggests that one way tobacco advertising works is by linking tobacco to `peripheral cues,' positive attributes including flavoring that may contribute to positive appraisal and lower harm perceptions of flavored products. Across a sample of n = 256 VP and non-VP young adult non-tobacco users, this multi-level study (store- and individual-level) will build on the ELM to examine differences in real-world exposure to FTP advertising, emphasizing point of sale (POS) exposure, using 14 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). It will examine the influence of exposure on self-reported perceptions of FTPs (lower harm, more appeal). Participants will be assessed at 2-weeks and 6- months post-baseline to examine differential impacts of FTP advertising and attitudes on susceptibility, intentions, and tobacco use patterns (for FTPs and non-FTPs) as a function of VP group status. POS exposure will be validated by photographs of tobacco advertising in stores visited by respondents. Our specific aims are to (1) Identify the frequency of FTP and non-FTP advertising, and number and types of products characterized by FTP descriptors (e.g., menthol, cherry) in tobacco retailers visited by VP and non-VP young adults, (2) Compare differences in harm perceptions and appeal of FTP vs non-FTP advertisements and descriptors across VP and non-VP young adults and (3) Examine the predictive utility of FTP advertising and descriptor exposure on susceptibility, intentions to use, and initiation of FTPs (and non-FTPs) at 6-month follow-up across VP and non-VP young adults. This unique approach to triangulate data at the store and individual cognitive level will yield timely information given the increase in use of FTPs and the need to identify new policies and approaches to combat tobacco disparities in vulnerable groups. Achieving the aims of this R21 will establish whether these associations exist and provide the foundation for a larger study developing interventions correcting FTP misperceptions, promoting FTP de-normalization among young adults , and examining the likely impact of local policies to restrict FTP availability and advertising particularly in vulnerable communities. This study can also provide a basis for examining targeted marketing of other harmful products at POS."
"9311914","The cerebral cortex is crucial for our highest cognitive and perceptual functions. Its function depends on the precise generation of different neuronal subtypes, and proper wiring of the neurons both within the cerebral cortex and between the cortex and other brain regions. Corticothalamic projection neurons extend axons into the thalamus. They are important in sensory processing, and their dysfunction has been implicated in epilepsy. Subcerebral projection neurons project axons into the midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. These neurons are clinically important since they degenerate in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other diseases, and are damaged in spinal cord injury. Despite their functional importance and extensive involvement in neurological diseases, the transcription network regulating the generation of distinct cortical projection neuron subtypes remains to be identified. Exciting discoveries have recently been made to illustrate the functions of a network of transcription factors including Fezf2, Tbr1, Sox5 and Satb2, in specifying the identities of distinct projection neuron subtypes. However, our recent and unpublished studies have revealed unexpected complexity in the functions of these genes and their interactions with each other. Thus our understanding of the network of transcription factors regulating cortical neuron fate specification remains incomplete. Lack of such knowledge hinders our effort to understand the biological causes of various neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, mental retardation, and schizophrenia, and prevents us from designing effective strategies to prevent and treat these diseases. In this grant application, we propose to determine the transcription factor network that specifies the subtype identities and connectivities for subcerebral neurons (Aim 1) and to identify the multiple functions of Satb2 (Aim 2) and Tbr1 (Aim 3) in regulating cortical projection neuron fate specification and differentiation. We will combine mouse genetics, molecular biology and neuroanatomical techniques to achieve these aims."
"9318578","Project Summary Motivational anhedonia?a subset of anhedonic symptoms involving dopamine-linked impairments in effort- based decision-making, reward anticipation and reinforcement learning?are common in psychiatric disorders such as major depression, and are notoriously difficult to treat. In recent years, these symptoms have been associated with alterations in dopaminergic corticostriatal circuitry, yet the underlying causes of this circuit dysfunction remain unknown. One candidate mechanism is inflammation; increased inflammatory cytokines have been reliably found in depressed patients, and administration of inflammatory cytokines or cytokine inducers has been shown to foment depressive symptoms of apathy, anhedonia and fatigue. In addition, inflammatory cytokines have been found to disrupt dopamine synthesis, alter basal-ganglia metabolism, and blunt striatal responsivity during reward anticipation. To date, however, the majority of data supporting the relationship between cytokines and symptoms in patients with major depression and other disorders is correlational in nature, and thus alternative experimental strategies are required to elucidate causal relationships. One strategy is to block inflammatory cytokines in a sample of depressed patients with high inflammation so as to determine which symptom domains are most affected and through which molecular pathways. Previously, we found that the TNF antagonist infliximab (a ?biologic? monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits TNF) selectively reduced symptoms of motivational anhedonia, but only in depressed patients with high inflammation as reflected by plasma c-reactive protein (CRP) of at least >3mg/L. Unfortunately, not all patients in this sample exhibited high inflammation, and these associations must therefore be considered preliminary, albeit promising. More critically, this study was unable to address target engagement at the level of neural circuitry. Building off of these initial data, the current study will assess neuroimaging measures of corticostriatal circuitry before and after a placebo-controlled pharmacologic blockade of inflammation in 80 depressed patients (n = 40 per group) recruited to ensure high levels of peripheral inflammation (CRP > 3mg/L). Primary aims are to evaluate whether 1) corticostriatal function during reward motivation and anticipation are associated with change in peripheral inflammation following pharmacologic blockade relative to placebo 2) the temporal dynamics of change in inflammation, gene- expression, reward motivation and reinforcement learning behavior and motivational symptoms assessed at baseline, and 24 hours, 3 days, 1 week and two weeks post infliximab infusion, and 3) test an integrative multi- level path model to determine whether change in corticostriatal circuitry following inflammation blockade mediates the relationship between change in inflammation and change in motivational anhedonia symptoms. These data will provide further validation of inflammatory cytokines as therapeutic targets for motivational symptoms in depression and will define symptom targets and biomarkers of response for future studies."
"9471512","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks support for years 31-35 of a T32 grant for postdoctoral research training for MD, PhD and MD/PhD scientists. The training centers in the Department of Pathology and Immunology at Washington University in St. Louis. We have 28 faculty, distributed among seven departments, with highest representation in Pathology and Immunology. The faculty is made up of a highly interactive group of immunologists and cell/molecular biologists who have collaborated for several years. The research of much of the faculty is on various aspects of immunology, host resistance, and cancer but also includes heavy emphasis on the molecular basis of cell activation (for example our projects focus on host responses to tumors and viruses, lymphocyte differentiation and activation, cell biology and biochemistry of antigen processing, and the analysis of cell interaction molecules). There are two types of trainees-(a) those with either MD or MD/PhD degrees who seek an in-depth experience in research following their clinical training in Pathology or (b) those with PhD and/or MD degrees, not associated with Pathology clinical training, who have an interest in the research done by our faculty members. We have a yearly applicant pool of about 200 qualified individuals who compete for a total of 103 postdoctoral slots among the 28 laboratories. Of these, ten/year were and are supported by this training grant. We request renewal of our ten training positions. A Steering Committee of six senior faculty members oversees the training and is responsible for the selection of trainees. Training includes a 2-3 year period of full-time laboratory research, where the trainee is exposed to the latest approaches in immunology and cell and molecular biology (e.g., transgenic and knockout mice, tumor immunology, DNA technology). Part of the training includes laboratory meetings and reports, participation in weekly seminars, training in research ethics and opportunities for courses in Cancer Biology and Immunology. Of the 49 trainees that have been supported by this Program in the last 10 years, 98% continue in research. The 28 trainees in the Program over the last five years published 40 papers and review articles: 25% in high impact journals and 37.5% involved two or more training faculty. Seventy one percent of our trainees supported during the last 10-years have completed the Program (29% are still in training). Of the former, 74% hold faculty positions, mostly in Pathology. This successful Training Program is thus producing the next generation of basic and clinician scientists who will elucidate many of the heretofore unknown mechanisms that lead to cancer development and/or discover novel therapeutic strategies that can be used to treat neoplastic disease."
"9461880","PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Malaria affected more than 200 million people last year, killing nearly 600,000. Antibody responses that target the parasite are essential for controlling parasite replication and limiting the severity of malaria. Potent antibody responses and optimally stimulated B cells require `help' from CD4+ T cells. Our published work has shown that CD4+ T cell function is markedly impaired following Plasmodium infection. We linked the reduced function of CD4+ T cells to the induction of co-inhibitory receptor expression, a class of T cell surface expressed proteins that directly limit the ability of CD4+ T cells to orchestrate protective immune responses against microbial pathogens. We further showed that blocking the activity of co-inhibitory receptors during malaria restored CD4+ T cell function, promoted strong antibody responses and accelerated parasite control and clearance from the infected host.  Recently, we identified that we can also restore the function of Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells by activating OX40, a member of a class of T cell stimulating receptors. Our new data show that therapeutically stimulating the OX40 receptor during the second week of experimental Plasmodium infection overcomes co- inhibitory networks, markedly improves CD4+ T cell activity and secreted antibody responses, and limits malaria parasite replication. Importantly, we also identified parallels in children infected with P. falciparum, establishing the relevance and significance of our discoveries and strengthening the scientific premise of the current proposal. In this project we apply new cellular, genetic and parasitological reagents to study how the OX40 receptor regulates communication between parasite specific CD4+ T cells and B cells and the generation of antibody responses. Our scientific questions and experimental approaches facilitate our long- term goal to identify new immune-based approaches to therapeutically stimulate host resistance against malaria. Our goal is addressed by three specific aims that will determine: 1) the distinct characteristics of Plasmodium infection that uniquely regulate the functional expression of OX40 receptors on CD4+ T cells; 2) whether the OX40 receptor is required for effective communication between CD4+ T cells and B cells to generate potent antibody responses; and 3) whether B cell expression of the OX40 ligand is regulated by parasite byproducts and necessary for generating potent secreted antibody responses. Our proposed studies and new reagents provide tractable systems and a detailed framework for sustainable extensions of this project that will establish additional new paradigms for enhancing CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against Plasmodium. Insight gained during the course of our studies will help us identify and develop new immune- based strategies to limit Plasmodium disease burden."
"9039554","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to prove the hypothesis that bi-directional interaction between tumor microenvironment and macrophages plays significant role in tumor progression and therapy efficacy. This hypothesis is specifically formulated at the level of living tissue and therefore will be tested in vivo using innovative electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based multifunctional approaches. These approaches will be used to correlate, in vivo, the role of macrophages and macrophage-specific HIF-1a and HIF-2a in the regulation of tumor hypoxia, extracellular pH (pHe), redox and glutathione (GSH); and how deletion of these factors affects clinically-relevant anti-cancer treatment strategies in the PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The specific aims are: (SA1) To optimize magnetic resonance modalities for in vivo multifunctional monitoring of tumor tissue parameters: pH, oxygen, redox and GSH. Novel paramagnetic probes and techniques will be optimized for multi-functional application in tumor tissue with the focus on application to the PyMT mammary tumors in mice. (SA2) To investigate the role of macrophages in regulating the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. We hypothesize that macrophages significantly affect oxygen tension, acidosis, redox and intracellular GSH (EPR signature of tumor microenvironment) in breast cancer, and that despite both being hypoxia-inducible proteins, macrophage HIF-1a and HIF-2a have disparate and opposing roles in the regulation of the these parameters in the tumor microenvironment, and that we can detect changes in corresponding EPR signature between transgenic mice containing the macrophage ablation or HIF-1a or HIF- 2a deletions. (SA3) To investigate macrophage-regulated tumor microenvironment and their role in chemotherapy efficacy in breast cancer. We will test the hypothesis that tumor pO2, pHe, redox and GSH all combine to form a tumor microenvironment profile that can predict levels of success for standard chemotherapies, and macrophages are a lynchpin in tumor microenvironment regulation. Specifically, we will test whether predominance in tumor macrophage polarity (M1/M2) will regulate a tumor microenvironment and the efficacy of standard chemotherapies, such as docetaxel, and whether macrophage HIF-1a deletion will increase docetaxel effectiveness. In summary, the results may provide new insight into the tumor microenvironment and macrophage regulation of efficacy of clinically-relevant anti-cancer therapies."
"9274884","ABSTRACT We are requesting funds to purchase an IVIS Spectrum®, a highly sensitive, high throughput and full tomographic pre-clinical optical imaging system. The addition of this optical system will provide continuity and further strengthen ongoing work in oncology, pharmaceutical sciences, engineering, neurosciences, and genetic medicine by current users of the USC Molecular Imaging Center (MIC). In addition, it will greatly enhance the ability of MIC to support new research in novel probe design, such as multimodality imaging probes. We have gathered 13 NIH funded investigators (eight major and five minor users) throughout research disciplines such as drug discovery, alcohol/drug induced liver disease, neurodegeneration, oncology, and pharmacy to support our current S10 application. More importantly, the unit will replace and upgrade an obsolete IVIS 200 unit that has been a very productive and instrumental imaging equipment for our research core users for over 11 years. The IVIS® Spectrum pre-clinical optical imaging system provides a compact and efficient platform that allows non-invasive, high sensitivity, in vivo imaging with high throughput and full tomographic optical imaging. The system?s optical imaging technology will provide our investigators a tool to perform quantitative, highly sensitive in vivo fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging. Optical imaging of fluorescence and bioluminescence based probes in live animals has undoubtedly become an invaluable tool in biomedical research. Optical based imaging serves as an important bridge between in vitro and in vivo studies, reconciling cell-based molecular biology with in vivo systems biology. Whole body fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging have provided a platform for investigators to visualize gene expression and protein functions in vivo. In vivo fluorescence- and bioluminescence-based optical imaging provides investigators with a cost efficient, high-throughput, and non-nuclear based approach to investigate disease progression."
"9250219","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to brain plasticity and maintain tissue homeostasis. Understanding how NSCs remodel the adult hippocampus may provide key insight into neural adaptability and repair. NSC function is defined by the ability to maintain a precursor state while generating neuronal and glial progeny. Recently, I developed a new in vivo clonal analysis system to reveal stem cell properties at the single cell level within the adult mammalian hippocampus, an area critical for learning and memory. We previously showed that radial glia-like (RGL) cells can act as stem cells, but exhibit significant heterogeneity in their decisions to proliferate, generate progeny and self-renew. A fundamental remaining question is what mechanisms underlie these differences. I hypothesize that divergent RGL behavior results from differences in their proliferative state and responses to changes in environment including GABA signaling and stroke injury. To address these points, I have established independent model systems that preferentially target quiescent and mitotic RGLs. I will first characterize NSC potential within these intrinsically biased RGL subpopulations by performing in vivo single cell lineage tracing. After establishing this foundation, we will assess how GABA signaling acts as an extrinsic molecular mechanism to regulate stem cell decisions in quiescent and active RGLs under physiological condition. Finally, we will determine how stroke injury dictates RGL cell fate decisions and potential in quiescent and active subpopulations under pathological conditions. Importantly, viral-based gene delivery, optogenetics and stroke surgery skills learned during the mentored phase are essential components toward a multidisciplinary approach for investigating extrinsic niche regulation during the independent phase. Collectively, this research seeks to understand NSC behavior in intrinsically different RGLs and how their decisions interact with specific physiological and pathological mechanisms."

Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1) Develop and deliver a multidisciplinary Biomedical Devices Development Course including a Clinical Immersion Component and 2) Enhancing Team-based Interdisciplinary Senior Design Project Experience in Biomedical Engineering Education. Innovative components of Specific Aim 1 of this proposal includes shifting from tradition of posing design problems for students to offering biomedical engineering students the opportunity, training and responsibility to identify real-world unmet clinical needs while working in a truly multidisciplinary team of students from the Schools of Nursing through a Biomedical Device Development Course. This course will offer lectures and trainings on responsible conduct of research, intellectual property and patenting, FDA and regulatory path and market analysis. Additional guest lectures from experts in the field will offer insight into the real world product development process. These lectures will be complemented with three industrial site visits to gain an understanding of work environment complexity. Clinical unmet needs will be identified at the five clinical immersion sites followed by two weeks of simulation lab training at the Center for Simulation and Computerized Testing located in Widener School of Nursing offering students hands-on experience of the clinical problem. Student success will be assessed through course assignments, an online discussion forum updating their weekly observation concluding with an oral poster presentation outlining an unmet clinical need and viable engineering solution for each clinical site. The top five proposed project ideas that are appropriate to meet time, cost and prototyping constraints of current design facilities and also ensure full buy-in from the clinician in order to provide direction and technical expertise will then be undertaken by some or all of these BME students as the two semester Capstone senior design project courses (ENGR 401/402), leading us into Specific Aim 2 of this proposed study. Additionally, engineering and nursing (Junior) students could pursue the proposed projects as part of the Widener Summer Research program, which is designed to promote undergraduate research experience at Widener University. Goals of Specific Aim 2 of this proposal are to (a) translate the unmet clinical needs into open-ended, interdisciplinary team- based senior design projects, and broaden students exposure and understanding of challenges that are specific to clinical environments (b) evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating clinically driven design projects into the senior design program. Through weekly interaction with the faculty advisor, students will follow the traditional senior design process including Phase 1: Understanding wants and constraints, benchmarking. Phase 2: Concept generation, Phase 3: Concept selection and Phase 4: Working prototype. A process map will be used to make sure of the timely completion of the project. Deliverables for each of the projects include a first semester design review presentation and a final design presentation followed by a final report and a working prototype in the second semester. Final presentation will include introduction, project goals, design and development, summary of work, progress, and future work. We hope that exposure to guided but open-ended challenges from clinical professionals will broaden the students? understanding of clinical barrier and help them develop skills that will prepare them for successful careers in biomedical engineering. Demographic data and student surveys/interviews in both courses will be assessed yearly by the PIs and the External Advisory Board to ensure diversity, recruitment, student retention and attainment of the program goals."
"9320061","ABSTRACT  In the United States, several hundred thousand people experience cardiac arrest each year, with the vast majority dying from this condition. Approximately two-thirds of cardiac arrest victims have previously suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), and death results from maladaptive responses to infarct healing. The healed infarct scar creates a substrate that supports malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and death results from ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating in the border zone around the infarct scar. The underlying cellular and tissue electrophysiology that allow the reentrant VT to exist is unknown. Histology studies support a role for surviving ribbons of myocardial tissue traversing the borderzone region, and immunohistochemical studies show decreased connexin expression, implicating impaired electrical conduction as a component of the arrhythmia mechanism. A problem with ascribing causation of VT entirely to these electrical conduction factors is that they occur diffusely throughout the borderzone, but VT exists in discrete circuits. If impaired conduction were sufficient to cause VT, it would come from everywhere within the infarct scar and borderzone, but it does not. Additional factors must be required for existence of VT in the discrete areas where it is found. Our goal is to define the mechanism of post-infarct VT. We have preliminary data showing alterations in KCNE3 expression and action potential duration that are unique to VT circuits. We hypothesize that these repolarization effects combine with the more broadly present alterations in conduction to create conditions that support reentry. To test our hypothesis, we use an integrative, patient-oriented approach with preclinical testing in a clinically relevant large mammalian model of post-infarct VT that we have previously validated for mechanistic and translational studies. We compare the animal model findings to clinical study of patients with post-infarct VT. In that way, we can perform in-depth mechanistic studies in the animal model and then compare the results to the human observations to prove relevance. We will focus on 3 aims: (1) to define the unique anatomical and electrophysiological elements of VT circuits within healed infarct scar in a preclinical model of post-infarction VT, (2) to reverse the maladaptive electrophysiological changes in the healed infarct scar and assess the effects on VT, and (3) to define the unique electrophysiological elements of VT circuits within healed infarct scar in humans. Successful completion of these aims will further our understanding of the mechanism responsible for infarct-related VT, ultimately allowing translation of these findings into novel drug, gene or ablative therapies."
"9456301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research: Studies over recent years revealed that an enhancement of brown adipose tissue activity can correct hyperlipidemia and prevent diet induced obesity and its harmful metabolic consequences. It has widely been assumed that all classical brown adipocytes in brown fat were functionally similar. This application is based on a recent unpublished discovery by Dr. Wang that there are two new, distinct, populations of classical brown adipocytes co-existing in normal brown fat that display distinct transcriptional fingerprints and morphology. The hypothesis is that they are active highly thermogenic and the resting low thermogenic brown adipocytes. This project will explore the function, dynamic and regulation of this two brown adipocyte subpopulations during development and under environmental and physiology challenges such as cold exposure and high fat diet feeding. By figuring out the key regulatory pathways leading to the diversity between the two subpopulations of brown adipocytes, we can identify the potential pharmaceutical targets to induce inter-conversion of brown adipocytes from low thermogenic capability to high thermogenic capability. Meanwhile, the proposed research will also investigate when the two subpopulations diverse during maturation; as well as how high fat diet challenge impairs the inter-conversion of the two subpopulations.

"9248779","The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) Department of Internal Medicine has a long history of supporting summer undergraduate research. In addition, the Department also has a critical mass of investigators with research foci on alcohol and its influence in vivo and in vitro. These two features of the Department of Internal Medicine form the backbone of our renewal proposal in support of our highly successful Summer Undergraduate Alcohol Research Program (SUARP). The objectives of this renewal application are to:  1) Provide a ten-week research experience for undergraduate students that  continues to create unique enrichment opportunities for students to learn first-  hand what is involved in performing research and to stimulate their interest in  careers in biomedical research.  2) Introduce undergraduate students involved in a summer research program to the  importance and spectrum of research related to alcohol and its consequences on  health, organ and cellular function.  3) Continue to recruit qualified undergraduate minority and disadvantaged students  to a summer undergraduate research experience to encourage their potential  future careers in biomedical research. To achieve our objectives, we will continue to leverage resources from our existing Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). Comprised of a ten-week research experience similar to SURP, the SUARP is distinct by including a seminar series devoted to topics in alcohol research, a journal club for its undergraduate students, and a newly conceived case-based learning initiative that will capitalize on technology and e-learning approaches. We have several strategies in place that have allowed us to successfully recruit underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students into the SUARP. We will continue to refine our existing short term and long term evaluation processes to enhance outcomes for the students including increasing their interests in careers in biomedical research."

"9311233","Project Summary/Abstract Current therapeutic options for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are limited, and new drug development in COPD has been hampered by the lack of clinically relevant biomarkers to assess likely drug efficacy. We will identify differentially abundant and lung-specific protein biomarkers of COPD in lung tissue and blood (plasma) using comprehensive proteomic analysis. Genetic determinants influence COPD susceptibility, but previously identified COPD genetic determinants account for only a small percentage of COPD heritability. Genetic analysis of protein biomarkers could reveal the network of regulatory factors influencing COPD susceptibility and COPD heterogeneity. Our overall hypothesis is that functional genetic variants lead to abnormal proteomic states that influence the development and heterogeneity of COPD. We will identify potential COPD biomarkers by studying lung-specific proteins that differ in lung tissue and plasma from 100 COPD cases and 50 smoking control subjects. We will then measure the most promising lung- specific plasma proteins in 1950 non-Hispanic White and African American COPDGene subjects with distinct imaging characteristics (airway-predominant COPD, emphysema-predominant COPD, and resistant smokers) to identify protein biomarkers associated with COPD and COPD subtypes. We will also perform genetic association analysis of lung-specific protein levels using whole genome sequencing data in these COPDGene subjects. Genetic determinants of protein biomarker levels will be tested for association with COPD susceptibility and COPD subtypes in multiple COPD populations. We will then determine whether the integrated analysis of the identified protein biomarkers of COPD susceptibility, several previously reported COPD protein biomarkers (CC16, Surfactant Protein D, sRAGE, and PARC), and the genetic determinants of COPD and COPD protein biomarkers enables prediction of disease progression rates in mild-to-moderate COPD subjects. The identification and characterization of novel COPD protein biomarkers may provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and tools for future clinical trials."
"9274599","ABSTRACT Funds are requested for the acquisition of a Malvern MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Isothermal Titration Calorimeter). ITC data will allow characterizing the thermodynamic signatures of a number of proteins that bind diverse targets and mediate fundamental functions, from immune responses and synapses to virology. Therefore, this equipment will significantly enhance our understanding of the nuanced relationships between thermodynamics, structure, and function, and expedite development and design of more potent and specific drugs for a wide variety of diseases including microbial infections, autism, and schizophrenia. Our previous, now defunct, VP-ITC was extensively used (by over a dozen research groups) and provided not only fundamental knowledge, but was valuable in securing many investigator-initiated federal grants. We cannot overemphasize the importance of an ITC for the Sealy Center for Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics (SCSB) core faculty and our other colleagues who are interested in the molecular mechanisms of their proteins of interest. The new instrument will be housed in the existing SCSB space at UTMB, and will be supported by the SCSB. A Ph.D.-level solution biophysics Facility Manager, also fully supported by the SCSB, will oversee the system. Scheduling of the instrument will be web-based, and any conflicts will be resolved through a steering committee. Approximately 10% of the available hours will be reserved for new and outside users, as well as for pilot studies, and in particular, priority will be given to new faculty investigators to facilitate their competition for NIH support. Further, we are confident that the new ITC will stimulate new collaborations among investigators in our University."
"9348825","PROJECT SUMMARY  In this revised application (priority score 29 and percentile 15%, which narrowly missed the 13% payline), we seek to define the impact of the microbiome on vaccine responses in a program spanning from observational studies in a human vaccine trial to studies in animal models to define the relevant functions of the microbiome. This revised application is built upon the strong 6 year collaboration between Dr. Dan Barouch and Dr. Skip Virgin. This collaboration included a highly productive multi-PI R01 grant (OD011170) to define the effects of pathogenic SIV and HIV infection on the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome. This collaboration led to several advances relevant to this application. Importantly, the technologies to evaluate the microbiome including the bacterial microbiome and virome and for defining the relationship of components of the microbiome to vaccine immunogenicity metadata were developed and published. The availability of these methods provides us with a unique opportunity to leverage an on going human vaccine trial to probe the important hypothesis that the nature and extent of vaccine responses is regulated by the microbiome. Data from many groups now show that that the microbiome regulates antiviral immunity, functions of key innate immune cells and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses. Based on evidence that bacterial and other microbiome constituents alter immune responses, the development of tools for analysis of the virome and bacterial microbiome, and the immediate availability of a unique set of human samples from a highly relevant international phase 1/2a clinical study of an HIV vaccine candidate that will likely advance into large- scale efficacy trials (A004/IPCAVD009; NCT02315703), we now propose, to test the hypothesis that variations in the intestinal microbiome influence vaccine immunogenicity in humans, rhesus monkeys, and mice. To address this important hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Aim 1: To assess the impact of the intestinal microbiome on vaccine-elicited immune responses in humans. Aim 2: To determine whether experimental alterations of the intestinal microbiome impact vaccine- elicited immune responses in animal models."

"9320174","ABSTRACT Having a heart with a steady beat is not optimal. The brain sends signals about various body states including blood pressure and breathing that contribute oscillatory rhythms to the speed of heartbeats and increase heart rate variability (HRV). For reasons that are not yet clear, having greater HRV at rest is associated with better emotion regulation and well-being. People with higher HRV tend to be less anxious, less depressed, less hostile and produce more context-appropriate emotional responses. One potential explanation for the relationship between HRV and emotion regulation is that the same set of brain regions regulates autonomic states and emotions, and so both HRV and emotion regulation reflect the general health and efficacy of this central autonomic network in the brain. However, it appears that the influences do not just flow from the brain to the heart. Paced breathing at the resonance frequency of the heart rate-baroreceptor feedback loop (around 6 breaths/min, a pace often attained during meditative practice) stimulates resonance characteristics of the cardiovascular system and so increases total HRV amplitude dramatically. Recent studies using this approach have shown that increasing HRV during short daily sessions can improve longer-term emotional outcomes. But it is unclear why episodes of high HRV have a positive impact. This project would be the first to examine the brain mechanisms of these effects, testing the hypothesis that episodes of high HRV induced by resonance frequency breathing lead to positive outcomes because they induce dynamic blood flow oscillations in brain regions that monitor and regulate physiological body states. Our experimental manipulation will be a 5-week protocol with random assignment to either a daily session with paced breathing at resonance frequency or one of two control conditions. We test the hypothesis that resonance frequency breathing will enhance measures of emotional well-being, resting state functional connectivity among brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and flexible up- and down-regulation of the amygdala during emotional experience. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that these outcomes will be mediated by blood flow variability during paced breathing rather than by alternative mechanisms. The expected findings would indicate that HRV is more than just an indicator of health, with an active role in stimulating brain regions in the central autonomic network to improve their coordination and function."
"9275975","The Transgenic Core deserves special mention because it has been a critical resource for major advances by BNORC scientists who study the neural control of feeding and reward, a central research question in the obesity field.

BNORC neuroscientist members are at the forefront of the field in applying these powerful technologies, moving the field closer to a wiring diagram for CNS control of feeding behavior, reward/motivation and metabolism. As mentioned above, since neuron-specific Cre-expressing mice enable each of these technologies, the BNORC Transgenic Core serves as a focal point for these activities.

"9252376","Fungal pathogens have a significant and increasing impact on human health-, and the lack of effective  treatments highlight the need for further study. This proposal will examine both major pathogens with large  clinical impacts and recent cases of severe outbreaks of fungal infections. In the first aim, we will examine  two large clinical cohorts of Cryptococcus neoformans, to define the genetic determinants of virulence and  niche adaptation in the pathogen. We will also characterize pathogen gene expression at the primary site of  severe infection, and both screen for and evaluate mutations that stabilize extra copies of chromosomes, a  major mechanism of fungal drug resistance. In the second aim, we will examine three recent cases of fungal  outbreaks in the US; isolates of Cryptococcus gattii and Fusarium spp will be sampled from clinical cases  and the environment and sequenced to examine how environmental reservoirs differ from strains virulent in  humans, similar to work in aim 1, and further monitor how one of these outbreaks spread over geography  and time. Lastly in aim 3, we will examine the host and pathogen interface for C. albicans, a common  commensal and the most common fungal pathogen, and other commonly observed Candida species  infecting the primary innate immune cells involved in early Candida detection and response. We will use  network analysis to identify host-pathogen hubs and to study how these networks evolve between strains  and species differing in virulence and drug resistance.

"9260711","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have been associated with increased prevalence of both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans. Recent data demonstrate that those with TBI-related injuries concurrent with PTSD, experience worsening of symptoms in the delayed post- deployment period. The compounded effects of PTSD-TBI make the diagnosis, management, treatment, and rehabilitation of those affected a challenge in VA, military, and civilian medical facilities. It has become increasingly important to recognize symptoms in veterans with comorbid PTSD-TBI compared to those symptoms associated with TBI or PTSD alone, in the rehabilitation period. One mechanism to have recently come into focus to explain the compounded effects of comorbid PTSD-TBI is impaired cortical activation, a condition that has been observed following either TBI or PTSD alone. TBI itself results in hypoactivity of cortical neurons, which is mirrored in patients affected with onl PTSD. Surprisingly, to date, there have been few preclinical studies to evaluate the impact of combined TBI and PTSD on neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex, adding to the significance and conceptual innovation of the proposed project. This knowledge gap will be addressed in the current application by examining cortical hypoactivation in comorbid PTSD-TBI, using mouse models of mild, non-contusive TBI and PTSD. Cortical hypoactivation will be evaluated at numerous levels, including markers of excitatory neurotransmission, dendritic structure, cortical volume, neuronal activation and cortically-mediated behaviors. The strength of this application is the comprehensive analysis of cortical function from receptor expression and activation to behavioral measures and use of novel imaging modalities to examine the longitudinal progression of symptoms. In addition, rehabilitative interventions using novel glutamatergic compounds, such as memantine, will be employed as translationally-relevant therapies for comorbid PTSD-TBI. We hypothesize that the combination of PTSD-TBI will exacerbate behavioral and molecular endpoints, functional/structural assessments of excitatory neurotransmitter levels, dendritic morphology, cortical volume, neuronal plasticity and cortical activation compared to either condition alone and that these deficits will be reversed by neurotherapeutic intervention. We will test this hypothesis using the following Specific Aims: 1.) Evaluate the influence of comorbid PTSD- TBI on cognitive behaviors, neuronal structure and markers of excitatory neurotransmission compared to either condition alone, 2.) Quantify the long-term impacts of comorbid PTSD-TBI on cortical neurotransmitter levels (neurochemical), volume (structural) and neuroactivation (functional) using novel magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques in a longitudinal manner in vivo compared to either condition alone, 3.) Evaluate the ability of neurotherapeutic treatment to improve/restore structural and neurotransmitter-related deficits associated with PTSD-TBI and thereby, to improve cognitive behaviors and cortical function."

"9344740","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Schizophrenia is a debilitating and costly psychiatric disorder which affects 1 in every 100 individuals in the U.S. The illness has severe consequences for psychological, social, and occupational functioning, which often leave individuals dependent on others for care and support. Schizophrenia not only takes a devastating toll on patients, it can place a tremendous burden on families who provide the bulk of care often without training and in isolation. For many individuals with schizophrenia family members are lifetime support systems. Family psychoeducation is a well-established and rigorously evaluated evidence-based practice for the treatment of schizophrenia. Meeting the needs of families by providing information, guidance, and techniques for coping, dramatically improves patient outcomes while also increasing relatives? well-being. Yet less than 10% of families receive any education or support. Because most families do not receive these valuable resources, there is a compelling need to develop new ways to disseminate evidence-based support that can be easily implemented and widely distributed. As outlined in NIMH?s strategic objectives, innovative technological services to support care and improve outcomes for both patients and their family members are critically needed. One way to bridge this gap and to increase accessibility of these resources is through the use of mobile web-based technologies. In the current study, we will develop an innovative, widely accessible and audience appropriate web-based tool to provide core elements of family psychoeducation designed to (1) cultivate knowledge and awareness; (2) generate empathy and insight into the experiences of people with schizophrenia; (3) build coping skills, problem solving techniques and effective communication; (4) develop strategies to combat stigma; and (5) identify and emphasize early intervention. This product is built upon the validated evidence base which confirms fostering practical competencies helps improve relationships, care, communication, and well-being. The product, which is customizable to accommodate a range of needs, includes didactic content; interactive experiential activities; documentary-style videos; and a library of video vignettes. During Phase I we will complete prototype development and feasibility testing with key stakeholders and families. Throughout this process we will integrate input from stakeholders, families, and our expert clinical advisors. Program development will include formative research to finalize the content, approach and strategies for engaging families in an easily understandable and meaningful way. The prototype will demonstrate the goals of the complete product including content, interactivity and videos for two thematic sections. We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to obtain feedback from stakeholders and relatives to determine usability, acceptability, and commercialization potential as well as to assess effectiveness of outcome measures in order to provide proof of concept for Phase II. The proposed product not only offers the potential for significant benefits to families dealing with schizophrenia, so, too, does it address a large currently untapped market."
"9345761","In this Phase II SBIR application, Experiad Solutions proposes to complete the development of Motivity, a new type of software that has the potential to modernize the practice of behavioral therapy for autism. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is an evidence-based autism treatment that is practiced by over 20,000 Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs ®) in the US. BCBAs analyze a child?s unique needs, then construct an individualized curriculum of skill acquisition and behavior modification programs consisting of sequences of progressive targets to be achieved. Each BCBA adheres to an intervention model, either formal or informal, which is comprised of the specific teaching instructions in their program library and the accompanying rules that define how targets are introduced, scored, and mastered. The BCBA supervises a Behavioral Technician (BT), who conducts the therapy and collects performance data. The BCBA analyzes the data to determine mastery and adjust programs as needed. This structured, data-driven process is critical to the effectiveness of ABA therapy, but the labor-intensive workflow limits a BCBA to supervising a small number of BTs at a time. The demand for ABA services far-outstrips the availability of qualified providers, many of whom have waiting lists of hundreds of families. Software systems can theoretically help improve provider efficiency and collaboration, but the vast majority of ABA service providers still use paper methods. Existing systems do not offer a compelling enough value-proposition to switch from paper, due to insufficient expressiveness, lack of knowledge management tools, and inadequate mechanisms for communicating instructions and answering questions. Many ABA service providers have spent years developing and fine-tuning their own libraries of paper programs, and they reject the idea of compromising their practice to fit a rigid third party system. Motivity overcomes these limitations by enabling BCBAs to implement their own software intervention delivery system that preserves the rich semantic content of their paper-based model. Motivity achieves this through a unique approach that lets BCBAs author their ABA programs using a concise, high-level markup language. This approach is far more flexible than template-based systems, allowing a wider range of programs to be modeled, and greatly streamlines the process of creating, modifying, and maintaining those programs. The Motivity platform translates the programs into custom data collection apps that allow BCBAs to remotely supervise BTs as data are being collected in the field, viewing the result of each trial instantaneously as it is entered. Motivity will support context-integrated two-way consultation, enabling virtual supervision or assistance, potentially reducing the frequency of BCBA travel to the child?s home where the therapy is being performed. Furthermore, Motivity will allow supervisors to make changes to the curriculum at any time, thereby enabling a much more agile therapy process. The Phase II aims are to complete the development of the Motivity cloud-based software and test it in an extensive pilot study."
"9306458","PROJECT SUMMARY Specific language impairment (LI) is a common child learning disorder that can persist into adulthood and that affects approximately 7% of children in the United States. LI is characterized by marked deficits in acquiring aspects of language including the sound structure of language, grammatical morphology, and the syntactic rules that govern word order. Individuals who are diagnosed with LI in childhood often show increased risk of developing other disabilities including learning disability and reading disability, in addition to being at increased risk of behavioral problems and failure to thrive in academic environments. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to optimize a theoretical understanding of the neural and behavioral etiology of LI. Although a substantial amount of high quality behavioral and brain-based research has been conducted and informed LI treatment, this research has often made assumptions about the intact nature of lower-level phonetic skills in LI. The first step towards the long-term goal is to test the hypothesis that LI reflects deficits in the neural representation and functional plasticity of phonetic category structure. Aim 1 uses fMRI neuroimaging to examine how the brain represents phonetic category structure. We hypothesize that (1) children and adults with LI will show evidence of rigidity in the temporoparietal brain regions that process phonetic category structure and (2) phonetic category structure becomes more defined across development such the neural coding of category goodness is more graded in adults compared to children. Aim 2 uses behavioral tasks to examine functional plasticity of phonetic category structure with respect to signal-driven and lexically-driven learning mechanisms. We hypothesize that children and adults with LI will show a decreased ability to dynamically modify the mapping to phonetic categories as a consequence of exposure to different distributions of phonetic variability. We also hypothesize that language ability mediates how lexical information is used to dynamically adjust perceptual representations and predict that children and adults with LI will show an attenuated ability to modify the mapping to speech sound categories using lexical information. With respect to previous research that has focused on characterizing LI in a static perceptual space, the innovation in this proposal is examining the neural and behavioral basis of the dynamic processes that support plasticity of phonetic category structure. The proposed research addresses important theoretical and clinical problems in the fields of language science, neurobiology, language impairment, and clinical practice including the need for a theoretical understanding of how phonetic category structure is formed and maintained across the developmental trajectory. Achieving these aims will lay important groundwork for improved specification of etiology of LI, which can be used to develop more targeted rehabilitation protocols, as well as for future neuroimaging studies that will be able to further explicate the neural basis of LI and functional plasticity."
"9332877","Fear in nonthreatening contexts is a hallmark of anxiety disorders. The hippocampus' plays a critical role in recognizing a context as a previously experienced dangerous one or a safe one. We will study the ability to differentiate such contexts in rats. Rats have proven to be an excellent model of human anxiety disorders. Rats need a period to explore a context in order to learn that it is dangerous. Our data indicate that a period just long enough to support robust fear learning results in generalizing that fear to any similar context. They need a longer period to learn a specific fear that allows them to distinguish between danger and safety. We will study the biology of this type of learning. We will examine how a particular neuromodulator, acetylcholine (ACh), influences the ability for this learning and have discovered that stimulating this neuromodulatory system enhances the learning. Anxiety disorders are much more prevalent in women and we will test the hypothesis that at certain times during the female cycle, when metabolites of progesterone are high, they act to dampen the brain's response to this neuromodulator. This results in a state where fear learning will be more nonspecific and generalize to safe situations. To study this we will use optogenetics to selectively stimulate ACh and measure release of this neuromodulator with a novel biosensor implanted in a brain region responsible for learning. We will also measure the rhythms of brain activity produced by the neuromodulator, the ability to learn fear and to differentiate safe and dangerous environments. We will compare male and female rats and also compare females in different stages of their cycle. This will provide a deeper understanding of why anxiety disorders develop and why they are more prevalent in women."
"9301942","In the United States, nearly 100,000 patients receive general anesthesia and sedation daily to safely undergo surgical and non-surgical procedures. A high proportion of the patients receiving anesthesia care are elderly, and in addition may have pre-existing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or cerebrovascular disease. As such, elderly patients have a higher risk of post-operative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Anesthesiologists know that management of older patients requires different approaches compared with that of younger patients. For example, the dose required to achieve the same anesthetic state in elderly patients can be 50% lower than that for younger patients. Unfortunately, at present we know little about the fundamental neurophysiology of how anesthetic drugs influence the aging brain. This represents a major knowledge gap that prevents us from developing novel approaches to more safely administer anesthesia and sedation in elderly patients. In recent years, aided largely by non-invasive imaging methods, significant progress has been made in understanding systems-level neurophysiology of anesthetic effects in humans. In parallel, imaging biomarkers have advanced to enable the identification of two of the most common ?silent? pathologies that may put older adults at higher risk for poor post-anesthesia/surgical outcomes: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). We propose here to bring these two lines of research together with a study employing imaging markers of preclinical AD (amyloid PET, cortical atrophy) and CVD (FLAIR MRI, DTI) alongside sophisticated computational analysis of intra-operative EEG, with the goal of using these measures to better understand variability in response to anesthesia and post-operative outcomes. As we accomplish the aims of this grant, the data generated should lead to fundamental new insights into the neurophysiology of anesthesia in aging patients. These insights will advance knowledge about how to assess patients for risks of anesthesia and reduce those risks through improved brain monitoring, improved drug dosing, and a precision- medicine approach to tailoring anesthesia to the individual's brain."
"9431270","Epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurological disorder, affecting approximately 2 million people in the United States. While many patients achieve satisfactory seizure control with pharmacotherapy, there is a significant proportion (20-40%) who have medically intractable seizures. For these patients identification of novel methods for seizure control is a high priority. One such method may be to harness endogenous seizure suppressive circuits in the brain. Because seizures may have multiple or unknown sites of initiation, focal stimulation approaches (e.g., deep brain stimulation [DBS]) that can control seizures originating in diverse brain networks are highly desirable. The circuitry of the basal ganglia has received particular attention in this regard.  Here, we propose to employ optogenetic methodologies to analyze the contribution of the nigrotectal pathway and its descending projections to the pedunculopontine nucleus to seizure control. The SNpr is major source of inhibitory input to DLSC. Moreover, both DLSC and SNpr both provide synaptic input to PPN. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that optogenetic silencing of the SNpr, activation of DLSC, or silencing of SNpr to DLSC projections will control spontaneous recurrent seizures in a post-status epilepticus model. In Aim 2, we will determine if projections from SNpr/DLSC to the PPN are necessary and sufficient to account for basal-ganglia mediated seizure control. We will dissect the contribution of multiple cell types within the PPN, separately analyzing glutamatergic and cholinergic cell groups.  In the service of these aims, we will examine the effects of optogenetic manipulations on complementary spontaneous and evoked seizure models to map the contributions of this network to seizure suppression within divergent seizure circuits. Together the proposed studies will provide proof of principle for optogenetic modulation of seizures in diverse networks from a single circuit. Moreover, this approach allows us to examine previously untestable hypotheses about the connections that mediate basal ganglia seizure control. Finally, the proposed experiments aim to uncover the circuit and neurotransmitter mechanism by which focal manipulations in motor control regions (i.e., SNpr/DLSC) translate into brain-wide changes in excitability."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Widespread uptake of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV holds the promise of reducing morbidity and HIV transmission - but requires consistent engagement with the health care system. South Africa has the largest ART program in the world, with 2.4 million people on treatment. Yet despite this unprecedented accomplishment, UNAIDS estimates that ~60% of people in South Africa in need of treatment are still not accessing ART. This reflects attrition from the multiple critical steps on the path fom HIV testing to linkage to HIV care to lifelong ART and virologic suppression. Previous research on patient attrition from the HIV care cascade has focused on cross-sectional snapshots of points on the care continuum. This approach fails to capture long-term, dynamic patient movement into and out of the cascade. Improvement in each step of the continuum must be achieved together to improve overall rates of virologic suppression and survival. Only by understanding patient, structural, and geographic factors that contribute to suboptimal progression through the continuum of care can we design effective interventions that target those at highest risk for poor care engagement. Innovative means of assessing patient progression longitudinally and across different treatment sites are needed to assess the dynamic, non-linear nature of the HIV care continuum.  Leveraging a well-characterized cohort of nearly 2,000 HIV-infected people drawn from an NIMH- funded trial in South Africa (R01MH090326), we will assess 5-year HIV care trajectories, characterizing patients via group-based statistical modeling based on a combination of national laboratory data and death registry information. Because cohort study subjects were consented prior to HIV testing, in a variety of clinical sites and with a wide spectrum of presenting CD4 counts, we will be able to characterize risk factors for different long-term trajectories for a wide variety of patient types. In addition,we will define geographic areas associated with poor engagement in care using spatial analysis of care trajectories and 2011 South African census data. We propose the following three specific aims: (1) To assess rates and sociobehavioral predictors of 5-year mortality following HIV testing adjusting for baseline and 9-month clinical factors, (2) To identify distinct long-term HIV care trajectories based on the pattern of CD4 counts and viral loads (such as in care, care interrupters, and not in care) and to assess sociobehavioral factors associated with membership in one of these trajectories, and (3) To use geographic information system and spatial statistical analysis to identify hot spots associated with a higher likelihood of inconsistent long-term HIV care trajectories and higher mortality.  This study will be among the first to examine longitudinal engagement in care for people newly- diagnosed with HIV. Our novel approach will help researchers and policymakers craft effective interventions targeting sub-populations of HIV-infected individuals and geographic areas with a higher likelihood of poor HIV care engagement. These findings can improve HIV care at the individual, program and community levels."
"9392423","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent discovery that de novo zygotic mutations in the form of CNVs and point mutations make major contributions to neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and autism begs the question as to the degree to which de novo post-zygotic mosaic mutations also contribute to disease. In this model, a mutation that occurs post-zygotically can seed some percentage of cells in the brain, and is sufficient to lead to neuronal dysfunction and disease. The approach of sequencing only non-neural tissues such as blood may underpower the detection of mosaicism, because mutations may be restricted to neural tissue. This proposal brings together a highly productive and collaborative team, in which each member contributes a special resource to make this effort truly unique. Gleeson and Mathern recently identified among the first de novo somatic mutations in the developing brain in the condition known as `hemimegalencephaly' (HME), a catastrophic neuropsychiatric condition associated with focal cortical disorganization (FCD). By comparing DNA from diseased brain vs. blood, we identified de novo somatic mutations in PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR, part of the mTOR pathway, in as few as 8% of brain cells, resulting in perturbations in an entire cerebral hemisphere. Courchesne and Roy recently identified focal patches of abnormal laminar cytoarchitecture in frontal and temporal cortex in the majority of available brain samples of children studied with autism (ASD), and we suggest focal patches akin to FCD may have similar mutations and contribute to disease. The goal of this application is to extend the discovery of mosaicism in patients with epilepsy and autism in which neurohistopathological evidence points to FCD, by sequencing dysplasias compared with adjacent normal tissue and/or blood at the DNA and RNA level at the single-cell level. We aim to uncover key sets of genes, in which specific de novo mutations, in specific locations, at specific mosaicism levels, is sufficient to produce clinically defined disease. We will combine next-generation sequencing of FCD brain from patients with neuropsychiatric disease with advanced bioinformatics, single-cell sequencing, complete clinical correlated neuroanatomy and mouse modeling. We will: 1] Test for de novo somatic mutations in a retrospective and prospective cohort of FCD presenting with autism or epilepsy. 2] Correlate genetic disease burden with clinical, imaging, histopathological and single-cell sequencing findings. 3] Test mechanisms by which uncovered de novo mutations alter progenitor cell functions in mammalian cerebral cortex."
"9264044","Project 3 Project Leader: Davis, Ronald L. Project Summary / Abstract The goal of this research is to identify the microRNA genes in Drosophila that mediate the process of learning and memory. We will continue a large genetic screen, surveying the importance of hundreds of microRNA genes, for their participation in short-, intermediate-, and long-term memory. These efforts will identify the subset of microRNA genes that have a functional involvement in memory formation, and perhaps in different temporal phases of olfactory memory. We will also study in great detail two microRNA genes that we have already discovered to improve memory when the microRNA gene function is impaired. Because impairing the gene improves memory, the normal function of the unimpaired genes must be as ?memory suppressor? genes. There are few genes known that can improve memory, so our research holds great promise for potentially identifying therapeutic targets for memory disorders. Our research studies are embedded in a large, collaborative project with other investigators who are studying microRNA genes for roles in sleep, locomotor activity, and synapse structure and function. The combined results will provide a broad understanding of how microRNAs underlie behavior through their functions in the central nervous system."
"9250675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are being pursued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a means to rein in health care cost growth while improving quality of care, but little is known about how ACO efforts to improve health care efficiency might affect health care equity. In this context, the candidate (Dr. Valerie A. Lewis) seeks to understand how ACOs affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care outcomes. The candidate, a sociologist and health services researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will leverage this application to develop her research agenda and develop into an independent investigator. During the period of support, she will pursue didactic instruction in several disciplines, including training in clinical conditions and organizational behavior along with leadership development. She will also have ample opportunity for mentored, project-based learning, including developing advanced understanding of how to measure quality of care. The proposed research plan has three aims: Aim 1. To examine Medicare ACO coverage across patient race and socioeconomic status. Dr. Lewis will use Medicare claims data to examine whether disadvantaged patients are more or less likely than other patients to receive care from ACO providers compared to non-ACO providers and will examine the relative effects of (a) patterns of provider participation in ACOs and (b) patient selection. She will then use the National Survey of ACOs to determine if disadvantaged ACO patients are cared for at ACOs that are systematically different from other ACOs (e.g., types of ACO providers or services, ACO capabilities). Aim 2. To examine how Medicare ACO programs impact disparities in patient care outcomes. Dr. Lewis will use longitudinal Medicare claims data to examine how Medicare ACO programs affect disparities in quality outcomes over time. Analysis will focus on the extent to which changes in disparities are a result of differences withi providers (e.g., all ACO providers improve care for disadvantaged groups) or across providers (e.g., providers serving disadvantaged patients make rapid improvements under ACO programs). Aim 3. To understand how organizational characteristics, capabilities, and strategies influence changing disparities over time under Medicare ACO programs. Dr. Lewis will examine how and why organizational characteristics and capabilities influence changing disparities under ACO models. She will use data from the National Survey of ACOs to explore how ACOs' organizational characteristics (e.g., partnership structure, governance, capabilities) and implementation strategy (e.g., care management programs, physician feedback mechanisms) affect changes in disparities over time. Finally, she will follow up with in-depth interviews to understand how organizational characteristics may be detrimental or beneficial to changing disparities in care. Findings from this project will inform policymakers and implementers about how the ACO model can best facilitate improved health care equity alongside important goals of increased efficiency."
"9280318","SUMMARY A fundamental advance in Neuroimaging in the last 10 years has been the development of methods to derive regional parcellations of the cerebral cortex, or `parcellated connectomes', from structural and/or functional MRI data. Within the Conte Center, the Neuroimaging core will focus on providing single subject and group connectomes of the brain in humans and macaques. Specifically, connectomes will allows for: (1) the localization of recording sites in relation to independently localized human cortical regions and networks; (2) standardization of recording site localization across centers, which will in turn provide a way to compare results across experiments; (3) definition of a macaque monkey cortical parcellation atlas for the comparison, sharing, and meta-analysis of physiological studies within our consortium, but also the wider non-human primates physiological community. The Neuroinformatics core will facilitate data sharing across the Conte Center sites and the neuroscience community through an open source web interface."
"9237254","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The bacteria of the oral microbiome form complex multispecies assemblages where species both compete and synergize to colonize each niche in the mouth. In our preliminary research, we discovered a novel aspect of microbial interactions among strains of oral Streptococci via gaseous/volatile compounds produced by some strains. In standard competition experiments these interactions blend with those mediated by diffusible compounds, confuse the picture, often missed, and remain understudied. We show that these interactions are strong and common among Streptococci. Here we will screen a collection of known and novel Streptococci to identify strains interacting via volatile compounds, and determine the nature of these compounds. The novelty of the project is in investigating the nature of previously overlooked or understudied aspects of Streptococcus ecology. This is important because the interactions we will study may influence which strains are able to establish themselves within the oral biofilm, ultimately impacting whether or not the community becomes infectious or remains benign."
"9246468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop a diverse pool of highly trained clinician scholars to foster the development of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV prevention and treatment in general medical settings. Patients who abuse substances are more likely to be seen in general medical settings such as emergency departments (ED), general medical primary care clinics and inpatient wards, HIV and adolescent health clinics, and women's health centers. These patients often present with a complex array of acute consequences and complications (e.g. intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, trauma and infectious diseases) of substance use as well as chronic conditions such as HIV disease, hepatitis, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Objectives: The Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program provides a comprehensive three year post-doctorate, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program to improve drug abuse, addiction, and HIV medical outcomes integrating prevention and treatment in general medical settings including ED, primary care, HIV, adolescent, and women's health clinics. Specifically, Yale-DAHRS will: [Aim 1] Develop clinician scientists with the knowledge, skills, and ability to become independent investigators, generating findings of practical value with significant impact to improve health outcomes of patients with and at risk for drug abuse, addiction, and HIV; [Aim 2] Develop future leaders by providing Scholars with leadership tools and skills and creating individualized programs to ensure success in leading multidisciplinary research teams in studying drug abuse, addiction and HIV, and implementation and integration of research findings into general medical settings; and [Aim 3] Enhance the diversity of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV researchers. Addressing women and minority faculty under representation will enhance the diversity of investigators and research topics, broaden perspectives in setting research priorities, increase clinical trial participation, and expand knowledge. Working synergistically with Yale's established training programs in drug abuse, HIV and clinical investigation, Yale- DAHRS will capitalize on existing academic infrastructure and expertise to ensure success. Unique, features include: (1) An interdisciplinary, diverse faculty of independent researchers in illicit and prescription drug abuse and addiction, tobacco, alcohol, HIV, and medical complexities such as pain and hepatitis C; (2) Synergy with well established, high quality post-doctoral training programs at Yale; (3) The use of clinical informatics for data collection, data management, diagnostic tool development, and information dissemination; and (4) The integration of such diverse fields as public health, informatics, clinical epidemiology, systems engineering and demography with the traditional clinical sciences of internal medicine, emergency medicine, HIV medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and psychology; (5) Established clinical research laboratories, including the Yale-New Haven Hospital, a tertiary care center for southern New England and a community hospital for the Greater New Haven Area, serving an ethnically, racially, culturally, and economically diverse population, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center and community treatment centers such as the APT Foundation and Federally Qualified Health Centers; (6) Synergies with established research centers and institutes such as the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS and the Veterans Aging Cohort on HIV. Career Development Plan: Yale-DAHRS is a three year research training program that will prepare a total of six clinician investigators for careers focusing on drug abuse, addiction, and HIV in general medical settings during its first funding cycle. Scholars will earn the Master in Health Sciences degree, combining rigorous training in research methodology, statistics and design with seminars in topics related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV content, leadership, grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Candidates will complete published mentored research project(s) and prepare an application for the next career step; i.e. NIH R21, R03, R15, R34 mechanism. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary faculty and the combined robust strengths of two principal investigators from Emergency and Internal Medicine, both with extensive experience mentoring and as independent funded investigators will drive the Yale-DAHRS program. Potential Research Projects: Multiple research projects are shovel ready for Scholar training and can be completed within our allotted time frame, such as secondary data analysis using national large datasets e.g. VA Aging Cohort (HIV); risk factors, prevention and treatment of prescription drug abuse, office-based treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, creation of cost effective evaluation models for patients with drug abuse, addiction and HIV including prescription drug abuse; investigation of gender and racial/ethnic disparities in identification and treatment interventions and outcomes; evaluation of screening, and treatment initiation in special populations (i.e. adolescent-elderly, veterans, incarcerated, HIV); comparison of models of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) delivery by providers and other innovative technologies; effectiveness and implementation of SBIRT science in general medicine practice with acute and chronic medical complexities."
"9251879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that the delivery of progenitor cells to the infarcted heart improves mechanical function, although the functional mechanism remains equivocal. A major limitation of cell delivery systems for cardiac repair has been ineffective localization and retention of cells in the heart. Recently, we developed new methods for producing biopolymer micro-threads that can be tailored to modulate cell attachment and migration. By attaching these micro-threads to a surgical needle, we have developed a novel biological suture that can be seeded with cells. This method efficiently delivers cells to the heart with a 63.6 ? 10.6 % engraftment rate, which is significantly higher than the 11.8 ? 6.2 % engraftment rate determined for intramyocardial injection. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that fibrin micro-thread-based delivery of progenitor cells can efficiently deliver cells to infarcted regions of the heart, resulting in improved mechanical function. In the first aim, we will determine how strategically enhancing cell adhesion to micro-threads with ECM proteins prior to implantation improves cell engraftment in the beating rat heart. As multiple cell types have been shown to improve mechanical function in the infarcted heart, we will investigate the delivery of two different types of cells: pre-differentiated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We will also determine how extending cell incubation time increasing cell adhesion strength to micro-threads. The second aim will determine the therapeutic effects of micro-thread-mediated progenitor cell delivery on promoting myocardial regeneration and mechanical function in the infarct zone and border zone. Cell delivery as a function of viability status of myocardial tissue will be assessed by concurrently delivering cells to healthy, infarcted and border zone tissue. Cell engraftment rates and regional mechanical function will be evaluated. Expression of cardiac specific markers will also be evaluated. The final aim will analyze how combining progenitor cell types with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) increases regeneration of myocardium in the infarcted rat heart. Individual micro-threads will be seeded with EPCs and combined with micro-threads seeded with iPS cell- derived cardiomyocytes or MSCs. We will also evaluate the ability of these cells to engraft and differentiate in the rat heart. Development of this innovative technology will improve cell delivery to the heart while providing targeted delivery and concise placement of cells in the region of interest."
"9273113","PROJECT SUMMARY We are requesting funds to purchase a PacBio Sequel long-read, single molecule sequencer, the latest next-generation sequencing instrument, released in September of 2015. The system will be placed in the Genome Technology Center (GTC) at New York University Langone Medical Center (NYULMC), a shared resource administered by the Office of Collaborative Science and operated by experienced and highly trained staff. The GTC is under the direction of Dr. Adriana Heguy, an expert in genomics with many years of experience providing genomics research in a collaborative setting. Currently the GTC provides only short read sequences on our three HiSeqs and two MiSeqs. We have no long read single molecule capability, with the exception of a MinION which has very limited throughput and capabilities, a high error rate and is not industry-standard. The requested PacBio Sequel will be utilized to fulfill the needs of a large community of NYU investigators with established and NIH funded research programs in microbiology, metagenomics, immunology, parasite biology and basic cellular processes such as DNA methylation and DNA repair, all of which require long-read, single molecule sequencing. These projects cannot be carried out with current short-read technology and their progress has been hampered by limited access to long-read sequencing through other institutions. The PacBio Sequel is the best instrument for the needs of our investigators; it provides increased capacity and flexibility, requires less space and operates at a lower cost as compared to the previous generation PacBio RS II System. The redesigned SMRT flow cell is based on their industry- standard, proven technology for long reads, high accuracy, uniform coverage and simultaneous epigenetic characterization. The PacBio Sequel will support the NIH funded projects of 7 Major Users and 6 Minor Users at NYU. The Major Users will occupy 68% of instrument capacity; 97% capacity for combined usage of both groups. All users are NIH funded. Any remaining capacity of this instrument will be allocated for pilot projects to generate preliminary data for grant proposals. We have extensive bioinformatics and high performance computing capabilities, already enabled for PacBio data analysis and storage. NYULMC is committed to supporting cutting edge genomics through strong institutional support of the GTC, and the acquisition, implementation and maintenance of the PacBio Sequel."
"9246396","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The premise of the proposed research is that older citizens possess considerable untapped potential related to their emotional balance and preferences for meaningful activity. Empirical evidence suggests that opportunities for meaningful work (paid or unpaid) may be especially motivating for older people and that older people may be especially well-suited for work that draws on social and emotional skills. Moreover, engagement in meaningful work is associated with increases in older adults' relatively low levels of physical activity. Thus, motivating activity by tapping preferences for meaningful engagement has the potential to improve the health and well-being of older people as well as the broader public that is served. The research is guided by socio-emotional selectivity theory, which maintains that changing time horizons result in systematic age differences in motivation and emotion. Specifically, when time horizons are expansive, people are motivated to explore and learn. When time horizons are constrained, people are motivated to prioritize emotionally meaningful experience. Over the past two decades socio-emotional selectivity theory has been extensively tested and validated in basic empirical studies; there is now a great opportunity to apply the theory to everyday domains outside of the laboratory. We propose a series of studies that explore postulates and test hypotheses about the ways that positive changes in emotional experience and the prioritization of emotional goals can enhance behavioral practices and performance in three areas: workplace productivity, physical activity, and volunteer activities. Three broad aims are pursued. Aim I tests hypotheses about (a) age differences in work preferences and the role of perceived time horizons therein, (b) comparisons of age differences in behavioral and emotional experience during work, and (c) exploratory research using company-level data to reveal contributions of older workers that may be overlooked in current managerial practices. Aim II tests hypotheses that older people prefer physical activities framed in terms of emotional meaning more so than activities specified as exercise, and that emotionally meaningful incentives are most effective in increasing walking in older people. Aim III applies the same theoretical approach to optimize the recruitment and retention of older volunteers nearing retirement age. By extending the research program in these innovative and applied directions, we extend the theory in novel ways that can help to refine the conceptual basis of the research as well as identify potential ways to improve public health. The research proposed in this renewal application is poised to have high impact because our research partners in private and government organizations have the ability to implement empirically-validated approaches on a large scale. Partners include the civic leadership of Santa Clara County, the President's Council on Physical Fitness, Mercer, Fidelity, and Target Corporation, each of which has the capacity to improve the health and well-being of the populations they serve."
"9230332","Many existing animal models and traditional cell culture based models do not adequately reflect pathogen-host  interactions or even support the growth of human enteric pathogens. The Wells lab has developed a human  intestinal organoid (HIO) system, where HIOs are derived from the directed differentiation of human pluripotent  stem cells (hPSCs). This pioneering approach allows for in vitro studies of human enteric pathogens, both viral  and bacterial. Importantly, we have been instrumental in disseminating this technology to the global research  community. We have trained numerous investigators, at our institution and around the world in the use of this  technology. For example in studying bacterial and virus-host interaction (3) the lead author was trained in my  lab and brought the HIO technology back to Mary Estes lab at Baylor. We have also hosted weeklong HIO  training sessions for trainees from the labs of Dr. Jim Goldenring (Vanderbilt), Dr. Calvin Kuo (Stanford), Dr.  Martin Martin (UCLA). In this application the human organoid core will fill current gaps in enteric disease  research by developing new systems to identify molecular pathways involved in pathogenesis of enteric  agents. In addition, we will carry on our tradition of providing human gastrointestinal tissues, training, and  support to researchers affiliated with this proposal, and to all other investigators in the field.  Human PSCs can differentiate into all cell and tissue types of the body, and can therefore be used to generate  tissues that can be used to study a plethora of disease processes affecting different organ systems. Moreover,  with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell technology, pluripotent stem cell lines can be generated from  any patient, allowing for patient-specific disease modeling and therapies. Because of the enormous potential of  PSCs, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) supported the establishment of the human  Pluripotent Stem Cell Facility (PSCF) (https://research.cchmc.org/stemcell/), established by Dr. Wells in 2007  and co-directed by Dr. Mayhew. This was one of the first human pluripotent stem cell cores in the country and  has been used as a model for cores at other institutions such as Cleveland Clinic and Case Western  (http://pscf.case.edu/). In aim 1 the core will generate and provide iPSCs as well as training to the U19  investigators. We have trained many labs around the world in HIO technology and should we become part of a  U19 consortium, CCHMC had committed to fully support the training of personnel from all participating  NAMSED institutions (see letter from Dr. Arnold Strauss). In aim 2 we will generate and provide genetically  modified PSC lines and gastrointestinal organoids for mechanistic studies of enteric pathogens (Table 1)  proposed in the 3 projects. These will be used to identify pathogen targeted cell types and molecular pathways  that function in specific cell types during pathogenesis."
"9236215","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ARDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. There are no specific therapies for ARDS other than protective mechanical ventilation and conservative fluid management and mortality remains high at 30-50%. Thus, there is a critical need for specific therapies that target fundamental mechanisms of ARDS. Increased lung epithelial permeability is a pathophysiologic hallmark of ARDS and is manifest clinically by pulmonary edema, impaired gas exchange and acute respiratory failure. We have identified cell free hemoglobin as a novel mediator of increased epithelial permeability in ARDS. Our preliminary data show that airspace levels of cell-free hemoglobin are high in ARDS and are associated with increased lung permeability and poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is the Ferryl oxidized form of hemoglobin that is elevated in the airspaces in ARDS. In a clinical trial in severe sepsis, the leading cause of ARDS, treatment with an inhibitor of Ferryl hemoglobin, acetaminophen, decreased lipid peroxidation and attenuated acute kidney injury. In cultured lung epithelial cells, hemoglobin treatment induces epithelial barrier permeability through cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. Furthermore, intratracheal administration of cell-free hemoglobin to the lungs of mice leads to generation of oxidized Ferryl hemoglobin and increased lung alveolar capillary barrier permeability. These findings support the overall hypothesis for the proposed studies, that formation of Ferryl-Hgb in the airspace in ARDS causes alveolar epithelial cell oxidative stress and increased epithelial permeability, contributing to the pathophysiology of ARDS. To test this hypothesis I have assembled a cross-disciplinary team of co-Investigators and consultants with expertise in clinical ARDS (Ware), Hgb redox chemistry (Roberts), primary alveolar epithelial cell isolation and culture (Guttentag), mitochondrial oxidative stress (Dikalov), human models of ARDS (Matthay) and advanced in vivo imaging techniques (West) whose expertise complements my own in cellular models of epithelial permeability and animal models of ARDS. We will utilize clinical samples of pulmonary edema fluid already collected from patients with ARDS and hydrostatic pulmonary edema along with mouse and epithelial cell culture studies to show that levels of Ferryl hemoglobin in the airspace are increased in human ARDS and cause increased lung epithelial permeability in mice and cultured epithelial cells (Aim 1). We will define the cellular and molecular mechanism of hemoglobin induced increases in epithelial permeability and cellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress in the epithelium (Aim 2). Finally we will test a therapy targeted at Ferryl hemoglobin (acetaminophen) in cell culture, in a clinically relevant model of ventilator induced lung injury in mice and in an isolated perfused human lung model (Aim 3). This proposal is highly innovative and addresses a clinically significant problem. Results from these studies will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of lung epithelial permeability in acute lung injury and will pave the way for future novel targeted therapeutics in ARDS."
"9247034","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a tremendous need for improved treatments for schizophrenia (SCZ), especially for its 'negative' symptoms and cognitive deficits. Oxytocin is a reproductive hormone that is also a powerful regulator of brain processes that are very relevant to SCZ. Preliminary research in animals and humans indicate that the oxytocin system may be an auspicious target for developing new SCZ treatments. However, in order for that to occur, a much greater understanding of oxytocin's potential anti-SCZ effects is urgently needed to address inconsistencies and gaps in the existing body of data. Animal studies are an important tool for obtaining information about potential new treatments, but there has been surprisingly little animal research into oxytocin's anti-SCZ potential. The overall aim of this project is to address this critical gap in knowledge.  Since it is unclear which specific features f SCZ may be benefited by oxytocin, several experiments have been thoughtfully designed to evaluate its effects in a battery of state-of-the-art animal tests developed to represent the distinct clinical features of SCZ's cognitive and negative symptoms. Other experiments are designed to uncover the biological mechanisms and brain circuits that underlie oxytocin's anti-SCZ effects, something that has not previously been well studied. By testing the effects of long-term oxytocin treatment via the intranasal route, the standard route in human studies, these experiments will provide an understanding of oxytocin's effects that is more relevant to the chronic nature of clinical treatment than the preponderance of previous animal studies on this topic, which have typically examined one-time, peripheral or central oxytocin administration. As it is highly involved in reproductive function, oxytocin's brain effects are likely to differ in maes and females, but animal experiments investigating its SCZ-relevant effects have almost exclusively included only male subjects. By incorporating both female and male animals in experiments, this project will provide much needed information about possible sex differences in oxytocin's anti-SCZ effects. Another important feature of this project is that it will advance the characterization of a promising rat model of relevance to SCZ and facilitate the ultimate assessment of the validity of the tests used to model features of SCZ. This project will greatly expand the current body of scientific knowledge regarding oxytocin's anti-SCZ properties, including important information regarding potential dose-, sex-, and time-dependent aspects of its clinical effects, potential adverse effects, as well as individual characteristics that may hel identify likely responders to oxytocin treatment. These findings will guide future studies in animals and in patients with SCZ, while the findings regarding oxytocin's neurobiological mechanisms will likely guide the design of novel drugs that are based on oxytocin, but that possess improved efficacy and/or safety."
"9316119","Diarrheal is a leading cause of death and illness throughout the world and causes 560 million deaths of children under 5 years old. Rotavirus (RV) causes about 70% of viral diarrheas and even with two vaccines kills 215,000 children yearly. RV diarrhea is mainly due to excess Cl- secretion that drives fluid loss, but the cellular pathways responsible for RV-induced fluid secretion are not well defined, which limits efforts to develop and testing of potential anti-diarrheal drugs that can be used to treat children when protection by vaccines is insufficient. Activation of chloride (Cl-) secretory channels is regulated by intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and cyclic nucleotide (cAMP) signals These signals in turn activate Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCC), such as anoctamin (Ano) family, and cAMP-activated Cl- channels (cAMP-CC), such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). RV diarrhea is the classic example of Cl- secretion due to elevated Ca2+ because a hallmark of RV infection is increased Ca2+ signaling, which is induced by the RV nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4). Ano channels are the prominent CaCCs in the gut; however, the Cl- channels responsible for RV diarrhea have yet to be identified. Additionally, NSP4 is considered the primary initiator of RV-induced Ca2+ signals; however, the mechanisms by which NSP4-derived signals cause Cl- channel activation and fluid secretion have not been adequately explored. In Aim 1, we will identify the Cl- channels responsible for RV diarrhea using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Little is known about the expression of different Cl- channels throughout the human intestine, particularly children, we will use human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) to determine gene expression of the key Cl- channels and their regulatory proteins. Next, we will measure the ability of RV to activate individual Cl- channels using a fluorescence quench assay and determine whether those channels contribute to fluid secretion using the enteroid swelling assay (ESA) in the presence of specific Cl- channel blockers. Lastly, we will determine whether inhibitors of Ano1 or CFTR will attenuate diarrhea and if so whether intestinal specific deletion of those channels also reduces diarrhea. In Aim 2, we will determine whether RV NSP4 activates both Ca2+ and cAMP through activation of the sensor stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1). STIM1 activation can generate Ca2+ signals through the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway, as well as cAMP signals through the store-operated cAMP signaling (SOcAMPs) pathway. We will use live cell imaging of intestinal cell lines and HIEs expressing fluorescent Ca2+ and cAMP biosensors to determine whether RV and NSP4 activate both SOCE and SOcAMPs and use the ESA to determine whether the Ca2+/cAMP signals generated by NSP4 cause fluid secretion. Lastly, we will determine whether blockers of SOCE or SOcAMPs will attenuate RV diarrhea in vivo. Our results will generate critical insights into the mechanisms of viral diarrhea and new biosensor HIE model systems that can be applied to future studies enteric virus, such as noroviruses and astroviruses."
"9263321","Project 1 of the Myanmar Regional ICEMR addresses questions in Research Areas A, Epidemiology and B, Transmission. Malaria elimination may require eradicating all parasites from all infected persons, not just those with clinical symptoms. If clinical malaria represents the ?tip of the iceberg?, understanding the rest of the iceberg?whether it poses risk or even benefit to infected individuals, and how it contributes to transmission in different epidemiological settings?will be important for malaria control and elimination. Using an ultrasensitive reverse transcription PCR (usPCR) assay, we are finding highly heterogeneous malaria prevalence of malaria in Myanmar. The World Health Organization recently endorsed mass drug administration (MDA) in Southeast Asia, and MDA is being undertaken in Myanmar based on subclinical malaria prevalence as measured by usPCR. However, no previous studies have assessed the clinical risks or transmission potential of the extremely low density malaria infections detected by these tests. The first aim of Project 1 is to measure the dynamics of subclinical malaria infections and assess their contribution to the risk of clinical malaria and to transmission potential in Southeast Asia. We hypothesize that persistent subclinical Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections represent chronic infection that protects against clinical manifestations of malaria, and that subclinical malaria infections represent a potential source of transmission. A multicenter, matched cohort study will be conducted at six sites in Myanmar and along its borders with China and Bangladesh. usPCR will be used to measure the prevalence and dynamics of subclinical ultralow density P. falciparum and P. vivax infection. The association of subclinical infection with incidence of clinical malaria and infectivity will be estimated using multivariate and time-to-event models. This aim will generate evidence to guide recommendations about MDA and other elimination interventions. We also designed and are using protein and peptide microarrays to measure antibody responses to large numbers of variants of diverse malaria and mosquito proteins. These microarrays may prove useful as surveillance tools to measure exposure to parasites and mosquitoes, and provide a way to characterize genetic diversity in low density infections that are difficult to genotype. The second aim is to estimate recent and remote exposure to malaria parasites and vectors in humans using these arrays to measure seroreactivity to diverse malaria and mosquito antigens, testing the hypotheses that antibody responses to diverse variants of P. falciparum and P. vivax antigens are associated with exposure to new malaria infections; antibody responses to diverse Anopheles antigens are independently associated with risk factors for mosquito exposure and with local vector diversity and abundance; and seroreactivity to gametocyte proteins is associated with infectivity. This aim will generate sets of informative proteins and/or peptides useful for surveillance tools to guide elimination interventions, with potential for further development as a point-of-care sero-surveillance test to help malaria elimination programs stratify malaria risk."
"9240621","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapid acceleration of gene discovery, our understanding of penetrance and variable expressivity remains limited. The ciliopathies have emerged as a useful model to study these phenomena. An improved knowledge of ciliary composition has led to the identification of numerous disease loci, each of which can contribute causal and modifying alleles. Moreover, an appreciation of the signaling functions of the cilium has allowed the assessment of the in vivo pathogenic potential of alleles. In the previous cycle, we asked how mutational load in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) particle can influence phenotypic variability. Through this work, we identified new disease loci; we showed a significant contribution of CNVs; and we showed how increased IFT mutational load tracks with phenotypic severity. Here, we will extend our studies to understand how a modular approach to genetic disease can improve the predictive power of genetic data, inform genetic buffering mechanisms, and assist the development of therapeutics. Our ultimate goal is to understand how variation across the ciliary module affects expressivity. However, because the entire ciliary proteome remains experimentally intractable, we will anchor our work on robust Preliminary Data gained from the IFT particle and extend to the other two known ciliary particles: the transition zone complex and the BBSome. We propose three Aims. First, through the systematic functional analysis of mutational data, we will ask whether enrichment for mutations in the three complexes tracks with endophenotypes and whether there are genetic interactions between specific subparticles. Second, we have found a source of false negative prediction of pathogenicity to derive from evolutionary conservation, where a human mutant allele is fixed in a different species. Using in silico and in vivo tools, we found that these phenomena can be caused by cis complementation, where a co- evolving allele in the same gene offers a protective effect. We will ask whether this is a common buffering mechanism against deleterious alleles; and whether we can predict cis complementing sites by studying co- evolution within disease-causing proteins and their modules. Finally, we showed recently that proteasome augmentation can rescue core BBSome component defects. However, such manipulations failed to rescue IFT defects, or defects induced by transient BBSome components, suggesting that the position of proteins within modules might have a differential response to therapeutics. We will test this hypothesis by suppressing each component of the three complexes in vivo and in vitro and ask whether genetic or chemical proteasome augmentation can rescue phenotypes differentially. Overall, our studies will determine how the distribution of mutations within modules and between associated modules contribute to variable expressivity; will interrogate the understudied phenomenon of cis-modification, which can inform the pathogenic potential of haplotypes in humans; and will begin to explore how the differential position of mutations in functional complexes can influence response to therapeutic interventions and thus tailor future clinical trials to specific genotypes."
"9286500","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) represent a group of systemic autoimmune disorders in which muscle and extra-muscular organs are targeted for immune-mediated destruction. We have previously established a model of histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HRS)-induced myositis that involves MyD88-dependent innate immune signaling pathways featuring Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2, TLR4). Given the prominent role of these TLRs in our model of HRS-induced myositis, we hypothesize that heightened activation of the downstream transcription regulator NF-?B is ultimately responsible for various inflammatory cascades as well as non-immune pathways promoting muscle dysfunction in this system?effectively linking HRS-induced myositis/IIM with other disorders (including muscular dystrophy as well as sepsis- and trauma/ischemia- induced myopathies) in which NF-?B dysregulation contributes to muscle inflammation, muscle degeneration, and impaired regenerative potential. Through a series of in vitro culture systems and in vivo immunization strategies involving knockout mice lacking critical components of MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, we will systematically examine the impact of HRS-induced TLR signaling and NF-?B activation on T cell migration, T cell activation, and muscle weakness. While Specific Aim 1 will focus on HRS-induced changes in T cell function and TLR-mediated activation of vascular endothelium (leading to lymphocytic infiltration of target organs), Specific Aim 2 will define direct and indirect pathways of HRS-induced NF-?B activation in muscle tissue through in vitro myoblast stimulation assays as well as additional immunization studies focusing on correlations between muscle inflammation, NF-?B activation, and in vivo/ex vivo parameters of muscle weakness. Complementary in vivo assessment tools including MRI and the use of NF-?B-luciferase transgenic mice will further define the relationship between HRS-mediated NF-?B activation and muscle dysfunction, providing the foundation for experimental trials of comparative NF-?B inhibition in Specific Aim 3. Collectively, these studies will elucidate the contribution of innate immunity to the pathogenesis of IIM, supplementing more traditional paradigms of antigen-specific, adaptive immune recognition and identifying therapeutic targets that are potentially relevant to a range of human inflammatory muscle diseases."
"9257397","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic illnesses in children, affecting 1 in 400,1 with evidence that its prevalence is increasing worldwide.2 The prevalence of T1D in adolescents is approximately 70 percent White, 22 percent Hispanic, and 8 percent Black.3-5 Parents of children with T1D are responsible for a labor-intensive and complicated daily regimen that has been described as an overwhelming experience, requiring constant vigilance.6 Intensive management of T1D requires frequent blood glucose monitoring, multiple insulin injections or use of an insulin pump, frequent alterations in insulin dose to match changing diet and activity patterns, and regular visits to health care providers. This 24/7 attention to their child's health manifests in elevated rates of parental perception of stress and increased risk for depression and anxiety. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms for parents of children with T1D range from 21-59 percent; depressive symptoms from 10-74 percent; psychological distress from 29-33 percent; and posttraumatic stress symptoms from 19-24 percent.7-9 Parental psychological distress has negative health implications for the parent, the overall functioning of the family, the psychological adjustment of their child with T1D, diabetes management, and child metabolic control.10-14 The goal of this application is to complete the psycho-educational web-based program for parents of adolescents with T1D (Type1Teamwork) which will help to: 1) decrease parental perceived stress and distress; 2) promote parental adjustment to the developmental transitions in adolescence; 3) support adolescent autonomy and transfer of diabetes responsibility from parent to adolescent; 4) decrease family conflict; and 5) maintain metabolic control during adolescence. We propose to complete two major Aims in Phase II: Specific Aim 1: Develop the Type1Teamwork program (for use on computer, tablet, or smartphone) based on the activities completed in Phase I. Six content themes have been identified as important to parents and providers. Feasibility assessment has provided support of these content themes as well as substantive recommendations to ensure content and interactivity is engaging and meets the needs of parents of children with T1D as well as health care providers. We will use an iterative process of development and evaluation, collaborating with our technology team, parent advisors, and clinical consultants to ensure development of a quality product and to submit a peer reviewed manuscript for publication of the results. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the Type1Teamwork program through a modest randomized clinical trial. We will determine the effect of the program on parent psychosocial outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety), adolescent autonomy, parent-adolescent responsibility for T1D management, family conflict, and adolescent metabolic control. Results will be presented at diabetes meetings, published in top tier journals (to provide clinical and scientific evidence of the newly developed program), and widely disseminated per the commercialization and marketing plan."
"9346974","Development of an assay for quantitative detection of cccDNA This SBIR application is in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) PA-15- 077 ?New Technologies for Viral Hepatitis SBIR (R43/R44)?, more specifically to #7 ?Develop genetic tests that might help in patient management of viral hepatitis, including tests that assess the risk of complications as well as likelihood of success of specific therapies.? There is an urgent and unmet need for an effective method to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) cccDNA in serum. HBV infection affects nearly 350 million people worldwide, and chronic infection is a major risk factor for development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which has a poor survival rate. Current therapies are effective at suppressing viral replication, although they do not eliminate the virus due to the persistent viral replication intermediate known as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that serves as a template for generation of progeny virus. This plasmid-like episome that resides in the host nucleus is produced from relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA), a partially double-stranded DNA found in circulating virions and transmitted into the host hepatocytes. The need to remove cccDNA to cure HBV infection has prompted drug discovery groups to focus efforts on developing compounds that can target and eliminate cccDNA. However, the absence of a quantitative reliable cccDNA assay that is highly sensitive, obtainable from serum, and not contaminated by detection of the highly analogous rcDNA is needed to facilitate the drug development and to monitoring cccDNA level in the blood of HBV infected patient under anti-viral therapy with repeated liver biopsies The goal of this project is to develop an innovative sensitive cccDNA assay that overcomes these challenges and would be suitable for routine testing by physicians. We have designed such an assay and our preliminary studies have indicated specific detection of 103 copies of cccDNA and no detectable amplification of 104 copies of rcDNA. Two aims are proposed in this phase I application. Aim 1 is to develop this prototype assay to be quantitative and sensitivity of 0.1% of cccDNA to rcDNA. Aim 2 is to demonstrate the detection of cccDNA in serum of patients with HBV infection and correlate this detection with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). In phase 2 we will further develop and evaluate the assay for monitoring of therapeutic efficacy and extent of liver damage."
"9420279","Currently, surgeons mainly rely on palpation and visual inspection due to the difficulties of translating findings of nuclear medicine to the operating room due to the general lack of landmarks to orient the prior nuclear medicine results. Therefore, there is a critical need for new intraoperative imaging modalities that can provide accurate, real-time, intraoperative assessment of both molecular and anatomical information resulting in identification of viable tumor, fibrotic (scar) tissue, non-malignant tissue, and tumor margins at greater depths than are available with infrared-fluorescent guided surgery as well as better resolution than endoscopy. To overcome these limitations, our objective is to develop, characterize, and validate ultra-acidic pH-responsive optoacoustic dye (pHO dye) detectable by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and provide real-time color maps of tissue pH to allow for identification of regions of tumor and non-malignant tissue in mice. Three innovative aspects in this proposal are: 1) development, characterization, and evaluation of the first zwitterionic optoacoustic contrast agent, prototype pHO dye, that modulates spectra in response to ? 0.2 pHe of the tissue microenvironment; 2) use of unique instrumentation, multispectral optoacoustic tomography, which provides superior resolution, penetration depth, and the ability to visualize multiple spectra simultaneously; 3) development and validation of ratiometric algorithm for generation of real-time acidic pHe color maps based upon detection of pHO dye or V7-pHO probe via MSOT imaging. We hypothesize that optimized pHO dye and V7-pHO probe will facilitate detection of tumor and differentiate it from non-malignant and fibrous tissue with high sensitivity and specificity using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) which utilizes a ?light-excitation and sound-emission? approach resulting in superior signal to background ratio. We will test this hypothesis by the following aims: 1) characterize, optimize, and validate pHO dye and V7-pHO probe to target acidic pHe for detection of tumor cells in vitro and in tissue phantoms; 2) assess optimized pHO dye and V7-pHO probe to facilitate detection of orthotopic tumors from non- malignant tissue in vivo using multispectral optoacoustic tomography; 3) develop ratiometric algorithms based upon the spectral modulation of the optimized pHO dye and V7-pHO probe to produce real-time pHe measurement color maps of tumors. Successful completion of this proposal will result in unprecedented improvements in detection of abdominal tumors in vivo to potentially reduce the gap between the surgeon and nuclear imaging."
"9111768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has organized and hosted an annual Cohort Studies Working Group meeting, Life Course Events in Aging, every year since 2002, with partial support from NIA since 2010. The workshops have brought together roughly 30 to 60 scholars with a common interest in the role of cumulative exposures in aging-related outcomes; and in understanding how the economic, institutional, and demographic context has changed for different cohorts and for different racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups within cohorts. This application proposes to extend NIA support for this annual workshop for five additional years, from 2015 to 2019, with meetings alternating between the NBER's main offices in Cambridge, MA and the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. NIA funds enable us to include in the workshop a larger and more inclusive participant group than would be possible with NBER resources alone. This larger group includes scholars engaged in aging-related research from numerous research universities throughout the United States, including most of the NIA-supported demography centers. It also includes researchers from other countries; researchers in academic disciplines other than economics (sociology, demography, epidemiology, clinical medicine, psychology, and public health); newer investigators developing or expanding their research agenda in aging; researchers with expertise in birth cohort or other long-term longitudinal studies in the US and abroad; and researchers developing new methodological tools for the study of longitudinal data sets. The funding requested from NIA will continue to supplement other NBER resources to support basic travel and accommodation expenses for workshop participants. This support is provided on the same basis for all participants, including both paper presenters and other attendees, engaging some of the most prominent scholars in the field in the activities of the workshop, regardless of whether they are presenting papers formally. All organizational costs of the workshop, all meeting expenses, and all group meals are covered with other NBER funds. By bringing together researchers from different fields, the Cohort Studies meetings provide opportunities for interaction and collaborative research across disciplines, potentially influencin the way they work. Researchers learn not just about new datasets, methodologies, and questions in life course events, but also have the opportunity for in-depth interactions with scholars from outside their field."
"9264043","Project 2 Project Leader: Griffith, Leslie C. Project Summary / Abstract The public health and economic impact of circadian and sleep misalignment had grown enormously with the increasingly global and 24-hour nature of our society, and costs are in the billions. In spite of this, however, we know very little about the mechanisms by which sleep is regulated. This project will provide the first comprehensive look at the function of microRNAs (miRs) in sleep. The dominant model of how the amount of sleep is determined is that the major regulators of sleep are the circadian clock and homeostatic sleep drive. It has become clear in the last few years, however, that other physiological variables can also exert modulatory influences. We have recently completed a screen of a library of miR-sponges and identified specific miRs which appear to be essential for each of these levels of control and we propose to understand the roles of these miRs at the molecular and cellular levels. This project is also part of a more integrated assault on the conserved roles of miRs in plasticity. Sleep and synaptic plasticity have been posited to be intimately related for two reasons. The first is that sleep itself is a daily exercise in rewiring: sensory inputs and motor outputs are suppressed. The second is that one of the most compelling theories of why we sleep is that we need a daily ?resetting? of our circuitry to keep synaptic weights and circuit activity with a linear range to prevent saturation of our information storage capacity. Our work on sleep-regulating miRs will be analyzed in the context of experiments done by the Van Vactor lab on NMJ synaptic plasticity and by the Davis lab on associative learning to give us a glimpse into the more fundamental roles of miRs in regulation of synaptic function. Specific Aims: 1: Determine the complete set of microRNAs which control sleep. 2. Determine how miR190 regulates sleep plasticity. 3. Determine the role of miR92a/b in the regulation of sleep by the clock. 4. Determine the role of let-7 in the hormonal regulation of sleep."
"9248864","PROJECT 2 - ABSTRACT Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a collection of clinical syndromes characterized by gradual, selective decline in speech and language functions. It is caused by neurodegeneration in the brain regions that sustain language. PPA is a devastating disease affecting adults in the prime of their life, depriving them of the ability to communicate and function in society. In the last decade, the cognitive and neural bases of PPA have been studied thoroughly, and three clinic-anatomical variants of the disease have been described. Importantly, each variant is characterized by a different probability of underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Recent preliminary data suggest that different neurodevelopmental and biological factors are associated with each of the main PPA variants. In this project, we will further develop this line of research and investigate developmental, genetic and molecular factors that might determine susceptibility of the language network to each PPA subtype. We will recruit 125 new PPA patients and combine data with that of our large existing cohort to realize the following main goals: (1) Identify the presence of language-based learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, and determine their effect on cognitive and anatomical phenotypes. We hypothesize that language-based learning disabilities will be present most often in the logopenic variant PPA and will predict earlier age at onset and greater phonological impairment. (2) Measure hemispheric lateralization of language function an asses brain symmetry using magnetoencephalography and structural MRI. We predict that svPPA patients will show anomalous lateralization of language activation and decreased asymmetry of specific perisylvian language regions. (3) evaluate APOE allele status, inflammatory gene expression patterns and plasma cytokines levels. We expect to find a lower incidence of the APOE4 allele among logopenic patients with learning disabilities than those without, and to find biomarkers indicative of an altered immunological response in svPPA. This research will increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of PPA and the neurobiology of language. Moreover, the results might serve as the foundation to develop early intervention strategies and personalized risk assessment for the prediction of neurodegenerative disease."

The TCS SP8 X will replace an aging Olympus FV1000, which has been in place since early 2005. The high resolution, sensitivity and fast scan rates of the new instrument will increase both the quality and productivity of vision-related research at OHSU. Participating projects include studies on the causes and treatment of major diseases affecting vision, including glaucoma, uveitis, retinal degenerative diseases, and autoimmune retinopathies, as well as research on fundamental mechanisms underlying normal visual function. After careful market evaluation, the TCS SP8 X was selected as the most versatile, high-performing system capable of meeting the current and projected imaging needs of the participating users. The instrument will be maximally utilized by placement in the Bio-Imaging and Confocal Microscopy Core, where it will be supported by the expertise and organization of a well established, NEI P30-funded Center. Casey Eye Institute commits to ensuring long-term, efficient use of the instrument by covering costs of the service contract and personnel salary via the P30 grant and as needed. Instrument time not used by the NEI investigators on this application will be available to other scientists at Oregon Health & Science University, thereby extending the overall benefits. The introduction of this instrument will fulfill the growing needs of the vision research community at OHSU to incorporate state-of-the-art confocal microscopy into their research. This will speed the progress of discovery to improve the detection and treatment of human diseases affecting vision."
"9235305","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to determine the role of natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) in mitigating acute lung injury. Diseases such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by movement of fluid, protein and cells from the pulmonary circulation to the interstitial and alveola space. This transudation of vascular fluid impairs gas exchange and initiates a cascade of inflammatory events that leads to acute lung failure. Cell signaling pathways that regulate fluid and cellular transudation across the pulmonary vascular membrane play critical roles in determining the extent of lung damage that occurs and the time it takes for the lung to recover. The natriuretic peptides (NP) are a family of proteins that play critically important roles in maintaining appropriate amounts of fluid in the circulation. NPs are released from the heart in response to increased blood volume and act to increase the permeability of blood vessels, thereby facilitating transudation of fluid, solutes and proteins from the intravascular to the interstitial space of systemic vascular beds. In the pulmonary circulation, however, NPs appear to protect against increased acute lung injury and pulmonary edema formation. In fact, numerous studies have shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) blunts acute lung injury in animal models and clinical studies. This differential effect of NPs on vascular permeability in the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds may be explained by differences in effects of the NP-receptors. Previous studies by other investigators suggest that enhancement of vascular permeability is mediated by NPR-A. However, recent studies from our laboratory suggest that the protective effects of NPs on acute lung injury are mediated by NPR-C. This proposal will test the hypothesis that NPR-C protects against acute lung injury by determining if lung injury is worse in mice lacking NPR-C and if NPs fail to protect against lung injury in NPR-C deficient mice. The proposal will also determine if barrier function in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells can be altered by increasing or decreasing NPR-C expression. Other studies aim to elucidate downstream signaling pathways responsible for the protective effects of NPR-C by determining if the protective effect of NPR-C is mediated by activation of G-inhibitory protein (Gai) and downstream modulation of cAMP. Finally, animal studies will be performed to determine if increased expression of NPR-C in vivo can protect against acute lung injury. Pulmonary edema formation is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in severe cases of acute respiratory failure. Identification of receptors and their associated signal transduction pathways responsible for maintenance of intact pulmonary endothelial barrier function is vital to furthering our understanding of pulmonary permeability and developing new therapies for patients with acute lung injury."
"9242552","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States. Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the causative agent, is highly motile and can traverse complex environments inside mammalian and arthropod hosts during its infectious cycle. The central hypothesis of this application is that the motility and chemotaxis of Bb constitute a unique paradigm and play a pivotal role in the host-vector cycle as well as in the disease process, e.g., dissemination, tissue tropism, and immune evasion. During our last funding period, several unique aspects about Bb motility and chemotaxis were unveiled. In collaboration with several other groups, we have pushed Bb motility research to the forefront, and now Bb has emerged as a paradigm for in-depth understanding of spirochete motility and chemotaxis. In this renewal application, a comprehensive study will be carried out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that account for the unique aspects that we have observed as well as their links to Bb pathogenicity. Bb has 7-11 internally localized periplasmic flagella (PFs) nea the cell poles. They form a distinct ribbon wrapping around the cell cylinder, which have both skeletal and motility functions. This unique arrangement and function have not been reported in any other flagellated bacteria. Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanism that controls the number and placement of PFs and determine how this control mechanism affects the virulence of Bb. As an enzootic pathogen, Bb has two different chemosensory pathways. It has been hypothesized that these two pathways function in different hosts during the infectious cycle, e.g., one in mammals and the other in ticks. Aim 2 will decipher the unique aspect of chemotaxis and its role in the enzootic cycle of Bb. Bb is highly motile and outruns (>10-fold faster) host immune cells in mouse dermis. We hypothesize that this ability allows Bb to rapidly disseminate through dense skin tissue ahead of the cellular immune responses and then to disseminate to distal organs in mammals. Aim 3 will test our hypothesis by analyzing two motility and chemotaxis mutants in mice using recently developed live-imaging techniques. All of the studies proposed in this renewal are novel and have not been carried out in any spirochetes. Completion of these studies will lead to a new level of molecular analysis of Bb motility and chemotaxis as well as an understanding of their precise roles in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. In addition, the fundamental knowledge to be gained here is high-impact and could aid in the understanding of the unique motility in other pathogenic spirochetes."
"9289537","Project Abstract/Summary Dysregulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopaminergic signaling is associated with multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Current antipsychotics have high affinity for Gi/o-coupled D2 and D3 receptors (D2R, D3R). While there has been considerable focus on the role of prefrontal D2Rs in neuropsychiatric disease, there is emerging evidence that the D3R is also critically important. However, we know very little about the cellular distribution and function of D3Rs in prefrontal circuits, or how antipsychotics regulate their function. The goal of this proposal is to determine the neuronal distribution and function of D3R in prefrontal cortex, the cellular mechanisms by which D3R regulates neuronal excitability, and the mechanisms by which antipsychotics regulate their function. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, 2-photon imaging, and molecular biology in native and heterologous systems to examine D3R signaling mechanisms, with particular focus on the potential role of arrestin-mediated signaling. Results of this study will provide insight into how PFC networks function normally and abnormally in psychiatric disease.  "
"9257478","The long-term goal of the Mentored Career Development component (KL2) of our CTSC is to build the capacity of our faculty to perform clinical and translational research (CTR), thereby addressing the significant health problems of New Mexico, the region, and the nation. Our short-term objective is to enhance our KL2 program by strengthening recruitment, augmenting individualized training, and improving mentoring to ensure that scholars become independently funded by the end of their K-award period. A parallel KL2-like program, open to additional faculty, with the same requirements, resources and training environment, has also been developed with funds made available to our CTSC (not an institutional match). The success of our KL2 program demonstrates the important role of our CTSC in catalyzing CTR training, thereby strategically increasing CTR capacity. The rationale for our approach is that by building on our already successful KL2 program, we will continue to develop the next generation of accomplished clinical and translational researchers. We will accomplish this with the following specific aims: 1) Continue robust and sustained leadership, administration, and institutional environment and commitment to the KL2 program; 2) Perform national searches for KL2 scholars that include enhanced processes: a) to match recruits with optimal training environments within our Signature Programs and departments, and b) to identify a racially/ethnically diverse pool of candidates; 3) Develop, use, and monitor individual career development plans (IDP) that articulate annual milestones and pathways for career development for five to ten years; 4) Enhance KL2 scholar mentoring by requiring local-mentor training, adding mentors to the Multidisciplinary Advisory Committee, and expanding the mentor team to include career mentors, peer mentors and, where appropriate, external mentors who are nationally recognized experts in their fields, and; 5) Implement a comprehensive evaluation process, including formative and summative components, for assessment of KL2 scholars, mentors, and the program. The expected outcome of our program will be an enhanced capacity to conduct CTR on the most important problems facing New Mexico, our region and the nation. We will attain this through heightened attention to the factors that improve recruitment, training, mentoring and career development of a new cadre of young, independently funded, and team science-oriented scientists. Such outcomes are expected to have an important, long-term positive impact on our institution and the CTR workforce, resulting in a generation of scientists trained in CTR; thereby promoting the nation?s priority to significantly accelerate the translation of discovery into impact on health."

Many of these conditions are associated with environmental influences, including household crowding, lack of piped water, transitioning diet, decreased physical activity, and tobacco exposure. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), a not-for-profit health organization providing statewide services for Alaska Native people and owned and operated by the Alaska Native people, is collaborating on multiple projects focused on these child health issues. However, development of NIH supported pediatric clinical trials has been challenged by a relatively small population, of which approximately half is widely dispersed in remote areas throughout the state and limited pediatric research infrastructure. ANTHC proposes to become a pediatric clinical trials center within the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network to develop the capacity and capability to conduct pediatric clinical trials, particularly in rural and underserved areas of Alaska. ANTHC and its local regional Tribal partner, Southcentral Foundation (SCF), will implement and initiate clinical trials that address Alaska Native child health inequities with priorities on environmental influences on upper/lower airway disease; obesity; pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; and neurodevelopment. ANTHC and SCF clinical and research staff will receive mentoring and professional development through activities within the IDeA program to develop and maintain research capacity thereby improving the ability for these organizations to successfully compete for NIH research funding in the future. ANTHC and SCF researchers will collaborate with other funded investigators to provide greater diversity in pediatric clinical study participation, accelerate study completion, and allow partnering with experienced investigators. ANTHC's participation in this network addresses critical barriers to progress in competing for research funding to address Alaska Native child health inequities through clinical trials. The IDeA pediatric clinical trials network provides an opportunity for ANTHC to participate in evaluations of key interventions with a larger group in a shorter time period and build research capacity to be able to initiate clinical trials.

"9264031","DESCRIPTION:  Traumatic brain injury (TBI), commonly caused by motor vehicle injury and falls in the young and elderly, afflicts nearly 1.7 million people in the United States each year. n addition to being a leading cause of death in children and young adults, TBI is also a major cause of permanent disability in the United States. There are currently no curative treatments for TBI, and the main course of action is to minimize secondary damage that results from changes in blood pressure, brain swelling, or intracranial pressure that is triggered by the initia injury. The overall goal of this project is to first develop a well-tolerated means of transferring genes to neural progenitor cells in the brain and then to use this technology to direct cortical neurogenesis after injury. We propose to use focused ultrasound to enhance non-viral gene transfer to neural progenitor cells in the brain mediated by a targeted polymer delivery vector, thus enabling the delivery of genes encoding fibroblast growth factor-2 and neurogenin2, proteins shown to enhance neurogenesis and direct neuron differentiation, respectively. We will evaluate in an animal model of TBI whether induced migration and increased neuronal integration can lead to functional improvement through a combination of histology, cognitive evaluations, and motor assessments. ."
"9395124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abnormal (or mis-)folding alters protein's 3D conformation from native (soluble form) to non-native (insoluble from) polymorphic amyloid structures. Protein misfolding is linked to neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, familial dementia, prion encephalopathies), systemic (type II diabetes, light chain amyloidosis related cancer) and other (cystic fibrosis) diseases. Prevailing view suggests that protein misfolding-induced amyloids result into a gain-of-function and cause pathophysiologic cell response by destabilizing cell ionic homeostasis. Understanding protein misfolding and the resulting 3D conformations that induce pathophysiologic activity have been an important but challenging area of research. Mechanisms underlying amyloid fibril formation and its prevention are being studied extensively although amyloid fibers do not directly appear to cause neurodegenerative diseases; recent studies have shown that only globular amyloids are sufficient to cause pathophysiologic responses. The most direct mechanism of globular oligomer- mediated toxicity would involve their membrane poration as the key initial events. Our prevailing paradigm, therefore, is that protein misfolding diseases result from small globular amyloids forming ion channels to destabilize cell ionic homeostasis. Molecules and other interventions that modulate their channel structure and activity could thus be used for effective therapy. Indeed, amyloidogenic peptides induce ionic conductances in both native cell as well as artificial membranes. Structural study of membrane-bound amyloid complexes has been limited. Our studies have shown that amyloid peptides associated with several diseases form polymorphic ion channels. This continuing proposal primarily focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD) linked amyloid beta (Ab) peptide that forms toxic channels. We intend to define the 3D structural polymorphism and identify amino acid (AA) epitopes in Ab peptide that can then be used as targets for designing effective therapeutics for AD. We will continue our multidimensional and complementary approaches of AFM imaging, ion conductance recording, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and cell Calcium uptake and degeneration to obtain a comprehensive understanding of amyloid ion channels. Our Specific Aims are 1) Image 3D structure of synthetic as well as tissue-derived amyloidogenic peptides and peptides with site-specific amino acid (AA) substitutions reconstituted in lipid membrane; 2) Image open-closed conformations, in response to pharmacologic agents, of channels made of peptides, normal as well as with site-specific amino acid (AA) substitutions, 3) Correlate open-close channel conformations with ion conductance using integrated ion conductance AFM and pharmacologic agents and site-specific AA substitutions, and 4) Examine the cellular effects (e.g., calcium uptake and degeneration) of amyloid peptides. Our study will define specific amyloid structures underlying Alzheimer's and other degenerative pathophysiology and will identify specific structural motif(s) in amyloid ion channels that can then be used for designing pharmacological intervention of therapeutic value."
"9330298","The 2017 Gordon Research Conference on Epithelial Differentiation and Keratinization (GRC-EDK) is the premier international meeting in epithelial biology, evidenced by the regular attendance of international leaders in this field, the size of its applicant pool and the overwhelmingly positive attendee reviews. The GRC- EDK has been held biennially since 1979 to present and promotes the latest conceptual and technological advances in epithelial biology, from primarily biochemical analysis in 1979 to more recent approaches in stem cell biology, regenerative medicine, cancer, epigenetics, and global genomics. This success has been achieved by combining a strong focus on cutaneous and epithelial biology with openness to new concepts and technical approaches. To maintain the pre-eminent quality of this meeting in 2017, we have invited leading epithelial biology researchers, leaders from other fields, and early career scientists with innovative and exciting research programs. The program covers areas of longstanding interest, such as stem cells, mechanisms in epithelial cancers, regeneration, epithelial adhesion, and rare diseases, and explores new topics including exciting developments in gene therapy, genome organization, cell competition, epigenetics, stress responses, as well as cutting edge advances in intravital imaging. To fuel new concepts and promote discussion of novel ideas over 30% of speakers are from outside the immediate field. Moreover, over 35% of oral presentations will be selected from submitted abstracts to accommodate late breaking exciting stories and ensure speaking opportunities for young investigators. The program strongly emphasizes translational medicine with an entire session dedicated to therapeutics. To promote collaboration between academic medicine and industry we have invited speakers engaged in biotech and other academic scientists with strong industrial ties. The relatively isolated location and residential nature of the 2017 Conference, and the informal afternoon periods, maximize opportunities for scientific discussions and mentoring interactions. For 2017, we will continue our commitment to trainee mentorship through the 3rd Gordon Research Seminar on Epithelial Differentiation and Keratinization (GRS-EDK) to be held, immediately preceding the GRC-EDK. GRS meetings are organized by and feature trainee scientists providing a unique venue to discuss their science in a supportive informal setting, network with peers and develop life-long collaborations. The GRS-EDK will feature a career mentoring panel discussion with special emphases on careers in academia versus industry, and the importance of diversity within science. Collectively, these programs reflect our aims of presenting and discussing the latest research developments within epithelial biology; promoting translation of key research findings to clinical practice, and furthering the careers of early stage investigators and trainees to maintain the highest level of innovation of this field. Support is requested from the NIH for the registration costs, with a particular focus on trainee and early career investigators."
"9464661","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has special implications for behavioral health, through expanded coverage, legislative mandates specific to behavioral health, and behavioral health parity with medical and surgical benefits. These changes to behavioral health coverage have the potential to shift the treatment landscape for mental health and substance use disorders. Behavioral health benefits are critical to HIV+ individuals, because mental health and substance use disorders are highly prevalent. Untreated substance use and psychiatric disorders have both been associated with poor general and HIV-related health outcomes and with increased population-level transmission of HIV. In addition, mental health conditions are often co-morbid with substance use disorders. Consequently, developing an evidence base for behavioral health will have implications for policymakers seeking to ensure availability of appropriate care for two, often strongly comorbid, groups of treatable conditions. Few studies have examined the effects of the ACA on the health outcomes of people with HIV, and there are no studies on changes in their behavioral health and ACA implementation. The overarching objective of this study is to estimate and interpret the effects of the ACA on behavioral health service utilization and behavioral health outcomes in people with HIV. The quantitative component of this study will estimate the effects of ACA implementation on mental health and corresponding treatment, with a focus on depressive symptoms, in addition to substance use disorders, examining alcohol use, illicit drug use, and associated treatment. Finally, the aims of this study include a qualitative component, which is also the focus of the proposed training plan. The qualitative aim will assess awareness and perception of the ACA's effects on behavioral health coverage and care by conducting in-depth interviews with people with HIV and behavioral health needs. This mixed-methods approach leverages the quantitative data from two longitudinal studies of HIV infection with in-depth interviews with a subset of HIV+ study participants to estimate and interpret behavioral health trends. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the ACA on the behavioral health of people with HIV and will contribute to a nuanced evidence base of the shifting behavioral health services landscape, the behavioral health needs of people with HIV, and remaining barriers to behavioral health care. These aims align with AHRQ funding priorities in that they will examine changing access to behavioral health care and associated health outcomes in a priority population of people with HIV who have behavioral health needs. In addition to the research aims, this project will provide me with the training and mentorship to apply mixed methods approaches to new questions on policy and health insurance in people with HIV. I am confident that the research project, training, and mentorship that I will receive under this fellowship will position me to submit a K series award, to continue studying the effects of health policies on vulnerable populations."
"9294501","PROJECT ABSTRACT Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent form of liver disease present in approximately 80% of obese individuals. The factors leading to the development of liver fat and progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including inflammation and fibrosis, are poorly understood, and there is a clear unmet research need in this area given the lack of effective therapies. The proposed research is significant because it has the potential to elucidate poorly defined pathophysiologic mechanisms of this highly prevalent public health disease, and identify new therapeutic targets The scientific goal of this project is to elucidate the role of the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis in the pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH. The central hypothesis is that relative GH and IGF-1 deficiency in obesity are associated with development and progression of NAFLD and NASH, and that GH administration will reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Aim 1 will determine the relationship between the GH/IGF-1 axis and intrahepatic lipid content, inflammation and fibrosis. Aim 2 investigates the effect of low-dose GH vs. placebo on these endpoints in biopsy-proven NASH. The rationale for this proposal is that relative GH/IGF-1 deficiency in obesity may play a role in the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH given its lipolytic, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties and based on our preliminary data. The candidate is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Assistant in Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) who is highly qualified for and deeply committed to developing a career as an independent investigator. Her short-term goal is to develop the skills and obtain the preliminary data necessary to make the transition to her first R-level independent NIH grant-supported research. Her long- term goal is to become an independent, patient-oriented researcher in endocrine mechanisms that may contribute to the etiopathology of NAFLD and progression to NASH. She is supported by an expert and highly- invested mentorship team composed of successful, NIH-supported clinical investigators in Neuroendocrinology, Hepatology and Radiology and has an impressive track record of success, including awards, pilot grants and publications. She and her mentors have designed a targeted training plan consisting of co-mentorship and a didactic program. The institutional environment is outstanding at MGH and Harvard Medical School, with multiple resources available from the MGH Department of Medicine, the MGH Division of Clinical Research, and the Harvard Medical School Clinical Translational Science Center grant, all of which offer a myriad of didactic opportunities, facilities and support to the candidate. The Neuroendocrine Unit and Department of Medicine have made a strong commitment to the candidate, including 90% protected time, space, study coordinator support and a faculty appointment, with the goal of fostering the candidate's career as an independent investigator."
"9280310","ABSTRACT: Two key principles define the core conceptual framework of our Conte Center. First, most sensory input is actively acquired by a motor and/or attentional sampling routine; e.g., rather than staring blankly and hoping that something will ?fall? into our gaze, we Actively Scan the visible environment with eye movements. Even when fixating, we can actively (albeit covertly) scan the environment by shifting attention. Corresponding ?scanning? of the auditory environment uses the more covert attentional sampling strategy, but is no less active. As a result, Active Sensing (i.e., strategic, goal-driven sampling of inputs) is ?predictive? in that, it is guided by the subject's expectations (theories, models), accumulated through species' evolution, and refined by individuals' experience. Its central tenet is that sensing and perceiving can be fully understood only in the context of subjects' ongoing, goal-directed information-gathering activities. Second, neuronal oscillatory dynamics are critical mechanistic components of normal brain operation. Neuronal oscillations reflect rhythmic fluctuations of neuron ensembles between high and low excitability states. Mounting evidence indicates that such rhythmic activity is essential to normal brain operations, and that its disruption contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders. The idea that Active Sensing incorporates neuronal rhythms as fundamental instruments of operation represents an ongoing paradigm shift in systems neuroscience. Our Center is unified by support Cores and a set of mechanistic (linking) hypotheses concerning the ?instrumental? functions of neuronal rhythms at local and network scales. The Center integrates electrocorticographic (ECoG) studies in humans with intracortical recordings in monkeys and computational modeling. Our Specific Aims are: AIM 1 ? Exploit ECoG's strengths of distributed sampling and direct human brain recording to define dynamical circuits of top-down control and coordination across cortical areas in Active Sensing. To gain a sample size appropriate for our purposes, we will pool subjects across 5 surgical epilepsy centers using a common set of Active Sensing tasks, and a common data format. AIM 2 ? Use recordings in nonhuman primates to elucidate and extend ECoG findings in humans. Laminar field potential (FP), current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles, along with single unit recordings will be obtained from monkeys performing tasks identical to those studied in humans. AIM 3 ? Develop iterative interactions between computational and empirical studies of circuit dynamics at local (cell assembly) and global (brain network) levels. Tracking specific neuronal dynamics from the global-network level in humans down to the cellular and cell ensemble levels in monkeys will yield novel and unique insights into mechanisms of active brain operation. Statistical and Computational modeling will allow rapid exploration of possibilities suggested by ECoG and related multielectrode studies in monkeys, and will help in building accurately representing and integrating our findings across local and global scales."

"9256388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to improve the quality of care in nursing homes (NHs) are long-standing, but concerns regarding poor quality of care persist. Fundamental change is likely needed to improve NH quality given the challenging and complex environments in which NHs operate. Through NH culture change and its advocated practices, deep systematic change aims to advance resident-centered/directed care and improve NH quality of care and life. The long-term goal of this research is to improve NH care and the quality of life within NHs by providing evidence on how culture change implementation impacts quality. The central hypothesis motivating this proposal is that greater implementation of NH culture change practice results in higher NH quality. The proposed study will be the first to use a diverse national sample of U.S. NHs and data from a longitudinal panel study including data from 2009/10 and 2015/16 survey responses to understand whether increases in culture change practice implementation and increases in critical domains of practices are associated with improved quality. The study will pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1) Describe the extent of culture change practice implementation in U.S. NHs in 2015/16 and the changes in implementation between 2009/10 (Time 1) and 2015/16 (Time 2); 2) Evaluate whether increase in implementation of culture change practice (overall and by critical domains) be- tween Times 1 and 2 is associated with improvements in: a) quality outcomes including lower rates of function- al decline, bedbound [i.e. bedfast] status, weight loss, behavioral problems, incident pressure ulcers, and hospital deaths; b) care processes including lower use of hospitals and of restraints, antipsychotic drugs and feeding tubes; and higher rates of bladder and bowel training; and, c) NH performance including reduced staff turn- over and health-related and quality of life survey deficiencies; and 3) Evaluate whether higher versus lower presence of NH Leadership and Family and Community Practices is associated with a) quality outcomes, b) care processes and c) NH performance (see Aim 2). This study is innovative since it will be the first national longitudinal panel study to examine how implementation of NH culture change practices has changed over time and whether increases in culture change practice implementation are associated with improvements in NH quality. This study is significant because its design and its planned propensity-matched difference- in- differences analyses will provide needed evidence for provider and policy maker decision making, and integral for improving the quality of care and life for vulnerable older adults in U.S. NHs. This knowledge is critical as many states are now implementing or changing their Medicaid NH pay-for-performance programs to acknowledge adoption of culture change practices with inadequate evidence to support these decisions; similarly, providers are implementing practices with inadequate evidence of their effect."
"9244855","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex, the highest-level processor of our sensations, perceptions, and decisions, are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle to treating such pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic.  Each primary sensory area of cortex receives connections from a primary and secondary thalamic nucleus. Strokes destroying primary thalamic nuclei cause near complete loss of sensation, but damage to secondary thalamus produces complex behavioral deficits. Secondary thalamus is also connected with diverse cortical areas, suggesting a possible role in psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the functions of secondary thalamus remain unknown. Are secondary nuclei alternate sensory pathways to cortex? Or key sources of behavioral signals?  This project will focus on the secondary somatosensory thalamus (the posterior medial nucleus, POm). POm has sometimes been regarded as an afferent sensory pathway, operating in parallel with the primary thalamic relay, but several studies support the view that POm is instead downstream of primary somatosensory cortex. POm has been suspected of mediating communication between cortical areas and, more recently, to aggregate motor signals to provide as feedback to cortical areas. Like secondary visual thalamus, POm may also have a role in selectively enhancing particular stimuli.  The first goal of this project is to investigate coding of sensory, motor and behavioral signals in POm. The second goal is to understand their functional impact on primary somatosensory cortex, particularly on apical dendrites in cortical layer 1-a major target of POm. The third goal is to determine whether or not simple sensory behaviors require POm. To achieve these goals, we will combine mouse behavior with electrophysiology, two-photon microscopy, and optogenetics. We aim to identify the role of this long obscure circuit component in somatosensation. Identifying fundamental functions of this secondary thalamic nucleus will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species."
"9411580","Maximal resolution and full-length phasing for next-generation MHC-typing Arima Genomics 7. Project Summary/Abstract The Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus is among the most polymorphic loci in the genome, and harbors genes that play critical roles in human immune health and disease. The polymorphic nature of the MHC locus allows for encoding every individual with a unique immune cell profile, hence, matching HLA genes among donors and recipients has been a critical step in mitigating immune rejections following organ transplants. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have increased the popularity of DNA sequencing as a means of typing the HLA locus for its clinical relevance. Yet current HLA typing technologies ignore potentially important DNA variants, type gene-by-gene at low resolution, and fail to haplotype phase non-HLA genes and other non-coding alleles in the MHC locus that are necessary for optimal donor-recipient matching. Arima Genomics has recently developed an innovative new approach to generate full-length haplotypes of the MHC locus at high-resolution, building on our proprietary HaploSeq technology for constructing chromosome-spanning haplotypes in the human genome. Our new technology,  HaploSeq-Mx is capable of phasing the entire 3.5Mb HLA locus onto a single haplotype block at ~91% resolution and ~99% accuracy with just 2x sequencing depth. As a cost-effective, next-generation haplotyping technology, HaploSeq-Mx is poised to underpin a new standard in high-resolution locus-spanning MHC typing. The objectives of Arima Genomics' proposed R&D efforts involve improving HaploSeq-Mx's targeting efficiency to further reduce sequencing costs and advance the method to clinical utility, developing computational approaches to improve the accuracy of HaploSeq-Mx even further to >99.5%, and demonstrating feasibility of HaploSeq-Mx for MHC typing patient samples in a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) study with clinical collaborators at the Immunogenetics and Transplantation Laboratory (ITL) at the UCSD Center for Advanced Laboratory Medicine (CALM), while developing a new algorithm for donor-recipient matching. Successful completion of our research aims will contribute invaluable new knowledge to ongoing investigations of how human genetic variation influences patient outcomes in transplants, and will substantially advance the capabilities of our HLA typing technology toward commercial viability in clinical applications. HaploSeq-Mx promises to greatly enhance our understanding of human genetics in health and contribute to the realization of personalized medicine."
"9325899","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5 year plan for mentored clinical and laboratory training designed to prepare the candidate to an independent academic career as a physician-scientist. The applicant is an MD, PhD, who recently completed the 4 year residency program in Medical Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine. The career development plan includes mentored research training which will include: i) regular meetings with the mentor, ii) biannual meetings with a Scientific Advisory Committee iii) didactic courses, iv) seminars, v) lab meetings, vi) national meetings, and vii) international meetings. The training will take place at Baylor College of Medicine providing an excellent training environment with access to the latest tools of genome study. The project main aim is to elucidate the biology of the human peripheral nerve in health and disease through the identification of novel genes implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. CMT is a progressive neurological disease caused by deterioration of the peripheral nerves with secondary muscle wasting and weakness. The disease is extremely heterogeneous both clinically and molecularly. We will study a cohort of well described patients with hereditary peripheral neuropathy and no obvious disease-causing sequence variants in any of the 32 known CMT genes. The genomic profile, including copy number variations and single nucleotide variations will be determined for index patients with the application of state of the art molecular techniques (next generation sequencing and genomic microarrays). Genomic data, after bioinformatics processing and filtering, will be mined to identify candidate genes. The methods of conventional genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics will be implemented to further validate the disease-causing potential of novel candidates"
"9327281","Project Summary Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) is a developing crisis, with prescription opioid related deaths exceeding those related to cocaine and heroin combined and estimated societal costs of over $55 billion in 2014. While agonist therapies, such as buprenorphine and methadone, have been indispensable in providing a path to recovery for these individuals, they primarily focus on reducing withdrawal symptoms. While it is true that withdrawal precipitates relapse, it is important to note that pain management is endorsed by a majority of non-medical prescription opioid users as a primary factor contributing to their continued use. Individuals with prescription opioid addiction often struggle with compliance, costs or dislike the necessity of continued medication. It is critical that the field explores non-pharmacological methods that are able to treat common causes of continued non-medical opioid use, specifically pain and craving. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that can be targeted to specific cortical locations. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a key executive control area and rTMS at this site is currently an FDA-approved treatment for depression. Furthermore, left DLPFC rTMS is currently under investigation as a treatment for pain and other substance use disorders. The primary goal of this F31 research proposal is to determine whether rTMS administered to treatment seeking NMPOU patients can affect the neural response to acute pain after a single session (Aim 1), if multiple sessions amplify these results (Aim 2) and if these effects are clinically meaningful on both on pain and craving (Exploratory Aim). This will be buttressed by a research training plan targeted at didactic and hands-on training in neuroimaging and brain stimulation (mentor: Hanlon), opioid dependence (mentor: Back) and pain processing (mentor: Borckardt). The feasibility of this project is enhanced through a partnership with MUSC?s Center for Drug and Alcohol Programs (CDAP) and its status as a sub-study as part of a larger protocol within in Dr. Hanlon?s laboratory. For this proposal, forty treatment seeking, prescription opioid dependent individuals will be recruited from CDAP and randomized to receive 10 days of real or sham rTMS in a double blind fashion. Immediately before and after the first (Aim 1) and last rTMS session (Aim 2) our participants will undergo thermal stimulation within the MRI environment to determine the neural response to painful stimuli. At multiple timepoints, thermal thresholds and craving will be evaluated. This proposal consists of three, interconnected training goals. First, the candidate will undergo training on the delivery of sham-controlled, double blind, left DLPFC rTMS, a tool that is gaining importance in substance abuse treatment. Secondly, the candidate will gain valuable experience in the recruitment and assessment of a population of non-medical prescription opioid users. Thirdly, in order to determine the neurobiological correlates of painful stimuli in this population, the candidate will be mentored on the delivery, collection and analysis of concurrent thermal stimulation and functional neuroimaging."
"9230859","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of underrepresented minorities (URM) receiving graduate training in the biological and physical sciences continues to be small despite increases in the total population. Major obstacles for URMs applying to and being admitted to graduate programs in the biomedical sciences include limited research experience, limited advanced courses in the biological sciences, unfamiliarity with the application process, unawareness of career opportunities for PhD's, and lower scores on standardized tests (e.g., GRE's). Recognizing these issues and the need to increase the diversity of its own doctoral programs and faculty as well as the field as a whole, Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences initiated a formal post-baccalaureate pilot program in the life sciences called the Research Scholar Initiative. This proposal seeks to expand this program by establishing a Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP Scholars Program). The program will provide a 1-2 year research and educational training opportunity for individuals interested in pursuing PhD's/ScD's in either the traditional lab-based biomedical sciences (referred to as Life Sciences) or non-lab based biomedical sciences (referred to as Population Health Sciences). The goals are to 1) provide a personalized research education and training opportunity for 10 scholars/yr; 2) have at least 90% complete at least one year of research training; and 3) have a minimum of 75% apply to and be admitted to top doctoral (PhD or ScD) or in some cases, MD/PhD programs in the biomedical sciences. In addition, by providing early exposure of the trainees in the Life Sciences and Population Health Sciences to the disciplines of the other, we hope to enable them to better understand research in each other's areas and plant the seeds of interdisciplinary collaborations in their future research programs. Goals will be achieved by 1) PREP Scholars doing independent research with faculty in the Life and Population Health Sciences for one year and possibly two years; 2) developing a personalized program to enhance academic preparation (e.g., quantitative methods, cell biology, computing, etc.); 3) Establishing an advisory committee for each scholar to expand their mentoring network; 4) Having Scholars participate in program-specific courses and workshops designed to build skills critical for graduate school success; 5) Engaging them in research discussions that will expose PREP Scholars to Population Health and Life Sciences research; 6) Familiarize scholars with graduate training environment by providing opportunities to interact with current students and faculty in our program and other programs in the area."
"9280314","How do we extract salient information from an ever-changing and noisy environment? Project 3 addresses this fundamental question in perception using direct brain recordings in humans (electrocorticography; ECoG) to assess two models of sensory acquisition. The Active Sensing model posits that high-level inputs act to rhythmically sample the sensory word and filter out noise. The related predictive coding model theory posits that prior knowledge enhances perception with the brain making predictions about upcoming stimuli to sharpen low-level sensory processing. We propose that both processes share similar neural substrates - neuronal rhythm-based engagement of frontal, premotor, motor and sensory cortical networks to enable active and predictive sampling of the world to enhance perception. We employ ECoG to measure neural oscillations and high frequency activity (HG; 70-200 Hz; surrogate for intracortical SUA activity) and employ network analysis approaches to define the role of top-down control of active sensing and predictive coding in the human brain. Two or our proposed human ECoG studies are performed in monkeys in Project 4 permitting a rich inter-species comparison of the neural substrates of sensory acquisition. AIM 1 tests the hypotheses that motor/premotor systems control auditory sampling rhythms and actively suppress distracting information. This aim also explores whether lateral prefrontal regions provide additional control to the motor/premotor-auditory active-sensing network. AIM 2 addresses how prior knowledge enhances speech perception and `fills-in' degraded speech representations in auditory cortices. Given the use of speech stimuli this study will only be performed in humans. This Aim directly tests the predictive coding model and examines if similar neural substrates support both predictive coding and active sensing. AIM 3 compares our ECoG data to the laminar LFP/CSD and MUA profiles and network parameters obtained in parallel monkey auditory Project 4. These unique cross-species data will be used to identify the cell populations and physiological processes that generate ECoG components in monkeys and humans providing unprecedented insights into cortical physiology in humans. We predict that active sensing mechanisms are modality independent and will also compare our finding from the auditory monkey-man to the visual human and monkey active sensing studies in Projects 1 and 2. Core C provides critical DTI and resting state fMRI to correlate with our ECoG network and HG data and Core B provides for data standardization and sharing. Finally, Project 5 provides the computational and modeling infrastructure necessary to build and refine cell and systems level models of the world is sampled. Active sensing and predictive coding are likely impaired in a host of disabling psychiatric, neurological and developmental disorders making the understanding of these processes central to the mission of the NIMH."
"9260064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 25-30% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with high mortality. In HER2+ patients, anthracycline (i.e. doxorubicin) chemotherapy is usually followed by treatment with trastuzumab, which has led to a dramatic improvement in survival. However, cardiovascular toxicity remains the most devastating complications of cancer treatments. In a recent large study, the adjusted 3-year incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) or cardiomyopathy was 42% for HER2+ patients. To monitor for potential cardiotoxicity, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is monitored and if a decline in LVEF develops, therapy is withheld. However, an LVEF decline occurs very late, and significant myocardial injury may have already occurred by the time an LVEF decline is detected. Therefore, an early detection of cardiotoxicity will have significant clinical impact by enabling initiation of cardioprotective theapy to prevent development of CHF and allowing uninterrupted completion of cancer therapy; however currently there is no non-invasive method to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity. Recent advances in cardiac MR (CMR) allow non-invasive assessment of the degree of extracellular volume expansion, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and edema which are directly related to myocardial injury associated with chemotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesize that CMR can provide noninvasive, quantitative evidence of early cardiotoxicity associated with adjuvant therapy for HER2+ patients to devise personalized treatment planning for management of toxicity without interrupting the chemotherapy."
"9265708","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The natural production of roseophilin is an excellent example of the unprecedented transformations that can occur in nature. Understanding the mechanism of production will provide major insights into reproducing such powerful reactivity in a biomimetic fashion. While the similarity of roseophilin to the prodigiosin alkaloids offers some understanding of its biosynthesis, the current state of information does not allow a concrete route to be formulated. Roseophilin was isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces griseovirdis, which has also produced the related prodigiosin R1 and deschlororoseophilin. The gene cluster believed to direct their biosynthesis contains four homologues of the enzyme RedG, which directs the cyclization of the related compound, streptorubin B. Therefore, it is hypothesized that  these four enzymes assist in the unusual cyclization events observed to produce roseophilin. To examine the activity of the enzymes, the proposed intermediates, dimethylundecylprodigiosin and prodigiosin R2, will be synthesized. The synthetic intermediates will be used in feeding experiments to determine how the enzymes react with the molecules and the products that are produced. The cyclization events will also be mimicked in the laboratory by synthetically generating the key radical species believed to exist en route to the complex natural structure. Direct reaction of prodigiosin R2 under oxidative conditions will be used to screen the reactivity of this radical, while a Barton ester analogue will also be produced to directly generate the desired radical intermediate in a controlled fashion. The synthesis of these structures will provide access to vital information needed to deduce the extraordinary biosynthesis of roseophilin. This knowledge will help foster future endeavors in biomimetic carbocyclizations, which will prove useful in targeting more complex compounds in a facile manner."

These include: 1) Program in neurodegenerative disorders; 2) Program on studies related to nicotine dependence; 3) Program in the early detection of lung cancer, and 4) Neurobiology of learning and memory. During the previous funding period we have successfully taken a new imaging agent, 18F-Nifene to human studies. 18F-Nifene, which has high affinity for ?4ß2 receptors, had no adverse effects in the healthy subjects, showed rapid brain uptake with ratios of thalamus to corpus callosum reaching 3 in 45 mins. A scan time of 45 mins is considered optimal. Both thalamic and extrathalamic receptors were clearly visualized in the human brain. The high ratios in specific brain regions and short scan time suggest 18F-Nifene to be amongst the most suitable agonist as a PET imaging agent for ?4ß2 receptors in humans. Therefore, our goals in this renewal NIH application are to complete the brain human studies with 18F-Nifene. Brain distribution of 18F-Nifene will be evaluated in normal volunteers in a test-retest paradigm to establish reproducibility and imaging methodology for quantitative analysis. Human radiation dosimetry studies will be carried out using a PET/CT scanner on 6 subjects. A second goal of the study is to evaluate effects of nicotine in healthy subjects in order to assess the degree of 18F-Nifene displacement in various brain regions, including corpus callosum. Sensitivity of 18F-Nifene to cigarette smoking will also be assessed, in order to evaluate its usefulness in tobacco dependence studies. A third goal of the proposal is to complete the preclinical development of a novel PET/SPECT agent Niofene which is a putative antagonist for this receptor and can be radiolabeled with fluorine-18 for PET or iodine-123 for SPECT studies. The availability of an agonist and antagonist will allow comparative studies of this receptor system in various disorders. The fourth goal of this application is to evaluate if 18F-Nifene is able to detect changes in the receptors in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients using autoradiographic methods. This will help in translation of the use of 18F- Nifene in PET studies of neurodegeneration as well as other CNS disorders."

"9299047","ABSTRACT Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease of unknown origin characterized by progressive fibrosis affecting skin and internal organs leading to severe disability, multiple organ failure, and a high mortality rate. Pulmonary involvement is the leading cause of functional disability and high mortality in SSc. A major unmet need for SSc clinical management is the absence of well validated biomarkers that allow early diagnosis and accurate assessment of SSc severity and extent of involvement, or that differentiate patients with Primary Raynaud Phenomenon from patients with Raynaud Phenomenon at risk of evolving into SSc. We recently obtained strong Preliminary Results indicating that microRNA (miRNA) analysis of exosomes isolated from the serum of SSc patients may provide unique and sensitive biomarkers that reflect the extent and severity of SSc. Based on these results we propose the following hypothesis: ?The unbiased analysis of the miRNA profile of exosomes isolated from SSc patient serum will allow to separate with a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity various relevant clinical subsets of SSc, will display a significant correlation with SSc severity and extent of pulmonary fibrotic involvement, and will distinguish patients with Primary Raynaud Phenomenon from patients with Raynaud Phenomenon harboring serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA) who are at high risk of evolving into SSc. A further hypothesis posits that: ?The differentially expressed miRNA identified in SSc serum exosomes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SSc tissue fibrosis inducing profibrotic molecular events on normal fibroblasts or inhibiting the profibrotic phenotype of SSc fibroblasts.? To test these hypotheses we will pursue the following Specific Aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: To identify employing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) differences in the miRNA profile of exosomes isolated from the serum of the following individuals: A: Patients with recent onset diffuse SSc vs. normal individuals; B: Patients with SSc-associated pulmonary fibrosis vs. diffuse SSc patients without lung involvement; and C: Patients with Primary Raynaud Phenomenon vs. patients with ANA-positive Raynaud Phenomenon. SPECIFIC AIM 2: To examine whether the most differentially expressed (upregulated or downregulated) miRNA identified in Aim 1 exert either profibrotic effects on normal dermal and lung fibroblasts or inhibit the fibrotic phenotype or SSc dermal and lung fibroblasts in vitro. The unbiased NGS miRNA analysis of serum exosomes proposed here is entirely novel and has not been applied to SSc previously. The differences in miRNAs present in serum exosomes identified here may lead to the future development of non-invasive SSc biomarkers that will result in a ?transformational change? in the standard of care for SSc patients and for patients with Raynaud Phenomenon at high risk of evolving into SSc. We further expect that the mechanistic studies performed with the most differentially expressed serum exosome miRNAs will identify novel molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in SSc tissue fibrosis."
"9262788","Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria PROGRAM SUMMARY Chronic hunger, food insecurity and famine continue to affect millions of residents of sub- Saharan Africa. Most people in African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture, making these populations vulnerable to drought and famine. Construction of dams and initiating rural irrigation schemes has been widely recognized as key solutions to food security and economic growth in drought prone regions. In the past decade, sub-Saharan African countries have experienced a new era of large dam constructions and expansion of irrigated agricultural farms. These environmental changes may have unforeseen ecologic consequences that adversely affect human health. However, to date there has been limited basic or translational research to evaluate the impact of water resource development and shifting agricultural practices on malaria ecosystems and attendant changes in the epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of malaria. To address the major knowledge gaps and challenges in malaria control and elimination in the face of drastic environmental modifications in sub-Saharan Africa, our ICEMR established a consortium with outstanding institutions and investigators from the US, Australia, Kenya and Ethiopia to study scientific questions important to the global malaria control and elimination effort, especially to the countries in the Greater Horn of Africa. The overarching goal of this ICEMR project is to assess the impact of human-induced environmental modifications such as dam construction, irrigation and shifting agricultural practices on the epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis and immunology of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria in highly populated Kenya and Ethiopia where major investments in water resource development projects are taking place. The ICEMR has three projects, each with multiple specific objectives. Project 1 will assess the impact of environmental modifications from water resource development projects on P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria epidemiology at the molecular, individual, field and population levels. Project 2 will examine the impact of environmental modifications on vector ecology and transmission, the outcomes of which will inform new integrated vector control approaches. Project 3 aims to determine the impact of environmental modifications on malaria pathogenesis and immunity by elucidating the immune mechanisms underlying susceptibility to symptomatic malaria and evaluating humoral immunity to gametocytes. The administrative and data management cores will provide support to the entire program. Knowledge gained from this ICEMR is important to malaria control, not only for the two study countries studied, but also to other regions of Africa prone to drought, famine, and large scale human population movement."
"9316979","Abstract While most autosomal genes are expressed biallelically, genomic imprinting causes some to be expressed only from either the paternal or maternal chromosome. The human Chr15q11-q13 region is imprinted, leading to expression of the SNURF-SNRPN gene and downstream noncoding region from the paternal chromosome. This region is implicated in an important human disease, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), which is associated with hypotonia, hypogonadism, hyperphagia and mild mental retardation. The long neuron-specific paternal transcript contains at least 148 exons and spans 470 kb. All paternal transcripts downstream of the SNRPN gene are noncoding and have been considered primarily as precursors for small RNAs. Since the smallest paternal deletions that cause PWS primarily remove the SNORD116 cluster of 29 similar snoRNAs, the most current published model is that SNORD116 deficiency is the primary cause of disease. How the snoRNAs in this region function in cells is completely unknown. These snoRNAs are of the ?box C/D? type, and such molecules are known to use complementary base pairing to promote specific 2'-O methylation of cellular RNAs, usually rRNAs or noncoding small RNAs. The SNORD116 RNAs are ?orphans?, as no targets have been identified so far, and bioinformatic approaches to identify or predict possible targets have failed. We propose to develop a novel technology to map 2'-OMe sites genomewide, and will apply it first in WT and PWS cells to find potential targets of SNORD116s. In the long term this method will allow studies on possible regulation and dynamic changes in rRNA modifications, and can be applied to the study of a number of other orphan snoRNAs."
"9262057","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the high relapse rates following treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs), preventative approaches targeting vulnerabilities implicated in SUD development are a promising avenue for reducing their public health burden. Well-supported models of the development of SUDs implicate negative reinforcement motives and dysfunctional appraisals of internal states as mechanisms in the transition from initiation to dependence. Emerging evidence indicates that distress intolerance (DI), which refers to the tendency to negatively appraise and escape aversive emotional states, is a risk factor uniquely associated with SUDs, coping-motivated substance use, and development of substance use problems. Although affect tolerance treatments have demonstrated efficacy in reducing relapse, these investigations did not target DI generally, instead focusing upon narrower domains of distress (e.g., anxiety), nor did they assess DI explicitly as a mechanism of change. Further, existing DI treatment research has focused on preventing relapse; the effect of reducing DI on preventing development of SUDs has not been studied. The extant DI literature is also limited by exclusive reliance upon self-report and behavioral measures of the construct. It is important to identify neurophysiological markers of DI to further clarify the construct and inform future ris identification and prevention efforts. The proposed study was designed to provide incremental training to the PI in psychophysiological assessment [specifically electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP)], technology-based interventions, and conducting clinical trials. In the proposed study, approximately 60 individuals with elevated DI and current cannabis use will be randomized to receive either a recently piloted two-session active DI intervention or a healthy behaviors control intervention. The first specific aim of the project is to determine if DI can be reduced relative to a placebo control via this brief DI intervention. The second specific aim is to  determine if individuals in the DI intervention condition report less stress-induced cannabis craving at post-treatment relative to individuals in the healthy behaviors condition. The next specific aim is to determine if individuals in the DI intervention condition will have fewer Cannabis Use Disorder symptoms/diagnoses at four month follow-up, and report lower coping-motivated cannabis use and use- related problems at one and four month follow-ups, relative to individuals in the healthy behaviors condition. Relatedly, the next aim is to determine if reductions in DI mediate the DI intervention's effect on these cannabis use outcomes. The final aim is to examine if high and low DI individuals matched for cannabis use show differential event-related potentials (ERPs) to cues signaling negative reinforcement, and to determine if the DI intervention leads to changes in these ERPs. By examining a brief treatment for DI in a substance using sample, this study will provide critical knowledge regarding how to quickly and effectively reduce DI and potentially prevent SUDs."
"9349855","The human gut microbiota undergoes compositional changes during pregnancy, and these bacterial changes have been shown to influence maternal metabolic responses; however, how this occurs is unclear. Part of these maternal metabolic changes include enhanced glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and an expansion of pancreatic ? cell mass (BCM). Providing a potential understanding of how the gut microbiota mediates this maternal response, we have new data suggesting a relationship may exist during pregnancy through the ? cell-expressed free fatty acid receptor-2 (Ffar2), where this receptor is activated by nutrients derived from the gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Exploring this potential relationship, we have observed the following; 1) Ffar2 expression is altered in mouse islets by gestational insulin resistance, which suggests FFA2 may help in ? cell adaption during pregnancy, 2) mice with a null mutation of FFA2 (Ffar2-/-) exhibit impaired glucose tolerance, lower insulin levels and diminished BCM expansion during pregnancy, 3) SCFAs, the primary ligands for FFAR2, are altered during pregnancy within the gut and blood of mice, and finally 4) the bacterial species in the mouse gut microbiota are influenced during pregnancy, as observed for humans. Because of these compelling data, our goal in this proposal is to dissect and test how the gut microbiota, SCFAs, and Ffar2 on ?-cells are contributing to gestational glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. First, through a novel mouse model created by our group, a ? cell specific knockout of Ffar2, we will explore how ? cell expressed Ffar2 mediates GSIS and BCM changes during pregnancy. Next, we will identify the key fermentative gut bacterial taxa and the metagenomic profiles of these taxa that contribute to SCFA level changes during pregnancy. And finally, we will test the collective relationship between gut microbiota, SCFAs, and ? cell expressed Ffar2 by modulating the gut microbiota through germ-free conditions, testing the influence of the gut microbiota on glucose homeostasis in our ? cell specific knockout of Ffar2. If this novel relationship exists during pregnancy, we will reveal a new paradigm in gestational glucose metabolism, and provide new insight into how the gut microbiota influences host metabolism. !"
"9273701","Project Summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly successful in suppressing viral replication and preventing disease progression, however it cannot eradicate HIV-1 infection, and it does not accelerate the elimination of infected cells. HIV-1 persists in a latent state as integrated proviruses in resting memory CD4+ T cells that are not accessible to ART. Several eradication strategies are currently being evaluated, and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a promising new modality, particularly if coupled with latency reversing agents. Antibodies differ from ART in that they can recruit immune effector functions through their Fc domains to accelerate clearance of viruses and infected cells. In addition, immune complexes are potent immunogens that can foster development of host immune responses. Passive administration of earlier anti-HIV-1 bNAbs has been evaluated in humans and found to be generally safe and well tolerated. While these first generation neutralizing antibodies were largely ineffective in preclinical and clinical settings, selected newer generation bNAbs can prevent infection and suppress active infection in humanized mice (hu-mice) and non-human primates (NHP). 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are two of most potent broadly neutralizing antibodies currently available. 3BNC117 targets the CD4 binding site and 10-1074 targets the base of the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120. In phase 1 clinical studies, 3BNC117 and 10-1074 have been generally safe to date. A single infusion of 3BNC117 suppressed HIV-1 viremia by an average of 1.48 log copies/ml, while 10-1074 suppressed HIV-1 viremia by an average of 1.34 copies/ml when dosed at 30 mg/kg. When evaluated in ART-treated individuals during an analytical interruption of ART (ATI), 3BNC117 effectively delayed rebound of antibody sensitive viruses from the HIV-1 reservoir. Similar to preclinical findings, selection of resistant viral strains occurred when either antibody was administered alone. The combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 have additive effects and provide broader coverage of viral strains. We now propose to study whether the administration of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 can suppress replication and reduce the reservoir by engaging the host immune system. The envisioned clinical trial is a phase I, open label, randomized study to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of 6 monthly infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 to HIV-infected subjects who have achieved viral suppression with ART alone, in the presence or absence of ART. We will evaluate the reservoir by quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the genetic composition of the replication-competent viral reservoir. In addition, we will evaluate if 3BNC117 and 10-1074 modulate HIV-1-specific immune responses."
"9187942","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to enable cancer researchers to develop and evaluate predictive cancer biomarkers more quickly and easily. We will do this by producing biostatistical methods aimed at eliminating two common frustrations in cancer biomarker research: (1) promising biomarkers must be abandoned because the assay cannot be implemented in its current form in a clinical trial, and (2) modifications in a biomarker assay which may reduce cost or improve marker performance cannot be explored because of the high additional cost of such studies.    It is frequently required or desirable to modify some aspects of an assay before moving to the clinical validation step. The assay may be modified for many reasons. We will call all of these changes assay modifications, and refer to the result as a modified assay.    Assay modifications can stymy biomarker development because, if the modification is not trivial, then any previous associations between the biomarker and clinical outcomes must be re-investigated.    This application will develop methods that allow the clinical performance of the modified assay to be estimated using data from a reproducibility study. The reproducibility study will compare the original assay and the modified assay on a set of patient samples. Importantly, these samples need not have clinical outcomes associated with them. In sum, if this application is successful, investigators will no longer need to feel locked into the assay as it was originally developed, or be forced to abandon an assay because modifications are required. More predictive biomarker assays will therefore be developed, and the benefits they provide to public health, patients and physicians will be realized.    The specific aims are therefore:  1. Develop sets of estimators for the change in biomarker performance associated with modifying an assay.  2. Using a combination of real data resampling studies, simulations and mathematics, evaluate how well different reproducibility metrics capture changes in biomarker performance.  3. Using the best metrics identified in Specific Aim 2, develop optimal statistical design and sample size methods for biomarker reproducibility studies."
"9461966","Abstract The West Virginia Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (WVPCTN) will work as a Clinical Center of the IDeA States PCTN to provide clinical trial access to individuals in the rural, central Appalachian state of West Virginia and surrounding counties included in the immediate service area. The WVPCTN will be critically poised to serve as a Clinical Center based on the historical, physical, psychosocial, and fiscal burdens brought about by a multitude of chronic disease conditions and a wide variety of environmental risk factors that contribute to those conditions in West Virginia. The WVPCTN is well positioned to be successful as a Clinical Center due to a combination of a variety of structural and human resources already in place that address: Subject Identification, Subject Recruitment and Study Performance. Specifically, the WVPCTN will utilize the following: for Subject Identification - the Integrated Data Repository of the WVU CTSI (containing over 2 million patient records), large neonatal and school age cohorts from our Birth Score and CARDIAC projects (described in detail in the Research Plan), and targeted cohorts from the West Virginia Perinatal Partnership Network, the Center of Excellence in Disabilities and the WVU Department of Occupational and Environmental Studies; for Subject Recruitment ? WVU General and Specialty Clinics, our CTSI sponsored Practice Based Research Network, the infrastructure of our Dental COHRA grant, the infrastructure from Birth Score and CARDIAC, and a variety of specialized existing settings; for Study Performance ? an experienced investigator pool, a group of mentee investigators, and the resources and oversight of the WVU CTSI sponsored Clinical Trials Research Unit core. These features and resources, together with strong and sustained partnerships throughout the state, and the multiple environmentally related conditions of our citizens, uniquely position us to both be successful at PCTN trials and propose new trials for the PCTN. The WVPCTN will add to a long standing commitment to pediatric focused initiatives across the state and benefit from statewide networks that have been established, in part through active IDeA State mechanisms. As such, we are uniquely positioned to fully leverage additional funds to efficiently establish the infrastructure to provide access to cutting edge trials which will impact the health of the children of West Virginia."
"9344930","ABSTRACT The purpose of the proposed grant application is to further develop a therapeutic regimen focused on radiological/nuclear medical countermeasures. Very few medical products have been shown to counter the acute and long-term injuries that can result from a nuclear or radiological accident or attack. Medical products and regimens that mitigate and/or treat radiation injury post-exposure (i.e., administration of first dose to start at least 24 hours after radiation exposure), with emphasis on broad activity (i.e. multi-syndrome and/or multi-tissue), ease of administration in a mass casualty and emergency scenario; safety; and long shelf-life are still to be developed and are thus of high priority. Therapeutic administration of recombinant proteins to lethally irradiated wild-type mice resulted in mitigation of lethal total body irradiation. These findings suggest that pharmacologic augmentation of the activity such proteins might offer a rational approach to the mitigation of tissue injury and lethality caused by ionizing radiation."
"9236950","This is a competitive renewal for R01 AG 029672, which applied modern psychometric methods to neuropsychological data collected by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). This competitive renewal proposes to analyze data from ADNI and from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyles of Ageing (AIBL) study using state-of-the-art psychometric approaches to address substantively important questions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. This project in many ways serves as a bridge between fields that do not often talk with each other: modern psychometrics and cognitive neuroscience applied to neurodegenerative conditions. The investigators propose to tackle two important problems in AD research: improving the ability to detect preclinical disease at the earliest stages (Aim 1) and understanding the clinical relevance of heterogeneity in the presentation of AD (Aim 2). Advances in modern psychometrics have the potential to optimize understanding of these critical questions by translating clinical insights into quantitative analytic approaches. The investigators have a tradition of disseminating their tools to the broader research community and propose to continue this tradition with a dissemination aim (Aim 3). Support for the next cycle of funding for this project will ensure continued scientific leadership bridging modern psychometrics and cognitive neuroscience."
"9315225","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk? from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior."
"9273668","Summary Brown University requests support for a FEI Teneo VS variable pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for serial block face imaging in the life sciences. Ultrathin sections are cut inside the microscope and series of images are acquired from the freshly cut block face, while the sections are discarded. The automated system is capable of imaging large z-stacks at isotropic 10x10x10 nm resolution. The series of images can be processed for 3D reconstruction of cells and tissues, with sufficient resolution to identify small vesicles, organelles and neural connections. The user group requested the basic Teneo VS system. This system includes equipment essential for serial block-face imaging and 3D reconstruction of the data sets, but does not include additional features or accessories. The requested system will replace a 25-year old SEM in the Division of Biology and Medicine at Brown University. The Teneo VS will be the only SEM in the Division of Biology and Medicine and the only variable pressure SEM for serial block-face imaging in the State of Rhode Island. The microscope will be used immediately by 15 investigators at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital for high-resolution 3D imaging of cellular and sub-cellular structures ranging from germ plasm in embryos to neural circuits in the retina. Collectively, these 15 users are funded by 26 NIH grants. The Major Users have a substantial need for the requested SEM for serial block-face imaging. As an indication of this substantial need, all Major Users have obtained preliminary results with various out- of-state SEMs for serial block-face imaging. While these preliminary results demonstrate the Major User group's need and expertise, the major users had limited access to the SEMs for serial block-face imaging and could only image a subset of samples that were important to their research programs. The Minor Users were unable to gain access to SEMs for serial block-face imaging, but have research projects that would immediately benefit from the proposed equipment. The impact of the proposed imaging system will extend beyond the projects of the Major and Minor Users, since the microscope will be made be made available to the broader scientific community in Rhode Island, which has more than 600 active NIH-funded projects with a total annual budget of $184 million. The microscope will be set up in the Leduc Bioimaging Facility at Brown University, which has the technical expertise to maintain the instrument, train its users and provide consultation on planned and ongoing research projects. In addition, the users will have access to assistance in sample preparation and data analysis. The Leduc Bioimaging Facility, supported by a broadly-based Advisory Committee, has an excellent track-record maintaining various high-end imaging systems and has strong institutional support, which guarantees that the instrumentation will be used to its maximum potential for years to come."
"9252264","The mission of the Center for Environmental Exposure and Disease (CEED) is to improve human health by performing transdisciplinary research to elucidate how the total environment, the genome and the epigenome interact to mitigate the risk of disease. CEED research focuses on: 1) assessing and modeling exposures, 2) discovering and applying biological response indicators which link exposures to mechanisms of pathogenesis, 3) developing and implementing targeted prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies, 4) reducing exposures by influencing public policy, planning and regulation, and 5) engaging and informing stakeholders. By analogy with Precision Medicine, CEED envisions that the integration of data from exposure biology, genomics, epigenetics and microbiomics to assess exposures, biological responses, mechanisms of pathogenesis and disease prevention will significantly impact the future of environmental health. The CEED vision is to lead the development of precision environmental health research through the integration of clinical, basic, and population-based studies, using the acquired information to prevent and/or treat environmental disease. The strategy is to combine the Center's long-standing breadth and depth of expertise in environmental health research with new capabilities in exposure biology, epigenomics, and microbiomics.

"9273851","ABSTRACT: We are requesting funds to replace an aged MoFlo Legacy in poor working state with a MoFlo Astrios EQ Cell Sorter at the Boston University Flow Cytometry Core facility. The BU Flow Core, located on Medical Campus, provides services to more than 90 laboratories with over 180 individual users of our instruments and consulting services. Also, the Flow Core houses the only two cell sorters (a FACSARIA and a MoFlo Legacy) on all the BU campuses. The facility has a large demand for cell sorting that to date is not adequately met; there is an obvious scheduling bottleneck with users often reserving the sorting instruments weeks in advance. To help meet the cell sorting demand, we employ an evening/weekend cell sorter. Our MoFlo Legacy, manufactured in 2001, is a five-color instrument in an aged and dilapidated state, frequently experiencing downtime due to mechanical failures. As Beckman Coulter stopped servicing the MoFlo Legacy in 2013, technical help is non- existent and parts are difficult to acquire, available only on the `used' aftermarket. Brian Tilton, our Director of Cell Sorting, serviced MoFlo instruments in a previous position and therefore his unique skill set has allowed the instrument to remain mostly functional to date. Two features of this instrument that are not present on FACSARIA include `jet-in-air' sorting and a yellow-green laser and both are absolutely required by many of our users. For example, members of BU's Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM) are heavily dependent on cell sorting for their basic research needs and often require jet-in-air sorting and/or the 560nm laser for their sorts. The CReM and other research groups have experienced significant financial and experimental losses in the last two years due to unreliability of our MoFlo Legacy. Thus, users that specifically require our MoFlo for their research are enduring experimental losses. The MoFlo Astrios we seek to purchase is a jet-in-air sorter and the laser configuration we request will allow simultaneous 18-color detection from 5 lasers including a yellow- green laser (560nm). Acquisition of a MoFlo Astrios will allow thriving research programs in stem cell biology, immunology, infectious diseases, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and others to continue to expand. When considering the particular cell sorting needs and the growth potential of the Boston University research community, we conclude that a MoFlo Astrios EQ High Speed Cell Sorter is the ideal instrument to replace our aged MoFlo Legacy."
"9316195","Project Summary  In an effort to improve the scientific and medical communities? ability to access epigenetic information, this project aims to develop a label-free method to detect epigenetically modified bases in DNA. The method that will be developed relies on the use of a carbon nanotube charge-sensor integrated with a solid-state nanopore. DNA will be driven through the nanopore by electrophoresis, causing it to pass by the nanotube in a serial fashion. By monitoring changes in the electrical current through the nanotube as DNA passes through the nanopore, nucleotides will be detected based on their charge. There are two specific aims for this project. Firstly, it aims to use a carbon nanotube-based charge sensor aligned to a nanopore to detect unlabeled epigenetically-modified nucleotides in a DNA strand as it traverses the nanopore. Secondly, it aims to use a nanotube-based sensor to categorize nucleotides in a DNA strand into one of two groups based on their charge. The methods developed in this project have the potential to lead to faster and simpler profiling of epigenetic information, allowing for its more routine use in medical diagnostics."
"9325947","Project Summary Inappropriate interpersonal aggression is a common and serious symptom of social dysfunction in multiple psychiatric disorders, including Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's Disease, ADHD, Autism, and Major Depression, among others. Despite the widespread prevalence of abnormal aggressive behavior in psychiatric patient, few effective treatments currently exist. Underlying this unfortunate dearth of treatments is a lack of comprehensive knowledge of the neural processes controlling aggressive behavior. Interestingly, recent neuroimaging studies in humans suggest that elevated aggression in psychiatric patients may result, in part, from the inappropriate activation of reward circuitry. Data in rodents corroborates this notion with a vast literature describing a functional role for the mesolimbic dopamine system in the repeated subordination of male conspecifics, an experience that induces ?escalated aggression? phenotypes in a small portion of individual mice and mirrors the pathological aggressive behavior observed in a small portion of human psychiatric patients. While hugely relevant to the processes underlying escalated aggression, the specific mechanisms controlling the motivational or rewarding components of escalated aggression remain largely unknown. Evidence from our laboratory suggests that the lateral habenula (lHb), a small region of the epithalamus crucial for providing negative regulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine release, plays an important role in controlling the valence of aggressive encounters. However, much still remains unknown about the mechanisms modulating lHb activity in the context of aggression and aggression reward. The hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin represents an attractive candidate for providing this modulatory role, as it has been implicated in a wide range of relevant behaviors including reward, arousal, stress, and social interaction. While orexin neurons send sizeable projections to the lHb, this circuit has never been examined in any behavioral domain. In this proposal, I will investigate the cell-type specific regulation of orexin receptor expression in the lHb by aggression. I will then utilize viral-mediated gene transfer techniques to knock down lHb orexin receptor expression in a cell-type specific manner to determine the functional importance of this receptor in mediating aggression and aggression reward. The results of these studies will inform our understanding of the mechanisms controlling affective components of aggression and reveal novel target mechanisms for therapeutic development."
"9256404","Project 5: PICALM, Oligomeric Abeta and Inflammation in Neurovascular Pathogenesis in AD  In this renewal the emphasis will still be on how Abeta and inflammation affect cerebrovascular function, but will  also take advantage of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have identified new AD risk  genes that have been broadly linked to inflammation/endosomal processing. Because the blood brain barrier  (BBB) is critically important for efficient transport of solutes in and out of the central nervous system (CNS),  and phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) one of the genes identified with  increased risk for AD is involved with initiating endocytosis/transcytosis of APP, ApoE and Abeta by endothelial  cells, we have chosen to focus on how the PICALM risk variant affects endothelial function in the presence  oligomeric Ap, angiotensin II, and inflammation (IL-1beta). Finally, because meta-analysis of AD risk loci has  revealed interactions between PICALM and APOE genotypes, where PICALM conferred risk predominantiy  in APOE e4-positive subjects, we propose to include APOE genotypes in our research strategy. Since  PICALM knockout mice show deficits in erythroid maturation and transferrin internalization, we hypothesize  that the PICALM risk variant represents either a deficit in endocytosis or an altered trafficking  function where vesicle cargo is misrouted. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate  the contribution of the PICALM AD risk variant on the level of parenchymal amyloid load, type-1 and type-2  cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Ap40 & 42 levels, tau, and inflammation in the UCI ADRC autopsy cases. Aim  2: We will investigate how human iPSCs-derived ECs homozygous PICALM risk or non-risk alleles affect  endocytic function and vesicular trafficking in endothelial cells (APOE genotypes 3/3, versus ?3/?4). Aim 3:  We will test endocytosis and transcytosis of transferrin, LRP1, ApoE and TrkB receptors, as well as APP and  Ap using an in vitro transwell model of the BBB. We will use iPSCs-derived ECs homozygous for PICALM  risk or non-risk coding variants and astrocytes from Down syndrome (DS) and non-DS that express APOE  ?3/?3 or ApoE ?3/?4. Aim 4: To test the role of PICALM in EC BBB function on Ap vascular pathology in vivo.  We propose to develop a transgenic mouse model with reduced expression of PICALM in endothelial cells  using the Cre-LoxP System. The conditional EC PICALM knock-out mice will be crossed with APP Tg mice  that develop Type 2 CAA or Type 1 CAA and the effect of PICALM knockdown on CAA, as well as  parenchymal Abeta will be assessed."
"9256402","Project 3: Role of Inflammation on Induction of Tau Pathology in the Brains of Transgenic IVIice  Alzheimer disease (AD) impairs memory and causes cognitive and psychiatric deficits. The number of  people with AD will quadruple to 115 million worldwide by 2050, with cumiulative costs of care in the absence  of disease-modifying treatments exceeding $204rillion over the next 40 years alone in the USA. Should this  expectation come to fruition, it will pose an unprecedented medical, social, and economic burden on our  society. One of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in the field centers on elucidating the role  that inflammation plays in disease progression, and in particular, how the cerebral buildup of p-amyloid (Ap)  promotes inflammation and the development of hyperphosphorylated tau. Notably, our studies identified  inflammation as an early and critical step that links Ap to tau pathology and cognitive decline. Supporting  GWAS-derived evidence further reinforces the importance of inflammation, as single nucleotide  polymorphisms in many immune-related genes significantly increase the probability of developing AD.  Although inflammation is critical to disease progression, a detailed molecular analysis of specific  mechanisms of the inflammatory response is greatly needed. Among numerous inflammatory pathways  associated with AD, interleukin-ip (IL-ip) plays a critical pathogenic role. We hypothesize that AQ> alters  intracellular protein clearance and trafficking, exacerbating IL-ip-mediated inflammation, eliciting tau  pathology and synaptic and cognitive deficits. Our goal is to elucidate the impact of Ap on IL-ip signaling  with emphasis on fiie relevance of protein clearance for IL-ip synthesis and protein trafficking for IL-1  receptor 1 (IL-1 Rl) levels. We developed several new and exciting transgenic models and viral approaches  that add significantly to the field and enable us to dissect the molecular pathways by which Ap, IL-ip and tau  interact and the mechanisms by which they adversely impact cognition during different stages of the disease  process. Because a better understanding of these pathways is critical not only for academic reasons but  also for helping to identify novel drug targets, the translational impact of this work is quite significant.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Inflammation plays both a protective and damaging role in Alzheimer disease (AD), so to identify a long  lasting and effective treatment, it is important that we better understand its underlying processes. Our studies  implicate a critical cytokine called interleukin-ip (IL-1P) as a factor that accelerates AD pathology. Here we  propose to study the molecular mechanisms by which this cytokine alters basic cell biological functions and  how these changes affect AD pathogenesis."
"9461970","Increasing the number of children from rural areas and minority families in clinical research can improve the health of all children by allowing us to better understand disease and treatment in a wider variety of patients. Nebraska is home to over 470,000 children, 27% of whom reside in rural areas. Nebraska also includes a significant and growing minority pediatric population, over 30% of whom live in poverty. These children are often underrepresented in clinical trials. Thanks to the outreach offered by the pediatricians and pediatric specialists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and the affiliated Children?s Hospital & Medical Center (Children?s), the proposed Nebraska Pediatric Clinical Trials Unit (NPCTU) is well suited to filling this gap in pediatric clinical trials by linking our well-established research infrastructure with our extensive clinical expertise and diverse patient population to create a central home for pediatric clinical research in Nebraska. Our clinical network includes over 30 outreach clinics throughout the state of Nebraska, as well as clinics in South Dakota and Iowa, and over 60 general pediatric and specialty pediatric clinics. The NPCTU partners this clinical network with the robust research infrastructure of UNMC and Children?s, including a Pediatric Research Office that supports more than 180 pediatric research trials and the UNMC Center for Clinical Trials Research. These entities have extensive experience in providing administrative and clinical support for the development of investigator-initiated studies and participation in multi-center, pharmaceutical and NIH/CDC/HRSA sponsored trials. Thus, the affiliation between UNMC and Children?s creates an environment with excellent pediatric research capabilities. This proposal has considerable institutional support and will integrate the extensive research and clinical resources available in Nebraska to build on current strengths to form a unified Nebraska Pediatric Clinical Trials Unit. In keeping with the goals of the Institutional Development Awards Program (IDeA) States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network, our Specific Aims as a participant in this program are two-fold: 1) To establish the NPCTU as the home for pediatric clinical trials in our region by developing a plan for communication with potential investigators and collaborators about trials, training opportunities and resources to support research. This proposal will also support the professional development of the principal investigator and associated faculty, residents and personnel conducting clinical research at UNMC and Children?s, while building on our existing program to conduct clinical trials research for children with a variety of conditions; and 2) To provide the underserved and rural populations of Nebraska and surrounding states access to state-of-the-art clinical trials. Our clinical outreach network with access to a wide variety of underserved populations uniquely positions the NPCTU to contribute to large-scale national pediatric trials."

"9355485","Project Summary/Abstract Our overall goal is to determine the long-term consequences of chronic HIV/HCV coinfection as a result of injection drug use (IDU) and the impact of HCV cure on the relationship of liver fibrosis and immune activation/ dysregulation in reproductively aging HIV-infected women. Liver disease with accelerated liver fibrosis is a major cause of death in HIV/HCV coinfected adults. Global immune activation may partly explain this accelerated liver fibrosis. With the advent of interferon-free direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), a decrease in the burden of liver disease is expected. It is unknown if, after HCV cure, HIV-associated immune dysfunction impacts liver fibrosis or if residual liver injury affects immune recovery in reproductively aging HIV/HCV-coinfected women. Estrogen depletion is associated with increased immune dysfunction and metabolic disruptions, including visceral obesity, which could impact liver fibrosis. HCV infection has a major impact on immunopathogenesis of HIV and HCV disease. Our studies show that coinfected women with liver disease as compared to coinfected women without liver disease, have increased activated CD4+ T cells, and changes in immune regulatory and maturational pathways critical for immune homeostasis, including regulatory (Treg), senescent, effector memory and effector T cells. Coinfected women also have higher levels of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), an immunosuppressive cytokine critical for Treg differentiation and an important regulator of liver inflammation and fibrosis, as well as IL- 7, which promotes HIV persistence, stimulates HIV replication and HIV reservoirs, and promotes fibrogenesis, compared to HIV-monoinfected women. Our central hypotheses are that after HCV cure, HIV/HCV- coinfected women, who are aging, will have impaired liver fibrosis regression, because of HIV- associated immune dysregulation and increased risk of metabolic perturbations including hepatic steatosis (or fatty liver). The specific aims are to: (1) Longitudinally examine the short and long-term effects of HIV and menopause on liver fibrosis after HCV cure in aging HIV/HCV-coinfected women and (2) Determine if liver fibrosis impacts immune activation and dysregulation after HCV cure in HIV/HCV-coinfected women. HCV- monoinfected, HIV-monoinfected and uninfected women will serve as controls. We plan to use medication, menopause, metabolic, and liver fibrosis data, and biorepository samples from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), to accomplish our aims. State- of- the- art clinical and laboratory technologies will evaluate liver fibrosis and steatosis severity and gene-signature expression to elucidate pathways of immune activation and dysregulation assessed simultaneously with cellular phenotypic and soluble biomarkers. The WIHS provides a unique opportunity to tease out the complex contributions of HIV, HCV, liver injury and estrogen depletion on immunologic markers in women. The proposed studies will help us understand if estrogen depletion blunts recovery of liver injury after HCV cure and if residual liver injury affects HIV-associated immune activation/dysregulation. This will help inform strategies for prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis."
"9198543","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 40,000 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are diagnosed each year in the United States. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are the mainstays of treatment for advanced OSCC, but frequently result in disfigurement and adverse cytotoxicities. Recurrent disease, leading to death, is associated with development of chemotherapy and/or radiation resistance. Efforts to combat OSCC have been severely hindered by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression and a lack of molecular markers that can be used to predict responsiveness to chemotherapy and radiation. Our long-term goal is to determine the role that gene mutations play in OSCC, to apply this knowledge towards risk stratification in patients, and to develop therapeutic strategies to overcome the negative consequences of these mutations.  We and others have reported the mutational landscape of OSCC, identifying the procaspase-8 gene as one of the most commonly mutated genes in this disease. Mutations in the coding region for procaspase-8 zymogen were identified in 8 percent of patient tumors, a finding confirmed by analysis of 302 OSCC tumors by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Wild-type caspase-8 is known to mediate death receptor-mediated apoptosis. In functional studies of four OSCC-associated, procaspase-8 mutants, we determined that the mutant proteins potently inhibit death receptor-mediated apoptosis, and a representative mutant interfered with formation of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC). The procaspase-8 mutants also conferred enhanced resistance to cisplatin and radiation. Inhibition of the DNA damage response proteins ATR and ATM reversed cisplatin and radiation resistance, respectively, in cells with mutant procaspase-8. We hypothesize that OSCC- associated procaspase-8 mutations promote resistance to death ligands, chemotherapy, and radiation, while defining a substantial subpopulation of patients who may benefit from treatment with ATR or ATM inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will utilize innovative OSCC models to investigate the impact of a broad panel of OSCC-associated procaspase-8 mutant proteins on DISC formation, apoptosis, and necroptosis following death receptor activation. Aim 2 will determine whether the mutant proteins confer resistance to cisplatin or radiation in vitro and in vivo, and will compare clinical outcomes of OSCC patients harboring wild-type versus mutant procaspase-8 using specimens from an ongoing Phase II clinical trial incorporating concurrent cisplatin/radiation treatment. In Aim 3, i vitro and in vivo studies will determine the potential of ATR/ATM inhibition as a strategy for reversing chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Results from our studies will determine the significance and consequences of frequent procaspase-8 mutation on OSCC responsiveness to death receptor agonists, chemotherapy, and radiation, and the mechanisms responsible for these effects. We also expect that our findings will lay the foundation for biomarker-driven clinical trials evaluating the value of ATR or ATM inhibition in patients with procaspase-8 mutations."
"9274285","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this NIBIB P41 Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) proposal is to establish a Center for Multimodal Evaluation of Engineered Cartilage at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Engineered tissues are close to entering clinical practice, and have the potential to replace a variety of prosthetic devices. The use of cells in engineered tissue introduces considerable variability into the process, resulting in unpredictable quality of tissue engineered (TE) constructs. This is a severe and limiting problem, as these constructs must ultimately replace all the essential functions of their target tissue when implanted. Failure can occur in many modes, and multiple minor deficiencies can have cumulative effects. All available information suggests that if a TE construct fails in any one mode, then it has not yet reached implantability. This has led us to conclude that robust, validated, and ideally non-destructive / non-invasive tools for continuous monitoring and assessment of the entire TE process, and of its end-product, are essential to ensure the production of implantable cartilage. Monitoring and assessment cannot focus on just one aspect of the TE process; rather, we must address the biological, biochemical and biomechanical aspects of the process in parallel. Similar problems, and thus needs, also affect our global network of colleagues engaged in cartilage TE. Hence, there is a need to establish technology and protocols for multimodal evaluation of TE cartilage. The proposed Center will fill that need by becoming a platform for developing, testing, validating, and disseminating new methods of evaluating cartilage TE processes and products, and a broadly accessible resource for Collaborative and Service interactions. Our team incorporates the biological and engineering expertise of several departments at CWRU, and has collaborated for decades on cartilage TE. We have accumulated experience, expertise, and technology related to cartilage evaluation that is not available elsewhere in a like concentration. Four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects are proposed, which will: 1) develop imaging modalities to longitudinally track the state of cartilage tissue differentiation - development of a miRNA-based imaging system is a major component; 2) develop non-invasive methods to analyze cell differentiation based on modified cells as probes, and tools to predict the ECM composition based on matrix remodeling during tissue growth; 3) develop technologies to evaluate the endogenous and exogenous biochemical environment of the chondrogenesis process; and 4) develop methods for imaging-guided multiscale, multimodal mechanical evaluation of TE cartilage. Each TR&D will: i) develop and validate technologies in well-characterized systems; ii) apply the technology to TE constructs from our collaborators; iii) exhaustively analyze these constructs post-test using conventional methods; and iv) accrue a cross- disciplinary database of information on the performance of TE cartilage. This work will assist in the development of new TE strategies; despite the focus on cartilage, the concept of multimodal evaluation is fundamental for all types of tissue constructs, and the technology we will develop is versatile and extensible to other tissue types."
"9285574","Project Summary/Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability, with ~20% of individuals suffering from clinical depression during their lifetime. Depression is a heterogeneous syndrome consisting of several subtypes and abnormalities in multiple brain regions. Despite the prevalence of depression and its considerable impact, knowledge about its pathophysiology is limited. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel signaling pathways contributing to the development of depression so that better diagnostic tests, treatments, and preventive measures can be attained. A recent ground breaking report revealed SIRT1 as one of the first two genes successfully linked to MDD in a genome-wide study. SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family, is characterized as a Class III histone deacetylase (HDAC), which regulates the acetylation state of histones and non-histone proteins and thereby influences gene expression and cellular physiology. Preliminary data from our lab show that chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), an ethologically validated model of depression and other stress-related disorders, regulates SIRT1 levels in the NAc, a key brain reward region. Additionally we demonstrate that SIRT1 overexpression in the NAc increases anxiety and despair-like behaviors. What is not understood is how SIRT1 influences anxiety and despair-like behaviors in a cell and circuit-specific manner. This is of particular importance due to the opposing role of D1 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and D2 MSNs in reward- and depression-related behaviors. A central hypothesis of this project is that SIRT1 signaling acts through the D1 pathway to mediate anxiety- and despair-like behaviors. To test this hypothesis, first we will use Cre-inducible RiboTag (RT) mice, which have been crossed with D1-Cre and D2- Cre bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice, allowing for the cell-type specific isolation of mRNA from D1 or D2 MSNs. Following CSDS we will measure SIRT1 mRNA from D1 and D2 MSN isolated from RiboTag-D1 Cre and RiboTag-D2 Cre mice. Second, to determine through which MSN subtype SIRT1 acts to mediate anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors we will selectively overexpress SIRT1 in D1 or D2 MSNs in the NAc and third we will utilize electrophysiology and morphological approaches, to uncover cell-type specific SIRT1 dependent neural circuits that mediate depression-like behaviors. If successful this study will have several positive impacts: 1) it would have identified the SIRT1-signaling pathway as a potential target in the development of urgently needed novel antidepressants; 2) it will provide additional support for the development of non-monoaminergic medications to treat depression; and 3) it will identify the neural circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms through which SIRT1 mediates depression-like behaviors."
"9343474","Obesity continues to escalate as a significant public health problem and as the leading preventable cause of death. One third of adult population in US is obese (CDC's BRFSS, 2015). Alarmingly, 78% of the veteran population is obese, a notably higher percent compared to general population. With over 9.2 million beneficiaries, the cost of obesity and its related diseases exceeds $1.7 billion annually for the VA (18). With this significant rising epidemic, obesity has become one of the major health risk factor that contributes to the development of severe conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, stroke and certain cancers. Genetic, environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors cause excess weight gain and obesity. Adipose tissue is an important endocrine regulator of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. New adipocytes are required for storage of excess energy (intake>expenditure) in the white adipocyte tissue and this is accomplished via adipose stem cells' adipogenesis process. Using human adipose stem cells (ASC) from lean and obese patients, it was showed that adipogenesis is dysregulated in obesity and mature adipocytes in obese subjects show distinctive phenotype compared to lean subjects(5, 6). Obesity is accompanied with chronic low grade inflammation which initiates insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome(7, 8). It was demonstrated that obesity changes the adipose stem cell niche. However, the impact of this phenomenon and importance of ASC niche in obesity has not been investigated mechanistically. Hence, a screening study was undertaken to identify genes whose expression is altered in obese ASC such that it renders adipocytes susceptible to increased inflammation. Data showed increase of Protein Kinase C deltaI (PKC?I) -an important kinase in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The data indicated that PKC?I promotes inflammation in obese adipocytes. Based on these observations, the goal is to elucidate the role of PKC?I in adipose stem cells in obesity. Aim 1: Determine the role of PKC?I in promoting inflammation in obesity: Obesity associated inflammation contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Data showed that PKC?I is increased in obesity and PKC?I knockdown inhibits inflammation in obese ASC. Systematic analysis of inflammatory genes with gain and loss of PKC?I will be performed. Aim 2: Determine the regulation of PKC?I expression in obese ASC. Using ASC, the data shows that NEAT1, a long noncoding RNA, regulates PKC?I expression. The molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of PKC?I expression by NEAT1 will be determined using RNA binding assays and loss/gain of function studies in ASC. Aim 3: Develop and validate a novel, specific PKC?I inhibitor in obesity in vivo. PKC?I is increased in obese adipocytes and it mediates inflammation which culminates in insulin resistance in obesity. Silencing PKC?I decreases apoptosis and inflammation in obese adipocytes. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel PKC?I specific inhibitor will be evaluated in vivo in an obese mouse model.  Obesity is the leading preventable cause of death. Overweight and obesity per se are not fatal; however obesity is the predominant condition that promotes diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, and cancer which have high mortality rates(9). PKC?I is an important mediator of inflammation in obesity which significantly contributes to obesity- associated co-morbidities. The drug discovery arm has developed a novel, specific PKC?I inhibitor which will lead to an advanced therapeutic strategy for management of obesity related morbidities."
"9359027","ABSTRACT In this revised application, we propose a new pre- and post-doctoral training program at the University of Florida: Breathing REsearch And THErapeutics (BREATHE). Our proposal is to create a training program focused on the respiratory neuromuscular system, emphasizing the discovery of new knowledge and its translation to neuromuscular disorders that compromise breathing and airway defense. Diminished breathing capacity, unstable breathing and/or aspiration pneumonia from inadequate airway defense are hallmarks of many neuromuscular disorders, and respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. However, despite the fundamental importance of breathing and airway defense to the quality and duration of life in patients with degenerative neuromuscular diseases (eg. Muscular Dystrophy, Pompe Disease, ALS) or neural injury (eg. spinal cord injury), we know of no other training program with similar focus on breathing and airway defense in in these conditions. Our proposal directly addresses this critical gap in NHLBI funded research training. The ultimate goal of the BREATHE Training Program is to develop a unique cohort of researchers with strong foundations in basic research on respiratory neuromuscular biology, and a strong appreciation for the needs/realities of translational research in our attempts to develop treatments for impaired breathing and/or airway defense. Our perspective is that we can accelerate progress towards development of effective treatments for impaired breathing capacity/stability in diverse neuromuscular disorders by training investigators with: 1) a well-developed and comprehensive conceptual framework embracing similarities and differences between neuromuscular clinical disorders; and 2) a state-of-the-art ?tool kit,? providing the technological know- how to perform meaningful investigations in animal models and humans with spontaneous disease. We will train individuals with diverse academic backgrounds, including neuroscience, muscle biology, engineering and/or clinical training (physicians, physical or speech therapists and veterinarians; including multiple specialties in each group). A hallmark of our program will be ?cross-training,? where basic scientists are exposed to meaningful clinical experiences, and clinician scientists establish strong basic research foundations. We will capitalize on existing, and building strengths at the University of Florida to provide an integrated research-training program in respiratory neuromuscular biology and translational research. The UF Health Science Center has demonstrated its commitment to this area of research by creating a new Center for Respiratory Research and Rehabilitation. This Center, and other strengths at the UF Health Science Center, will provide an exceptional academic environment for the BREATHE Training Program."
"9240616","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose three related area of research, each focused on a major aspect of Ras signaling. The first attempts to solve an important question relating to the NF1 gene, now recognized as a major tumor suppressor in human cancer as well as genetic basis for neurofibromatosis, a disease that affects 1 in 3500 people worldwide. Using biochemical approaches as well as cell-based screens, we will try and identify proteins or other cellular factors that regulate neurofibromin's ability to regulate Ras. Recently, we identified the first bone fide neurofibromin binding proteins other than Ras, the Spred proteins that are essential for neurofibromin's activity. We will build on this discovery to determine how the neurofibromin/Spred complex is assembled and regulated, and, in addition, we will perform unbiased screens for factors that regulate Ras through neurofibromin, or regulate Ras-independent functions of this highly conserved protein. Second, we will analyze individual mutants of K-Ras for their requirement for upstream signaling, and for the specific activation of downstream pathways. We will do this, as in the previous section, by combining analysis of biochemical properties of the proteins themselves, and analysis of downstream pathways. We will focus on known pathways that are clearly activated differently by different oncogenic forms of Ras, such as the Raf  MAPK pathway, and unbiased analysis of signaling differences that are revealed by analysis of individual  proteins in a clean, isogenic background. Finally, we have discovered that K-Ras promotes a stem-cell like phenotype in cancer cells that enables them to form tumors very efficiently from small numbers of cells, to metastasize and to become drug resistant. These phenotypes are caused by K-Ras binding to calmodulin and suppressing non-canonical wnt signaling, while increasing transcription from beta-catenin and other factors involved in stem-cell signaling. One of these factors that is produced by K-Ras cancers and plays a major role in the stem-cell phenotype is Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). We have found that neutralizing LIF prevents tumor initiation in vivo and sensitizes pancreatic tumor cells to gemcitabine, so that established tumors can be completely eradicated. We propose to undertake pre-clinical analysis of humanized anti-LIF monoclonal antibodies, using several models of pancreatic cancer, with the intention of moving these antibodies into clinical testing based on the results of these experiments. Binding of K-Ras to calmodulin is prevented by phosphorylation on serine-181, by PKC. The non-tumor promoting natural product, prostratin, activates PKC in vivo and disrupts K-Ras-calmodulin interaction. Oral administration of prostratin prevents development of pancreatic cancers in mouse models, with no obvious side effects. Several analogs of prostratin have been synthesized: we will test all of these, and make more. We will identify which form of PKC is involved in K-Ras phosphorylation and perform thorough preclinical testing for safety and efficacy of the most promising analogs, so that, if successful, we will advance one of these towards clinical testing."
"9273164","Abstract The Bruker Avance I-600 MHz NMR spectrometer, which is the key and only active 600MHz instrument at the Cleveland Center for Membrane and Structural Biology (CCMSB), has been dysfunctional for the past several months. The symptoms include frequent interruption of the experiments followed by the cryoprobe warm-up. The cryoprobe, after many such interruptions and warm-ups, has also been damaged with ~40% sensitivity drop. Routine 3D triple resonance NMR experiments cannot be performed effectively on this instrument any more. Our repair team comprising expert from Bruker BioSpin has made tremendous effort to troubleshoot the problems by replacing numerous parts without success, leading to the conclusion that the console of this particular instrument, which has been continuously running for nearly 13 years, has reached its lifetime and needs to be upgraded. In the past 13 years, this instrument has acted as a workhorse for a large number of biomedically important projects as supported by dozens of NIH grants, and thus has significantly contributed to the life science and regional economy. Here we request funds to upgrade the instrument by purchasing a new console equipped with a new state-of-the-art TCI cryoprobe. The upgrade is not only essential to allow the investigators to continue their research but also will enhance their capacity to carry out novel projects due to the new features in the upgraded instrument including substantially enhanced sensitivity, non-linear sampling, which dramatically reduce the NMR acquisition time by a factor of 2-5, and 19F detecting capability, which allows the direct characterization of 19F-labeled drugs and macromolecules in vitro and in cells. The projects of the investigators range from studies of unresolved mechanisms central to development, physiology, pharmacology. Translational components exist for many of the NIH-supported projects as exemplified by the development of inhibitors for inflammatory diseases, design of novel thermostable and long-lasting insulin analogs, understanding and manipulating cell signaling in carcinogenesis, and protein misfolding in Alzheimer's disease and prions. The upgraded instrument will also play a direct role in training students and fellows creating the critical mass of expertise in the region, thereby promoting the development of cutting edge biological research and associated high technology industry in the mid-west."
"9233275","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to identify medications, or combinations of medications, that may affect incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or alter the progression of ALS. In vitro efforts to exploring single compounds for efficacy in ALS therapeutics based on proposed biological mechanisms for the disease is a valuable and warranted approach, but it is inherently slow because of the need to test compounds one at a time. It also does not explore effects of combinations and it cannot test the role of these compounds in ALS incidence. Given the wide array of medications that older adults take, and the possibility that different combinations of medications may be relevant, we propose that a valuable parallel approach would be an epidemiological screening process to test whether any currently used medications are related to ALS incidence or survival. This would be akin to in vitro high throughput screening, but using novel statistical approaches to explore high dimensional ?big? epidemiological data (many people, many medications) for associations with ALS and ALS survival: specifically, boolean logic regression and random forests in a nested case-control and survival analysis framework. These approaches allow for efficiently exploring high-dimensional, likely correlated, data for associations between individual medications and different combinations of medications and an outcome, here ALS. In order to accomplish this, we propose to use two parallel very large data sets with prospectively and objectively collected pharmaceutical and health data: The Danish Registry System and the Clalit Health System in Israel, with a total of approximately 4,300 ALS cases and over 300,000 controls. By using the two data sets in different populations we will increase the probability of identifying causally related compounds by identifying those that screen positive in both populations. The results of this work have the possibility to identify currently used medications or combinations of these medications that can affect ALS and survival with ALS. Any positive results could open up new research avenues that include targeted clinical trials as well as potentially new directions for epidemiological studies and laboratory research into underlying mechanisms.  "
"9261173","Project Summary/Abstract Drugs of abuse are known to cause long-term changes in the synaptic plasticity of reward circuitry and, ultimately, persistent changes in behavior. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes is a key open question. As the reward circuitry and the learning and memory circuitry share key nodal points, new discoveries in the learning and memory field will have the potential to shed light on aspects of drug-seeking behavior. In particular, it is well established that gene expression is required for long- lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Very recently, studies demonstrated that epigenetic regulation of gene expression during memory consolidation can modulate gene expression dynamics, resulting in surprising effects on memory formation. For example, inhibition or deletion of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the nucleus accumbens leads to maintained expression of Nr4a2 (nuclear orphan receptor 2), correlating with cocaine-context associated memory formation. Nr4a2 is a transcription factor for tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter, defining enzymes of dopaminergic signaling. The medial habenula (MHb), a region that highly expresses both HDAC3 and NR4A2, and its projections have recently been identified as main targets of drugs of abuse. Recent work has shown that the MHb is implicated in both the acquisition and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Furthermore, my preliminary data has shown that the MHb is active during the reinstatement of cocaine- associated memories. Yet, the effects that drugs of abuse have on the circuitry of the MHb and the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate its gene expression remain largely unstudied. The experiments in this proposal will address the overall hypothesis that the MHb is necessary and sufficient for reinstatement of cocaine-context memory (Specific Aim 1 and 2) in an Nr4a2-dependent manner (Specific Aim 3)."
"9308599","Abstract Severe obesity is the fastest growing category of pediatric obesity, with a reported prevalence near 6% in the United States. Unfortunately, conventional treatment approaches rarely result in sufficient weight loss in adolescents with severe obesity; therefore, innovative and effective strategies are desperately needed. The financial incentive model has been used successfully in adult obesity trials to address suboptimal adherence to lifestyle modification therapy and improves weight loss outcomes. Although yet to be investigated as a weight loss intervention among adolescents, financial incentives have been shown to improve many health-related behaviors in teenagers. Owing to the refractory nature of pediatric severe obesity, financial incentives are more likely to be effective if used in concert with a structured dietary plan such as meal replacement therapy (liquid shakes and frozen entrées). In a recent trial, meal replacement therapy produced promising short-term weight loss in adolescents with severe obesity; however, initial weight lost by participants was regained after 4 months, owing to diminished adherence to the meal replacement regimen over time. Our concept is to capitalize on the synergy of meal replacement therapy and financial incentives to optimize weight loss and improve cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular health in teens with severe obesity. This study will afford a unique opportunity to address another key unanswered question related to the treatment of pediatric severe obesity: how much weight loss is necessary to elicit clinically-meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular health? Although evidence-based benchmarks have been established for adults, no such thresholds have been identified for youth with severe obesity. Therefore, we plan to conduct a 12-month randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of meal replacement therapy plus financial incentives on weight loss and cardiometabolic/vascular outcomes among 142 adolescents with severe obesity and to identify thresholds of weight loss required to achieve clinically-meaningful cardiometabolic/vascular improvements in this patient population. This research targets a significant public health problem, will utilize an innovative treatment concept and approach, and will generate new knowledge to guide selection of treatment type and intensification, ultimately exerting a powerful and sustained influence on the field of pediatric obesity."
"9332563","Project Summary Over the past half century there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of studies identifying cardioprotective agents, but relatively few have progressed to the clinics. There are probably several reasons for this lack of translational success: 1. That models identifying these potential cardioprotective mechanisms are based on acute experiments, not similar to chronic ischemia in patients; 2. many prior protective mechanisms cannot induce angiogenesis/arteriogenesis, which is required for patients with chronic myocardial ischemia and limited coronary blood flow; and 3. the data were derived solely from rodent models. The current application is based on the discovery of a novel cardioprotective agent, sFRP3, which was found in pigs with chronic preconditioning. Although relatively little is known about this gene in heart disease, it has been also found to be upregulated in patients with heart disease, which stimulated prior studies to conclude that sFRP3 exerted an adverse effect in heart failure, a conclusion diametrically opposed to our hypothesis and preliminary data. One of the major limitations to clinical translation of prior cardioprotective agents, is the inability to improve myocardial blood flow to the chronically ischemic heart by inducing angiogenesis/arteriogenesis. Our preliminary data indicate that sFRP3 induces both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, which makes it an important new mechanism designed for not only acute cardioprotection, but also protects against chronic myocardial ischemic disease and finally will be of use to protect other organs where compromised blood flow induces disease, e.g., peripheral arterial and cerebral vascular disease. We will study 2 major hypotheses: Hypothesis A: sFRP3, when overexpressed either by injection into the heart, or genetically, exerts an important protective effect on coronary vessels, by induction of angiogenesis/arteriogenesis. Hypothesis B: sFRP3 induced protection against acute coronary artery occlusion is mediated by novel signaling mechanisms rather than angiogenesis/arteriogenesis."
"9288644","SUMMARY Inflammatory diseases are often characterized by imbalanced ratios or functions of T effector (Teff), such as elevated Th2 and Th17 that promote asthma, and regulatory (Treg) cells, that suppress inflammation. While many such diseases can be controlled with corticosteroids, some, including severe asthma and multiple sclerosis, can show steroid (glucocorticoid; GC)-resistance and lead to increasingly negative outcomes, including death. Understanding factors that promote steroid- resistance, therefore, is critical to establish new approaches to treat GC-resistant inflammatory diseases. It is now clear that while Th2 cells are GC sensitive, steroid-resistant asthma is often characterized by the presence of IL17 producing cells, including Th17 CD4 T cells that can have intrinsic GC resistance. GC are well known to inhibit metabolism and we propose that the unique metabolism of Th17 cells contributes to their selective GC resistance. We have shown that T cell metabolism is dynamic and the Phosphatidylinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway induces Th17 CD4 T cells to increase glycolysis and metabolism of glutamine to glutamate for mitochondrial oxidation (glutaminolysis). Consistent with this metabolic program, we show allergen challenge increases both lactate and glutamate in bronchalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of asthmatics and that T cells from BAL of asthma patients express the glucose transporter Glut1 at high levels. Importantly, GC resistant Th17 cells have both higher levels of glucose metabolism and glutaminolysis than GC sensitive Th2 cells. Th17 cells also have higher mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ability to withstand mitochondrial inhibition than Th2 cells. In contrast, Treg use lipid oxidation and have high levels of active AMPK, which inhibits mTORC1. Further, we show Treg are functionally impaired by high rates of glycolysis. We also show that Th17 cells rely on Glutaminase (GLS) to support glutaminolysis and differentiation, and inhibition of GLS selectively impairs Th17 cells. Elevated levels of glucose and glutamine metabolism may directly protect Th17 cells from GC, as T cells with increased Glut1 were resistant to GC-induced reactive oxygen species and cell death. Here we will test the hypothesis that allergen-induced cytokines signal T cells to induce a flexible metabolism of glycolysis and glutaminolysis that promotes GC resistance in Th17 cells and impairs Treg. To test this hypothesis we will: (1) Determine T cell metabolic programs and regulatory signals in airway inflammation and (2) Test the contribution of T cell metabolism to GC resistance of Th17 cells. Together, these studies will address a poorly understood but potentially key contributor to the pathogenesis of GC-resistant inflammatory diseases, such as severe asthma, by establishing and targeting the unique metabolic program and requirements of Th17 cells."
"9461974","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Each year in Lafayette County, Arkansas, 16 of every 1,000 infants die before their first birthday;1 this infant mortality rate is greater than that of many second-world countries. Thirty-six percent of Arkansas residents live in rural areas, almost one in three children lives in poverty, and all counties are medically underserved.2 Arkansas is an IDeA state and is joined in these disparities by similarly rural states. Infants and children living in rural and medically underserved IDeA states are less likely than those living in urban states to be enrolled in and benefit from clinical research, especially clinical trials.3-5 To address this disparity in pediatric research, the Environmental Influences on Children Health Outcomes (ECHO) initiatives will establish the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) to increase representation of and access to clinical trials by children in underserved states with disproportionately low NIH funding. Up to 15 clinical sites located in IDeA states will be funded and supported by one Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC). As such, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) proposes to create the DCOC. Being an academic medical center with a robust clinical research portfolio and experience with conducting research in rural and underserved areas, the proposed team at UAMS is well positioned to serve as the DCOC. The key personnel work across the four ECHO priority areas and are prepared to help ISPCTN sites do the same. The DCOC will work collaboratively with ISPCTN clinical centers to build capability for and increase access to pediatric clinical research in IDeA states to increase generalizability of trial results. To establish the DCOC, UAMS will: ? Specific Aim 1: Establish a coordinating center infrastructure to support trials conducted by the  IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. The proposed DCOC will create a cost-effective  operations and data-coordinating infrastructure to support ISPCTN clinical trials. ? Specific Aim 2: Execute the operational tasks and scientific responsibilities of the DCOC as  required within the collaborative agreement. The DCOC will support the operations, logistics, data  management, and biostatistics needs of the ISPCTN. ? Specific Aim 3: Develop and implement relevant professional development programs to establish  highly competent pediatric clinical trial teams in IDeA states. The DCOC will leverage existing  infrastructure to provide professional development and mentoring.  The objective of the DCOC is to support the development and implementation of clinical research within the ISPCTN. The UAMS team will work collaboratively with clinical investigators at the ISPCTN sites, Project Scientists, Program Officials, and other NIGMS and NICHD staff to select or design, implement and oversee clinical trials addressing the ECHO priority areas and the health needs of children living in IDeA states."
"9242070","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this project is to increase the success rate and speed with which the results of basic biomedical research are translated into products that have a positive impact on human health. To do this, we propose to create a commercialization program at the University of Louisville (UofL) with a structure that is designed to overcome the many obstacles that currently impede translation. Though UofL is a relatively small institution in an IDeA state, it has invested in talent and infrastructure for translational research in order to create a pro-entrepreneurial culture. This has already paid dividends and UofL has been awarded numerous major grants, including three current COBRE awards, a Coulter Translational Partnership, the NIH Cardioprotection Consortium, the NIH-UofL RBL (a BSL-3 facility), and multiple P-/U- series grants. Moreover, UofL discoveries have led to interventions that have already benefited patients, such as a first-in- class anticancer drug, a method to prevent transplant rejection, and a protocol that has allowed paraplegic patients to stand again. Many more UofL innovations are now on their way to clinical trials, including new vaccines and minimally invasive devices to detect cancer. The proposed UofL REACH program will be known as the ExCITE Hub to reflect its function as a central resource for Expediting Commercialization, Innovation, Translation, and Entrepreneurship. The hub is designed to fulfill the goals of the FOA (RFA-OD- 14-005), but is tailored to match UofL's specific strengths and needs. In short, the university will supply a robust pipeline of diverse technologies and the infrastructure/expertise required for translational research, whereas the Hub will deliver the necessary funding, education, and access to business expertise to bridge the gap between a great idea and the marketplace. The ExCITE Hub has three major aims: (1) identify the most promising technologies and provide funding for product definition studies, (2) promote commercialization of selected products and transition to a self-sustaining ExCITE program, and (3) expand educational, experiential, and networking opportunities for stakeholders. Our approach includes innovative features: (1) a geographically focused program to expedite operations and maximize impact on the local eco-system, (2) an innovative governance structure to integrate the three main goals and avoid silos, (3) a proactive, rather than passive, approach to education, (4) a mentored technology development grant program that requires early interactions between scientists, tech transfer staff, and industry consultants, and (5) an emphasis on improving academia-industry relationships by increasing mutual understanding, ensuring robust technologies, and being responsive to industry needs. Institutional and regional commitment to the ExCITE Hub is evident from the >$3.1M in matching funds and 40 letters of support. Success in this project will have a major economic impact on the region and will speed the delivery of innovative new products to the patients that need them."
"9276442","Project Summary  We will continue our study of genes needed for neuronal differentiation and function using the six touch receptor neurons (TRNs) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Our previous research identified genes needed for the generation, specification, maintenance and function of the TRNs. In the last few years we 1) identified genes needed for the specification of neuronal subtypes; 2) discovered a new activity of transcription factors, including Hox proteins (as ?guarantors?) that maintains transcription factor expression by the restricting its stochastic expression; 3) examined the how the release of epigenetic inhibition affects the terminal differentiation of subtypes of motor neurons; 4) discovered several behaviors that modulate TRN touch sensitivity, including a previous unstudied type ? long-term sensitization ? and the mechanisms underlying these modulations; 5) identified a role for integrins and other focal adhesion proteins in neuronal mechanosensation; 6) discovered that the ?-tubulin acetyltransferase MEC-17 specifies the unusual, 15-protofilament structure of TRN microtubules; 7) discovered a new type of chaperone for the mechanosensory transduction channel; 8) determined the stoichiometry (MEC-42MEC-10) of the transduction channel; and 9) investigated the roles of the Wnt signaling pathway, Rac GTPases, and GEFs in process outgrowth. The general goal of the research going forward is to exploit these findings to understand how the differentiation of individual cell types is controlled and how mechanical inputs are sensed and modified. We plan to discover and characterize genes needed for TRN differentiation, specifically those needed for the differences among TRNs and TRN process outgrowth and ensheathment and to investigate touch sensitivity and its control by investigating newly identified lethal genes needed for touch sensitivity by testing and characterizing TRN-expressed genes for supersensitivity, and by studying the role of neuropeptides. The health relatedness of our work comes from the discovery of new genes and new interactions among genes that are similar in humans and other mammals."
"9274608","Abstract The application seeks funds to purchase a GE Typhoon FLA 9500 imager. The typhoon imagers are high performance laser scanners, ideally suited for quantifying nucleic acids, proteins, and other biomolecules. A multidisciplinary group of 7 users (5 with current NIH funding), as well as 10 minor users (6 with current NIH funding), currently depends on this imager for their research. An older GE Typhoon trio is jointly owned and maintained by the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at The Ohio State University. However, this aging instrument frequently breaks down, and will no longer be serviced by the manufacturer after the end of 2016, making it difficult, if not impossible to obtain replacement parts after this date. With its improved sensitivity, larger scanning areas, and additional lasers, the GE Typhoon FLA 9500 imager will enhance ongoing research and ensure that it can continue without interruption. Numerous NIH-funded research projects rely on use of the typhoon imager to investigate mechanisms of essential RNA processing and repair enzymes, Salmonella colonization resistance, processing of pre-tRNAs in the brain, DNA replication and repair by translesion synthesis, metal ion homeostasis, RNA-induced silencing, and RNA surveillance. Access to the proposed Typhoon FLA-9500 imager is essential for the success of this NIH-funded research."
"9277459","ABSTRACT Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical technique to measure chromophore concentrations in tissue including hemoglobin, myoglobin, water, lipid, and cytochrome C oxidase. Continuous wave (CW-) NIRS systems are widely used but are limited to the measurement of changes in chromophore concentrations and have low quantitative accuracy in reporting absolute concentrations due to the unknown pathlength factors related to the diffusion of light in tissue. Frequency-domain (FD-) NIRS is a variation of this method that uses amplitude modulated light and the measurement of the amplitude and phase of the light passing through tissue to provide more quantitative estimates of baseline optical properties. However, current FD-NIRS systems are limited to only a few optical wavelengths due to the cost and complexity of these modulation circuits. In this project, we propose to develop a novel hyperspectral FD-NIRS system, which uses a broadband white light source and CCD spectrometer detection system. The unique innovation of this system is the use of electro-optical modulators (EOMs), which will be used to directly modulate the light rather than relying on electrical modulation of laser diodes. Two devices will be used to enable heterodyne downshifting of these MHz signals for CCD detection. This approach will be a much simpler and more cost effective way to increase the number and range of wavelengths used by the system in comparison to previous versions of CW- and FD-NIRS systems. This device will improve the way in which NIRS is collected across a wide range of applications. The aims of this study are: Aim 1. Construct a hyperspectral FD-NIRS device and characterize sensitivity and noise properties of the instrument. Aim 2. Investigate the sensitivity and specificity of CW- and FD-NIRS measurements in simulated muscle tissue using Monte Carlo techniques to look at the effect of realistic muscle structure on photon migration. Aim 3. Characterize the sensitivity and specificity of the measurement of physiological compounds using the device in phantoms and compare with Monte Carlo simulation results. This proposed R03 study will develop this unique system and allow us to apply these advanced NIRS techniques in future studies of muscle physiology including injury risk assessment, the impact of aging and diabetes, among various other work."
"9251274","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The physiological effects of opiates, including drugs of abuse such as heroin or prescription opiate medications, are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Activation of opioid GPCRs results in feedback mechanisms in which receptor number and signaling activity is regulated through endocytosis and sorting at the endosome. The current model describes three sorting operations for opioid GPCRs at the endosome: degrade at the lysosome, reinsert at the cell surface ('recycling'), or hold at the endosome ('retention'). The importance of this process in regulation of opioid function is underscored by the observation that the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and the delta-opioid receptor DOR are sorted in diametrically opposed manners at the endosome: MOR recycles while DOR degrades. While the mechanisms and proteins involved in recycling and degradation of opioid receptors are becoming well understood, the role of the endosomal retention remains puzzling. The central paradox of endosomal retention comes from experimental data linking it to the sorting of DOR (which degrades) but also MOR (which recycles). These data raise the question of when and how endosomal retention occurs for opioid receptors in context of the general trafficking outcomes already described. Testing these questions has proven difficult, as for the last decade the only known component of the retention pathway was the protein GASP1 (GPCR-associated sorting protein 1), and its connection with the receptor is challenging to manipulate. An exciting recent development has been the identification of a new protein, named Beclin2, which forms a complex with GASP1 and is necessary for GASP1 function. Beclin2 is more amenable to experimental manipulation, opening the opportunity to directly test the role of endosomal retention in the regulation of opioid receptors. The hypothesis of this proposal, supported by preliminary data, is that the endosomal retention of opioid receptors functions as the initial sorting step for both the recycling and degrading pathways: Beclin2- GASP1 hold opioid GPCRs at endosomes until a handoff of the receptor mediates spatial separation and entry into the recycling or degrading pathways. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested using a combination of Determine the role of Beclin2 in sorting of defined manipulations (to the receptors and endosomal sorting machinery) with techniques including flow cytometry, microscopy, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry in primary neuronal cultures and non-neuronal recycling GPCRs; (2) Define the relative functional locations of Beclin2 and the endosomal recycling model cell lines. The specific aims of this proposal: (1) complex; (3) Establish the identity of the Beclin2 sorting complex. This proposal addresses opioid receptor regulation on the molecular level with the goal of better understanding the cellular response to opiate drug abuse and addiction."

"9223179","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The upper brainstem is necessary for conscious wakefulness, and lesions dividing this area from the forebrain result in deep coma. However, the neurons originating this ascending arousal system and their forebrain targets necessary for maintaining conscious wakefulness have never been identified. Currently, our ability to diagnose, prognosticate, and ultimately treat patients with disorders of consciousness is constrained by a lack of information regarding the precise location, genetic identity, and connections of these arousal-promoting neurons. We recently analyzed human brainstem lesions and identified an focal area in the upper brainstem that is injured specifically and commonly in patients presenting in coma. This coma-specific area is in the region of the parabrachial nucleus (PB), a site in which experimental lesions in rats produce deep coma. We also found that this coma-specific region exhibits strong and specific ?connectivity? with the frontoinsular cortex (FI) in resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) analysis in normal human subjects. In rodents, a subpopulation of PB neurons projects directly to a homologous cortical area (agranular insular cortex), so we hypothesized that PB neurons with direct projections to the frontoinsular cortex (PB-FI) are a core component of the ascending arousal system. To test this hypothesis, we will use connectivity-based mouse genetic tools, accessing PB-FI neurons by injecting AAV6 ?retro-Cre? into the insular cortex and then Cre-dependent vectors in PB. This approach allows us to selectively characterize and manipulate PB-FI neurons without altering the myriad other homeostatic functions mediated by other PB neurons. We will use this approach first to identify the full range of efferent projections of PB-FI neurons, searching for any axon collaterals to subcortical regions that may sustain arousal in parallel with FI. We will then use fiber photometry to measure the activity of PB-FI neurons from calcium transients in awake, behaving mice, and correlate their activity with concurrent behavioral state using continuous video-EEG. Finally, we will activate and ablate PB-FI neurons, testing our hypotheses that they produce wakefulness, and that their absence will result in coma or hypersomnolence. Information about their axon collaterals and activity patterns will enable optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of the fiber terminals of PB-FI neurons in target- and state-specific tests of the role of each projection of PB-FI neurons in maintaining a waking state. Ultimately, these experiments will shed much-needed light on a key, unanswered question in clinical neurology: which brainstem neurons and connections mediate basic, conscious wakefulness?"
"9295321","Project Summary/Abstract Racial differences in the utilization of therapeutic procedures in stroke patients are pervasive and contribute to worse outcomes in minorities compared to whites after stroke. Swallowing dysfunction immediately after stroke is common, but most patients recover adequate swallowing function within a few days or weeks. Percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes for enteral feeding are commonly placed for patients who are perceived unlikely to recover adequate swallowing function in a timely manner, but ideally are avoided as PEG placement is invasive, carries the risk of procedure-related complications, and has been associated with poor long-term outcomes. Clinical decision-making surrounding PEG placement lacks objective and standardized criteria, but is largely dependent on clinical swallowing evaluations by Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) providers, and use of ancillary radiographic swallow studies such as a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS). The PI?s preliminary data show that PEG tubes are overutilized in minorities compared to whites despite similar stroke severity, medical comorbidities, and incidence of swallowing dysfunction. The research proposed in the current application will investigate the potential mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG tube placement after stroke by thoroughly addressing the various care processes involved in evaluation of swallowing recovery and decision-making regarding PEG placement. The specific aims are (1) to investigate whether access to SLP services including frequency of bedside swallow evaluations and VFSS testing differs among black and white stroke patients, (2) to determine the presence of an unconscious (implicit) racial bias and its effect on PEG decision-making among SLP providers, and (3) to assess whether patient-SLP provider communication behavior during bedside swallow evaluations differs between race-concordant (white patient, white SLP provider), and race-discordant (black patient, white SLP provider) patient-SLP provider pairs. This project is proposed as part of a career development plan for the PI, a cerebrovascular neurologist, to obtain training in methodology related to the study of implicit bias, patient-provider communication, and advanced statistical methods. The training program and the mentoring team the PI has assembled will help to elucidate important mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG placement after stroke, position him to apply the newly acquired skill set to investigate implicit bias and patient-provider communication behavior as the underlying mechanisms of other disparities in stroke care, and allow him to develop strategies aimed at mitigating disparities in stroke care via future interventional studies as he transitions to become an independent clinical investigator."
"9228376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common class of childhood neuromotor disabilities, resulting in lifelong impairments in productivity and health as well as high costs. To date, no form of infant therapy has proven efficacious via an adequately powered RCT; further, usual and customary therapies often fail to produce clinically meaningful benefits. This revised application builds on new findings from 2 independent preliminary studies showing benefits for infants who received alternative forms of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). Using a multisite RCT design, 72 infants (6 - 18 mos old) with unilateral or asymmetrical CP will be randomly assigned to receive one of 3 manualized forms of multi-component therapies. Primary outcomes include objective assessments (at baseline then 1 wk, 6 mos, and 12 mos post-therapy) of affected upper extremity (UE) skills in unilateral and bilateral activities, as well as changes in brain lateralization based on a novel fNIRS protocol fo infants. The specific aims are: 1) to compare the effects of 3 promising forms of Infant-CIMT that are identical in dosage (3 hr/day X 21 days) and their key therapy elements (shaping, massed practice, home-based, embedded in play and everyday activities, provided by a trained therapist in partnership with parents) but that differ in their use of constraint - continuous casting, part-time splint, or no constraint; and 2) to assess stress levels and safety related to constraint condition (continuous or part-time) compared to no constraint. Stress will be assessed using multiple salivary cortisol samples from infants and parents, parent self-report, and observations. Safety monitoring will include range of motion, skin integrity, sensory awareness, functional use of the casted arm and hand, as well as changes in laterality scores involving the casted side. Even though prior studies affirm the general safety and acceptability of using constraint with infants, there are strongly competing hypotheses about its potential benefits versus risks. Impact: if one or more of the tested infant therapies produces large magnitude benefits lasting up to 12 mos later, then these findings would have a high impact on future clinical practice. Moreover, highly effective therapy very early in life may lead to much higher levels of independence, learning, social engagement, and quality of life for children with unilateral and asymmetrical CP."

Prior work has shown that most adult diseases begin in childhood and some begin during intrauterine exposure, making childhood the ideal time for intervention with the goal of improving health outcomes into adulthood.  Improving healthcare outcomes and wellness in children is contingent on expanding high quality clinical research to include more diverse populations. Pediatricians at the University of Louisville (UofL) with our Healthcare Partners serve a highly diverse patient population that includes the rural and urban poor, a unique Appalachian community, refugees and numerous ethnic minorities. In order to better serve this population, we propose to build upon our current programs, expand our bidirectional community engagement efforts, collaborate with other institutions on pediatric clinical trials through the IDeA Pediatric Trials Network, and collaborate with ECHO and CHEAR sites to advance healthcare for children.  The Kentucky-Pediatric IDeA Research Center (K-PIRC), as part of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trial Network, will make it possible for 1) underserved rural and urban infants, children and adolescents to participate in clinical research; 2) junior investigators to be trained in clinical research and community engagement, improve the health of both children and adults in Kentucky through this research, and develop their academic career; and 3) create a regional network of partners to sustain this clinical research initiative. The four primary focus areas of research are 1) upper and lower airway disease; 2) obesity; 3) pre-, peri- and postnatal outcomes; and 4) neurodevelopmental outcomes. These primary focus areas have a high prevalence in Kentucky therefore K-PIRC will enable strengthening current collaborations and accelerate the development of new networks within the state through bidirectional community engagement and feedback to support pediatric clinical research. Ultimately through these efforts the health outcomes of Kentucky children and adults will improve and a sustainable pediatric clinical research workforce locally and nationally will be established."
"9256403","Project 4: Neuroprotection and neuroinflammation induced by the complement proteins and receptors  In order to increase the successful identification of novel therapeutic targets for degenerative disorders  commonly seen in the elderiy, the interrelations between new discoveries in genetics (GWAS identified risk  association genes), cell biology (autophagy), immunology (inflammasomes) and neurobiology must be  delineated using a combination of experimental approaches. One rapidly emerging area is the link between  the immune system and cellular homeostasis in neurobiological systems, consistent with a role for the  immune system components in normal and pathological brain function. The complement system is a  powerful effector mechanism of the innate immune system that contributes to protection from infection and  resolution of injury. Complement component deposition has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD),  macular degeneration, Parkinson's disease and other age-related neurodegenerative disorders. While the  activation of the complement cascade may be detrimental in these diseases, C l q , the initiator molecule of  the classical complement pathway, has anti-inflammatory effects in the absence of the other components of  the complement system. Unexpectedly, it has become apparent that in the brain C l q synthesis is induced in  response to a variety of insults and injury initially in the absence of synthesis of other complement  components. In addition, our lab made the novel observation that in vitro C l q improves neuronal survival  under nutrient stressed conditions and suppresses amyloid beta-induced neuronal death suggesting that  C l q may have a neuroprotective role. This novel neuroprotection triggered by C l q was associated with  induction of expression of neuronal genes which if suppressed abrogated the C l q neuroprotective effects.  Here we will collaborate with other members of the Program Project to identify the mechanisms of this C l q  neuroprotection/survival, determine if this coordinates with a GWAS identified risk polymorphism in CRI, and  create new animal models to elucidate the significance of this pathway in in vivo models of  neurodegenerative diseases in aging populations. The molecular delineation of this novel pathway should  uncover a number of potential therapeutic targets which have not been explored which can then be  translated into innovative strategies (perhaps in combination with other therapeutic targets) in the clinic for  the enhancement of neuron survival to improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from  neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will identify key signaling pathways and molecular interactions that are required for a novel  neuroprotection mechanism discovered in our laboratory and determine if this pathway improves neuronal survival  in an animal model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In a complementary approach the biological basis of the AD risk  association of a polymorphism in an immune regulatory protein, CRI, will be determined. These results will  provide the first step in design of novel pharmacologic interventions for degenerative diseases in humans."
"9464651","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research are widely agreed to be a key strategy for improving the physical and economic health of the nation. Research on quality, safety and comparative effectiveness will provide the knowledge urgently needed to improve health outcomes and lower costs. A particular shortage of trained researchers in the areas of surgical, trauma, and urgent/emergency care quality, safety and comparative effectiveness research is made more pressing by the high impacts and costs of surgical and trauma care. None of the existing AHRQ-supported T32 programs specifically focus in these clinical domains. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed UC Davis Quality, Safety, And Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) T32 program, led by Joy Melnikow, MD, MPH, is to establish a multidisciplinary, postdoctoral training program in quality, safety, and comparative effectiveness research with a particular emphasis on training researchers from all relevant disciplines in surgical, trauma, and urgent/ emergency care quality and outcomes. Given UC Davis' extensive research training and academic infrastructure, QSCERT has the capacity to nurture such a cadre of researchers. QSCERT will admit three postdoctoral fellows (MD or PhD) per year to participate in a two-year training program (in special circumstances, scholars may be recruited for one year). The QSCERT curriculum includes the core requirements of didactic training, career development training, and mentored research experience, with the option to earn a Master in Public Health (MPH) or Master in Advanced Study (MAS) degree. For didactic training, an effective array of courses and career development workshops have been chosen from established training programs to form the core QSCERT curriculum, providing scholars with the core competencies and in depth knowledge required for successful careers in quality, safety and comparative effectiveness research. For mentored training, scholars will be matched to a primary faculty mentor and a multidisciplinary mentorship team drawn from institutional Centers (the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, Cancer Center, Center for Poverty Research, and the Institute of Population Health Improvement), the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, and Public Health Sciences, and the Betty Irene School of Nursing. As home to one of the National Center for Research Resources' (NCRR) vanguard Clinical and Translational Science Centers, UC Davis has a strong track record in developing and maintaining interdisciplinary research programs. Through the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, UC Davis has also built a prominent multidisciplinary research program in quality, safety, and CER, with a successful primary care faculty development program supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). We will leverage our experience and established infrastructure to create an interdisciplinary training program that will build our national capacity for research focused on improving health care outcomes for the American people."
"9252265","The mission of the Center for Environmental Exposure and Disease (CEED) is to improve human health by performing transdisciplinary research to elucidate how the total environment, the genome and the epigenome interact to mitigate the risk of disease. CEED research focuses on: 1) assessing and modeling exposures, 2) discovering and applying biological response indicators which link exposures to mechanisms of pathogenesis, 3) developing and implementing targeted prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies, 4) reducing exposures by influencing public policy, planning and regulation, and 5) engaging and informing stakeholders. By analogy with Precision Medicine, CEED envisions that the integration of data from exposure biology, genomics, epigenetics and microbiomics to assess exposures, biological responses, mechanisms of pathogenesis and disease prevention will significantly impact the future of environmental health. The CEED vision is to lead the development of precision environmental health research through the integration of clinical, basic, and population-based studies, using the acquired information to prevent and/or treat environmental disease. The strategy is to combine the Center's long-standing breadth and depth of expertise in environmental health research with new capabilities in exposure biology, epigenomics, and microbiomics.

Aim 4: Translate research findings to stakeholders in local, state and federal government agencies to provide guidance on mitigation of risk, to influence public policy, and to support legislation that reduces exposure and improve environmental health."
"9248861","CORE E: ABSTRACT This is a proposal to renew the Outreach, Recruitment, and Education Core (Ed Core) for the UCSF Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). The core supports the UCSF ADRC by ensuring a steady flow of participants with FTD-spectrum disorders, CJD, amnestic and non-amnestic AD, controls and Chinese- Americans into the Clinical Core, while providing an unparalleled educational environment for emerging researchers and early clinical trainees. The core will focus on four aims, which will continue the current efforts and extend them in the following ways. (1) For Education of Community Professionals, we will maintain outreach to Bay Area professionals with lecturing, organization of conferences, and continued contact with colleagues at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center (KPMC) in San Francisco. In addition, we will strengthen these efforts by expanding our outreach to KPMC, establishing a new relationship with the HOPE program in Marin County, and organizing a new series of recurring lectures in partnership with the Northern California Alzheimer's Association and other major Bay Area medical centers. (2) For Community Education, we will continue community lectures and maintain and update our web-based resources including our website, Facebook page, Twitter feed, and Blog. In addition, we will improve our website by creating a section on young-onset/non-amnestic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease. (3) For Outreach to Chinese Americans, we will continue our clinical consultation program in Chinatown and partnerships with community organizations to educate laypersons and health providers serving the Chinese American community about neurodegenerative disease. In addition, we will further facilitate the ability of Chinese Americans to participate in research by translating the new UDS neuropsychological battery into Chinese and making these materials available to all centers via NACC, and developing the EXAMINER-C as a frontal assessment battery for Chinese individuals by creating preliminary normative data. (4) For Research and Clinical Training at UCSF, we will maintain our fellowship training programs with a rich set of clinical and experimental resources and continue to welcome medical early clinical trainees to our month long behavioral neurology rotation. In addition, we will enrich and expand these experiences by establishing a new statistical seminar for our clinical research fellows and opening the neurobehavioral rotation to students and postdoctoral fellows in the UCSF Neuroscience program."
"9331881","PROJECT SUMMARY  Our broad, long term objective is to understand the molecular details of Fc? receptor (Fc?R) function, with the goal of improving monoclonal antibody therapy for cancer. The antitumor effects of antibody therapy are largely mediated by Fc?R, which become clustered and activated upon binding to the Fc portion of antibodies. Monocytes and macrophages are essential for antibody therapy to be effective, and Fc?R activation in these cells can lead to pleiotropic responses. These include phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), production of inflammatory cytokines, or a combination of these. Amongst these activities, the mechanisms by which monocytes / macrophages carry out ADCC remain the least understood.  We have recently found that Fc?R clustering can induce Granzyme B production by human monocytes and that ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 8 can significantly enhance this response, as well as induce Granzyme B themselves. Granzyme B is a serine protease expressed predominantly by natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells, and is required for their cytotoxic functions. Given the central role of Granzyme B in NK cell- mediated ADCC, our finding that monocytes can also produce Granzyme B is remarkable as it provides an as- yet undiscovered anti-tumor function of monoclonal antibodies. Most notably we have also found that nurse- like cells (NLCs) generated from CLL patient blood also produce Granzyme B following Fc?R activation and TLR8 ligand treatment, and they can engage in Granzyme-dependent ADCC of CLL cells. This latter observation is of particular interest, as NLCs typically promote CLL-cell survival and proliferation. We therefore hypothesize that Granzyme B production by monocytes and NLCs represents a critical aspect of the effector response to antibody-coated target cells. We propose to explore the significance of these findings specifically related to CLL immunotherapy in the following 3 specific aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanisms of Granzyme B induction by Fc?R in monocytes/macrophages and NLCs, 2) Determine the mechanism of augmentation of Fc?R-induced Granzyme B production by immune modulators and 3) Analyze the expression and function of Granzyme B by monocytes and monocyte-lineage cells in patient samples and mouse models of CLL.  Upon completion of this study we will have fully explored an entirely new mechanism of antibody-mediated destruction of tumors by monocytes/macrophages and NLCs. These mechanistic studies will significantly enhance our understanding of ADCC mediated by these cells, and will likely provide information that can lead to the further enhancement of antibody therapy."
"9256713","Abstract  Chronic inflammation is frequently noted as a major risk factor in the development of cancer. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a debilitating cancer marked by an expansion of malignant T cells in the skin and whose etiology remains unknown. CTCL patient tumor samples often show markers of inflammation such as elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-17 production. This observation implicates T helper 17 cells (Th17 cells), which require the transcription factor STAT3 for differentiation and which secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17, as the cells of origin for this disease. T cells isolated from CTCL patients show signs of chronic antigenic stimulation and lesion sites are often enriched for antigen presenting cells highlighting a potentially critical role for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in tumorigenesis. Given that Th17 cell differentiation in the skin has been recently shown to rely on exposure to specific bacterial species, bacterial antigens may be crucial mediators of this disease. The fact that antibiotic treatment given to CTCL patients to eliminate Staphylococcus aureus infections often leads to a noticeable clinical improvement further points to a potential role for bacteria in the genesis of this disease.  This project aims to determine the role of antigenic signaling and the contribution of the skin microbiome to CTCL pathogenesis. To accomplish this, we have generated a mouse model in which a hyperactive mutant STAT3 (STAT3C) is expressed specifically in T cells. These mice develop a lymphoproliferative disease with features highly reminiscent of CTCL including skin lesions and enrichment of IL-17 producing T cells in the skin. Our preliminary experiments show that crossing this mouse model onto a background lacking endogenous TCR signaling ameliorates disease progression. Further, preliminary results indicate that rederiving this line in germ-free conditions yields a similar delay of disease onset. The proposed experiments will investigate the precise role for antigenic signaling in this model and use gnotobiotic methods, informed by skin microbiome analysis of our model and CTCL patients, to identify the microbial species most important for disease initiation. In doing so, this study will potentially yield broad insights into the genesis of T cell malignancies and highlight novel therapeutic targets."
"9287852","SUMMARY  Overall treatment failure for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America is estimated at 24%. The  relationship between drug susceptibility of Leishmania and therapeutic response is uncertain for all forms of  human leishmaniasis. Methodological disparities and the multifactorial basis of the outcome of treatment  confound attempts to correlate drug susceptibility with clinical response and impede the use of drug  susceptibility in treatment policy or decisions for control and management of leishmaniasis. Comprehensive  analysis of bacterial and fungal susceptibility to diverse antimicrobial drugs and the predictive utility of  susceptibility testing for therapeutic outcome has shown that host factors influence the correlation with  outcome of treatment. Nevertheless, overall experience in the analyses of antimicrobial drug susceptibility has  consistently shown that therapeutic response is significantly lower among individuals infected with resistant  organisms in a relation referred to as the ?90-60 rule?. We will apply the lessons and principles of antibacterial  and antifungal susceptibility assessment, to determine the relationship of parasite susceptibility to anti-  leishmanial drugs with the clinical and parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment and identify  parasite factors defining this relationship. To achieve this goal three specific aims will be pursued:   1. Define the relationship between in vitro and ex vivo drug susceptibility phenotype of clinical strains and   the clinical and parasitological response to treatment in CL patients,   2. Determine the reciprocal effect of drug susceptibility phenotype on activation of innate   immune/inflammatory responses and its relationship with outcome of treatment, and   3. Identify genetic markers of Leishmania associated with drug susceptibility phenotype and therapeutic  outcome  We will strategically exploit an extensive collection of Leishmania strains and corresponding clinical data base  available from patients who have participated in previously concluded randomized clinical trials, and patients  prospectively identified in Project 1 through active case detection. Susceptibility of these clinical strains to  pharmacologically relevant concentrations of meglumine antimoniate and miltefosine will be determined in  novel in vitro and ex vivo analytical systems that approximate the in vivo cellular environment and confounders  of clinical response will be controlled in evaluating the relationship with treatment outcome. Genetic markers  and underlying mechanisms of therapeutic outcome will be identified by SNP profiling from genome-wide  transcriptomes of drug-susceptible and resistant Leishmania from therapeutically responsive and non-  responsive CL. Results of this project will establish the contribution of drug resistance in treatment failure,  guide optimization of current treatment, development of more effective treatments, and inform treatment policy."
"9259978","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          The theme begins with a unique and defining strength of the Harvard-NIEHS Center for Environmental Health, the investigators' unmatched portfolio of population and patient studies of environmental exposures and their health effects. These studies of the real-world environmental exposures of human subjects ensure that Center research readily translates into public health policy and clinical practice. These population-based investigations combine with mechanistic laboratory studies to illuminate the pathways by which environmental exposures cause health effects. The Center makes this partnership a productive two-way street: Data from populations inform and guide studies of pathways in animal and cell culture models.  In turn, the evidence from pathway studies is used to improve or develop new population studies of exposures and health effects. Together their Populations to Pathways research provides both estimates of human population risk as well as adding to the understanding of mechanistic pathways of environmental health effects. The investigations of populations and pathways in turn inform public health policy and clinical practice.            To facilitate interactions the Center is organized around three Research Cores representing major cross-cutting environmental health exposures: Metals, Organic Chemicals, and Particulates.  Each of the Research Cores has track record of productivity, potential for continued growth, and the ability to integrate and catalyze leadership in the future. Each Research Core is multidisciplinary and deploys the full range of our intellectual resources. These Research Cores have been highly effective in promoting integration and collaborations through seminars and symposium, invited speakers, working groups, and pilot projects. Each of the three Research Cores features toxicology, basic mechanisms, in vitro models, animal models, gene- environment interactions, epidemiology, risk analysis, risk communication and connects to the Community Outreach and Education Core.  Each includes exposure assessment as well as health outcomes in both animal models and human populations. Moreover, each represents an area of considerable activity and accomplishment as well as a compelling list of unsolved concerns. By using the Center mechanism to increase integration, each Research Core is composed of individuals not only from a variety of disciplines, but also from a range of academic programs and departments throughout Harvard and at neighboring institutions.            The Community Outreach and Education Core (COEC) provides a community context for the research and integrated health sciences occurring within the Center and supports the Center's goal to translate its research into public health policy and clinical practice, and serves as a conduit for the community and stakeholders to interact with and provide guidance to the Center in defining research priorities and opportunities."
"9295463","ABSTRACT  The aim of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award application is to obtain training and conduct research in spatial sciences and molecular genetics at the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (USC). The proposed projects will facilitate the PI?s transition to an independent researcher in health and aging with emphases in environments and genetics. The PI is a developmental health psychologist and has received rigorous training in multidisciplinary approaches to the social sciences. The proposed training will add substantially to the PI?s skills in neighborhoods and health and genetic research.  Environments with a greater degree of crime, disorder, and decay may be a situation of chronic stress, with exposure to such environments potentially resulting in poor health. The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in its aims to methodologically advance understanding of relations between neighborhoods and health, investigate affective and physiological pathways explaining this link, and examine age and genetic moderation of this link. Through age-related declines in physical functioning and reduced mobility, older adults may be particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors. Older age is one of the largest risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, and the proposed research will examine cardiometabolic health in the context of multiple indices of environmental stressors. Additionally, genetic markers have been identified that are posited to partially explain individual differences in stress sensitivity and cardiometabolic diseases. Findings from the proposed research have the potential to inform policy and community-planning efforts.  The proposed research will use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-based sample of people 50 years and older, and a NIH-funded Contextual Data Resource. HRS participants provide blood and saliva samples for an analysis of physiological well-being and genetic information and respond to questions about their neighborhoods and their health. The Contextual Data Resource that will be used in the proposed research contains information on psychosocial and physical environmental stressors. Generalized linear models will be used to examine individual-level data (participant neighborhood perceptions) and multi- level models will be used for neighborhood-level data (neighborhood SES, crime, disorder and decay).  USC is an ideal location for conducting the proposed training, as there are ample intellectual, material, and structural resources available for researchers in aging, molecular genetics, neighborhoods and health, and psychophysiology. Funding for the R00 research projects will provide the necessary resources for the PI to develop data and expertise to launch an independent research career as well as an R01 proposal examining additional environmental stressors and cognitive and physical frailty among older adults."
"9289675","Project Summary/ Abstract Periosteal bone growth and modeling take place in the periosteum at the outer surface of cortical bones. The perioseum, which covers the entire bone surface except the portion of bones that contains articular cartilage, is one of the most osteogenic tissues in the body and plays a critical role in cortical expansion during growth. Periosteal bone formation has different mechanisms from other areas of bone surface such as endosteum, secondary spongiosa and trabecular bone remodeling, etc. Despite its physiological significance, the periosteum is often overlooked when it comes to processes that occur in the underlying cortical bone. Periosteal biology remains little investigated and poorly understood. Structurally, the periosteum is composed of two layers; adjacent to the periosteal bone surface is a layer of loosely packed cells essential for growth and repair of the underlying bone. Further outward is a layer of densely packed periosteum derived stem cells (PDSCs) interspersed with lymphatics, blood vessels and nerve endings. The microenvironment of the outer layer serves as a niche to maintain the PDSCs whilst the inner layer provides an osteogenic microenvironment for periosteal bone formation. We have shown that there are no osteal macrophages and Trap+ mononuclear cells in CSF-1 op/op mice (CSF-1-/-), and interestingly, no obvious cortical bone formation. A single injection of rhM-CSF is sufficient for rescue of osteoclast recruitment and survival in CSF-1-/- mice. These results suggest that periosteal macrophages are essential in maintenance of periosteum microenvironment for periosteal bone formation. Moreover, we have shown that Trap+ mononuclear cells derived from wild WT mice secrete PDGF-BB to induce migration of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. Knockout of PDGF-BB in the Trap+ cell lineage reduces periosteal angiogenesis and bone formation but PDSCs and matrix proteins are still present in the periosteum, suggesting periosteal macrophages play more important role in maintenance of periosteum homeostasis. In addition, we have found mechanical stress induces periosteal TRAP+ mononuclear cells to secrete PDGF-BB for angiogenesis and bone formation in our preliminary data. Thus, we hypothesize that periosteal macrophages maintain homeostasis of the periosteum and TRAP+ mononuclear cells recruit PDSCs from outward layer to the periosteal surface for angiogenesis and bone formation. In this proposal, we will first determine the role of periosteal macrophages in periosteum homeostasis. We will then determine the function of Trap+ mononuclear cells, specifically, the mechanisms by which PDSCs are recruited by Trap+ mononuclear cells for periosteal bone formation. Finally, we will validate the role of TRAP+ mononuclear cells in mechanical stress-induced periosteal bone formation."
"9255203","PROJECT SUMMARY Immunopharmacotherapeutics, also called addiction vaccines, represent an emerging treatment strategy for the treatment of nicotine dependence. These addiction vaccines induce the production of antibodies that bind to nicotine molecules and sequester them in the periphery in order to mitigate their rewarding effects. While several phase II and III clinical trials have been conducted with nicotine vaccines, none of the studied injectable preparations have resulted in improved rates of smoking cessation across all patients. However, further inspection of the data has presented cause for optimism. While none of the tested vaccines induced a robust immune response in all treated subjects, those patients who were able to mount the most robust immune responses were found to have a higher chance of successfully quitting. These observations indicate that while the principles behind the use of nicotine vaccines are valid, improved administration tactics are needed to improve the overall efficacy and dosing flexibility of nicotine vaccination strategies. Thus, we aim to generate a nicotine vaccine that is suitable for pulmonary administration using liposome-conjugated haptens. With this formulation in hand, the ability of this pulmonary nicotine vaccine to generate a soluble IgA-biased immune response and decrease nicotine delivery to the brain will be measured. Next, a model of nicotine dependence arising from chronic intermittent exposure to nicotine vapor will be used to measure the ability of this liposomal vaccine to diminish symptoms and place aversion due to nicotine withdrawal. Finally, the anatomical distribution of the liposomal particles in mouse lungs will be assessed ex vivo following aerosolization using a radiolabelled tracer. Overall, it is hypothesized that pulmonary administration of a liposomal vaccine will lead to vigorous immune and behavioural responses, and that this formulation will be suitable for aerosol administration. Successful demonstration of these characteristics would provide a proof-of-principle that pulmonary delivery of nicotine vaccines could enable the application of individualized dosing regimens via repeated aerosol self- administration. If provided alongside nebulized nicotine, such a mechanism of vaccine dosing could potentially even arise naturally, using biofeedback from continued nicotine use. This would represent a significant breakthrough for the field by removing inter-individual variability as an obstacle to the achievement of population-wide efficacy for smoking cessation."
"9291506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Randomized controlled trials suggest that ADHD medication has beneficial short-term effects. The increasing use of ADHD medications is being heavily debated, however, because of concerns regarding the short- and long-term effects of ADHD medications. The overall objective for this proposal is to more precisely estimate the magnitude of the short- and long-term risks and benefits of ADHD medications on serious psychiatric (substance abuse, suicidal behavior, mania/bipolar disorder, and major depression) and neurological (seizures/epilepsy) outcomes by conducting advanced pharmaco-epidemiologic analyses in two large datasets that include prospective longitudinal information on prescribed ADHD medications and medical problems. We will use a Swedish cohort of 75,000 patients with a diagnosis of ADHD based on national registers. And, we will conduct analyses on a large US sample based on insurance claims, including 2.3 million patients with ADHD. The analyses in both datasets will use the same analytical approaches, including within-individual comparisons and advanced statistical techniques to account for stable and time-varying confounding. Our central hypothesis is that ADHD medication will be associated with reduced psychiatric and neurological problems and that risk for adverse outcomes (e.g., short-term seizures and long-term substance use problems) will be minor, especially when we compare the relations within individuals. The first aim is to examine the short-term effects of ADHD medications on these problems. The second aim is to examine the long-term effects of ADHD medications on these problems. The rationale for the proposed research is that rigorous pharmaco-epidemiologic studies-employing advanced designs and statistical analyses with large, population samples-can more precisely characterize the risks and benefits of ADHD medication. The significance of the proposed research is that the results will more precisely identify the specific risks and benefits associated with ADHD medication, which previous studies have been unable to adequately explore. The proposed analyses, which are based on the two large datasets, also will explore the generalizability of the findings across different national, cultural, and medical contexts. These efforts would directly inform medical practice and influence subsequent research in numerous fields, such as pharmaco-epidemiology and randomized controlled trials. The proposed research is innovative because the research team will analyze two datasets (in Sweden and the United States); combine within-individual comparisons with sophisticated analytical strategies to rule out confounding factors; and bring together a team of international researchers with expertise in the etiology and treatment of ADHD, pharmaco-epidemiology, quasi-experimental designs, and analyses of both datasets. We propose, therefore, to conduct the most comprehensive study of serious psychiatric and neurologic problems associated with ADHD medication to date."
"9287853","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic throughout the Amercias with an average 60,000 new cases reported  annually. Colombia reports one of the highest numbers of cases in the region, second only to Brazil. The  absence of a vaccine and the unsustainable vector control strategies translate into control measures based  solely on case detection and treatment. The high frequency of therapeutic failure to first and second line  antileishmanial drugs challenges these control measures. It is recognized that the outcome of antileishmanial  treatment is multifactorial. However, the mechanisms that drive therapeutic cure or failure, and the host and  parasite determinants of these divergent responses are only partially understood. In this project we will explore  the participation of innate immune responses in the outcome of treatment of patients with cutaneous  leishmaniasis caused by L. Viannia, and will seek to identify predictive and prognostic signatures of therapeutic  responsiveness. To achieve this, we will characterize the magnitude, dynamics and regulation of innate  inflammatory responses to explore complex non-linear interactions and to determine predictors of therapeutic  outcome. This will be carried out by integrating access to affected populations with well characterized  therapeutic responses, state-of-the-art transcriptomic profiling of primary innate cells and lesion biopsies from  prospectively enrolled patients, functional characterization of TH17 responses in innate cell recruitment and  activation, and statistical and machine learning analytics. We will challenge the dogma that parasite elimination  is the central determinant of successful antileishmanial therapy and hypothesize that sustained recruitment and  activation of innate immune cells to cutaneous lesions, driven respectively by pathogenic TH17 responses and  TLR signaling and inflammasome activation, is a leading factor of treatment failure in CL patients. This will be  achieved through the following aims:  Aim 1) To determine the relationship of the innate immune response and inflammatory signaling to the  clinical outcome of antileishmanial drug treatment  Aim 2) To investigate the role of pathogenic and non-pathogenic TH17 subpopulations in activation and  recruitment of innate cells to the lesion and in treatment outcome  Aim 3) To construct classification and prediction models of therapeutic outcome.  Understanding the role of innate immunity in the outcome of treatment will enable identification of host-specific  predictive and prognostic signatures of the therapeutic response, and the rational selection of host-targeted  therapeutics that redirect inflammation and revert pathogenicity."
"9411382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current established evidence-based treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are incompletely effective and not universally acceptable, and appear to wane in effect over time despite significant immediate benefit e.g., FDA-approved medication, which shows large acute benefit, leaves a third of children only partially treated even when combined with behavioral treatment, and has not been demonstrated effective beyond 2 years. Additional treatments are needed that are effective with persisting benefit, preferably related to a biomarker predicting treatment response. A good candidate is electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback, called neurofeedback (NF). It is based on 1) observations that patients with ADHD often have excessive theta band (4-8 Hz) quantitative EEG power, low beta band (13-21 Hz) power, and excessive theta- beta ratio (TBR), and 2) theoretical application of operant conditioning to correct this EEG imbalance. Meta- analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials found a large benefit for inattentive symptoms and medium benefit for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Unfortunately, none of these were blinded. Three of 4 small blinded studies found no advantage for NF over sham, but used suboptimal NF, leaving the situation inconclusive. Because of the expense and time required by NF, there is a public health need to determine whether it has a specific effect beyond the obvious nonspecific benefit of doing a focused activity several times a week with a friendly, encouraging adult who reinforces for attending to the task. Experts in NF, ADHD, clinical trials, statistics, ad data management have joined to design a double-blind sham-controlled randomized clinical trial to answer several pressing scientific and clinical questions in a way that will be credible to all.At each of 2 sites (1 university & 1 NF clinic) 70 children (total N=140) age 7 through 10 with rigorously diagnosed moderate to severe ADHD and TBR>5 will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to active TBR downtraining by NF vs. a sham training of equal duration, intensity, and appearance. To keep both participants and study staff blind, the sham will utilize pre-recorded EEGs with the participant's artifacts superimposed. The sham will be programmed into the equipment via internet by an off-site statistician-guided person who has no contact with participants. Treatment fidelity will be trained and monitored by 2 acknowledged NF leaders in a manner that protects blinding. Multi-domain assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, treatment end, and follow-ups at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years will include parent and teacher ratings of symptoms & impairment, neuropsychological tests, clinician ratings, and quantitative EEG as well as tests of blinding and of sham inertness. Hypotheses include that NF will improve parent- and teacher-rated inattentive symptoms (primary outcome) and other outcomes more than sham, that benefit will persist for 2 years after training, that initial TBR will moderate treatment response, and tha change in TBR will mediate response. Research Domain Criteria and EEG brain changes will be explored, including relationship of TBR to clinical symptoms, executive-function impairment, and sleep."
"9462546","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health epidemic that exacts an enormous financial toll on the health care system and a devastating health burden on affected patients by markedly increasing their risk of end- stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease and premature death. Novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to prevent complications of established CKD, and novel diagnostic strategies are needed to support the primary prevention of CKD itself in at-risk individuals. During the first period of support under this award, we reported in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study that an elevated level of the phosphate regulating hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), may be the earliest detectable abnormality of disordered mineral metabolism in CKD. We further demonstrated that elevated FGF23 is an independent risk factor for ESRD in patients suffering from CKD stages 2-3, and a potent risk factor for mortality across the spectrum of CKD: from stages 2-4 to incident hemodialysis patients and even kidney transplant recipients. Although these data established elevated FGF23 as a powerful biomarker of adverse clinical outcomes in CKD, we recently reported that elevated FGF23 is likely a mechanism of disease that contributes directly to the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a common manifestation of cardiovascular disease in CKD and a leading risk factor for major cardiovascular events and death. In this renewal application, we will expand our productive, multidisciplinary program of FGF23 research into critical new areas. In Aim 1, we will extend our ongoing work in CRIC by performing the first longitudinal study with annual repeated measures of FGF23 and mineral metabolites that will allow us to define the evolution of disordered mineral metabolism over time in CKD and its association with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on CRIC's completed genome-wide association study and its rich phenotype data to perform efficient genetic discovery studies that investigate the genetic basis underlying known racial differences in mineral metabolism. We anticipate these studies will suggest novel therapeutic targets for the future. In Aim 3, we will test whether an elevated FGF23 is an independent risk factor for incident CKD in an ancillary study to the ACCORD Trial of type 2 diabetes. If elevated FGF23 is an independent risk factor for incident CKD, it could serve as a novel diagnostic to support primary prevention of CKD. Preliminary data support our hypotheses, and our research team has the requisite expertise in FGF23, observational cohorts and population genetics to successfully complete these Aims. In addition, this project will continue to be a fertile training ground for nephrology trainees, including several recipients of K23 awards and a Minority Supplement mentored by the PI. Ultimately, the innovative studies we propose will provide insight that will help us realize our long-term goal: to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies to improve the dismal clinical outcomes experienced by patients with CKD."
"9263320","The Mapping Core will provide complete support for all geospatial aspects of the Myanmar Regional ICEMR's mission, including geospatial and remote sensing data collection, mapping of the study sites at multiple spatial scales (e.g. village and regional level), geostatistical analysis of clinical, genetic, entomological, environmental, and sociodemographic variables. The Core will develop a state-of-the-art, online sharing platform for the project team to use and share their mapping and analyses results for all study site locations in Myanmar, China, and Bangladesh. The Mapping Core will direct and manage the extensive geospatial data collection efforts for all three countries where the ICEMR is operational in order to support the mapping and analyses planned for this project. Where possible, the Mapping Core will use open source data sources for its geospatial data. The data collection will include data on geographic features, sociodemographic data, land use/land cover data, environmental data, and an archive of existing satellite-based image datasets required for the development of custom datasets in support of research investigations for all of the proposed ICEMR research projects. The Mapping Core will provide full support for geostatistical analyses including spatial cluster and hotspot mapping, spatial interpolation, spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression. Mobility modeling proposed as part of the ICEMR research will utilize spatial network and trajectory analyses. Using the latest software tools for online web mapping and sharing map layers, all project maps and results of geospatial and remote sensing analyses will be shared online through a public and private-facing website where researchers can easily find, review, and download maps and data in a variety of open formats. Results from all spatial data analyses for the three research projects will be shared in this single site and integrated to create a state-of-the- art malaria risk decision support system that combines clinical findings with environmental, remote sensing, mobility, vector, and parasite modeling research outcomes. Mapping Core activities will be undertaken by a collaborating team in Myanmar, China, Bangladesh and the U.S. We will train a new generation of geospatial experts from the ICEMR in-country partner institutions who will work together to develop a comprehensive and novel online web site dedicated to mapping malaria transmission and risk. The site will initially be served from the University of Maryland, however in-country ICEMR geospatial specialists will be trained in web mapping and learn how to independently add their own geospatial results, and develop their own decision support tools as part of the ongoing projects, such that by the end of the project, this will be managed entirely by in-country geospatial teams."
"9277537","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Red blood cell (RBC) utilization is decreasing markedly in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom as a result of blood conservation programs. To date, the safety of these strategies is supported by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of liberal and restrictive transfusion strategies in specific patient populations and by our own observational mortality data from a large community hospital setting. However, more recent RCTs have highlighted that the potential risks and benefits of restrictive transfusion strategies may differ according to the patient population studied. Decreased hospital acquired infections, increased myocardial injury, and an effect on mortality have been identified in specific transfusion RCTs. Validating these findings in general clinical practice and identifying which patient subgroups are at highest risk of adverse events will inform national transfusion guidelines and help promote best practices. In parallel, recent biological and epidemiological studies have highlighted the potential impact on recipient outcomes of blood donor factors such as age and gender. Preliminary findings from our linked donor, component, and transfusion recipient analysis show donor age and sex effects on recipient mortality, and support a larger, well controlled analysis of donor factors.  The Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) hospital system transfusion cohort will include granular data from electronic medical records of more than 100,000 transfused patients at 21 hospitals from 2010-2016 as well as linked donor demographic data from Blood Systems Research Institute. Using innovative statistical techniques to control for confounding and indication bias, we propose to examine the following Specific Aims: 1) Controlling for patient factors and hemoglobin levels, we will determine how blood conservation has impacted the incidence of 3 adverse outcomes (hospital acquired infection, myocardial injury, and mortality) among transfused hospitalized patients. We hypothesize that restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies will not impact mortality but will be associated with decreased incidence of infection and increased rates of myocardial injury in specific populations. 2) Controlling for recipient characteristics, blood processing methods, and storage duration, we will determine whether donor factors (age and sex) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in transfused hospitalized patients. We hypothesize that blood from younger and male donors will be associated with decreased organ failure, incidence of infection, hospital length of stay, and mortality in transfused hospitalized patients. Results from this project utilizing comparative effectiveness methods may impact clinical care in tailoring RBC transfusion guidelines for specific patient conditions and can inform planning for future randomized clinical trials. In addition, they may generate hypotheses for basic science research of donor factors that impact the safety and efficacy of RBC transfusion."
"9217934","Project Summary/Abstract The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however only a moderate number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have been identified. Advances have come largely from the study of rare genetic variants, especially de novo varia- tion, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), insertion/deletions (indels), copy number variation (CNV), and larger chromosomal imbalances. A portion of the progress for ASD has come through the efforts of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), which represents a coordinated effort by more than 40 independent groups to rapidly identify ASD risk genes. Here we propose to continue the work of the ASC, largely by continued pro- duction and analysis of sequence data from ASD subjects and their families. The ASC benefits from substan- tial leveraging of resources, including the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) centered at the Broad Insti- tute (BI) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of ASC samples, supported by an NHGRI Center Grant to BI, to make this renewal as low cost as possible. We also plan new avenues of research, such as integrating whole genome sequence (WGS) data and building on ideas that have emerged from the study of common variants to understand the interplay of common and rare variants to impact risk. Through this new research we will accel- erate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Moreover, such variants have direct implications for patients and their families in terms of etiological diagnosis, genetic counseling and pa- tient care. Our central hypothesis ? formulated based on results over the past decade ? is that rare and com- mon variation contributes additively to risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific Aims: 1) Produce and/or analyze WES of 30,000 new ASD subjects, parents and other controls, for a total of more than 50,000 samples; 2) Develop and apply approaches to find ?hidden? risk variants, and, 3) Use results from common and rare variant studies to describe the interplay of such variation in ASD risk. This contribution is significant because it represents the first step in research to understand pathogenesis of ASD and to the development of pharmacological strategies for treat- ment of core symptoms of ASD and etiologically related neurodevelopmental disorders. The research pro- posed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identify- ing risk variants and for integrating rare and common variation. This is a new and substantively different ap- proach to gene discovery in ASD that departs significantly from the status quo and provides the means to achieve these important goals."
"9338028","This project will (i) develop new statistical methods of estimation and hypothesis testing for network- generated observational data that will significantly expand the range of applications and (ii) make those methods available to empirical researchers by implementing them in user-friendly, computationally efficient, large-data capable commands in the widely used statistical software Stata.  Applications of network analysis are of growing importance and range over a wide variety of disciplines, including the social sciences, the behavioral sciences, the humanities, and the health sciences. In these fields, spatial networks and, increasingly, social networks have received special attention, aided by the increasing availability of datasets that provide spatial information or information on social networks. For example, the National Cancer Institute's GIS Portal provides interactive mapping and visualization of cancer-related geo-spatial data, and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) provide data on peers. Many datasets such as those listed above provide longitudinal information, outcomes on several variables are often determined simultaneously, and networks are often formed endogenously. In the proposal, we illustrate this with two examples in the area of health. The first example relates to peer effects on different exercise activities by individuals. An understanding of such peer effects is important in light of recent research on the connection between exercise and the reduced risk for cognitive impairments. The second example relates to the supply and demand for nursing home beds. Estimation methods developed under the assumption of exogenous network formation are generally inconsistent if the actual network formation is endogenous. Consequently, it is important to develop estimation methodologies for network-generated data that remain consistent under endogenous network formation. Until recently, a crucial obstacle toward developing such methodologies was a lack of appropriate limit theorems. However, Kuersteiner and Prucha (2013, 2015) introduced fairly general limit theorems that can be exploited to develop inference methods for endogenous networks from longitudinal data.  The aims of the proposed research are as follows: 1. Define and formally derive the statistical proper- ties of generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimation methods for simultaneous-equation models for longitudinal data, allowing for endogenous network formation. 2. Define and formally derive the statistical properties of robust tests for network dependence, allowing for endogenous network formation. 3. Define impact measures and derive their statistical properties, to provide a better interpretation of estimation results. 4. Implement and provide access to these methodologies in Stata."
"9333688","Abstract  Excessive alcohol consumption, the defining characteristic of an alcohol use disorder (AUD), damages the nervous system, producing the cognitive impairments observed in those afflicted with an AUD. Preclinical and clinical evidence from our lab and others suggest that microglia play a key role in alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Various types of microglia have been categorized based on their function: classically activated (M1) proinflammatory microglia and alternatively activated (M2) growth-promoting microglia. However, the mechanisms responsible for alcohol activating microglia and polarizing them to either phenotype are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small noncoding RNA molecules that play an important role in the regulation of microglia polarization. Although miRNAs act mainly in a cell- autonomous manner, accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs can be packaged into exosomes for intercellular signaling. Exosomes are small, 50-150 nm vesicles that are secreted into the extracellular space, fuse to neighboring cells, and release their contents (proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs), thus serving as a novel intercellular genetic regulatory mechanism. Many cells in the nervous systems have the capacity to release exosomes, including neurons. Our preliminary data demonstrated that neuronal exosomes contain miRNAs that can alter microglia activation. Therefore, we hypothesize that miRNA-containing exosomes derived from alcohol-treated neurons transport messages, namely miRNA, to microglia and modulate their activation and function, and thus potentially contribute to neuroinflammation in AUDs. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify the miRNA elements that regulate microglia activation and function in alcohol-treated neuronal exosomes. Aim 2. Determine the role of brain exosomes derived from 4-day binge alcohol-exposed rat brains in mediating brain inflammation and microglia activation. This proposal is novel in exploring the role of exosomes in cellular communication between neurons and microglia in AUDs. This unique and novel regulatory mechanism in neuron-to-microglia communication will provide new insight into miRNA- mediated microglia activation in pathological conditions such as AUDs."
"9274478","Project Summary/Abstract This application requests funds to purchase a Bruker 600 MHz NMR system with cryoprobe and sample changer, with additional funds to be matched by The Scripps Research Institute/Scripps Florida, that will significantly enhance the ability of NIH-funded investigators at Scripps Florida to perform outstanding research in the areas of biomolecular, natural product, and small molecule NMR. Scripps Florida has leveraged its excellence in research at the interface of chemistry and biology to initiate numerous basic research as well as translational projects, many funded by the NIH. Since the establishment of Scripps Florida in 2005, the Scripps Florida NMR core facility has been a crucial component of basic and translational research for numerous NIH funded projects. The NMR core facility initially focused on servicing small molecule NMR needs with two low- field NMR spectrometers. Later, with the acquisition of a high-field NMR spectrometer, there has been an expansion into biomolecular NMR studies and other dilute samples requiring high sensitivity measurements. The large growth of NIH-funded research at Scripps Florida in the past 10 years has maxed out the capacity of our current NMR capabilities. The areas most in need include NMR samples requiring high field on biomolecular samples (proteins and nucleic acids; high sensitivity on dilute small molecule samples, such as natural products; and higher sensitivity and thus throughput for more demanding analysis of small molecules relative to our aging lower-field NMR instruments. Attaining this new, modern Bruker 600 MHz NMR instrument will significantly advance scientific capabilities at Scripps Florida for NIH funded research and advance the long-term mission of institute?to expand the frontiers of knowledge, accelerate new treatments for disease, and train the next generation of scientists in this critical work."

"9310862","Summary/Abstract: The genomes of higher organisms are highly regulated and their expression can respond to a variety of developmental, environmental, and nutritional cues. The failure to execute proper gene regulation can lead to developmental defects and disease states. A broad goal of this research is to understand basic regulatory mechanisms of genes at the level of transcription, the stage where RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes the genes into mRNA. Studies of Drosophila heat shock (HS) genes, and more recently mammalian genes, have revealed that regulation by transcription factors (TFs) in vivo can occur at a point after Pol II has initiated transcription and has elongated to sites 20 to 60 bases downstream where it pauses. This proximal-promoter pausing in early transcriptional elongation is a rate-limiting and often regulated step in transcription. In contrast, traditional models of transcription regulation, based mainly in studies of microbes, indicated that transcription regulation occurs primarily at the recruitment of Pol II to promoters. Understanding the regulatory contributions and molecular mechanisms of TFs at three critical steps; 1) Pol II recruitment, 2) promoter-proximal pausing, and 3) the regulated release from the paused Pol II to productive elongation, are foci of this renewal. A battery of complementary approaches (some novel) are designed to disrupt (as rapidly as possible) critical TFs involved in transcription regulation, while high spatial and temporal resolution assays will allow Pol II and TFs to be observed across the genome both before and during a time-course of gene activation. These observational assays include highly-sensitive PRO-seq assay for mapping the position and amount of engaged Pol II across genes and genomes, and ChIP-nexus for mapping the position of specific transcription factors genome-wide. Both provide near base-pair resolution, which is critical in evaluating regulatory mechanisms. We will use three experimental systems Drosophila; mammalian cell lines, and S. pombe, and each has a foundation of available tools and existing data sets that can be uniquely exploited. Together, these systems will assess the generalities of our regulatory models. They are designed to reveal in many cases the primary effects of disruption of particular TFs, catalytic activity and macromolecular interaction domains. Aim 1 tests the mechanistic role of TFs, like GAGA factor and M1BP, and the NURF remodeler, in recruitment of Pol II to promoters and enhancers, and test candidate mammalian factors for comparable roles. Aim 2 tests the mechanistic role of pausing factors NELF and DSIF, and general transcription factors in stabilizing Pol II pausing at both promoters and enhancers. Aim 3 tests the role of TFs in the release of Pol II to productive elongation. While Aims 1-3 seek to disrupt a TF, Aim 4 directly recruits TF domains and coactivators to explore their roles, again using genome-wide high-resolution assays. The proposal's multi-targeted perturbation and genome-wide resolution assays carried out at near base-pair resolution should provide new insights to the mechanics of transcription regulation."
"9256484","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is intimately associated with obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Traditionally, NAFLD has been associated with caloric excess on a susceptible genetic background, however recent studies from our laboratory and others have pointed out a role for environmental toxicants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in the etiology of steatosis and steatohepatitis, particularly in the context of hypercaloric diet coexposure. Our proposed study uses exposure parameters informed by our recent analysis of serum samples from a previously-described cohort of individuals residing in Anniston, AL who were exposed to high levels of PCB-containing waste. Although many of these individuals have serum levels of PCBs above that found in the general population of the US, their exposures remain well below the levels implicated in acute liver injury. Nevertheless, these individuals have significantly elevated biomarkers of liver injury as well as elevated inflammatory cytokines, elevated prevalence of diabetes, and increased BMI when compared to an unexposed population. A frustrating finding of previous toxicity studies has been the very different pathological response of mice and humans to such subacute, chronic, and environmentally relevant PCB exposures. Our preliminary data in a mouse model of subacute PCB exposure shows paradoxical elevations of liver injury biomarkers, fatty change, and inflammatory cytokines at lower exposure vs. higher exposure to a PCB mixture (20mg Aroclor 1260/kg body weight vs. 200mg/kg body weight Aroclor 1260). In two knockout mouse models that lack the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) or the pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (PXR), our laboratory has found differential transcription of the gene targets of these receptors in response to Aroclor 1260 and high-fat diet exposure. These patterns of pathological and phenotypic responses are consistent with a transcription-factor based mechanism of PCB toxicity. The differences in disease endpoints may therefore be due to differences in ligand specificity and target gene cohort between the human and mouse forms of these receptors. We therefore propose to expand our investigation of receptor-based mechanisms of PCB toxicity with the use of a novel triple-transgenic mouse model expressing human forms of AhR, PXR, and CAR. We hypothesize that using both an acute-exposure primary hepatocyte culture, and a whole animal chronic exposure model, we will find that differences in the structure and function of these receptors will drive a differential transcriptioal response to PCBs and ultimately, differences in PCB-associated disease endpoints."
"9287851","SUMMARY  Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in the Americas largely relies on passive case detection and  ambulatory treatment without comprehensive follow-up. Information on clinical response and adverse drug  reactions under the standard of care are neither routinely obtained nor reported. Passive case detection is  particularly inefficient in the vast rural areas of transmission where dispersed populations have limited access  to diagnosis through health systems. Despite some recent reports of treatment failures, the logistical demands  of endemic areas, and the toxicity of the recommended parenterally administered drugs, have contributed to  the virtual absence of information on their routine effectiveness, as opposed to efficacy. The overall goal of the  proposed project is to estimate the hidden burden of cutaneous leishmaniasis by predictive risk mapping and  quantifying underestimation cases and effectiveness of standard-of-care treatment. We will integrate a  comprehensive assessment of under-reporting and under-ascertainment through case detection based on  passive and active surveillance by community-based surveillance and risk mapping and we will implement  mHealth tools for quantifying treatment effectiveness under routine clinical practice conditions. This working  framework will allow us to extend mHealth surveillance to treatment follow-up and effectiveness estimation in  CL. To achieve this, we will develop the following specific aims:  1) Estimate under-reporting and under-ascertainment of CL using mHealth assisted active case detection,  chain-referral sampling, and community-based surveillance.  2) Develop a model, based on remote sensing and vector niches, for predicting risk of cutaneous  leishmaniasis, and estimate its ability to identify high-risk sites  3) Estimate the effectiveness of the standard treatment for CL in three municipalities supported with mHealth  tools managed by leading participants of the community.  Results from this project will provide the evidence base for implementation of community based active case  detection and referral for standard of care treatment using novel mHealth tools that can be implemented at the  community level. Early diagnosis and treatment will reduce the burden of disease, and its physical and social  consequences."
"9461964","Abstract Highly skilled physician investigators are urgently needed for pediatric trial teams that can take advantage of new technologies and respond to the increasing demands of high quality pediatric clinical trials. At the same time, rural and underserved communities need access to and to benefit from these clinical trials. Locally, regionally, and nationally, UNM Pediatric Clinical Trial Site (PCTS) will support and advance clinical trials. Our impact is significant because 1) UNM PCTS will be a portal of entry to our diverse patient populations including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as geographically isolated and under-resourced rural communities. Our community-engaged approach strengthens recruitment of these diverse populations into research studies and will improve health among pediatric populations. 2) UNM PCTS is a needed asset locally and regionally. UNM PCTS will devote a structured and skilled research team including trained investigators to conduct pediatric clinical trials. 3) UNM PCTS will bring unique capabilities to the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN), including collaboration with the Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) through our Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Mountain West Research Consortium (MWRC). Our clinical site will be a hub for other IDeA and non- IDeA sites; it will increase opportunity for partner sites to participate in pediatric clinical trials as they would contribute to accelerated patient enrollment and increase diversity of the patient population. 4) We have unique and established strengths in clinical study infrastructure and Translational Workforce Development (TWD) as part of UNM Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) that will provide valuable assets to the entire ISPCTN. 5) Finally, UNM PCTS will have experienced principal investigators (PIs) participating in multisite pediatric clinical trials and recruitment and retention from communities and rural areas statewide. They will be a great asset to the ISPCTN Network and Steering Committee. UNM PCTS will offer an experienced team of researchers to work with the IDeA states Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC) of the ISPCTN. The team will improve access to relevant populations and accelerate overall study accrual and retention of participants while generating high-quality data that meet regulatory standards. UNM PCTS and collaborators will offer expertise needed to identify research topics of high priority, including rural and underserved communities. We will exert a positive impact on access and on the quality of multisite pediatric studies in a measureable way. We will accomplish this by increasing the speed and efficiency of multisite pediatric trials and by using innovative methods to improve engagement, enrollment, and retention of diverse populations from New Mexico and other IDeA and non-IDeA states. We will sustain Network productivity by training independent pediatric clinical-trial investigators as we sustain the influence on the field."

Senior undergraduate and master's-level courses in the design curriculum are targeted. The main elements of the program are enhancements in: 1) Experiential learning through a 10-week summer clinical immersion program designed to create student peer mentors in clinical needs-finding, a newly developed inter-professional  medical device sandbox , and expanded support for device prototyping and testing; 2) Specialist cross- disciplinary instruction in key topic areas that are best taught by practicing experts in the field, including medical device design controls, communication and teamwork, medical device reimbursement, healthcare public policy, and biomedical ethics; and 3) Outreach and networking through an annual MedTech Roadtrip and increased support of existing student outreach efforts to recruit a diverse student pool. The University of Michigan has excellent infrastructure and resources for BME Design, which will be leveraged to create an integrated and impactful program. All BME undergraduate students will benefit from this program through their participation in the capstone design experience. Master's-level BME students interested in medical device design also will be impacted through enhancements to advanced design classes. The program is structured to help students identify and understand current clinical problems, and to then apply design skills to develop focused and viable solutions. The program also educates students on the broader context of medical device development, including regulatory, legal, business, and ethical perspectives. Students learn to work and communicate effectively on multidisciplinary teams to tackle open-ended problems. The program and proposed enhancements will be regularly evaluated for both short- and long-term impact using established assessment and evaluation methods. Best practices and outcomes of the program will be disseminated through a dedicated BME Design web site and presentation at relevant professional meetings. This project aims to create the next generation of medical design engineers and directly supports NIBIB's mission of enabling the development and accelerating the translation of innovative biomedical technologies to improve health."
"9316222","This project develops a platform-independent target enrichment technology for the preparation of large (50- 150 kb+) DNA fragments. These are magnetically selected from genomic regions of interest and used directly - without any intermediate amplification step - for next-generation sequencing (NGS). This will allow the direct detection of methylated base information on several of the newer NGS systems. Large DNA templates can currently be processed by several NGS platforms, and even more powerful systems are being developed. The ability to utilize large, contiguous DNA segments as sequencing templates greatly assists in detecting and characterizing structural variants, obtaining accurate sequence information across complex and GC-rich genomic loci, conducting de novo sequence assembly, phasing long-range haplotype information, and finding new or unexpected sequence elements, such as viral integration sites, inversions, duplications and other types of chromosomal rearrangements. Existing methods for genomic enrichment are not able to provide a comprehensive characterization of complex genomic loci in an economical and flexible manner because they cannot provide the large size fragments that are required to successfully span confounding sequence elements and resolve persistent challenges at important loci. We will develop an efficient long-read capture technology for small amounts of input DNA that resolves common sequencing and assembly problems that occur with most current amplification- or hybridization- based enrichment technologies. The benefits of this large-fragment enrichment as carried out with capture primers with a very small footprint (20-25 bases) will extend to all types of NGS platforms, including to those that rely on short read lengths.

"9248847","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UCSF Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) has made remarkable progress in our first 9 years, developing diagnostic approaches to dementia that are elucidating the phenotypic, genetic and molecular heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The unique clinical cohorts, biospecimens, and images that we collect in the ADRC have facilitated these successes. Talented scientists mentored through our ADRC are making major contributions to the understanding of dementia. ADRC research has steadily increased. We are defining distinctive clinical subtypes of AD, FTD, and CJD that predict specific molecular and physiological mechanisms for dementia, while improving early recognition and tracking of transitions from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. These efforts will continue in parallel with drug development and pursuit of clinical trials with researchers who  work with the ADRC. We will explore the heterogeneous features of AD, FTD-spectrum disorders, and CJD in the early stages with the goal of predicting their physiological, genetic, and molecular underpinnings. We will leverage cohorts in the ADRC and the powerful neuroscience community at UCSF and beyond to stimulate new diagnostic and treatment efforts for AD, FTD and CJD. We will increase understanding of the unique cultural and biological features of aging Chinese-Americans. We will develop innovative approaches to data management and biostatistics that we will share. The Education Core will be responsible for training new dementia leaders, while educating the medical and lay communities about non-AD dementias and non-amnestic subtypes of AD. We will perform three new projects: Project 1: Dr. Gil Rabinovici will compare and contrast early onset AD, late onset AD, and apoE4+ versus apoE4- patients to improve diagnostic accuracy in AD. Project 2: Dr. Marilu Gorno-Tempini will study developmental and immunological factors that influence the phenotype in PPA. Project 3: Dr. Yadong Huang will reprogram human skin fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells and convert them into neurons from E4/E4 or E3/3 patients and healthy controls. Pathological substrates and gene expression will be compared."

"9306933","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COPD is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in the US. Despite the growing availability of efficacious pharmacotherapy for COPD, patients still experience a significant disease burden and with more than half reporting significant impairment in functioning. Thus the efficacy of COPD medications in clinical trials stands in stark contrast to the poor outcomes experienced by patients in the real world. One possible explanation for this gap is low rates of medication adherence. Only 25% of COPD patients are adherent, which is the lower than other chronic illnesses including diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Despite the high prevalence of nonadherence in COPD interventions there are significant gaps in the development and evaluation of interventions for adherence. Previous research has been based on cross sectional studies using self-reported measures of adherence and largely a theoretical. In the absence of data, many hospital systems are developing interventions to address medication adherence as part of their clinical program to reduce hospital readmissions and avoid financial penalties from CMS. This project proposes to recruit 360 patients with COPD to longitudinally evaluate potential determinants on adherence and disease progression based on theory of self-regulation. Participants will use novel electronic medication monitors to measure adherence to long term controller and rescue medications and ecological momentary assessments to measure patient reported respiratory symptoms and patients reactions including outcome expectancies, self-efficacy to management symptoms and medication health beliefs. This data will be used to evaluate the theory of self-regulation in COPD. Participants will also complete bi-annual clinical visits to track disease progression on clinical outcomes (e.g., lung function, functional status, quality of life) and psychological/ cognitive functioning. The impact f this study is to identify novel and potentially powerful targets for behavioral interventions in COPD which has been understudied despite its tremendous detrimental impact on overall public health."
"9289053","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the development of new therapies, cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life-shortening disease. Airway infec- tion and inflammation begin during infancy and lead to respiratory failure. Thus, early interventions aimed at correcting the initial host defense defects and preventing/reducing infection could dramatically improve the course of CF lung disease. It is well known that mutations in the gene encoding CFTR, a HCO ? and Cl? con-  3 ducting channel, cause CF. Yet, the origins of CF lung disease have remained less well understood. We dis- covered that loss of CFTR impairs two important airway host defense mechanisms. a) Reduced activity of air- way surface liquid (ASL) antimicrobials. b) More viscous mucus that also has abnormal properties, impairing its ability to detach from submucosal gland ducts, thus hindering mucociliary transport (MCT). In both cases, loss of CFTR-mediated HCO3? secretion and an abnormally acidic pH are key factors. Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutics that target primary host defense defects due to loss of CFTR function. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine if airway alkalinization, with a repurposed drug, can prevent or allevi- ate the development of CF airway disease. Our hypothesis is that airway alkalinization with tromethamine (THAM, an FDA-approved alkalinizing agent in human clinical use for metabolic acidosis), will restore airway host defenses in CF and prevent/alleviate the development of CF airway disease. We found in humans and pigs that aerosolized THAM, a tris-based, non-bicarbonate buffer, causes a sustained increase in ASL pH and the effect lasts for hours, in contrast to a much shorter duration with NaHCO3. THAM enhanced ASL bacterial killing and decreased mucus viscosity. We test the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Does aerosolized THAM produce a prolonged increase in ASL pH and enhance antimicrobial activity in pigs and humans? Based upon our published and unpublished data, our working hypothesis is that aerosolized THAM will increase ASL pH and restore ASL antimicrobial properties, in humans and pigs with CF. Aim 2. Will airway alkalinization im- prove MCT? From our earlier studies, we postulate that airway alkalinization with THAM will reverse MCT de- fects in CF, thereby enhancing MCT in CF. Aim 3. Does airway alkalinization alleviate or prevent early airway disease in CF pigs? Our published and preliminary data show that CF pigs already have airway host defense defects present at birth and develop airway disease within 3 weeks of age. Thus, we hypothesize that, in CF pigs, long-term restoration of ASL pH with THAM will improve airway host defense and lessen or prevent early airway disease in CF pigs. We are uniquely positioned to translate our recent discoveries on the pathogenesis of CF lung disease into a therapeutic intervention. These results, from both human and preclinical animal stud- ies, will be transformative for CF and likely other airway diseases. They will have an important positive impact on accelerating clinical development of THAM and other new therapeutic interventions and endpoints for early CF, a critically important time point in the era of universal newborn CF screening."
"9258337","Abstract This proposal focuses on the mechanisms of integrin activation, which is crucial for basic cellular responses essential for normal physiology and pathologies ranging from thrombosis, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction. Integrins play a key role in angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature. There is a need to understand how angiogenesis is regulated so that innovative approaches for the control of excessive vascular growth in patients with distinct therapeutic needs (i.e. cancer, age-related macular degeneration and retinopathy of diabetes) can be identified. Our mechanistic focus is on Kindlins, a novel family of intracellular mediators which are required for integrin functions on all cells. Although our previous and preliminary studies demonstrated importance of Kindlins in human pathologies, many Kindlins' functions remain to be identified. Thus, the goal of this project is to further understand the molecular mechanisms and structural requirements underlying integrin-dependent and independent functions of kindlins in endothelial and myeloid cells during vascularization processes. The main hypothesis to be tested is that K3 is required for functions of endothelial and myeloid cells in angiogenesis and many, but not all, of these functions are integrin-dependent. The following Aims are proposed: Aim 1. To determine whether K3- dependent regulation of integrins in endothelial and myeloid cells plays a critical role in vascularization in vivo. We will test the hypothesis that K3-integrin interaction is crucial for the regulation of angiogenesis in vivo by using newly generated K3KI knockin mice (expressing a mutant of K3 that is unable to bind to integrin). We will compare the role for K3 on endothelial to that on myeloid cells. Aim 2. To assess the mechanisms responsible for impaired function of endothelial and myeloid cells from K3KI mice, and perform rescue experiments with K3 and K2. To determine the structural requirement for K3-specific functions in EC. Aim 3. To determine whether and how K3 function in hematopoietic cells is regulated during integrin activation with an emphasis on the regulatory role of K3 phosphorylation."
"9290385","Project Summary/Abstract The loss of motor function that occurs with aging is closely associated with adverse health outcomes. In recent years, published findings strongly suggest that malfunction and degeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse formed between ?-motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers, contributes to age-related motor dysfunction. As the final output of the somatic motor system, degeneration of the NMJ inevitably results in degeneration of motor axons and atrophy of muscle fibers, thus affecting voluntary movement. Thus, it is critical to identify factors that function to maintain and repair the NMJ. Using an R56 grant provided by NIA, our lab has identified the fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1 (FGFBP1) as a promising candidate factor secreted by muscle fibers to preserve and restore the integrity of NMJs during aging. FGFBP1 functions to chaperone FGF ligands from the extracellular matrix to cognate receptors. In this manner, it enhances FGF signaling. We have found that while FGFBP1 concentrates at NMJs in young adult mice, it progressively decreases during normal aging and in SOD1G93A mice, a mouse model for ALS. Using knockout mice, we observed that FGFBP1 expression is required to slow aging of NMJs and motor deficits during normal aging. Furthermore, FGFBP1 deletion in mice expressing SOD1G93A, a model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), accelerates NMJ degeneration, disease progression and death. These initial discoveries strongly suggest that preventing loss of endogenous of FGFBP1 during aging may be sufficient to slow degeneration of NMJs, and thus preserve motor function. To test this hypothesis, we proposed three specific aims that build on each other. In aim 1, we test the hypothesis that motor deficits in mice deficient for FGFBP1 result from cellular, molecular, and physiological changes at NMJs. In aim 2, we will seek to identify molecular mechanisms that inhibit FGFBP1 expression in aging muscles. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that FGFBP1 is sufficient to prevent and reverse age-related changes of NMJs. These aims are designed to uncover the initial changes that precipitate aging of NMs, the molecular factors that result in decreased FGFBP1 expression in aging muscle, and the therapeutic potential of FGFBP1 in preserving NMJs and motor function."
"9411050","PROJECT SUMMARY We hypothesize that Protein Kinase C (PKC) agonists such as the non-tumorigenic Bryoids combined with HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) represent a valuable pharmacological approach to purge latent HIV-1 from cellular reservoirs. We also hypothesize that a combination of a Bryoid and an HDACi co-encapsulated in a long- circulation pegylated immunonanosomes coated with anti-PD-L1 nanobodies will provide efficient HIV latency activation and immunological depletion of latent reservoirs. This combination nanosomal approach has the added benefit of concomitantly and significantly reducing systemic toxicities of both PKC and HDACi. Our Phase I Specific Aims are: (1) construct and characterize nanosomes containing the Bryoid, Bryostatin-1 in the lipid membrane and nanosomes of HDAC inhibitors SAHA, Romidepsin and Panobinostat in the aqueous core; (2) evaluate the cytotoxicity of Bryostatin-1, HDACi and of their corresponding nanosomes in cell culture models, and in vivo cytotoxicity and biodistribution in BALB/c mouse model to select most efficacious combination; and (3) evaluate the synergistic and anti-HIV-1 latency antagonistic effects of two nanosomes of different combination of Bryostatin-1 and the alternate HDAC inhibitors in cell culture and in humanized mice models of HIV latency. We plan to conduct this Proof-of-Concept study over a 24-month period with a multidisciplinary team of 1.10 full-time equivalents (FTE) of an engineer, virologist, and manufacturing technician. Additionally, our lean but experienced research team will be advised and supported by Dr. Robert F. Siliciano, Professor of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute who will also provide support with respect to the ex vivo evaluation of the combination PKC-HDACi nanosomes; Dr. Eduardo Munoz, University of Cordoba, Spain, an immunologist, an HIV latency researcher and Scientific Advisor to Aphios Corporation; Dr. Santiago Moreno, Head, Infectious Diseases, Ramón y Cajal Hospital and Professor of Infectious Diseases, University of Alcalá, Madrid, Spain, an HIV clinician and Principal Investigator of an ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial of Bryostatin-1 for HIV latency in HIV patients on cART; and Dr. Joseph L. Bryant, D.V.M at the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland Medical School, an HIV animal model expert, who will lead the in vivo toxicity and efficacy animal studies planned. We will establish a Scientific Advisory Review Panel with Drs. Siliciano, Bryant, Munoz and Santiago for the research. Should we be successful in achieving our Phase I milestones, we will prepare and propose a comprehensive Phase II research and development program which will: (1) systematically construct immunonanosomes by coating the most promising nanosomes identified in Phase I anti-PD-L1 nanobodies, and physically, chemically and biologically characterize the immunonanosomes; (2) evaluate most potent HIV latency drug combination in an induction/activation therapy protocol in the SHIV/macaque or alternative model of viral persistence and latency; and (3) determine the potential effects of treatment on selected immunological functions during induction therapy. The end-goal of our research program is to develop a combination therapeutic to clear and free HIV patients from latent viruses, curing a chronic disease and reducing the burden of personal toxicities and ending the economic burden of this disease in both developing and developed countries. In order to reach these objectives, we plan to conduct rigorous clinical studies in a Phase III clinical research program with a commercial partner/investor in which we will: (1) perform cGMP manufacturing of HIV latency combination therapeutic at the pilot-scale level; (2) establish a Drug Master File; (3) design IND-enabling preclinical studies and Phase I/II clinical trials; (4) prepare pre-IND package; and (5) establish and conduct pre-IND meeting with FDA and file an IND with the FDA. We will then conduct Phase I and II clinical trials, and license the therapeutic to a multinational pharmaceutical company such as Roche, J&J, Pfizer, Merck or GSK. In summary, we will utilize Aphios? proprietary critical fluid nanosomes (CFN) process for the formation of small, uniform liposomes for the co-encapsulation of Bryoids and HDAC inhibitors [US Patent, Castor, 2014], and take advantage of promising data we have generated from preliminary studies [Perez et al., 2010], to develop responsive protocols for Phase I and II clinical studies in HIV-1 patients being treated with cART and having a suppressed viral load [Gutiérrez et al., 2016]. The outcomes of the proposed studies will inform product development for HIV latency, and fast-track the field to complete elimination of HIV infection and sterilizing cure."
"9249663","Our long-term goal is to understand how eosinophils (EOS) traffic to and interact in the ainway and contribute to the progression of asthma. aM32 integrin (CD11b/CD18) is highly activated on EOS obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage after segmental antigen challenge, suggesting that aM(32 functions becomes important as EOS extravasate to and migrate in the lung. However, little is known about roles of aMp2 and relevant ligand(s) in adhesion, migration, and activities of EOS in the airway. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the role of aMp2 in modulating behavior of EOS in the ainway. Based on our preliminary data and current understanding of EOS biology and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in asthma, the current hypothesis is that periostin, an ECM protein characteristic of inflammation driven by T helper type 2 cells and found in the asthmatic ain/vay, is a dominant adhesive ligand for EOS aMp2 integrin and that the aMp2-periostin interaction is an important determinant of EOS function. Aim 1 is to define roles of aMp2, periostin and TGF-P-induced protein (TGFBI), a periostin homolog also found in lung, in adhesion, migration, sun/ival, and other functions of EOS activated by IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, or other activators. Aim 2 is to determine the structure-function relationship ofthe recognition of periostin by aMP2, map the aMp2-binding site(s), and define minimal constructs that when immobilized support, and when soluble block, EOS adhesion and migration. How the vitamin K-dependent y-carboxylation and alternative splicing affect periostin's biological activities will also be determined. Aim 3 is to understand the mechanism and significance ofthe striking increase of periostin that is found in the asthmatic airway. Periostin secretion from fibroblasts and epithelial cells stimulated by TGF-p or other factors, as well as its deposition into ECM and turnover will be analyzed. Antibodies to the various forms of periostin and TGFBI will be developed for localization in bronchial biopsies after segmental antigen challenge. Achieving the goals of this proposal will provide novel knowledge and a better understanding of EOS trafficking and functions and the interplay between EOS and the ECM in Th2-driven inflammation, and will generate agents and reagents that will allow this interplay to be studied and modulated. RELE^VANCE (See instructions): The proposed research will determine how the connective tissue protein periostin, which is strongly up- regulated in asthma, interacts with its cell-surface receptor protein aMP2 integrin (CD11b/CD18) on activated EOS, and supports attachment and migration of EOS. The project will provide new insights into the movement of EOS in the asthmatic ainway and the biology of connective tissue in the diseased lung."

"9264534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Higher visual functions, including object recognition and global motion detection, are carried out by extrastriate visual areas, or higher visual areas (HVAs), downstream from primary visual cortex. These higher processing functions often fail to completely recover following congenital blindness or amblyopia. These observations suggest that early visual experience sculpts HVA circuitry, but this has not been determined. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose an integrative approach using genetically engineered mice. Our goal is to determine how experience sculpts the normal development of HVA circuitry and how circuit deficits are caused by visual deprivation. Our preliminary data indicates that a subset of HVAs is slow to develop after eye opening, and fails to completely recover visual responses following dark rearing. By contrast, a complementary set of HVAs is visually responsive at eye opening, and fully recovers following dark rearing. We will map the development of HVAs at multiple time points, starting at eye opening, using intrinsic signal optical imaging and two photon calcium imaging. We will use a paradigm we developed for high resolution receptive field mapping of local populations of neurons in parallel. We will use technology we have recently developed to examine activity correlations between visual cortical areas and map how these change in development. We will dark rear mice to determine the effect of visual deprivation on HVA circuitry. The results from this project will reveal the role of visual experience in sculpting HVA selectivity and circuit development."
"9349089","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this project is to improve the management of HIV infected (HIV+) lung cancer patients. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in older HIV+ patients. Up to 30% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at a loco-regional stage (with expected increases due to the implementation of lung cancer screening in the HIV+ population), can be treated with a curative intent, and may experience relatively good long-term survival. Despite this, HIV+ lung cancer patients experience lung cancer treatment disparities and have poorer lung cancer outcomes. The risk/benefit ratio of cancer therapies can be substantially altered in HIV+ patients because of differences in treatment toxicity, tumor aggressiveness, functional status, life expectancy, and quality of life. Unfortunately, patients with comorbidities such as HIV are consistently excluded from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) generating an important gap in knowledge regarding their management. Lack of data relevant to HIV+ patients has profound negative impact including under treatment, increased morbidity, and decreased survival. Thus, optimizing the management of HIV+ lung cancer patients is a major public health priority. In this study, we will use simulation modeling, an approach complementary to RCTs, to determine the optimal treatment of early stage HIV+ lung cancer patients. The Specific Aims are to: 1) enhance and validate the Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) to simulate the management and subsequent outcomes of HIV+ patients with loco-regional non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 2) determine the optimal management for stage I NSCLC in HIV+ patients; 3) find the optimal indications for adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II-IIIA NSCLC in HIV+ patients; and 4) identify optimal management strategies for stage I-IIIA NSCLC in HIV+ patients with severe cardiac, pulmonary, renal or hepatic comorbidities. To achieve these Aims, we will use an enhanced version of the LCPM, a well-validated mathematical model of lung cancer progression. In Aim 1, we will use data from several population-based HIV+ cohorts to substantially enhance, calibrate, and validate the LCPM by incorporating an HIV natural history module, as well as HIV-specific parameter modifications for functional status, frailty, cancer treatments, complications of surgery and chemotherapy toxicity, outcomes, survival and quality of life. Then, we will assess the optimal management, in terms of reducing toxicity and maximizing survival and quality of life, of HIV+ patients with early stage lung cancer. Our study is innovative in providing HIV-specific cancer treatment guidance, as well as in applying modeling approaches mostly used to evaluate cancer screening, to the optimization of lung cancer therapies. The results of the study will directly inform the management of large numbers of HIV+ lung cancer patients, a vulnerable and understudied group that currently experience substantially worse outcomes."
"9312083","Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community."
"9268013","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a hybrid imaging approach by adding a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye to a radiotracer to improve upon existing methods for intraoperative detection of tumors. Dual labeling strategies are typically based on modifying radiotracers that have yet to be translated, thus lacking clinical data to benchmark the performance of a dual-labeled counterpart. As a result, targeted hybrid agents have not advanced past preclinical testing despite clear potential to enhance surgical efficacy. To overcome this, the clinically validated somatostatin targeting peptide, octreotide, wil serve as a model for hybrid agent development. Gallium-68 labeled octreotide (68Ga-DOTA-TOC) is used clinically to detect neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) by Positron Emission Tomography and possesses superior imaging properties compared to the current clinical standard, Octreoscan. To achieve the versatility in agent design not attainable with commercial chelators such as DOTA, a novel multimodality chelation (MMC) scaffold that combines a chelator and NIRF dye into a single entity will be employed for facile dual labeling of octreotide. Through use of the MMC, it is expected that the conversion of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC into a hybrid agent will provide surgeons with state-of-the-art tools to effectively perform cytoreductive surgery and encounter less incidences of residual disease. This would reduce the need for additional surgeries and be a significant step forward in nuclear and NIRF imaging as both modalities will be able to translate their exquisite detection sensitivities into a therapeutic seting to directly impact patient outcomes. Preliminary studies have shown efficient dual labeling and cell binding of a prototype MMC-octreotide hybrid agent, thus strategies to demonstrate intraoperative utility are proposed. The Specific Aims of this proposal focus upon: 1. Developing a high-specific activity formulation that permits microdosing and retains fluorescent properties. 2. Demonstrating retention of binding properties using in vitro assays. 3. In vivo imaging in mice to show efficacy for tumor detection and assess imaging performance. 4. Establishing an intraoperative imaging approach that improves tumor detection compared to conventional methods such as visual inspection and palpation, and results in more effective tumor resection. The proposed hybrid imaging approach builds upon the evolution of SSTR targeted imaging agents and the established NET clinical imaging infrastructure, thereby enabling rapid agent validation and guiding development strategies for agents that can be used for more prevalent tumors."

"9240524","Project Summary/Abstract: ?Bayesian image analysis in Fourier space (BIFS)?  The objective of this grant is to develop a family of new medical imaging processing methods that will advance the state-of-the art in radiological research and diagnostic evaluation. We will improve on commonly used spatial filtering methods, Fourier/wavelet shrinkage/sparsity methods, and conventional Bayesian image analysis methods by reformulating Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space (BIFS), i.e., by modeling in terms of spatial frequencies. Spatially correlated prior distributions that are difficult to model and compute in conventional image space can be more efficiently modeled as a set of independent processes across Fourier space. The originally inter-correlated and high-dimensional problem in image space is thereby broken down into a series of independent one-dimensional problems in Fourier space, where the independent distributions are tied together by our development of a parameter function over Fourier space. This independence over Fourier space structure coupled with the concept of the parameter function will enable us to develop new families of powerful and easy to specify BIFS models with fast algorithms to compute posterior image estimates. We will disseminate these methods to imaging researchers and clinical practitioners by developing a BIFS software package designed to solve a wide range of medical image processing problems.  The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to develop novel BIFS models targeted to provide improved solutions to medical image processing problems; 2) to validate benefits of BIFS models compared with conventional processing methods based on careful simulation and phantom imaging studies; 3) to clinically validate improvements generated by BIFS modeling in two ongoing clinical studies: a) quantification of brain perfusion patterns associated with frontotemporal lobar dementia, and b) detection of breast cancer in MRIs; and 4) to disseminate the methods to the wider clinical and scientific communities by generating and releasing an R package for the implementation of BIFS.  Our innovative BIFS modeling approach has the potential to make a big difference in the field of medical image processing problems and image analysis in general. The impact on radiological application through the development of new, readily implementable and fast-to-compute BIFS models will lead to increased accuracy for the detection of findings in radiological screening and diagnosis; improved assessment of treatment efficacy; increased accuracy for measuring disease effects in imaging-based clinical studies; and expanded potential for practical image data-mining."

"9250050","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative incidence and clinical spectrum of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria, a longitudinal study in Sabah, Malaysia has one of the most successful malaria control programs in Southeast Asia, with marked reductions in the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax over recent decades and an aim to eliminate these species by 2020. However, the simian parasite P. knowlesi has emerged as a major cause of human malaria, and we recently reported that in Sabah, east Malaysia, combined notifications of P. knowlesi and the microscopically near-identical P. malariae increased >10-fold between 2004 - 2011. However, microscopic diagnosis of P. knowlesi is known to be problematic, and definitive diagnosis requires molecular methods. Hence, whether the apparent increase in P. knowlesi is due to increased recognition of the species remains uncertain, and the true incidence and trend of knowlesi malaria in Sabah, in comparison to the other human malaria species, has not been determined. P. knowlesi has a 24-hour replication cycle and can result in high parasitemias with consequent complications. Risk of severe disease appears higher than that of falciparum malaria, and fatal cases have been reported. However, many knowledge gaps remain with regards to the epidemiology and clinical features of knowlesi malaria. Large prospective longitudinal studies have not been conducted, and no prospective study has evaluated the clinical features of knowlesi malaria in children, or the occurrence and consequences of knowlesi malaria in pregnancy. In our proposed study we aim to determine the true incidence and trend of knowlesi malaria in Sabah, in comparison to the other human malaria species. This will be achieved through collaboration with the Sabah Public Health Laboratory, and will involve the implementation of state-wide molecular testing of every case of microscopy-diagnosed malaria in Sabah during the 5-year study period. Basic demographic details including pregnancy status will be recorded for all cases. Our second aim is to determine the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of knowlesi malaria at two district hospitals, including changes over time. This will be achieved through the enrolment of every patient admitted with malaria at two district hospitals in northeast Sabah, with detailed epidemiological and clinical details recorded. Our proposed research will provide for the first time accurate information regarding the true incidence of knowlesi malaria in Sabah, and the trend of this species over time in comparison to the other human malaria species. This will inform malaria control programs in Sabah, in addition to informing other countries in Southeast Asia about the potential emergence of knowlesi malaria as P. falciparum and P. vivax are brought under control. In addition, our prospective district-hospital studies will provide crucial information regarding the clinical features of knowlesi malaria in populations that have not been previously well-studied, including children and pregnant women."
"9311535","Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics ? the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes ? in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down?s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner."
"9251298","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We recently demonstrated that delivery of physiological amounts of microRNA-145 (miR-145) completely restored impaired coronary collateral growth (CCG) in a rat model of metabolic syndrome by restoring vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to their normal physiological phenotype (contractile vs. synthetic) in the late stage of CCG. miR-145 is highly enriched in smooth muscle and is expressed at high levels in normal, healthy coronary VSMCs. Its expression is severely decreased in VSMCs of metabolic syndrome animals and humans and correlates with loss of the normal contractile VSMC phenotype. As such this intervention has potentially important implications for clinical re-vascularization therapy. However, to assess the clinical applicability of miR-145-based therapy for induction of CCG, it is essential to understand the mechanisms by which it achieved restoration of CCG. We propose that this single miR delivered to a single cell type (VSMC) had such a profound effect on a complex process of collateral growth, which involves coordinated interactions between multiple cell types, because the miR-145-induced conversion of synthetic VSMCs to contractile VSMCs in turn modulated all key regulatory aspects of CCG including ECM remodeling, endothelial cell (EC) survival and function, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), bioavailability of growth factors vs. growth inhibitors, and nitric oxide (NO). Our data show that VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery converted VSMCs from synthetic to contractile phenotype and normalized (converted to profile seen in normal animals) ECM composition, inflammation, including cytokine, ROS and MMP levels, and endothelial function in the metabolic syndrome animals. In contrast, delivery of the biological inhibitor of miR-145 (antimiR-145) to the normal animals resulted in induction of the synthetic VSMC phenotype, which produced the ECM composition, inflammatory profile, ROS and MMP production, and endothelial dysfunction similar to that observed in JCR rats. Therefore, we hypothesize that restoration of physiological VSMC miR-145 levels in the late stage of CCG in the metabolic syndrome restores CCG by normalizing ECM composition and inflammation and restoring endothelial function. Three specific aims will be addressed: 1) determine whether VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery normalizes ECM remodeling during CCG in the metabolic syndrome, 2) determine whether VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery and normalized ECM remodeling ameliorate excessive inflammation (inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine, ROS and MMP production from these cells) during CCG in the metabolic syndrome, and 3) determine whether VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery and normalized ECM remodeling restore endothelial function during CCG in the metabolic syndrome. These in vivo studies will identify functional physiological responses, which account for miR-145's global effect on CCG recovery, at the cellular level."
"9346864","ABSTRACT Comprehensive, Near Patient Assessment of Severe Hypoglycemia  in Newborns using Low Blood Volume (Fast-Track SBIR) Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic disorder in newborns and places the neonate at increased risk of seizures and permanent brain injury. The etiology of severe neonatal hypoglycemia -- which affects around 25,000 newborns each year in the U.S. -- is complex, with underlying causes including hyperinsulinism, cortisol and/or growth hormone (GH) deficiencies, and defects in glycogen metabolism. Comprehensive evaluation of these physiological pathways is essential to guide appropriate, effective medical interventions. However, the current panel of laboratory assays requires relatively large volumes (3 mL or more) of whole blood, making newborn assessment challenging, particularly in preterm newborns. More importantly, routine turnaround times for these assays may be 48 hours or more, leading to critical delays in life-saving treatment. The overall goal of this Fast Track SBIR project is to develop a comprehensive near patient digital microfluidic system, FINDER, for the rapid assessment of severe, persistent hypoglycemia disorders in newborns using microliter volumes of whole blood. FINDER will accept single use cartridges and will multiplex 6 assays for the detection of insulin, cortisol, growth hormone, glucose, ?-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acids using < 50 µL of whole blood for all assays. Run time will be approximately 45 minutes. The team at Baebies will collaborate with leading clinical investigators in Neonatology (Dr. Michael Cotten) and Pediatric Endocrinology (Dr. Michael Freemark) at Duke University on this project. The system proposed herein addresses a critical unmet clinical need for rapid testing at the time of hypoglycemia; the final product will be substantially differentiated from current laboratory based assays in terms of lower blood volume, lower cost and faster time-to-result. The Phase I Specific Aims include: 1) optimize assay-ready reagents for on-cartridge drying and storage; 2) translate six laboratory based assays to the digital microfluidic cartridge and establish preliminary analytical performance; and 3) demonstrate preliminary feasibility of the assay panel on whole blood. The key milestone for progression to Phase II will be the successful demonstration of all individual assays on-cartridge using dry reagents and with high reliability and precision. A small feasibility study in Aim 3 will test our assay performance against clinical standard laboratory assays. The Specific Aims for Phase II are: 1) multiplex all assays to perform simultaneously on the same cartridge; 2) perform analytical validations to determine device performance; and 3) preliminary clinical validation of the hypoglycemia panel: results obtained with FINDER will be compared to standard values obtained in the Duke Clinical Laboratory. At the conclusion of Phase II, we will have a commercializable product for rapid, efficient and accurate assessment of severe hypoglycemia in newborns using microliter volumes of whole blood. We will seek FDA approval of the final product, which will initially be marketed for use in pediatric patients in U.S. hospitals, with a future market towards other patients who may benefit from the innovative features of the platform."
"9394078","PROJECT SUMMARY  Dysarthria negatively impacts functional communication and social participation for over 50% of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Although dysarthria is a disorder of speech movement, very little is known about the biomechanical factors that underlie reduced intelligibility in children with dysarthria. This lack of knowledge is a fundamental barrier to developing more effective assessment and intervention strategies. The proposed research aims to address this need by identifying biomechanical constraints that limit precise articulation and intelligible speech in children with CP. In addition, the study aims to determine the efficacy of a kinematic index of articulatory distinctiveness for quantifying articulatory imprecision in children with CP. Specific Aim 1 will use four kinematic measures (i.e., range, speed, duration, and inter-articulator coupling) of lip, tongue, and jaw movement to identify articulatory constraints in connected speech of children with dysarthria secondary to CP relative to typically-developing children, and to identify kinematic measures that contribute most to reduced speech intelligibility. We hypothesize that children with dysarthria will use inefficient movement patterns (i.e., increased or equal movement range and speed, longer durations) and have reduced coordinative flexibility (i.e., increased coupling between articulators) in sentence production, compared to typically- developing children, and that measures of articulatory coordination will best predict intelligibility. Specific Aim 2 will use the variation in tongue coupling relations across a comprehensive set of consonant and vowel contexts as an index of articulatory flexibility that can used to quantify articulatory distinctiveness, and will determine how well this kinematic measure of articulatory distinctiveness predicts intelligibility in children with dysarthria, relative to an acoustic measure of vowel distinctiveness (i.e., acoustic vowel space area). We hypothesize that the amount of variation in tongue coupling, reflecting articulatory distinctiveness of both consonants and vowels, will be a stronger predictor of intelligibility than acoustic vowel space area. The proposed research has important implications for improving theoretical understanding of the biomechanical basis of reduced speech intelligibility in children with dysarthria, and has the potential to lead to improved assessment and treatment techniques that leverage information about articulatory constraints to maximize the efficacy of speech intervention."
"9209554","The main function of the Bone Stem Cell Core (Core C) is to isolate and distribute bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs) to the investigators of the individual projects, and to provide technical support for use of the cells. A key component essential to the success of the proposed Program Project is the availability of BMSCs because all projects require these cells. Thus, a centralized Core facility for the production of quality cells is crucial to the success of this dynamically coordinated Program Project. This Core will benefit the research efforts of individual investigator by reducing costs, providing quality control for study procedures, and enhancing collaborations among multiple disciplines to achieve greater scientific gain through an integrated approach. In addition, production and distribution of cells from a centralized facility will ensure that all studies start with cells of the same lineages and background. The Specific Aims are: 1. Isolate, characterize and distribute mouse BMSCs, human bone marrow MSCs (hMSCs), and 2. Provide ongoing technical support for hypoxic and conventional MSC culture and differentiation (osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic) assays. By achieving these objectives, this Core will function as a unique resource to provide mouse and human BMSCs and technical assistance to the individual projects, as well as to other Georgia Regents University investigators who are interested in studies related to aging, metabolic bone diseases, or stem cell research."

Collaborators: Mark Pierce, PhD., Shridar Ganesan, MD, PhD. This project aims to develop a library of new nanoscale imaging probes to identify and dynamically track microlesions that trigger the rapid spread of difficult to treat diseases like metastatic cancers and atherothrombosis. By causing mortality and morbidity as well as increasing health care costs, these diseases currently take a staggering toll on society. Technologies to treat these diseases are showing improvements, but clearly would have better outcomes when integrated with early diagnoses and rapid feedback on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. In this R01 proposal, we seek to harness the transformative potential of a hitherto undeveloped region of the optical spectrum, short wave infrared (SWIR)-based imaging, by advancing tunable SWIR emitting rare earth nanoprobes. Our team has demonstrated the potential of a new family of rare earth nanoprobes to image deeper within tissues than other modalities of optical fluorescence imaging, and with little autofluorescence and reduced scattering. The specific goals of this project are to develop new SWIR imaging probes and technology to detect and track microlesions in vivo and to identify their molecular phenotype. A novel panel of multispectral rare earth doped phosphor nanoprobes with high luminescence intensity will be synthesized and tested for their photonic properties. The ability of these probes to effectively label and resolve the SWIR-emission from engineered, sub-surface diseased cell clusters will be benchmarked in vitro (Aim 1). A suite of three convergent in vivo imaging tools for the SWIR probes will be optimized in Aim 2, including the design of biofunctionalized probes for targeting to metastatic lesions of breast cancer cells, SWIR macroscopic imaging of the lesions in the lymph nodes, and SWIR in situ confocal microscopy of lesions. In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the lesion-targeted probes to detect and track the development and regression of metastatic lesions in vivo following pharmacotherapy. Outcomes from this study will include new tools for more sensitively identifying and elucidating the molecular determinants of disease lesions in vivo. Potential applications include tissue- sparing imaging of lymph node tracking for early detection of cancer metastasis, as well as imaging of vascular lesions such as those in cardiovascular disease and atherothrombosis. The envisioned impacts of the R01 would be a first-in-class imaging probe/hardware framework, equivalent to an optical biopsy in vivo, to visualize the incidence, growth, and treatment of disease microlesions, stretching beyond the currently possible limits of spatial resolution (molecular phenotyping) and detection of sub-surface diseased tissues (depth penetration)."
"9265304","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders are two commonly co-occurring, severe neuropsychiatric diseases that affect millions of Americans. Patients with these diseases similarly experience recurrent obsessions followed by compulsive behaviors aimed at reducing distressing thoughts. These debilitating, complex symptoms severely impair a patient's daily life functioning, and current available treatments may reduce the severity of symptoms but do not cure these life-long disorders. To date, the neural pathways underlying these disorders are poorly understood, highlighting a critical need for uncovering the precise neural circuit interactions behind destructive behaviors seen in these diseases. This proposal seeks to achieve a circuit-level understanding of hypothalamic pathways that control feeding and self-grooming in mice, two behaviors that are maladaptive in human eating and obsessive-compulsive disorders, respectively. Optogenetics, a technology that combines genetics with properties of light-activated channels, allows for precise control of specific neural circuit activity. Preliminary experiments utilized optogenetic approaches combined with unique animal models to map and characterize neural circuit projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the paraventricular hypothalamus, two important regions previously implicated in feeding and self-grooming behaviors. The proposal's preliminary data shows that lateral hypothalamic neurons send excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic input to paraventricular hypothalamic neurons, and light activation of this circuit projection in live animas produces voracious feeding and repetitive grooming behaviors. Importantly, evoked feeding depends on release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and loss of GABA in LH neurons results in uncontrolled grooming upon light stimulation of the same circuit projection. Additionally, optogenetic activation of PVH neurons induces repetitive grooming. These observations led to the hypothesis that separable, competing inhibitory and excitatory lateral hypothalamic neuron populations control feeding and grooming by modulating paraventricular hypothalamus neuron activity. The experiments proposed in this application will identify the specific neural circuit pathways within the hypothalamus controlling these two important behaviors, allowing for insight into the neural basis for eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders and development of novel therapeutic strategies."
"9316779","Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is characterized as an abrupt decrease in kidney function. AKI is one of the most serious and common health complications, occurring in up to 20% of all hospitalized patients and over 45% of patients in a critical care setting. AKI is particularly prevalent among populations already susceptible such as renal transplant recipients, patients with cardiac arrest, or septic shock. As the kidney is a highly vascularized organ, the complex vasculature is extremely sensitive to damage during AKI, however, the role of the microvasculature during ischemic injury is vastly understudied. The long-term goal of this study is to determine whether subtle developmental defects of the microvasculature lead to increased susceptibility to ischemic injury. Our preliminary data using conditional mouse deletion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (Flk1, expressed on endothelium) in the Foxd1 positive stromal mesenchyme demonstrates a critical role of the stromally derived endothelial cells in patterning the renal vasculature both developmentally and in the adult. Vessels appear dilated in mutants compared to controls. To test whether these endothelial cells play a critical role during ischemic injury we utilized transgenic mice where the stromally derived endothelial cells expressed red fluorescent protein and subjected these mice to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). We found that the stromally derived endothelium were particularly responsive 7 days post IRI. When we performed IRI or drug induced AKI with the conditional knockout mice we found that these animals had more severe renal injury including a reduction in perfusion, increase in hypoxia and severe tubular damage. Taken together we hypothesize that stromally derived endothelium are critical mediators for kidney injury."
"9252234","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The microenvironment within tumors is significantly different from normal tissue. The chaotic vasculature leads to transient or chronic hypoxia which leads to acidification of the interstitial space. This creates a cytotoxic environment for normal cells while favoring tumor growth through degradation of extracellular matrix, induction of angiogenic factors, enhanced migration, and immunologic evasion. Our application focuses on the mechanisms that regulate acidification. We have assembled a group of outstanding investigators and will use state-of-the-art approaches to provide new insights in control of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. Our overall goal is to understand the role of membrane-bound carbonic anhydrases, whose catalytic domains face the extracellular milieu, in controlling acidification in breast cancer. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that membrane bound carbonic anhydrase is mechanistically responsible for regulating pH in the tumor microenvironment. Increased carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) expression in primary breast cancers is a marker for hypoxia, an indicator of poor prognosis, and associated with high-grade estrogen receptor negative tumors. For unknown reasons, carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII) expression in breast cancer is an indicator of good prognosis. Few investigators have studied CAIX or CAXII in the native breast cancer environment, as we propose, which will provide the most accurate appraisal of their roles in pH control. We have developed the methodology to compare the kinetics of these two proteins to determine if differences in their intrinsic activity r environment underlie this paradox. We challenge the current paradigm that CAIX contributes solely to the development of the acidic tumor microenvironment. Rather, our data suggest that CAIX has the ability to balance tumor extracellular pH by improving extracellular buffering using the CO2/bicarbonate system. In contrast, CAXII is a better enzyme at higher pH. The aims of our proposal are: 1.) To compare the kinetics of CAIX and CAXII in basal B and luminal breast cancer cells. 2.) To analyze the mechanism(s) by which breast cancer cells control extracellular pH. 3.) To assess the role of CA on pH control in xenograft breast cancer tumors comprised of breast cancer cells and human tissue grafts. These data will be particularly important for those women who have triple negative breast cancers. These cancers are strongly associated with CAIX expression, predominate in the minority populations, and have no specific treatment modalities. We believe that our proposal has high impact as it uses innovative approaches, addresses unique hypotheses, may reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer, has applicability to other cancer types, and has a great chance of success."
"9312723","The pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and its subsequent accumulation into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and other hyperphosphorylated tau-containing inclusions are defining histopathological features of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and several other neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies. These diseases affect millions of people in the United States and exact enormous personal and financial costs on those afflicted and their loved ones. However, while amyloid-? (A?) and tau aggregates in the brain are the common pathological hallmarks of AD, the disease is heterogeneous with different comorbid pathologies and symptom progression rates. Recent studies suggest that NFTs are not the most toxic tau entities in tauopathies; rather tau oligomers?soluble intermediates between monomers and NFTs?have emerged as an important drug target due to their toxicity, seeding potency, and ability to propagate a specific abnormal tau conformation and thus initiate widespread tau pathology. Our data suggest that oligomers composed of different proteins might give rise to increased and diverse tau oligomerization, resulting in different pathologies and phenotypes that sometimes overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases. The dynamic and hydrophobic nature of tau oligomers allows for the formation of heterogeneous populations of aggregates that include distinct tau oligomeric conformers (strains). In this proposal we will test the tau oligomeric strain hypothesis in AD by defining strain characteristics and potential mechanisms of strain formation and propagation. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that diverse tau oligomeric strains are found in AD brain and CSF. Specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that brain-derived tau oligomeric strains arise from cross-seeding other amyloidogenic proteins and propagate pathology in vivo. This research proposal will yield useful results with great potential to advance the development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications to target toxic tau oligomers in AD. The elucidation of different tau oligomeric strains and their roles in disease progression may reveal novel therapeutic strategies and identify upstream drug targets for treating AD. Moreover, a better understanding of tau strains could help identify useful approaches for screening the best drug candidates. Finally, it could provide novel insights into the design of future clinical trials and introduce the exciting possibility of personalized medicine to treat AD and other tauopathies."
"9350731","Following the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA), there is increased activity of glutamate neurons within the subthalamic nucleus. These excitatory neurons project to the internal globus pallidus [GPi, or entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in the rodent], which utilizes the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid). In Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the GPi results in improvement in motor function and provides symptomatic relief. However in a rodent PD model, stimulation of the EPN/GPi did not result in any protection against motor deficits or DA loss following acute intrastriatal infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine. DBS could also be damaging the fibers of passage. However, directly decreasing GABA release from the EPN/GPi neurons without affecting the fibers of passage could answer this concern. Since EPN/GPi neurons utilize the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) for uptake of GABA into synaptic vesicles, deletion of this gene would selectively decrease the release of GABA from those EPN/GPi neurons.  Using the Cre/loxP recombinase gene technology where a specific gene can be silenced, effecting GABA release from the EPN/GPi GABA neurons, can be achieved through deleting a targeted gene in the specific brain area by injecting AAV-Cre into mice that are floxed for the GABA transporter, VGAT (Vgatflox/flox). To determine if deletion of the Vgat gene in the GPi/EPN can be neuroprotective against DA terminal and cell loss using the neurotoxin, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), we find that unilateral infusion of AAV-Cre-GFP (green fluorescent protein) into the EPN/GPi labeled approximately 80-90% of those GABA neurons, as determined by GFP staining of EPN/GPi neurons, and increased GABA immuno-gold labeling within the terminals of the motor thalamus (i.e., the EPN/GPi projects to the motor thalamus). As measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, this resulted in a bilateral protection from the loss of DA terminals in the striatum and improved motor function. There was partial protection (~50%) from TH/DA neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Following neurointervention, with unilateral AAV- cre-GFP infusion into the EPN/GPi followed immediately by MPTP treatment (MPTP/Cre), we find that there is improved motor strength and increased TH protein expression in the striatum and SNpc in the MPTP/Cre vs MPTP only group. Using an additional PD animal model, in which AAV-alpha synuclein (A-Syn) is bilaterally infused into the SNpc, prior deletion of the Vgat gene in the EPN/GPi with AAV-Cre (i.e., protection) resulted in improved motor strength and blockade of TH/DA cell loss in the SNpc compared to the A-Syn only group.  The overall goal of this project is to determine whether unilateral deletion of the Vgat gene, in 2 animal models of PD, within the EPN/GPi, following (i.e., neurorestoration, a more translationally relevant model) either progressive administration of MPTP or intranigral infusion of A-Syn, can bilaterally reverse the loss of DA within the nigrostriatal pathway in both young and aged mice. An additional goal is to determine the role of glutamate in the striatum in reversing the DA depletion due to MPTP. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1.) determine if unilateral deletion of the Vgat gene within the EPN/GPi initiated 4 weeks after progressive MPTP administration can bilaterally reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and improve motor function in both young and aged mice, 2.) determine if unilateral deletion of the Vgat gene within the EPN/GPi initiated 8 weeks following bilateral infusion of AAV-A-Syn (mutant form: A53T) into the substantia nigra pars compacta can bilaterally reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and improve motor function in both young and aged mice and 3.) determine if the mechanism behind the striatal TH/DA restoration in the MPTP-treated mice following deletion of the Vgat gene within the EPN/GPi is due to increased striatal glutamate. Glutamate antagonists will be infused into the striatum to determine if this will block the DA recovery due to deletion of the Vgat gene in the EPN/GPi following MPTP."
"9227819","Project Summary/Abstract C. difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings with about 453.000 cases and 29,000 deaths yearly in US per CDC report in 2015. A continual rise in severe CDI has been observed worldwide due to the emergence of hypervirulent strains. CDI symptoms range from diarrhea to intestinal inflammation/lesion and death. Symptoms are mainly caused by two exotoxins TcdA and TcdB, which glucosylate Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42 within cells, leading to disruption of cytoskeleton and tight junctions. Both toxins share similar domain structures, including the N-terminal glucosyltransferase domain (GT), the autocatalytic cysteine proteinase domain (CPD), the translocation domain (TMD), and the C-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD). Only the GT is released into cytosol after auto-cleavage of the toxin by its CPD. The course of CDI is characterized by an initial intestinal inflammatory process followed by a systemic inflammatory response. However, the mechanism by which TcdA/TcdB induce a potent inflammatory response, the hallmark of the disease, is unclear. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms mediating intestinal inflammation by C. difficile toxins and to utilize this knowledge for designing better interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of CDI. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of TPL2 in the pathogenesis of CDI. We hypothesize that TPL2 ablation will down regulate TcdA/TcdB-induced activation of MAPK, leading to reduced TNF-? / IL-6 production, thus reducing toxin-caused intestinal inflammation, tissue injury and mortality. To test our hypothesis, two specific aims will be pursued. In aim 1, we will evaluate the role of TPL2 in the pathogenesis of CDI using mouse models. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of TPL2 in the signaling pathway mediating TcdA/TcdB-induced production of TNF-? and IL-6 by bone marrow-derived macrophages."
"9237864","Project Summary Alcohol associated health problems are a major medical burden in industrialized countries. Patients with alcoholic liver disease show intestinal bacterial dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability. Disease severity correlates with systemic levels of translocated bacterial products. Although there is considerable progress in understanding the interaction between the host and intestinal bacteria, the role of the intestinal fungal microbiome (also called mycobiome) in alcoholic liver disease has not been investigated. Results from an international collaboration by Schnabl, Stärkel and Fouts laboratories suggest that quantitative changes in the intestinal mycobiome and translocation of fungal products occur in a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease, while deep sequencing demonstrates intestinal fungal dysbiosis in patients with chronic alcohol abuse. Reducing intestinal fungal overgrowth with antifungals or restoring intestinal barrier function using probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii ameliorates experimental alcoholic liver disease. The central hypothesis of this proposed collaborative research application implicates disturbances in the intestinal mycobiome as an important etiological factor in the modulation of hepatic and systemic inflammation, and the development of alcoholic liver disease. We predict that chronic alcohol suppresses the intestinal immune system and facilitates qualitative and quantitative changes in the intestinal mycobiome. Fungal products such as ?-glucan translocate to the portal circulation and liver, and cause progression of alcoholic liver disease. Towards this goal, we will use pharmacological interventions, supplementation of probiotics and genetically modified mice in preclinical mouse models of alcoholic liver disease (Aim 1). We will characterize the intestinal mycobiome in patients with alcohol abuse, mild and progressive alcoholic liver disease. We predict that translocated fungal products correlate with levels of systemic and hepatic inflammation, and with the degree of liver disease (Aim 2). We believe these studies will provide important insights into alcohol-mediated changes of the intestinal mycobiome that result in fungal translocation. Eventually this approach might lead to new therapeutic targets for patients with alcoholic liver disease."
"9327211","Project Abstract: Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental principle of the nervous system and underlies many neurobiological processes including neurodevelopment, sensory processing, and memory storage. New gene transcription is required for long-lasting plasticity, and this requirement for transcription indicates that signals from stimulated synapses must reach the nucleus via synaptonuclear signaling. One such mechanism of synaptonuclear signaling that is essential for long-term plasticity is the physical translocation of signaling proteins from the synapse to the nucleus. While a few dozen proteins are known to undergo activity- dependent synapse-to-nucleus translocation, little work has been done to systematically identify the population of proteins that undergo this translocation. Moreover, little is known about the gene expression programs that these synaptonuclear signaling proteins initiate. This project aims to: 1) Characterize the gene regulatory role of an exemplar synaptonuclear signaling protein, CREB-Regulated Transcriptional Coactivator 1 (CRTC1); and 2) Systematically identify proteins that undergo synapse-to-nucleus translocation during plasticity. For the first aim, electrophysiology will be used to characterize late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in acute hippocampal slices from CRTC1 conditional knockout mice to study the function of CRTC1 in long-lasting plasticity. These studies will be complemented with RNA sequencing to determine the role of CRTC1 in the transcriptional programs that give rise to long-term plasticity. In the second aim, novel synaptonuclear signaling proteins will be identified using a biochemical screen. In brief, mass spectrometry will be used to identify synaptic proteins that are bound to the importin ?1 nuclear transport complex and are therefore likely to be cargo destined for nuclear import. Candidate proteins will be studied in the context of synaptic plasticity. Identifying novel proteins that translocate from synapse to nucleus will provide insight into the types of signals that translocate during plasticity, and the identity and function of these synaptonuclear signaling proteins will provide insights into the regulation of gene expression during plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is widely involved in neurological function and dysfunction, and therefore addressing these fundamental questions about synaptic plasticity will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9274445","NIH S10 equipment proposal: From genomics to natural language processing:  A protected environment for research computing in the health sciences. Health sciences researchers are often required to manage, mine, and analyze restricted patient data (Protected Health Information, PHI) to facilitate and advance their research aims. They are often required to do this without access to central information technology expertise or resources to facilitate their research aims. These researchers are often left to their own devices to ?solve? their research compute and data needs and are challenged due to lack of available resources, barriers from central IT, and/or lack of knowledge of available resources. A further challenge is that ?small? data sets? data that researchers could formerly handle on office resources?have morphed and grown into the big data domain through the explosion of technical advances and significant expansion in various research directions. Examples include: genomics research, image analysis, simulation, natural language processing, and mining of EMRs. Therefore, the need exists to develop a framework for managing and processing this data securely and reliably. This S10 equipment proposal is to replace the ?protected environment? (PE) prototype the University of Utah?s Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and Department of Biomedical Informatics built six years ago and has operated since. The PE consists of both high performance computing and virtual machine (VM) components and associated storage sufficient to manage, protect and analyze HIPAA protected health information. This environment has been very successful and has grown significantly in scope. CHPC isolated this protected environment in the secured University of Utah Downtown Data Center and setup a network protected logical partition that provided research groups specific access to individual data sets. As the environment and technology developed, CHPC added additional security features such as two-factor authentication for entry and audit/monitoring. Unfortunately, the prototype has reached the point where demand is surpassing capability and all the hardware is aged and off-warranty. To give an idea of users of the virtual machine farm component, the Biomedical Informatics Core (BMIC) REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) environment for data collection has over 2,500 users in 1,500 projects supporting over $25M in NIH funding at the University of Utah, including support for more than 25 active NIH R-01 grants. Moreover, the HIPAA compliant protected environment was a key factor that aided passing the recent University of Utah HIPAA audit. The ?protected environment? also helped the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and the BMIC justify the NCATS Center Clinical and Translational Science award (1ULTR001067)."
"9280315","SUMMARY ? ABSTRACT: The ?Active Sensing? perspective posits that acquisition of sensory information is enabled by overt motor behavior (e.g., saccadic scanning) and/or covert attentional operations. Understanding active sensing is crucial for unraveling the nature of the brain's interaction with the environment. The projects in this Center, including the human ECoG studies, the more invasive cellular and cell circuit studies in monkeys, and the statistical/ computational modeling studies that interface at each level of analysis, all join to investigate how the motor and attentional systems influence and participate in sensing. Numerous findings suggest that the thalamus also plays a central role in Active Sensing and one that is far more complex than previously recognized. This underscores the value of monkey studies in this Center, because direct access to the thalamus is extremely rare in human neurophysiology. A final reason to pursue monkey studies in this center is that investigations at the cellular/circuit levels of analysis bridge the gap between ECoG measurements in humans and biophysically realistic computational modeling studies directly testing models' predictions and sharpening the physiological interpretation of electrophysiological findings in humans. Our specific aims are: AIM 1 - Investigate motor involvement in auditory sensory processing. We will test the hypotheses that 1) the motor system is a source of auditory cortical rhythms, and 2) motor and premotor regions help to actively suppress distracting information. AIM 2 - Examine extralemniscal thalamic modulation of cortical synchrony and communication. We will test the hypothesis that the thalamic Matrix plays a key role in phase reset and rhythmic entrainment in auditory cortices. AIM 3 - Define neurophysiological mechanisms generating specific ECoG signals. We will use laminar LFP/CSD and MUA profiles to identify the cell populations and physiological processes that generate ECoG components analogous to those seen under the same conditions in humans. CENTER SYNERGIES: This project interacts directly with Project 3, which uses the identical auditory tasks in human ECoG studies and also with Project 1, which uses conceptually similar, albeit visual, tasks in human ECoG studies. Supported by Core A, we will interact strongly with Project 2, to aid their implementation of laminar recording methods, and to harmonize conceptual aspects of the visual and auditory studies. Supported by Core B and Project 1 and 2's PIs we will implement r-fMRI and DTI studies in our monkeys. We will feed data to Core C for eventual sharing. Finally, we will provide data to Project 5 to help build and refine cell-circuit computational models, and adjust our studies to test model predictions as the project progresses. Ultimately, the Center's investigators plan to combine models across network and cellular circuit levels."
"9242701","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study comprises a randomized controlled trial to examine 1) the effectiveness of TeachTown: Basics, one of the only evidence-based computer-assisted intervention (CAI) packages for students with autism; 2) the extent to which teachers implement TeachTown the way it was designed; 3) the effects of its use on other evidence-based practices; and 4) organizational and teacher variables that mediate changes in the use of evidence-based practices when TeachTown is introduced. While there has been a rush to take advantage of CAI, there is little research on whether it will result in better outcomes for student with autism, and be feasible or sustainable in community settings. While CAI has the potential to increase instructional time for students with autism, it may result instead in teachers reducing their use of other evidence-based practices, including the amount of interpersonal (as opposed to computer) instruction students receive. While the related constructs of exnovation, de-implementation and de-adoption have been used to describe this phenomenon for more than 30 years, they rarely have been systematically studied.  The proposed study takes advantage of an ongoing rollout of TeachTown in the School District of Philadelphia. TeachTown includes a computerized instruction component, combined with offline, interpersonal instruction between the student and teacher. It is not known whether public schools have the resources to implement programs like this, regardless of their efficacy, or whether or how teachers will incorporate them into the instructional day. An especially important question is whether existing evidence-based practices are exnovated as TeachTown is implemented. To address these questions, we rely on our longstanding collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia, the 8th largest school district in the US. At the beginning of the school year, we will inventory relevant technology and observe how it is used in the District's 83 kindergarten-through-second-grade autism support classrooms. We also will survey teachers and school administrators about expectations, support and rewards for using these technologies and attitudes, norms and self-efficacy regarding the use of these technologies. We then will use a waitlist-control randomized design to examine TeachTown's effects on student outcomes and use of other practices. We will unpack the impact of the implementation of TeachTown on existing evidence-based practices using direct observation and through qualitative interviews. The waitlist design allows the district to roll out the intervention to all classrooms, which is their intent. It also allows s to increase our sample to study moderators of sustainment of existing EBPs when a new technology is introduced. The proposed study would be one of the first to examine longitudinally the uptake of new technology for children with ASD in school settings, and the first to address use of CAI. Successful completion of this study will identify malleable targets for intervention to increase the use of CAI, should that appear warranted, while sustaining existing EBPs for children with autism in community settings."
"9327723","ABSTRACT Regenerative medicine therapies seek to replace cells or pathological tissues with engineered substitutes, but robust methods for precisely orchestrating activities of transplanted cells do not exist. This is especially true in pathological conditions that arise from chronic diseases, in which normal homeostatic and regenerative cues are overridden by deleterious signals, leading to cell death and loss of organ function. The goal of this proposal is to develop technologies that couple highly specific interactions between stem cells and their environments with programmed cellular outputs, such as homing, differentiation, matrix synthesis, and cytokine / growth factor secretion. We have developed a synthetic receptor platform that allows cells to recognize ligands through specificity imparted by carefully selected single chain variable fragments (scFv). Upon engagement of immobilized ligand (either membrane- or substrate-tethered) by this scFv receptor, engineered cells deploy a pre-defined program that dictates the outcome of cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Though we have used this platform to drive various behaviors in other cell types, we have not established its utility for guiding stem cell functions that are pertinent to regenerative medicine. We hypothesize that this synthetic sensory platform can enable stem cells to autonomously implement regenerative programs, such as homing, differentiation, or matrix synthesis, in response to cell-cell and cell-biomaterial interactions. In Specific Aim 1, we will establish our ability to link specific external signals to defined changes in stem cell states, including migration, differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis. In Specific Aim 2, we will incorporate ligands recognized by our synthetic receptors into biomaterial scaffolds. In this way, we will produce cellular delivery vehicles and tissue engineering scaffolds that enable the cells to self-select programmed behaviors with engineered, context-dependent specificity and precision. By implementing this novel sense and response system in regenerative medicine strategies, we intend to produce stem cell therapies capable of autonomously detecting features of a microenvironment and responding with a coordinated regenerative program that restores function, even in the absence of cues normally required for cell-based repair. This fellowship will provide me with the experience and tools critical for my goal of developing into a productive, independent scientist while also contributing key insights toward stem cell-based and biomaterial-guided tissue regeneration and repair."
"9255709","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis (CF), are the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, with costs exceeding $150B/year. A major obstacle to evaluate therapies for these diseases is that currently available tools to assess lung function are either insensitive to early disease or unsuitable for longitudinal use. Though ubiquitous, pulmonary function testing via spirometry is highly variable and insensitive to early and regional disease; bronchoscopy is insensitive to regional disease and invasive. While chest CT is sensitive to regional abnormalities, it provides little functional information, and radiation exposure limits its long- term and repeated use, particularly in children. An emerging solution to this pressing need is hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe MRI, which provides quantitative markers of regional lung function. Currently, this technology is available only in larger research centers, primarily because it is regulated as a drug/device combination. Our long-term goal is to build a business that broadly deploys non-invasive, high-resolution HP 129Xe MRI to accel- erate treatment discovery and personalized care for lung diseases. The objective of this application is to estab- lish a marketable 129Xe hyperpolarizer and perform pediatric testing required by FDA for HP 129Xe approval and dissemination. To accomplish this objective, we will: 1) demonstrate the superior sensitivity of HP 129Xe MRI to conventional spirometry; 2) document human factors/usability studies and polarizer design under FDA-device control guidelines; and 3) demonstrate safety and utility in pediatric subjects, specifically CF patients. The ra- tionale for the project is that unlike other common chronic lung diseases, which have poorly understood dis- ease etiology and display variable disease trajectories and long time-courses, CF lung disease is caused by mutations in a single gene and displays predictable and rapid progression in adolescent CF patients, providing an ideal means to test HP 129Xe MRI against spirometry. Guided by our Phase I SBIR successes and strong preliminary data, we will accomplish these goals through three Specific Aims: 1) commission and operationally qualify a compact 129Xe hyperpolarizer; 2) demonstrate superior ability of HP 129Xe ventilation MRI to quantify 1-year lung function decline in adolescent CF patients, compared to spirometry; and 3) determine the contribu- tion of permanent airway remodeling to ventilation abnormalities. The proposed approach is innovative, be- cause it leverages improved polarization technology and end-user experience to obtain FDA mandated human factors data, meets FDA requirements for pediatric testing, and capitalizes on well-characterized decline in ad- olescent CF lung function. The proposed research is significant, because it will enable HP 129Xe technology that is easily disseminated, installed, and operated to be marketed to guide therapy development and patient treatment in all chronic lung diseases. Further, the proposed research has direct translational implications, be- cause it will provide much needed structure/function data to inform personalized care for pediatric CF patients."
"9254590","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant represents the primary focus of our lab: understanding the effects of PGC-1 coactivators on vascular biology, and translating findings into clinically relevant avenues. During the current period of this grant, we have focused on mechanisms and physiological effects of the generation of new blood vessels by PGC-1s in muscle, heart, and elsewhere. We now propose to extend these studies to understanding the quality of the new vessels as well, specifically focusing on the ability of these vessels to transport fatty acids to the underlying skeletal myocytes. In type II diabetes, the accumulation of incompletely esterified fatty acids in skeletal muscle, i.e. lipotoxicity, is a proximate cause of insulin resistance. Because all blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells, fats must traverse through the endothelial barrier in order to be delivered to tissues. Remarkably, very little is known about how fats do this, and what molecules might regulate the process. We describe here the identification of a novel metabolite, regulated by PGC-1alpha, and secreted from skeletal myocytes, which signals endothelial cells to increase trans-endothelial fatty acid transport. We hypothesize that excess concentrations of this metabolite drives fatty acid uptake into myotubes, leading to inhibition of insulin signaling and glucose intolerance. We propose experiments to  1) Test the effect of this metabolite on lipotoxicity and insulin signaling in muscle, and on systemic glucose  metabolism in intact animals.  2) Identify molecular mechanisms by which the metabolite modulates fatty acid handling in endothelial  cells, including identifying its receptor.  3) Test if inhibition of endothelial fatty acid transport can protect from diabetes in both diet-induced and  genetic murine models of diabetes. Lipid trafficking in and out of tissues is at the heart of diabetes, and yet little is known of how lipid get across the most prevalent barrier to travel: the vessel wall. The proposed work thus stands to identify a number of novel vascular targets for the treatment of diabetes and its complications."

"9257440","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks continuation funding to develop and support a vast archive of large-scale microdata drawn from 163 censuses of 43 European and Asian countries enumerated over the past half century. These data are a vital component of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), one of the most intensively-used resources for population and health research. The improved and expanded database will allow investigators to make comparisons across dozens of countries during decades of transformative change and will result in substantial new health-related analyses of the interrelationships of economic development, fertility and mortality decline, international migration, and family change. The Eurasian microdata archive represents a permanent and substantial contribution to the world's population research infrastructure. By making these data easily accessible to researchers and developing comprehensive and comprehensible documentation, the project is stimulating new scientific studies that transcends national boundaries and static interpretation. The project has four major goals: (1) Expand the database, adding data for six new countries and new 2010 round samples for countries currently in the database. (2) Enhance data and metadata, including new geographic coding to better support consistent cross-national and cross-temporal analysis, a new internationally-comparable living standards index based on housing characteristics, and a new socioeconomic indicator based on occupation and educational attainment. (3) Improve data infrastructure and access by implementing an Application Programming Interface, innovative new data structures, and a virtual data enclave. (4) Ensure dissemination and sustainability through user support, training and outreach, and implementation of a new plan to ensure long-run preservation of the data and metadata. This infrastructure is a basic resource for health research and policy analysis. Models and descriptions of the past underlie both theories of past social change and projections into the future. Accordingly, the data series provides a unique laboratory for the study of health and demographic processes and provides the empirical foundation we need for developing and testing social and economic models. ."
"9445517","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary sphingolipids such as sphingosine and ceramide promote enterocyte turnover and have been shown to protect against intestinal tumorigenesis in mice. However, sphingosine taken up by enterocytes can be phosphorylated by the oncogenic enzyme SphK1, generating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a mitogenic lipid that inhibits apoptosis and promotes inflammation, transformation and carcinogenesis. Thus, dietary sphingolipids represent a double-edged sword in colon cancer. Elucidating their specific roles in carcinogenesis is a necessary first step to developing sphingolipid-based strategies to lower colon cancer risk. S1P is irreversibly degraded by the enzyme S1P lyase (SPL) which is highly expressed in enterocytes and other cellular compartments of the gut mucosa. We showed previously that SPL is downregulated in ApcMin/+ mouse adenomas and human colon cancers. We now show that SPL is also downregulated in tumors that develop in azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-treated mice. Thus, SPL downregulation is a common feature of intestinal neoplasia. We generated gut-specific SPL knockout mice (SPLGutKO) and demonstrated that loss of enterocyte SPL expression promotes tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice and enhances colitis, enterocyte proliferation and tumor incidence in AOM/DSS-treated mice. Loss of SPL expression was associated with increased activation of STAT3, a critical regulator of inflammation, carcinogenesis and interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment or niche. STAT3 acts as a transcription factor with many mRNA and microRNA targets. STAT3 has also been shown to regulate mitochondrial functions. Importantly, we found that inhibition of STAT3 prevented the ability of SPL disruption to promote tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS and xenograft model systems. In addition to these findings, we recently identified a family of soy-derived sphingolipids called sphingadienes (SDs) with chemopreventive action in mice. SDs promote enterocyte turnover, inhibit STAT3, WNT and AKT signaling pathways and, importantly, induce SPL expression in colon cancer cell lines. Our cumulative findings have led us to propose our central hypothesis, which states that: SPL downregulation promotes colon carcinogenesis through STAT3-dependent mechanisms that influence intestinal epithelial cells and other cellular compartments of the tumor niche. We further propose that SDs serve as an antidote to SPL downregulation by reversing it and its associated effects on colon inflammation and carcinogenesis. To test our hypothesis, we have devised four Specific Aims: 1) To clarify how S1P promotes cell transformation and tumorigenesis; 2) To elucidate the role of SPL in modulating the tumor niche; 3) To establish whether SPL downregulation promotes intestinal tumorigenesis induced by a pro-inflammatory diet; 4) To test whether SDs can reverse SPL downregulation and its associated effects during intestinal tumorigenesis. In accomplishing these aims, we should achieve our two major goals: to elucidate the biology of SPL in colon cancer, and to develop chemopreventive strategies that work by reactivation of SPL."

The MACS was funded by NIAID and NCI in 1983, with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men. With the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the MACS became also a study of the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases associated with aging. MACS participants, including 1808 enrolled in SHARE, have been followed semiannually since 1984 and have provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens. Evaluating and following the prevalent and incident cases of HIV infection in SHARE and the MACS has provided key insights into risk factors for infection with HIV, monitoring and mechanisms of progression of HIV infection once it is established, host defense against HIV, genetic factors affecting HIV pathogenesis, and use, efficacy, and adverse effects of different types of therapy for HIV and related illnesses. SHARE and MACS are currently recruiting new participants who are receiving more recent cART regimens that are more potent, safer, and more convenient than older regimens, and which are initiated earlier in the course of HIV infection; this recruitment will be completed by the end of the current funding period in March, 2014.  The specific aims of SHARE for the 2014-9 renewal period reflect those of the MACs and are to determine: the effect of evolving, earlier initiated c ART regimens on HIV-induced inflammation and immune dysfunction; the occurrence of and risk factors for emerging, non-AIDS-defining, high morbidity outcomes according to HIV infection and new c ART regimens; the determinants for incidence, progression and survival of malignancies, both AIDS- and non-AIDS-defining; the biologic and physiologic effects of treated HIV infection on the aging process; the relationships of substance use and psychosocial factors of aging in HIV infection with adherence, coping skills, resiliency, depression and quality of life and genetic factors associated with resistance to and control of HIV infection. SHARE will contribute to these goals through leadership of eight MACS working groups focusing on these topics, and through local studies focusing on liver disease, energy metabolism, cytomegalovirus infection, and regulation of immune activation and inflammation. These aims can be achieved only through continued follow-up of this extremely well-characterized cohort. SHARE and the MACS should continue to play a leading role in studies that will foster better treatments and prevention of HIV infection."
"9309382","Project Summary. The goal of this project is to define the interactions between RNA polymerase II, the basal and regulatory transcription factors, and the chromatin template that lead to accurate transcription initiation and productive elongation. Using a combination of approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system, several fundamental aspects of gene expression will be studied. Specific Aim 1 will continue our studies of how transcription intersects with chromatin modifications. We will probe the function of the Set1/COMPASS complex, which methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). Methylation is co-transcriptional, and H3K4 trimethylation is strongest at the nucleosome nearest the transcription start site, while dimethylation predominates further downstream through the next few nucleosomes. This aim will explore how Set1/COMPASS is recruited to transcription complexes and how the gradient of methylation is created. In the previous funding period we successfully developed a pipeline for proteomic analysis of both initiation and elongation complexes using immobilized chromatin templates and quantitative mass spectrometry. Specific Aim 2 will exploit these systems to further define the events and factors that drive the transcription cycle forward. We also test a new model for how TFIID functions. In Specific Aim 3, our immobilized template transcription system will be combined with single-molecule TIRF microscopy to visualize transcription in real time. We will analyze the interaction kinetics between factors and the transcription template. Interesting findings in all these aims will be validated in vivo using the genetic, genomic, and molecular techniques our lab has developed over many years. The experiments in these three specific aims will significantly increase our understanding of the RNA polymerase II transcription reaction and its interactions with the chromatin template. Although the project uses a model system, mechanisms of transcription are highly conserved in eukaryotes and, based on past experience, the results are likely to be directly applicable to human gene expression. This fundamental knowledge is essential for understanding how mutations in transcription factors and histone modifying enzymes lead to diseases such as cancer and developmental defects."
"9295682","Abstract Rapid progress in the discovery of disease biomarkers commands the development of high-performance detection systems that can achieve the requisite levels of speed, sensitivity and accuracy. With extraordinary sensitivity and dynamic range, solid state nanopore (ssNP)-based electrical counting methods are the leading candidates to meet this need. In processing one molecule at a time however, ssNPs must overcome a major challenge in throughput before they can be used to analyze clinical samples. This project will develop a novel dual membrane device (NPN/ ssNP) to address two critical issues limiting nanopore performance: short lifetimes and diffusion-limited capture rates. The enabling feature of the device is the addition of a highly porous silicon nanomembrane (NPN) immediately upstream of the ssNP. The membrane serves as a filter to prevent clogging and enables microfluidic delivery of biomarkers. When combined with parallelization and biomarker amplification, the dual membrane device should yield a 106 improvement in throughput, enabling ssNP technology to detect biomarkers at sub-picomolar clinical concentrations in practical time periods (minutes). The project will establish proof-of- principle in work organized under three Aims. Aim 1 thoroughly characterize the new device and produce an optimum configuration for DNA capture. Aim 2 will elucidate the benefits of microfluidic delivery of sample. Finally, Aim 3 will apply the lessons of Aims 1 and 2 to maximum benefit and demonstrate the detection of fM concentrations of biomarker in under 10 minutes from 10 ul of blood plasma."
"9284878","ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods, through policy and practice changes and capacity-building. At the client level, the intervention targets healthy food demand, using behavioral economic and educational approaches. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), the nutritional quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, measured by a Hunger Relief Nutrition Index. The study also aims to improve implementation of policies and practices that promote a nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews. As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee families. After a 1-year needs assessment, an intervention will be conducted in 2 waves in Years 2-3. Years 4-5 will be focused on analysis and local and regional dissemination through channels supported by our partnering agencies. This work capitalizes on a palpable local momentum towards improving the hunger relief system. Research aims address the need for a system- wide approach to improving the hunger relief network and evaluation of its impact on client outcomes."
"9263316","OVERVIEW Myanmar Regional Center of Excellence for Malaria Research Shortly before NIAID announced the ICEMR program in 2009, artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria appeared in Southeast Asia [1,2], posing a serious threat to global malaria control and elimination [3,4]. As a leading center for research on the emergence and spread of drug resistant malaria in Africa [5-9], our group was asked by the World Health Organization (WHO) and regional partners to help design and lead a series of clinical and genomic epidemiology studies to identify and validate molecular markers for artemisinin resistance in Asia [10-15]. Based in part on our findings about the patterns of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in the region [14], in 2015 the WHO abandoned its strategy of trying to contain artemisinin resistance, and the World Health Assembly approved a new WHO recommendation to launch a campaign to completely eliminate falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia [16]. Along with other countries at the 2015 East Asia Summit, Myanmar, the emerging democracy formerly known as Burma, and the Southeast Asian country with by far the greatest malaria burden [17], endorsed a plan for malaria elimination in the region by 2030.  To achieve this daunting goal, innovative tools are needed for malaria surveillance, treatment and prevention. Because the heaviest concentrations of malaria in Myanmar and neighboring countries are found in border and conflict areas that are often out of reach of national health systems, malaria elimination?and malaria research in support of elimination?requires a multi-sectoral, cross-border approach. Building on the foundation of a successful malaria research program that we created in Myanmar in 2012 with NIAID grant support, and working closely with local and regional partners, we now propose to establish a new ICEMR centered in Myanmar, with sites in central Myanmar and on both sides of its borders with China and Bangladesh. Integrating findings from clinical and field research, including molecular surveillance, genomic epidemiology and geospatial mapping and modeling of malaria risk, we will conduct innovative multidisciplinary research that will provide essential knowledge, tools, and evidence-based strategies for national malaria control programs and their partners to control, treat and ultimately eliminate malaria in Southeast Asia."
"9246334","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are an important, yet often overlooked, component of fertility in animals from insects to mammals. Sfps have significant effects on the reproductive physiology of mated females, on storage and release of sperm inside females and, as recently shown in mice, on the phenotype of progeny. Male animals abnormal for specific Sfps are sterile or subfertile; evidence for this extends to humans. Some Sfps bind tightly to sperm; others remain in the seminal plasma and therefore are removed during some Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs). Yet despite their importance in reproduction, little is known about exactly how Sfps act to influence the female. This proposal combines genetic, physiological, evolutionary, and protein methodologies to address two pressing questions about Sfps' action: (1) How, precisely, do Sfps interact with the female to cause post- mating effects? (2) How do Sfps bind tightly to sperm and exert effects on sperm storage? We address these by using the experimental strengths of Drosophila, which we have established as a premier genetic model system with which to dissect Sfp function and whose Sfps have many molecular and phenomenological parallels to those of mammals. To address the first question, Aim 1 focuses on ovulin, a Drosophila Sfp that stimulates ovulation. Ovulin induces octopaminergic signaling, which in turn regulates muscle contraction in the reproductive tract, causing an increase in ovulation rate. We will identify the female's receptor for ovulin (OvR) by testing our candidate GPCRs for ovulation phenotypes upon knockdown, and for binding to ovulin in cultured cells. Then, using targeted knockdowns of OvR we will test the hypothesis that ovulin acts directly on the nervous system. We also will determine whether the proteolytic processing of ovulin that occurs when it enters the female enhances ovulin's activity and its binding to OvR. To address the mechanism and function of sperm-bound Sfps, Aim 2 focuses on the Drosophila sex peptide, SP. We recently defined a network of Sfps that binds SP to sperm. We will test whether male contributions are sufficient for SP's sperm binding, or whether females also contribute factors, by determining whether SP can bind to sperm in pure ejaculates. We will then identify the sperm protein that is required for SP binding. SP action is required to efficiently release sperm from storage. In the final part of Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that SP does so through the nervous system (and octopaminergic signaling) rather than by action within the sperm storage organs. Elucidating how Sfps interact with and affect the female at the molecular level is a very new area that is only now becoming amenable to study. Results of the proposed work are relevant to understanding and diagnosing Sfp-based infertilities and in considering strategies for ARTs, which may benefit from inclusion of critical Sfps. Additionally, understanding reproductive molecules in Dipteran insects will assist in strategies to control mosquitoes that transmit viruses that cause serious human diseases like dengue and malaria."
"9345346","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to identify genetic contributors to respiratory control and hypoxia tolerance. The hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) is first line of defense when oxygen availability is reduced. The ability to sense hypoxia and increase ventilation is important for patients with respiratory diseases (e. g. sleep apnea, COPD), as well as in healthy individuals during ascent to high altitude. This project aims to (1) test the hypothesis that HVR variation is greater in ancestral highland populations compared to lowland populations, (2) test the hypothesis that an individual's HVR is explained by genetic factors related to hypoxia tolerance, and (3) to determine the role that gene expression plays in the acute response to hypoxia. Since the HVR is a key element in preventing respiratory disturbance in hypoxia, the results from this study will determine if disease progression can be predicted based on patient ancestral background. Therefore, this study will contribute to the development of individualized care and predictive strategies for pulmonary disease patients. Furthermore, this study will link genotypes to phenotypes by determining if the HVR is a function of patient genotype. These aims will be met by measuring the HVR and analyzing the expression of hypoxia-related candidate genes (e.g. EPAS-1, EGLN, HMOX2) in populations of highland and lowland ancestry. Native highlanders (Tibetans) demonstrate increased HVR variability as well as positive selection on these candidate genes compared to native lowland populations and therefore provide a valuable means for examining the relationship between genotype and the phenotypic hypoxia response. This research project is part of a postdoctoral training program in which the fellow will develop the skills necessary to launch a career as an independent biomedical scientist who will transform our understanding of lung disease and respiratory biology. The fellow will be supported by a network of pulmonary physiologist at UCSD and will focus on transforming basic science discoveries in to clinical practices."
"9324760","Abstract To better support the needs of our aging vivarium, the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of California, Davis (MMRRC-UCD) is driven to improve the infrastructure and equipment within our M3 high-level rodent barrier facility. As a premier distributor of mutant mouse models, the infrastructure of our barrier is a critical factor influencing the health and well-being of the animals we produce and distribute worldwide, currently serving 41 countries. The MMRRC-UCD is the largest center of the four NIH-funded consortiums, and specializes in the cryopreservation and distribution of valuable mutant mouse models. In continued efforts to improve the efficiencies of our operations we have analyzed the deficiencies hindering our optimal production and identified a key factor being aged and outdated equipment. Older animal housing and procedure equipment can lead to increased energy and water use, in addition to excessive noise and vibrations compared to more advanced modernized technologies, all leading to increase stress to the animal. As a result, animal production may be compromised and the costs of operations increased. The laboratory animal community has been strong advocates to promote the ?3R?s? being Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. However, we are now in an era when we must also advocate for what we envision as the ?5E?s?: Efficiencies, Exclusion, Ergonomics, Enrichment, and Education. Our goal is to improve the infrastructure at our barrier facility by implementing lean management principles with an environmentally resourceful emphasis using our innovative 5E?s approach. The current proposal requests funds to upgrade outdated animal transfer stations and biosafety cabinet in the M3 Barrier Facility. Additionally, we will discontinue the use of water bottles as a water source for the animals and convert to using HydropacTM pouches to provide a sterile water source, thus reducing the risk of pathogens and decreasing the environmental resources used. The MMRRC- UCD strives to advantageously integrate innovative concepts for higher efficient, exclusive and ergonomic vivarium designs to transform our standard rodent barrier facility into a state of the art prototype of a Lean- Green animal research facility, to guild other institutions to enable our principles to be applied globally."
"9256400","Project 1: Intracellular amyloid accumulation, innate immunity and pathogenesis.  Project 1 proposes that the accumulation of intracellular amyloid contributes to pathogenesis by activating  an innate inflammatory cascade that represents a futile attempt to degrade or eliminate this amyloid by  activating autophagy and ultimately leading to neuronal death and the initiation of a neuritic plaque. Project  1 examines the contribution of two unique types of amyloid immunoreactivity to aging and AD through this  inflammatory mechanism and it explores the potential role of late onset AD genes in this process. One type  of unique amyloid involves the dramatic accumulation of amyloid fibril monoclonal (M78) immunoreactivity in  nuclei in human and Tg mouse brain, which is correlated with intraneuronal nuclear accumulation of APP  immunoreactivity. The nuclear amyloid immunoreactivity is specifically associated with eariy plaque  pathology (stage A or B) in humans and at 12 months in 3xTg-AD transgenic mice. The staining is reduced  or absent in late stage AD and at later times in transgenic mice. The other type of unique amyloid is  specifically associated with subset of vascular amyloid. Confocal immunofluorescence indicates that the  M31 immunoreactive vascular amyloid accumulates at least partially intracellularly in vascular smooth  muscle cells. The goals of project 1 are to test the hypothesis that the accumulation of the amyloids  represent an infection of the cell with a prion like agent that is associated with activation of the innate  immune response. Specific aim 1 will establish the fundamental characteristics of the accumulation of these  unique types of amyloid and test the hypothesis that their accumulation is associated with leakage of  lysosomal cathepsins and cystatin c into the cytosol and activation of the NLR infiammasome, resulting in  the activation of caspase 1 leading to neuronal death by a mechanism related to NETosis. Specific aim 2  will examine whether LOAD genes, PICALM, clusterin and TREM2, recentiy identified by GWAS play a role  in the intracellular accumulation of the unique amyloids. Specific aim 3 will explore whether these unique  types of amyloid display fundamental properties of infectious agents, like prions and whether they can be  propagated by seeding to cells. We will determine whether the the phenotype of the infected cells matches  the intracellular amyloid pathology in human brain. Dr. Glabe's project 1 will provide Dr. Cotman with  oligomers. Project 1 will interact with Dr. LaFeria on intracellular APP and Aß in the 3XTg-AD mouse and  AAV vectors and Dr. Cribbs on the accumulation of vascular amyloid. It will interact with Dr. Tenner on the  role of Clq in neuritic plaque formation and the relationship of intraneuronal CRIto intraneuronal amyloid."
"9270631","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is emerging evidence that gray matter (GM) degeneration is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), and more closely linked with disability than white matter (WM) injury. Indeed, WM volumes, as measured by high resolution MRI, wax and wane as a reflection of inflammation, whereas GM atrophy accelerates with time in MS. Whether GM degeneration purely results from WM injury or may also occur as a primary process in MS is unclear. More recently there has been growing evidence that primary neuronal loss in the cortex and retina may occur in MS, independent of demyelination or axonal injury. The retina, although an unmyelinated brain structure, is now recognized to be a frequent site of inflammation, blood-retinal-barrier disruption, and neuronal loss in MS, highlighting the retina as an opportune site to study the mechanisms by which inflammation directly mediates neurodegeneration in MS, and link these processes back to what is occurring in the brain. However, the interplay between changes in retinal layers over time, and the relationships of these changes with brain-substructure changes in MS remains unclear, and we propose to investigate this in the current application. Herein, we hypothesize that ONL atrophy is the consequence of INL inflammation, and signifies increased susceptibility for global neurodegeneration in MS as a consequence of inflammation. The completion of the experiments outlined in this application will reveal novel insights into the pathobiological mechanisms through which inflammation mediates neurodegeneration in myelinated and unmyelinated regions of the brain in MS. Specifically, we plan to determine if primary neuronal mechanisms of pathology are operative in MS retina, and if this primary neuronopathy is predictive of GM atrophy and the accrual of clinical disability in MS. The results could provide evidence to challenge the paradigm that MS is a myelin dependant disorder, and directly impact present concepts of how to target degeneration and disease progression in MS."
"9332781","Project Summary / Abstract Neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability, autism, juvenile intractable seizures, and schizophrenia have high socioeconomic impact, yet poorly understood etiologies. Recent large scale sequencing efforts identified de novo mutations as a major cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. Most de novo mutations arise in the paternal germline to confer a growth advantage to mutant spermatogonia in what has been termed ?selfish spermatogonial selection?. Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases is a known regulator of growth and differentiation and a suspected tumor suppressor. A trimeric enzyme of catalytic (C), scaffolding (A), and variable regulatory subunits (B,B',B''), PP2A can exist in >50 subunit combinations in mammalian cells, presumably with distinct localization, substrates, and regulatory mechanisms. A surge of de novo mutations in PP2A uncovered since 2015 defined two new classes of autosomal-dominant mental retardation. The most common class is caused by recurrent missense mutations in one of the 12 PP2A regulatory subunit genes, PPP2R5D, the product of which, B'? predominates in human testes and brain. The same de novo PPP2R5D mutations cause human overgrowth, a syndrome commonly associated with intellectual disability and autism. This exploratory proposal seeks to identify molecular mechanisms by which recurrent de novo mutations in PPP2R5D (B'?) cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Because some neurodevelopmental disorders are reversible, our results may lead to new pharmacological interventions. Predicated by our published work predating the discovery of PP2A mutations in mental retardation, we hypothesize that de novo mutations in PPP2R5D cause neurodevelopmental disorders by a novel change-of-function mechanism. Specifically, we suggest that basic amino acids introduced into an acidic substrate-binding surface alter PP2A substrate specifity to impair some and favor other dephosphorylation events. This in turn may enhance growth/proliferative signaling pathways over those that mediate cell cycle exit, differentiation, and morphogenesis. To address this hypothesis, the two aims of this proposal will delineate consensus sequences for dephosphorylation by wild-type and mutant PP2A enzymes, identify their cellular substrates by quantitative phosphoproeomics, and uncover phenotypes in cell models of neuronal development. Fundamental insights from this proposal are expected to pave the way for new patient-derived cell models, animal models, diagnostic tests, as well as ultimately for PP2A-targeted therapies of neurodevelopmental disorders.  "
"9281583","ABSTRACT Obesity causes 300,000 US deaths yearly, but most treatments do not result in lasting weight loss. People who show greater brain reward and attention region response, and less inhibitory region response, to high-calorie food images/cues show elevated future weight gain (Demos et al., 2012; Stice et al., 2015; Yokum et al., 2011, 2014), consistent with the theory that overeating results from a strong approach response to high-calorie food cues paired with a weak inhibitory response (Wiers et al., 2007). This implies that an intervention that reduces reward and attention region response to such food and increases inhibitory control region response should reduce overeating that is rooted in exposure to pervasive food cues. Computer-based response-inhibition training with high-calorie foods has decreased attentional bias for and intake of the training food, increased inhibitory control, and produced weight loss in overweight participants in 3 proof-of-concept trials, with effects persisting through 6-mo follow-up (Allom & Mullan, 2015; Kemps et al., 2014b; Lawrence et al., 2015b; Veling et al., 2014). A pilot trial found that overweight/obese adults who completed a multi-faceted 4-hr response- inhibition training with high-calorie food images and response-facilitation training with low-calorie food images showed reduced fMRI-assessed reward and attention region response to high-calorie training foods and greater body fat loss than controls who completed a rigorous 4-hr generic response-inhibition/response- facilitation training with non-food images (d=.95), producing a 7% reduction in excess body fat over the 4-wk period. We propose to evaluate a refined and extended version of this response-training intervention. Aim 1 is to randomize 180 overweight/obese adults to a 4-wk response training obesity treatment or a generic inhibition training control condition that both include bi-monthly Internet-delivered booster training for a year and a smart phone response training app that can be used when tempted by high-calorie foods, assessing outcomes at pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (e.g., % body fat, the primary outcome). Aim 2 is to use fMRI to test whether reduced reward and attention region response, and increased inhibitory region response to high-calorie food images used and not used in the response training mediate the effects of the intervention on fat loss. We will also test whether during training participants show acute reductions in reward and attention region response, and increases in inhibitory response to high-calorie training food images to capture the learning process, assess generalizability of the intervention to food images not used in training, and collect behavioral data on mediators. Aim 3 is to test whether intervention effects will be stronger for those who show less inhibitory control in response to high-calorie food images, a genetic propensity for greater dopamine signaling in reward circuitry, and greater pretest reward and attention region response, and weaker inhibitory region response to high-calorie food images, based on the theory that response training is more efficacious for those with a strong pre-potent approach tendency to high-calorie foods."
"9260592","Abstract Alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) is one of the most effective and cost-effective preventive health services, and SBI to address unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs has been a significant focus of research, policy, and clinical programs in the US. Yet many unanswered research questions remain, including how to deliver alcohol SBI in regular clinical practice, how to effectively intervene with respect to drug use, and how new approaches could be applied to increase the reach and effectiveness of interventions. It is essential for researchers to come together now to share their knowledge and map the next phase of SBI research. To provide a forum for knowledge exchange, an alcohol and drug SBI conference is planned for New York, NY, September 14-15, 2017. The conference will be the 14th annual meeting of the International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Other Drugs (INEBRIA), and represents only the third such meeting to be held in the US. INEBRIA is the only organization in the world dedicated to SBI research on alcohol and other drugs. INEBRIA's goals include translating evidence for SBI into practice, identifying and promoting SBI best practices, identifying SBI research gaps and needs, promoting international research cooperation, and setting standards for research in the field. The conference theme `Screening and brief intervention at the intersection of research, policy and practice: Advancing knowledge and meeting new challenges' highlights a focus on practice-based research that informs policy and can impact health at the population level. The goal of this INEBRIA research conference is to present findings from and promote further development of SBI research, with a particular emphasis on implementing and scaling up what works, and finding new approaches to addressing unhealthy substance use (including alcohol and other drugs) that are feasible, effective, and sustainable. The specific aims are: (1) to communicate and disseminate research findings about SBI implementation and dissemination, SBI in the larger context of behavioral health, and new advances in SBI research, (including digital platforms and interventions targeting adolescent substance use); (2) to increase collaboration among SBI researchers across the US and worldwide; and (3) to engage junior researchers in SBI research and provide them with a forum for presenting their work and finding mentoring opportunities. The 2017 INEBRIA conference will convene a large and diverse group of researchers in an epicenter of substance use research, New York, NY, for 2 days of research presentations and discussions. Conference planning committees have been convened. The program will include plenary sessions, research abstract presentations and workshops, and a poster session. Abstracts will be peer reviewed by the Scientific Committee, which will select those that present high quality research on alcohol or drug SBI. The 2017 INEBRIA conference will clarify the state of research science related to SBI through international discussion and collaboration, and presents a unique opportunity to advance the field."
"9461959","Project Summary/Abstract Clinical trials are the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness and safety of treatments in the medical field. However, experts agree that children routinely receive medical therapies that have not been studied in clinical trials involving pediatric subjects. Additionally, nearly 20% of US children are affected by at least one chronic disease, but clinical trials focused on the etiology, prevention, and/or treatment of these illnesses are often limited to extrapolating from adult-derived data. Residents of rural areas in particular are more likely to report limited access to and/or awareness of available clinical trials. When interviewed, children enrolled in clinical trials state that their participation provided them with access to a larger variety of treatment options, improved their understanding of their disease, and provided them with the opportunity to help other people. Thus, there exists a critical need to increase the opportunity for children, including remote rural children, to participate in clinical trials. The long-term goals of the Sunflower Pediatric Clinical Trials Research Extension (SPeCTRE) are to: 1) provide enhanced opportunities for children in rural and underserved areas of Kansas and neighboring IDeA states to participate in clinical trials; and 2) to increase the capability of pediatric clinicians and researchers within Kansas to develop and conduct clinical trials. The specific objective in this application is to extend the reach of the IDeA Network to children in rural and underserved areas within Kansas by extending existing infrastructure. This objective will be accomplished by: 1) using the statewide healthcare outreach infrastructure of the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) sponsored Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) to identify clinical trials performance sites across rural Kansas; 2) employing telehealth resources provided by the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth to bridge distance barriers to clinical trials follow-up and subject retention; 3) increase community and healthcare provider awareness of and participation in pediatric clinical trials through coordinated outreach efforts including social media, academic detailing, and the use of participant registries within the KUMC system and available to the public; and 4) increasing the workforce capacity to conduct pediatric clinical trials in Kansas by recruiting rural health care providers and health sciences students into clinical research and training these professionals in the principles of research and responsible clinical trials conduct. Longitudinal evaluation and improvement of all clinical trials-related operations conducted by SPeCTRE will be accomplished by measuring outcomes measures that will be organized according to the RE-AIM framework, a well-established method of ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of public health and outreach programs. Funding SPeCTRE will increase clinical trials enrollment of Kansas children from rural and underserved areas, enhance access to innovative medical therapies for Kansas children, and improve workforce capacity in Kansas to conduct pediatric clinical trials, all in order to eventually support the development of better care options for children."
"9209556","Aging is associated with a loss of muscle mass in the form of sarcopenia and a loss of bone mass and density in the form of osteoporosis. Loss of muscle and bone mass with age are in turn underlying factors contributing to falls and fractures in the elderly, and these fractures are very costly both in terms of financial burden and quality of life. A critical barrier to progress in correcting the problem of muscle and bone loss with aging is a poor understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related musculoskeletal dysfunction. Our goal is to address this problem by providing critical, new information on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control these processes, and thereby improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and eventually clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, secreted by stem cells in bone marrow are significantly altered with aging, and that altered EVs contribute to muscle and bone loss by transporting specific microRNAs (miRNAs). This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data indicating that the miRNAs carried by EVs in bone marrow are significantly altered with age. Moreover, treatment of young bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with EVs from bone marrow of aged animals suppresses the osteogenic differentiation of these cells, and treatment of young myoblasts with these EVs suppresses the expression of myogenic genes. Our preliminary results also suggest that these age-related changes in EV-derived miRNAs can be reversed with long-term caloric restriction. Our objectives are to 1) define how aging alters the secretion and cargo of EVs from bone-derived stem cells, and 2) determine how these EVs regulate key cellular events in bone loss and muscle atrophy. Our expected outcomes include 1) identification of EV-derived miRNAs that are actively secreted by bone marrow stem cells and are altered with age, and 2) determination of how these small molecules affect key cellular processes directly related to bone and muscle loss with aging. The impact of this project will be new findings on the role of EVs and miRNAs in the development of age-related diseases and end-organ injuries. In the future this knowledge may be critical in the diagnosis, treatment and management of vulnerable patient populations debilitated by the vast array of age-induced pathologies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that bone- derived EVs, and their miRNAs, are induced by specific age-related stimuli. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that EVs, and their miRNAs, altered with aging directly impact key cellular events in muscle atrophy and bone formation in vitro. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that EVs, and their miRNAs, altered with aging directly impact key cellular events in muscle atrophy and bone formation in vivo."

Age is the number one risk factor for AD, with imaging and biomarker data suggesting that the pathophysiological processes of AD begin more than a decade prior to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for AD, which also lowers the age of onset of AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. In most clinical studies, apoE4 carriers account for 60? 75% of all AD cases, highlighting the importance of apoE4 in AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal studies in humans demonstrate that apoE4's detrimental effect on cognition depends on age and occurs before typical signs of AD arise. A challenge in AD research is to fully understand how the multiple etiologies, including apoE4, and age-related prodromal processes interactively contribute to the pathophysiology of AD.  This proposal builds on three novel findings from our recent studies of mouse models. First, expression of apoE4 in female knock-in (KI) mice causes age-dependent impairment of GABAergic interneurons in the hilus of the hippocampus, which correlates with the severity of learning and memory deficits. Second, in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings throughout the hippocampal circuit shows that compared to aged female apoE3-KI mice, aged female apoE4-KI mice have fewer sharp wave ripple (SWR) events?hippocampal network events critical for memory replay and consolidation?and have significantly reduced slow gamma activity during SWRs (see Preliminary Studies), which coordinates SWRs. Third, although most female apoE4- KI mice develop learning and memory deficits by 20 months of age, some of them (~25%) remain cognitively normal, similar to the proportion of apoE4/4 carriers who do not develop AD by 85 years of age. Understanding the neuronal and network mechanisms that differentiate the susceptible (pathological aging) and resistant (normal aging) groups of apoE4-KI mice might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay the disease in people at risk for AD.  This proposal aims (1) to determine the effects of aging on apoE4 disruption of hippocampal network activity underlying memory replay and its relationship with GABAergic interneuron loss and cognitive decline in mice, (2) to explore whether apoE4 disruption of hippocampal network activity underlying memory replay occurs early and predicts the conversion of normal aging to AD-related pathological aging late in life in mice, and (3) to determine whether, during aging, persistent normal hippocampal network activity underlying memory replay predicts tenaciously normal cognition (normal aging) in apoE4-KI mice. The outcomes of the proposed studies will shed light on the interactive roles of apoE4 and aging in AD pathogenesis and could identify functional biomarkers capable of predicting the conversion of normal aging to AD-related pathological aging."
"9213060","Summary Cluster-randomized trials are an increasingly common trial design that has unique advantages for some questions and is required for others. It has also spawned several related trial designs. Recent high-profile studies using these designs include trials of Ebola vaccines and for preventing the spread of resistant pathogens in hospitals. The key feature of cluster-randomized trials is that subjects are randomized in groups, rather than as individuals, so that all members of a community, hospital, or practice receive the same treatment. All trials must have accurate power and sample size calculation for moral and ethical reasons. It is wrong to randomize more persons than are needed for good power, as this exposes the excess persons to the risks of randomization unnecessarily. It is also wrong to randomize fewer persons than create good power, as then all are exposed to the risks of the study for naught?there is little hope of showing a benefit of any treatment-- and a lack of study effect may be due to poor power rather than ineffective treatments. Though it is a lesser concern, it is also unethical to have too small or large a sample size, as this wastes scarce resources such as the investigators? time and the funder?s dollars. For some cluster-randomized trial designs, there exist analytic (closed-from) sample size formulae that rely on assumptions that can be unrealistic. For other designs, only approximate formulae exist. In general, these calculations can be found only in textbooks, scientific papers, and in software that is costly and can be difficult to understand and apply. There are very limited options for the most accurate calculations, which are based on simulations. Simulation-based power calculations can accommodate complex designs and realistic scenarios that are only awkwardly possible in formulae. We propose to generate a comprehensive free and open-source software suite to provide approximate, analytic, and simulation-based power assessment. In addition, we will develop a web app for the code to allow users who have less computing knowledge to make use of the software. Finally, we will make use of the software to answer outstanding questions in the design of cluster-randomized trials."
"9326620","Project 1 will focus on the optimization of the next generation polyvalent Env HIV vaccine formulations using  the multi-gene, polyvalent DMA prime - protein boost technology platform.  Our first HIV vaccine formulation, DP6-001, was developed several years ago for a proof-of-concept trial to  demonstrate the immunogenicity of the DMA prime - protein boost approach in human volunteers. The  primary Env antigens isolated from HIV infected patients in mid-1990s were selected randomly based on  their genetic clades. Rapid progress in the HIV vaccine field now provides us with a much larger selection of  primary Env antigens, especially those Env proteins from clades less studied in the past and those Env  proteins with more detailed information about the patients from whom the viruses were isolated. In addition,  the recently developed pseudotyped neutralization assay and newly established target HIV-1 primary virus  panel (the Tiers System) provides a measurable standard to guide our selection of more relevant primary  Env antigens for the development of HIV vaccines focusing on the induction of neutralizing antibody  responses. By taking advantage of the above progress, we have identified a group of primary Env antigens  that were able to elicit much broader neutralizing antibodies than those included in our previous formulation  DP6-001. In the current Project 1 of this IPCAVD program, the following studies will be conducted:  Aim 1 To finalize the selection of next generation polyvalent Env formulation to further improve the quality of  neutralizing antibody activities.  Aim 2 To select an immunogenic adjuvant to be used as part of the protein boost for the next generation  polyvalent Env formulation.  Aim 3 To test the immunogenicity of next generation polyvalent Env formulation when the DMA priming is  delivered by the electroporation method.  Aim 4 To examine the epitope profiles in immune sera elicited by DMA prime-protein boost approach and  identify the epitope specificities of antibodies responsible for the neutralizing activities."

"9311866","Project Summary Co-location networks ? two-mode networks that capture connections between individuals and locations in geographic space ? have broad relevance in the health sciences in areas ranging from the study of infectious disease transmission to understanding the influence of social processes on health outcomes and behaviors. Despite their broad relevance, however, statistical methods for understanding co-location networks are limited. This methodologically oriented proposal focuses on the development of a statistical framework for the study of co-location networks using a bilinear mixed-effects model with interacting latent activity pattern motifs and profiles. Through latent interacting random effects, our model captures the dependence between individuals based on their shared use of space and between locations based on the individuals who frequent them. Our flexible modeling framework uses a mixed-membership structure to relax the assumption that activity profiles are static and takes advantage of a data augmentation strategy to allow versions of the model with either direct or indirect specification of the dependence between actor-location ties. Our novel statistical models will be used in analyses of activity pattern data collected as part of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) Study, an ongoing data collection effort in Franklin County, Ohio. Through GPS-based smartphone tracking and space-time budget software, the AHDC Study provides rich detail on the co-location networks of adolescents in the study area. In addition, a wealth of survey data, smartphone-administered Ecological Momentary Assessments (capturing real-time measures of location, social network partner presence, activities, risk behaviors, and mood), and biomeasure data on the study participants are available. Recognizing that our proposed statistical model may not be able to capture the structure the co-location network structure of AHDC adolescents based entirely on their observed activity patterns, we also propose to embed relevant information derived from social media into our analyses through informative prior distributions on model parameters. To do so, we propose novel data mining algorithms to retrieve potential activity pattern motifs and coincident profiles from Twitter posts and network structure. In particular, we extend named entity identification methods to the spatial setting to automatically retrieve information relevant to activity patterns and develop novel methods for prioritizing activity pattern information based on its relevance to particular subpopulations (here, adolescents) using scalable sentiment analysis. Using our new statistical and data mining methodology, we will perform detailed statistical analyses to explore the relationship between spatial and socio-spatial exposures derived from an inferred co-location network and physiological stress in adolescents."
"9310993","Project Summary/Abstract The three-dimensional organization of the genome plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, but the mechanisms by which it is established and maintained are not well understood. Drosophila represents an ideal model system to study these processes. Architectural proteins, also known as insulator proteins, were first found in Drosophila. Contrary to other model organisms such as S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, or A. taliana, Drosophila shows the same organization into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and compartments found in mammalian cells. In vertebrates, CTCF and cohesin are the main architectural proteins studied in detail, although other proteins found to interact or co-localize with CTCF could also play a role in genome 3D organization. In addition to CTCF and cohesin, Drosophila has a large number of architectural proteins that bind DNA directly or are recruited to chromatin indirectly. Work we have carried out during the current funding period has resulted in the understanding of how these proteins are organized in the genome and their roles in 3D organization. Individual DNA- binding architectural proteins recognize DNA motifs at specific sites and recruit a variety of accessory proteins to form architectural protein binding sites (APBSs). The number of DNA- binding and accessory proteins, i.e. the degree of occupancy at specific sites in the genome, determines their role in 3D organization, with highly occupied APBSs present at boundaries between TADs. High gene density and transcription are also enriched at boundaries between TADs, and inhibition of transcription results in alterations in 3D organization. In this application we propose experiments to dissect the mechanism responsible for chromosome 3D organization and determine the relative contribution of architectural proteins and transcription to this process. We will establish correlations between architectural protein localization, transcription, and 3D organization by examining these three features during the heat shock response, in sperm, during early embryonic development, and in mitotic chromosomes. In addition, we will determine the causal effect of architectural proteins and transcription by examining their effect on 3D organization using transgenes, containing APBSs or expressed reporter genes, in a specific region of the genome. Results from this work will inform a computer simulation algorithm able to predict 3D organization from the properties of APBSs and transcriptional state. The ultimate goal of this work is to establish general rules that take into account the contribution of these two factors to explain how chromosomes fold in all organisms from yeast to mammals."
"9209551","This is a competitive renewal application of our currently funded Program Project (P01) award entitled ?Age- induced Impairment of Nutrient Signaling Results in Bone Loss?. Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 44 million Americans. The estimated annual direct health-care cost for osteoporosis totaled $17 billion in 2001 and is rapidly rising. A critical barrier to correcting the problem of frailty and osteoporosis is a poor understanding of how nutrient-related stimuli and epigenetic mechanisms interact to induce bone and muscle loss. Our central hypothesis is that aging alters epigenetic regulatory systems (e.g., miRNA, acetylation) that act through nutrient signaling pathways on stem cells to affect musculoskeletal function. This project will improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and clinical practice as they relate to age-induced muscle and bone loss by 1) defining specific epigenetic mechanisms that lead to bone and muscle loss with aging and 2) identifying specific nutritional interventions that can reduce or reverse these age-related changes. This is a highly integrated proposal from a group with an established track record of interactions, productivity and collaborations. Four individual projects, focused on epigenetic regulation and nutrient-related stimuli, comprise this application. The proposal also includes three Core facilities that will provide essential support to the Projects: an Administrative Core (Core A) that includes biostatistics and bioinformatics; a Bone Biology Core (Core B), which will provide the bone-specific techniques utilized by all the investigators; and a Bone Stem Cell Core (Core C) that will provide bone-derived cells to all investigators, including mouse and human bone marrow progenitor cells. The project has three specific aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that age-related changes in epigenetic signals alter musculoskeletal stem cell function; Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that specific dietary interventions (e.g., selective amino acid supplementation or intermittent fasting/protein feeding) can reverse age-related changes in epigenetic modifications and promote normal stem cell function; Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that relevant age-related epigenetic modifications identified in our mouse model are translatable to normal human physiology. The long-term impact of this project will be new findings on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying bone and muscle loss with age, and new countermeasures for reducing or reversing musculoskeletal aging."

"9205537","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV in Lebanon and the Middle East is predominantly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and rates of HIV and sexual risk behavior are on the rise among young MSM (YMSM), driven in part by increased freedom of expression, social tolerance in areas such as Beirut, an influx of migration attributed to MSM refugees coming from war torn Iraq and Syria, and a flourishing sex tourism industry. At a time of political and societa upheaval across MENA, with no substantial HIV prevention programs for MSM anywhere in the region, Lebanon and MENA may be at risk for a critical surge in HIV infection in this vulnerable population. This context presents a great opportunity for an intervention like Mpowerment (MP) to make a critical impact. MP is an evidence-based community-level, structural, social and behavioral HIV prevention intervention developed for YMSM. It combines strategies for individual and community empowerment and mobilization, self-affirmation, sexual self-knowledge, and the creation of supportive social environments for YMSM. It has been widely disseminated in the U.S., but it has never been used in a Muslim-dominant setting; hence, the need for formative research to help us understand how to best tailor MP for this much understudied cultural setting that is not well understood. The gay community in Beirut has grown significantly in recent years with regard to organization, development and advocacy, making it ready to take on and be successful with a community driven intervention like MP. This 5-year project will culturally adapt and pilot MP for YMSM (age 18-29) in Beirut. Phase 1 will involve extensive formative research including innovative peer ethnography and focus groups to better understand the social networks of YMSM and how they communicate about HIV and sexual health with each other, and elicit feedback on how to culturally adapt the MP program for Beirut. In Phase 2 we will pilot specific MP components and adapt the intervention manual. Phase 3 will consist of a 2-year pilot implementation and controlled evaluation of MP to assess intervention effects on community levels of sexual risk behavior and HIV testing. Cohorts of 200 YMSM in each of Beirut and the comparison community of Jounieh will be used to evaluate intervention effects. This study is innovative in being the first implementation and evaluation of any psychosocial sexual health intervention for MSM in all of MENA, and the first study of the social network-driven MP program that will use social network (SN) methodology for evaluating and adapting the intervention. It will have impact by providing pioneering data to broaden the field's understanding of the cultural underpinnings of HIV risk behavior and how to intervene to promote HIV prevention among a high-risk group (YMSM) in a cultural setting in which very little prior work has been done. The goal of this research is to establish an evidence-based model for HIV prevention and sexual health promotion with YMSM in the Middle East and other Muslim-dominant countries."

"9326395","Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the USA, mainly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques causing myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Excess activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is associated with vascular inflammation, atherosclerotic plaque rupture, and increased risk of MI and stroke. As MR activation is associated with obesity, heart failure, and hypertension, all very common health conditions, the majority of Americans may be at increased risk for MI and stroke due to inappropriate MR activation. Prior research in our lab and others indicates that MR in the vasculature promotes vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, while its inhibition results in smaller plaques and fewer adverse cardiovascular events in randomized clinical trials. In response to traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and, we have recently found, hyperlipidemia, the MR specifically within endothelial cells (EC-MR) mediates vascular dysfunction, which is widely known to be an early step in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. We have also found that EC-MR promotes leukocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration, suggesting a mechanism for how the MR promotes vascular inflammation. We therefore hypothesize that hyperlipidemia induces EC-MR to maladaptively activate intracellular pathways that promote endothelial permeability, thereby facilitating leukocyte trans-endothelial migration and vascular inflammation and contributing to development of atherosclerotic plaques with a phenotype that is prone to rupture. To investigate this hypothesis, we have developed a novel mouse model with the MR specifically deleted from endothelial cells, which we inject with a viral vector containing constitutively active PCSK9 to induce hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will investigate the role of EC-MR in plaque formation and morphology, vascular inflammation, and leukocyte trans-endothelial migration in vivo using this mouse model. In aim 2, we will treat isolated endothelial cells in culture with oxidized phospholipids to model atherogenic conditions and investigate intracellular signaling, cell-cell junction stability, and leukocyte trans- endothelial migration in vitro. Successful completion of our aims will result in substantial advances in our understanding of atherosclerosis and inflammation and could lead to novel therapies specifically targeting EC- MR to reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden and plaque rupture, drastically reducing the morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. This proposal also includes a detailed training plan including coursework, collaborations, presentations at national meetings, and integration of clinical training to prepare the PI for a successful career as a physician-scientist."
"9263322","Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country with the heaviest malaria burden, has been a historical gateway for the dissemination of drug-resistant malaria to India and the rest of the world. The emergence of artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria in western Cambodia and its subsequent appearance in Vietnam, Laos, China and Myanmar has raised the specter of losing the efficacy of first-line malaria treatments in the region and worldwide and poses a serious threat to renewed hopes for malaria eradication. Averting this grim scenario requires aggressive measures to eliminate malaria in areas where resistance is present and in areas at high risk of acquiring resistance through spreading or de novo mutations, and tools to identify such areas. The previous failed attempt to eradicate malaria in the 1950s and 1960s taught us that ongoing research and evidence-based, locally tailored public health interventions are essential for successful malaria elimination. Tools that can help distinguish locally transmitted versus imported malaria and identify sources and sinks of malaria transmission will also help National Malaria Control Programs target malaria elimination interventions effectively. Using samples collected as part of Project 1 from sites within Myanmar and bordering regions of China and Bangladesh, we propose to identify patterns of malaria parasite population structure and migration to facilitate malaria elimination efforts and track the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites. The work will be accomplished in two aims. In the first aim, we will estimate P. falciparum and P. vivax genetic diversity and population structure over time in sites within Myanmar and bordering regions of China and Bangladesh. This will be done by generating whole genome sequence data from both species and estimating genetic diversity, multiplicity of infection, and population structure over multiple years. Using these data, we will identify a minimum set of markers needed to detect population structure and to differentiate parasites from different geographic areas at an increasingly fine scale, and we will develop an assay that can be used in- country to track parasites in time and space. In the second aim, we will use the whole genome sequence data from Aim 1 to estimate parasite migration rates using coalescent-based methods and methods based on shared haplotypes that are identical-by-descent. Molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance and flanking loci in linkage disequilibrium with drug resistance genes will be called from whole genome sequences to determine the prevalence and origins of drug resistance mutations. Rates of parasite migration will be compared to estimates of human mobility determined in Project 3 and between regions with evidence of spreading drug resistance. If successful, this project will generate actionable evidence about the structure and movement of parasite populations that can be used to guide targeted elimination interventions and deter the spread of drug resistance."
"9298770","Project Summary Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States, affecting approximately 80 million adults. The leading cause of death in NAFLD is coronary artery disease (CAD) and accounts for >25% of deaths. Despite the high incidence of CAD-related mortality, little is known about NAFLD specific CAD pathogenesis. Thus, there is a pressing need to elucidate the pathophysiology linking NAFLD and CAD. The aim of this proposal is to evaluate a specific metabolite, anandamide (AEA) in NAFLD and CAD and to begin to define the metabolomic signatures of CAD in NAFLD. We have previously shown that NAFLD is associated with several important CAD risk factors including a high frequency of atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of small dense LDL. We have also shown that dyslipidemia improves with NASH resolution but does not resolve entirely. Further, we have identified several novel factors associated with CAD in NASH including serum sodium, serum albumin and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. However, these identified factors do not fully account for the increased risk of CAD in NAFLD. Thus, we have undertaken a metabolomic screen in our patients and found that the endocannabinoid AEA is associated with radiographic NAFLD, histologic NASH and cardiometabolic risk factors including weight circumference, insulin resistance and body mass index. Thus, AEA may serve as a link between NAFLD and CAD development and warrants further evaluation. We also seek to more comprehensively evaluate the complex relationship between CAD and NAFLD by evaluating full metabolomic profiles in those with CAD and NAFLD and those with NAFLD alone. The larger goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 12-24 months. The planned R01 will focus on the metabolomic profiles in individuals with NAFLD that predict the development of incident coronary artery disease (CAD) and CAD-related death as well as to assess differences between metabolomic profiles before and after the development of CAD. Elucidation of these profiles will allow for the development of a CAD risk profile in NAFLD and provide understanding into the pathogenesis of CAD in NAFLD. Ultimately, we hope to improve our understanding of CAD in NAFLD to improve CAD prevention and decrease CAD-related mortality in NAFLD."
"9376778","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance: Traumatic pelvic bleeding is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and many patients die from potentially survivable injuries. These injuries claim up to 40,000 lives every year in the United States. This fact highlights an emergent need for innovative technologies to control bleeding in the most severely injured patients. Approach: This FastTrack SBIR application will develop novel, self-expanding polyurethane foam systems for treatment of exsanguinating pelvic hemorrhage. In Phase I of the proposal, Arsenal Medical will collaborate with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to create a novel, clinically relevant animal model of pelvic hemorrhage. A trimodal approach incorporating vascular injury, soft-tissue injury, and tissue disruption will be utilized. To estabish baseline performance and areas for optimization, existing treatments will be tested, including Arsenal Medical's ResQFoam technology (designed for intraabdominal use). In Phase II of the proposal, a foam will be developed for efficacy and removal in the pelvic space by modulating open-cell microstructure and improving foam mechanical properties (tensile strength, elasticity) of the polyurethane struts. The appropriate dose of this self-expanding foam for effectiveness in pelvic bleeding will be determined through a dose ranging study. The net result will be an effective biomaterial intervention for treatment of pelvic bleeding. After optimizing the foam, a comprehensive physiological study of ischemia-reperfusion dynamics will be conducted. Phase II will culminate in the preparation of a preliminary regulatory submission to the FDA. Innovation: The trauma community lacks a robust animal model for the assessment of therapeutics, surgical approaches, and devices for the treatment of pelvic hemorrhage. Establishing this animal model, as well as critical research in ischemia-reperfusion injuries, will provide substantial benefit to the trauma community. Self-expanding foam treatment will be effectively developed for clinical use in retroperitoneal pelvic bleeding based on the aims of this proposal, resulting i a new life-saving therapy. An established, productive interdisciplinary team, established regulatory pathway, and existing manufacturing infrastructure increase the probability of success and commercialization of self-expanding foams for pelvic trauma. The proposed research will develop the first closed-cavity, lethal model of pelvic exsanguination and create a minimally invasive foam platform for pelvic hemostasis that will be superior to the existing standard of care."

"9309813","The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in the development of hypertension, and elevated sympathetic activity is a major component of several cardiovascular risk factors, including stress. In addition, augmented cardiovascular sensitivity to acute stressors in young normotensive individuals predicts a higher risk of becoming hypertensive later in life, indicating that enhanced stress-responsiveness and long-term elevation of blood pressure (BP) are linked by the same, yet unidentified, stress-related central regulatory mechanisms. Here, we propose that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acting in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), is a multi-faceted mechanism that is uniquely suited to directly activating PVN sympathoregulatory neurons to induce acute BP elevations to stress as well as mediating long-term transformation of the PVN neurocircuitry to facilitate responsiveness to hypertensive stimuli leading to the development of hypertension. Our recent publications and preliminary data suggest that BDNF exerts these effects in the PVN via mechanisms that have traditionally been recognized to mediate plasticity, learning and memory in hippocampal and cortical neuronal networks, but have not been explored in the PVN. These actions include 1) intracellular Ca2+-dependent BDNF expression in PVN neurons in response to excitatory input converging on the PVN during stress; 2) activation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor TrkB, leading to opening of the transient receptor potential channel-3 (TRPC3) via phospholipase C (PLC) signaling; 3) differential regulation of expression and function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and ?-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptors, shifting the excitatory-inhibitory balance toward long-term sensitization in PVN sympathoregulatory neurons. In addition, there is evidence for important mechanisms that integrate actions of BDNF and angiotensin II (AngII), a key regulator of BP in the PVN. These newly discovered interactions are mediated by AngII-induced stimulation of BDNF expression; AngII-type-1 receptor (AT1R)-induced trans- activation of TrkB; and by BDNF-induced upregulation of AT1R. We employ a comprehensive array of in vitro patch-clamp and Ca2+-imaging techniques as well as in vivo experiments using viral vector-mediated genetic manipulation of BDNF signaling in rats to achieve the following aims: Aim 1: To elucidate TrkB?PLC?TRPC3- mediated mechanisms by which BDNF activates PVN sympathoregulatory neurons to acutely increase SNA and BP; Aim 2: To characterize functional interactions between BDNF and AngII in sympathoregulatory PVN neurons; and Aim 3: To determine how excessive activation of BDNF signaling augments excitatory and diminishes inhibitory synaptic function in PVN sympathoregulatory neurons to promote the development of hypertension. These studies have the strong potential to significantly advance the field by establishing BDNF as a highly important regulator of autonomic and cardiovascular function, one that mediates both acute stress responses and long-term adaptive mechanisms in the PVN leading to the development of hypertension."
"9315640","PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies [1-6] and their application to transcriptomics (by sequencing complementary DNA (cDNA)) [7-12] have resulted in an even more complicated view of the transcriptome and its regulation, demonstrating our limited knowledge of transcription. DNA sequencing technologies have eliminated some of the technical challenges posed by hybridization-based microarray strategies, but several fundamental shortcomings still remain [13-18] that prevent us from understanding the ?true? nature of transcriptomes and from identifying the 1?2 fold transcription changes that can distinguish a disease-associated physiological process from a normal one [19, 20]. To respond to this need, SeqLL, LLC (Woburn, MA) is proposing a Phase I SBIR project to develop, optimize, and demonstrate the feasibility of a direct RNA sequencing technology to capture whole-transcriptome information from the RNA isolated from a single cell. This work builds on encouraging preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of a direct RNA sequencing technology based on a single-molecule sequencing platform; however, existing challenges must be overcome for this technology to be a viable and reliable commercial option (including a reduced read length compared to DNA sequencing, a lower yield compared to a similar input of DNA, and is less reproducible in lower-order species). To achieve this goal, the team proposes three specific aims:  Specific Aim 1. To design, synthesize, and screen multi-color reversible terminators optimized for the sequencing of RNA molecules. This aim will use chemical synthesis methods to generate reversible terminator (RT) analogs that are well suited to direct RNA sequencing. These RTs will be ?third generation? (based on innovative iterations of these molecules by SeqLL), fluorescently labeled, and have a variety of inhibitory moieties that will be tested for improved sequencing performance.  Specific Aim 2. Optimize chemical and reagents for use with high-throughput single-molecule direct RNA sequencing to improve base stacking, sequencing yield, read length, and accuracy. This aim will optimize imaging buffer, generate mechanisms for cleave/capping, and to test alternative modifications that should allow for significant improvements in direct RNA sequencing base stacking, sequencing yield, read length, and accuracy.  Specific Aim 3. Whole-transcriptome sequencing of single cell RNA without amplification. This aim will seek to efficiently perform whole-transcriptome sequencing of RNA derived from a single cell, without amplification. Single-cell preparations will be obtained from our collaborators at the Bernstein lab (Harvard Medical School). This work will report upon methods and the sequencing performance of using the optimized methods identified in Aims 1 and 2 to perform single-cell direct RNA sequencing of the whole transcriptome."
"9258335","Project 1- Abstract Project 1 focuses on the regulation of the ?3 integrins on cells exposed to blood. In the past funding period, evidence has been developed to demonstrate a previously underappreciated role of the kindlins in integrin function by showing that they are essential regulators of integrin activation. Kindlin-2 (K2) and kindlin-3 are known to play a particularly prominent role in controlling the functions of the two ?3 integrins, ?IIb?3 and ?V?3, on platelets, endothelial cells and leukocytes. This project focuses on K2, and the preliminary data support the hypothesis that K2 regulates: 1) integrin inside-out responses as exemplified by its control of ?V?3 activation; 2) outside-in signaling via its regulation of cell spreading; and 3) integrin independent responses as exemplified by its regulation of membrane proteins expression. Consequently, K2 plays important and diverse roles in vascular biology, including the capacity to regulate: a) ?V?3 activation, which controls angiogenesis; b) outside-in signaling via a previously unrecognized and direct interaction with actin; c) integrin independent responses as demonstrated by its selective regulation of trafficking of a subset of membrane proteins in endothelial cells, which controls hemostasis, and d) interaction with proteins of adherens junctions, which controls vascular permeability. To test the elements of this hypothesis will require an in-depth understanding of K2 structure-function relationships, and animal models in which the functions of K2 can be interrogated in various biological settings. To probe the structure-function relationships of K2, mutational analyses driven by NMR studies will be performed on specific sites in the molecule that regulate its biological activities. For in vivo analyses, unique mouse strains developed in the laboratory, floxed K2 and mutant K2QW/AA knock-in mice which are unable to bind integrins, will be used. The specific aims of the project are: 1) To delineate the function of K2 in vivo in which K2 has been selectively deleted from endothelial cells, express the K2WQ/AA mutant or K2+/- mice, which has been used successively and extensively by us to identify previously unknown functions of K2. Angiogenesis, hemostasis, trafficking of membrane proteins and changes in vascular permeability will be examined in these mouse strains. 2) To resolve the molecular mechanisms, which allow K2 to orchestrate its integrin-dependent and independent functions. The basis for the preference of kindlins for the ?3 integrins, the specificity of clathrin binding motif in K2, and the previously unappreciated role of the small C-terminal segment of K-2 in integrin activation will be determined. A particularly novel aspect of these studies will be to pursue the lead that K2 binds to a membrane proximal site to alter the transmembrane region of ?3 and influence the activation process. 3) To determine the location, specificity and functional consequences of the direct interaction of K2 with actin. These studies will establish how K2 functions at a molecular and cellular level and how these roles manifest in the intact organism."
"9258336","Abstract The long term objective of this proposal is to understand molecular basis of integrin-mediated cell adhesion with the focus on talin ? a master regulator of cell adhesion. Well-known as a physical linker between integrin and actin filament, talin has been extensively studied for more than three decades. The past 15 years have seen a significant advance where talin was found to have the capacity to activate integrin - a key step for initiating all integrin-mediated cell adhesive events such as cell spreading and migration. Using NMR spectroscopy and cell biology approaches (in collaboration with project leader 1), we were the first to show that talin utilizes its N-terminal head (talin-H) to break a cytoplasmic clasp of platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3 to trigger conformational change and activation of the receptor. We further discovered how talin itself is regulated through an autoinhibition mechanism where a key integrin binding site on talin-H is masked in inactive talin. These findings, together with data from other laboratories, have paved the way for understanding a conformation-based regulation of talin in mediating integrin activation. However, the central issue of how talin spatiotemporally engages with integrin and actin to regulate dynamic cell adhesion is still elusive. Specifically: (i) what mechanism(s) activates talin to bind integrin? (ii) How does the activated talin trigger integrin transmembrane signaling? (iii) How does talin cooperate with kindlin ? another key regulator of integrin activation? Finally, (iv) How is talin regulated to dynamically link integrin to actin filament? Despite an extensive literature, the answers to these fundamental questions are still speculative and controversial. With strong preliminary data, we propose to use structural biology as a major tool coupled with functional analyses to obtain definitive answers to these perplexing questions. Longstanding collaboration with other project leaders for functional experiments is the strength of this proposal, which has proven to be highly productive in the past. We believe the newly proposed studies will lead to a new advance for understanding the mechanisms of integrin signaling and cell adhesion. Given the critical involvement of talin and its associated proteins in thrombosis, stroke, cancer and other diseases, our studies may be also valuable for development of new therapeutics to treat these diseases."
"9344777","Project Summary Transcriptional control, targeted modification, and excision of HIV-1 in the brain Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes a persistent infection, which ultimately results in the demise of immune regulatory cells. HIV infection is inexorably followed by diseases attributable to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1, 2). Clearance of HIV infection by the immune system is inefficient and thus allows for integration of proviral DNA into the genome of host cells, which ultimately results in viral latency (3). Latency in HIV infection has immense importance because infectious virus can remain protected from immune mediated clearance and re-emerge after a long absence, often years following initial infection, regardless of current therapeutic strategies. One location of latent virus is in the brain, an area that is relatively compartmentalized from the body via the blood brain barrier. HIV infection in the brain results in NeuroAIDS, a pathological condition that is marked by HIV associated dementia (HAD) (4). Indubitably, devising a method that would abrogate the viruses' ability to remain in the brain of infected individuals could prove therapeutically significant and impacting. We propose here to contrast three distinct, yet complimentary, approaches capable of specifically targeting HIV in the brain and either epigenetically silencing, directing Cytosine to Thymine (C->T) mutations, or excising the virus from integrated sites. The three distinct approaches which we will develop here are; (1) small non-coding RNA directed epigenetic silencing of HIV-1 (5), (2) BREC1 enzymatic cutting of HIV (6), and (3) a newly developed Zinc Finger targeted silencing and APOBEC1 mediated cytosine to thymine mutation approach."
"9274634","A group of 13 investigators in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, which includes PI's on 26 different NIH grants, with over $6,700,000 grant support per year, requests funds for the purchase of a computational resource for structural biology and molecular biophysics. The resource is designed to leverage existing instrumentation and research groups working in the areas of Cryo-Electron microscopy (Cryo- EM), NMR, X-ray crystallography and scattering, single molecule biophysics, high resolution mass spectroscopy (MS), Hydrogen Exchange (HX) and macromolecular simulations. One function of the resource would be to support the Cryo-EM Tecnai G2 F20 TWIN 200kV field emission gun transmission electron microscope obtained with an earlier shared instrumentation grant. This instrument, part of a successful and well used EM core facility is now producing data at a rate that requires significantly higher throughput computer resources for 3D image reconstruction, in order to maximize return on the investment in Cryo-EM. The resource is targeted specifically for computationally intensive tasks which cannot be efficiently performed on the highly distributed, and already saturated computing facilities in the Perelman School of Medicine. The proposed hardware will make heavy use of state of the art graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, which has been shown to provide unmatched performance per dollar on the type of computations required by structural biology and molecular biophysics. GPU-optimized software required for the most computationally intensive structural biology and molecular biophysics applications has already been developed, so the requested hardware could be put into use immediately. Major users have well-funded research programs that address important questions in diseases such as amyloidogenesis and neurodegenerative disorders, diseases of protein-misfolding, gene regulatory proteins and their aberrant regulation in cancer, defects in myosin leading to hypopigmentation and neurological disorders, identification and structural characterization of new protein targets for drugs and therapeutics. The requested computer resources will greatly advance these important biomedically relevant projects as well as those of other investigators using the Cryo-EM core."
"9252513","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a growing epidemic in the Western World, afflicting 6 million people in US, with an additional 550,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The one and five year mortality rates for CHF are 10% and 60%. Heart transplantation is gold standard therapy for advanced heart failure, but that remains limited by number (2,200 donor heart available each year) and cost. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) offer an alternative treatment for advanced heart failure by working in parallel with the failing ventricle. The current generation of rotary VADs uses a turbine rotor to impart blood flow, have one year survival rates approaching 85%; however, the technology is limited by cost, complexity, and complication. A leading long term cause of death with VAD therapy is infection and 30% of VAD recipients experience an infection each year. There is very little research which has examined why VAD patients remain so susceptible to infection. We have observed that the neutrophils of VAD recipients and advanced heart failure patients circulate in the blood in an activated state, which does not occur in healthy individuals. We have also developed novel microfluidic devices to simulate the extreme shear forces which blood cells experience when they pass through the VAD. Neutrophils from healthy individuals undergoing millisecond exposure to these forces, became activated, suggesting the high shear in VAD may cause neutrophil activation. However, it is not clear why neutrophil activation would contribute to an infectious susceptibility. To investigate these issues we propose 1) Measure changes in neutrophil activation following high shear exposure, 2) Quantify the adhesive capacity of healthy volunteer neutrophils after high shear exposure in comparison to those from Advanced Heart Failure and VAD patients, 3) Examine changes in neutrophil phagocytic function after high shear exposure and in Advanced Heart Failure and VAD patients."
"9291719","Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immune-mediate diseases that affect an estimated 1.5 million Americans and account for 1.5 million in direct healthcare costs. Due to their young age of onset and protracted course characterized by relapses, hospitalizations, and surgery, they exert a considerable toll on patients and society. Therapeutic advances with the availability of monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ? (anti- TNF) and anti-integrin (vedolizumab) therapies have made achievement of durable clinical and endoscopic remission increasingly possible. However, one-fifth of patients fail to achieve even an initial response and a similar proportion response annually. At present, choice of therapy is largely non-selective with sequential trial of agents from different therapeutic classes without a priori prediction of likelihood of response. However, this results in protracted morbidity due to inadequate treatment of disease and increases likelihood of permanent bowel damage in addition to exposing patients to ineffective but potentially toxic agents. Thus, there is an important unmet need for tools to predict response to each individual therapeutic class. Clinical factors such as smoking, duration of disease, location and behavior of involvement, have proved inconsistent in predicting response to therapy. In our previous work, we developed a prediction tool using genetic risk alleles to identify primary and secondary non-responders to anti-TNF therapy. This tool demonstrated both the utility of genetics and superiority of it as a predictor compared to clinical data. However, limitations to that work include retrospective adjudication of treatment response categories and reliance on improvement of symptoms which correlate poorly with endoscopic severity of inflammation, arguably a more robust marker. In this proposal, we aim to validate our prediction tool in an independent prospective cohort of patients initiating anti-TNF therapy, and important to assess its utility in determining response based on change and normalization of fecal calprotectin, a sensitive objective marker of intestinal inflammation. In addition, with the goal of developing tools to aid in personalized precise therapy by identifying mechanisms of action most likely to be of benefit to each patient, we will examine the predictive value of our existing therapy response tool in a prospective cohort of patients on treatment with vedolizumab. If our existing model is unable to predict response to vedolizumab, we will develop a separate predictive model with distinct polymorphisms to predict response to this therapeutic class. Importantly, the insights from this proposal will serve as a foundation for development of a comprehensive predictive model that also incorporates composition and metagenomic function of the gut microbiome that will significantly further our aim of providing personalized, precise care to our patients and ensuring optimal outcomes. This grant will also provide important preliminary data in support of the applicants future independent R01 funding proposal, and is a critically important step in the long-term academic success of the applicant."
"9406896","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because little is known about non-genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), this proposal seeks a novel approach to advance our knowledge of the complex etiology of autism due to environmental chemical exposures from the use of common consumer products. Phthalates are selected as a chemical class of interest because they are ubiquitous in personal care products (e.g., cosmetics, fragrances, shampoos) and indoor residential environments (e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flooring and plastics, children's toys, vinyl tiles, shower curtains), have been shown to influence sex steroids critical n early brain development, and have neuro- developmental toxicity in infants and children. A recent epidemiologic study also found that having PVC flooring material (a source of airborne phthalates) in a parent's or child's room was associated with an increased risk of ASD. The overall goal of this project is to determine whether exposure to phthalates during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of ASD. To estimate prenatal exposure to phthalates, this study will leverage existing resources from a unique longitudinal study initiated under the NIEHS-funded UC Davis Center for Children's Environmental Health known as MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs). MARBLES is a prospective investigation, enrolling pregnant women who already have a child with ASD and are therefore at high risk for delivering another child with autism, designed to identify causes and early markers of autism. From this study, we have available multiple urine samples collected from the mother throughout pregnancy, a key feature for improving the exposure estimates for each infant and mother due to the fact that phthalates are metabolized and excreted quickly, with elimination half-lives on the order of hours. Moreover, two hundred fifteen of the children from this pregnancy cohort will have been assessed for autism at the age of 36 months during the time of this R21, enriching the value of these prenatal biological samples. Close to one in five of the firt 147 children to reach 36 months has been confirmed with a diagnosis of ASD. Other developmental diagnoses, including adaptive function and cognitive development, are also available for these children. Therefore, multiple gestational urine samples collected from mothers and confirmed diagnoses of autism in MARBLES are invaluable resources that will enable rigorous analyses of the association between prenatal exposure to phthalates and the risk for ASD or other developmental concerns. Up to four urine samples were collected each trimester for each woman. To reduce analytical costs while maintaining some information about variability, we will analyze the first sample collected each trimester as an individual sample and pool all remaining samples for that trimester. To assess variability of maternal exposures during pregnancy, longitudinal individual urine samples collected approximately one week apart from 9 mothers will be analyzed for phthalate metabolite levels. This study will markedly advance understanding of the role of a class of endocrine disrupting compounds common in consumer products on ASD."
"9250167","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this lumping of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of diagnostic criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate fair to moderate agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (?'s 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis."
"9273198","Abstract This proposal is for the acquisition of a high-end LC-MS/MS instrument to be placed in the Proteomics Core Laboratory at the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. The proposal contains projects from nine NIH funded investigators and is asking for a ThermoScientific Fusion Lumos instrument which will be coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 uHPLC. This is a high-end LC-MS/MS system that represents the state-of-the-art in mass spectrometry that is being utilized for proteomics investigations. Currently, the lab is equipped with two LC-MS/MS systems including a twelve year old ThermoScientific LTQ and a four year old ThermoScientific Orbitrap-Elite system. The Elite instrument is the cornerstone of the Proteomics Core and performs 98% of the current experiments and is currently running at capacity. More importantly, several of the projects presented in this proposal require access to an instrument with higher sensitivity and additional functionality not available on the Elite instrument. We performed several preliminary experiments comparing the performance of the Elite to the Lumos. The Lumos instrument has a much higher scan rate and is more sensitive than the Elite resulting in a 2 fold increase in peptide and protein identifications and a 200 fold increase in LOQ for targeted peptide quantitation. This increase in sensitivity will have a positive impact on the identification of low abundant novel proteins derived from alternative poly(A) sites (Ting) and the identification of low abundant oxidized lipid-protein conjugates (Podrez Lab). One of the features of the Lumos instrument that is not available on the Elite is the ability to perform SPS-MS3 fragmentation for isobaric quantitation at both the protein and peptide levels. Several projects in this proposal will be greatly impacted by this functionality including the analysis of the gut microbiome (Hazen), biomarker identification in PAH (Erzurum), identification of the ADAMTS substrates (Apte), and analysis of the sulfhydrome (Hatzoglou). Another feature of this instrument currently not available in the Proteomics core is ETD which is an alternative fragmentation method that can be used for site-specific identification of post-translational modifications (PTM's) on highly charged ions. Several of these projects include analysis of PTM's including phosphorylation (Stark, Erzurum, Lefebvre, Gupta), sulfhydration (Hatzoglou), and oxidized lipid-protein conjugates (Podrez) all of which will be positively impacted by the ability to perform ETD fragmentation. Another feature of the Fusion Lumos instrument not available on the Elite is the ability to perform sensitive large-scale targeted quantitative studies on 100's of peptides simultaneously. This functionality will greatly impact research involving the large-scale quantitation of post-translational modifications (Stark and Gupta), validation of TMA lyases present in the gut microbiome (Hazen), and the validation of protein biomarkers of PAH (Erzurum)."
"9255753","Project Summary In the past 10 years, over 21,000 genetic variants have been linked to complex human traits through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the predictive power of many of these variants remains limited, and it is still unclear how best to use the wealth of information generated by GWAS to impact personal health and clinical practice. For nearly 10 years, 23andMe has been not only a driving force in direct-to-consumer genetic testing but also has established an innovative crowd-sourced genetics research platform. This platform has yielded a compelling data resource and many genetic discoveries. In this proposal, we will address the next phase of 23andMe human genetics research: the development of highly scalable and accurate disease risk estimation. Two of the key challenges in human genetics research are (1) to determine how to use results of GWAS to paint an accurate picture of an individual's disease risk, and (2) to determine how these estimates can provide information of personal and clinical utility. These challenges are difficult due to many factors including the wide spectrum of disease classes, the paucity of genetic and phenotypic data and significant methodological and computational challenges. In this proposal, we present a plan to utilize the genetic and phenotypic data stores at 23andMe to ?develop validated risk estimation algorithms?. In Phase I, we will build a computational pipeline that will be used to develop predictive algorithms for estimating disease risk (Aim #1) and use this pipeline to evaluate predictive ability of different estimation approaches in a broad class of human complex traits (Aim #2). In Phase II, we will validate these algorithms in external cohorts and build customer-facing reports that we will test for user comprehension. We believe that the development of accurate risk estimation capability will have a major impact on both consumer genetics and clinical genetics markets.     "
"9260683","Project Summary Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis are a group of related neurogenetic tumor suppressor syndromes that share a predisposition to develop benign and malignant nerve sheath tumors. Because most tumors encountered in patients with NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis are histologically benign, overall survival is not an appropriate clinical trial outcome for these patients. In 2011, a group of NF researchers agreed to meet periodically to develop novel outcomes for these conditions. The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration consists of specialists from multiple countries and disciplines dedicated to the study of neurofibromatosis, schwannomatosis, and clinical trials. REiNS holds an annual conference during the winter in which recommendations for clinical trial outcomes are discussed. Each year, the Leadership Group of REiNS selects experts on the topics under discussion. These meetings have led to multiple publications that have been incorporated into ongoing clinical trials and that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature. The annual REiNS meeting is a critical forum for generating new ideas and approaches to these rare tumor suppressor syndromes. The 2016 conference topic is Enhancing patient engagement in neurofibromatosis clinical trials and will include outside speakers from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology initiative (OMERACT), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute. The ultimate goal of this conference is to develop patient engagement guidelines for the REiNS International Collaboration."

The goal of this ICEMR is to assess over time the impact of environmental modifications such as the construction of dams, irrigation and shifting agricultural practices on malaria epidemiology, vector biology and pathogenesis in Kenya and Ethiopia. This Center involves a considerable number of investigators based at institutions in malaria endemic and malaria non-endemic regions of the world. A well-developed administrative plan is essential for the success of this Center that involves extensive international collaboration and multiple investigators from the US, Kenya, Ethiopia and Australia. Thus, this Administrative Core is designed to manage, coordinate, and supervise the entire range of Center activities, monitor progress, and ensure that the milestones defined by each project are being met and are implemented effectively within the proposed timelines. This Core has four major goals: 1) to coordinate, supervise and manage the research activities of the Center to ensure the accomplishment of the scientific goals of our Center; 2) to provide financial management for the Center to ensure fiscal rules of the US federal government and NIH are followed, including the effective management of subcontracts at participating domestic and international institutions; 3) to foster outreach activities to promote collaborations with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Ethiopia and other ICEMR centers based in other malaria endemic regions; and 4) to organize and coordinate training of students, junior scientists and project scientists in data management, and techniques in biostatistics, malaria epidemiology, vector biology and immunology. The well-developed management plan, together with our previous track records in ICEMR project administration, will facilitate the multidisciplinary research of this Center, student training and scientific collaborations. ."
"9249093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgery increases the risk of thrombosis but prevention and management of thromboembolic disease in the perioperative period is complicated by the risk of hemorrhage. Neutrophils (PMNs) play a vital role in wound healing, but their contribution to perioperative thrombosis and implications for thromboprophylaxis are now emerging. Adherence of PMNs to wounds and to the vasculature generates a unique localized sequestrum enriched in enzymes and antimicrobial peptides protected from plasma inhibitors that contribute to innate immunity in part through the orderly formation and dissolution of fibrin. We posit that post-operative and persistent inflammation disrupt this balance, predisposing to thrombosis by promoting formation and persistence of fibrin. We have previously observed that a-defensins (a-def), antimicrobial peptides that constitute 5% of total human PMN protein that are released upon activation, promote clotting and inhibit fibrinolysis. The absence of a-def in murine PMNs has hindered a better understanding of how these peptides contribute to thromboembolic disease in the perioperative setting. Using a novel transgenic mouse that expresses PMN a-def (Def++), we show that a-def circulates in a complex with fibrinogen and promotes polymerization and retraction of fibrin in vitro, deposits in the vasculature, induces occlusive arterial and venous thrombosis, and inhibits lysis of pulmonary emboli in vivo. These pathogenic properties can be transferred to wild type animals by transplanting bone marrow from Def++ mice and can be prevented and reversed by immunodepleting PMNs or by inhibiting a-def release using colchicine. We now propose an integrated approach to understanding the mechanism and implications of PMN a-def on perioperative thrombosis by examining: a) The biophysical effects of a-def on clot formation and structure; b) The mechanism of accelerated thrombosis and impaired fibrinolysis in Def++ mice and the salutary effect of blocking a-def release; and c) The utility of a-def expression as a biomarker for risk of venous thromboembolism post- surgery. These studies will provide insight into an unappreciated contribution of PMN a-def to arterial and venous thrombosis, identify novel genetic and protein biomarkers of patients at risk for surgery related thrombosis and provide evidence for the use of a safe and effective intervention to prevent thrombosis in the perioperative period."
"9418778","Abstract  Bronchiolitis is the most common illness leading to hospitalization in young children. For children under age two, bronchiolitis incurs an annual total inpatient cost of $1.73 billion. Each year in the U.S., 287,000 emergency department (ED) visits occur because of bronchiolitis, with a hospital admission rate of 32-40%. Due to a lack of evidence and objective criteria for managing bronchiolitis, ED disposition decisions (hospital admission or discharge to home) are often made subjectively resulting in significant practice variation. Studies reviewing admission need suggest that up to 29% of admissions from the ED are unnecessary. About 6% of ED discharges for bronchiolitis result in ED returns with admission. These inappropriate dispositions waste limited healthcare resources, increase patient and parental distress, expose patients to iatrogenic risks, and worsen outcomes.  Clinical guidelines are designed to reduce practice variation and improve clinicians? decision making. Existing guidelines for bronchiolitis offer limited improvement in patient outcomes. Methodological shortcomings include that the guidelines provide no specific thresholds for ED decisions to admit or to discharge, have an insufficient level of detail, and do not account for differences in patient and illness characteristics including co-morbidities.  Predictive models are frequently used to complement clinical guidelines, reduce practice variation, and improve clinicians? decision making. Used in real time, predictive models can present objective criteria supported by historical data for an individualized disease management plan and guide admission decisions. However, existing predictive models for bronchiolitis patients in the ED have limitations, including low accuracy and the assumption that the actual ED disposition decision was appropriate. To date, no operational definition of appropriate admission exists. No model has been built based on appropriate admissions, which include both actual admissions that were necessary and actual ED discharges that were unsafe.  To fill the gap, the proposed project will: (1) Develop an operational definition of appropriate hospital admission for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. (2) Develop and test the accuracy of a new model to predict appropriate hospital admission for a bronchiolitis patient in the ED. (3) Conduct simulations to estimate the impact of using the model on bronchiolitis outcomes. The project will produce a new predictive model that can be operationalized to guide and improve disposition decisions for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. Broad use of the model would reduce iatrogenic risk, patient and parental distress, healthcare use, and costs and improve outcomes for bronchiolitis patients. If the model proves to be accurate and associated with improved outcomes, future study will test the impact of using it in a randomized controlled trial following its implementation into an existing electronic medical record to facilitate real-time decision making."
"9250819","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Seizure focus delineation using spontaneous and stimulus evoked EEG features Abstract an estimated 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy. Of these, it is expected that ~30% continue to have seizures despite maximal medical therapy. The seizures of these patients may be controlled through appropriate surgical intervention if the region of brain giving rise to seizure activity is full circumscribed. Buildingon preliminary work, this study will pursue three research aims focused on (a) using brief recordings of neural activity, sophisticated signal processing techniques and advanced decision algorithms to delineate the epileptogenic region in patients with intractable epilepsy; augment this procedure with (b) examinations of the stimulation-response characteristics of different brain regions and (c) move toward non-invasive methodologies including high-density scalp EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation that leverage the above approaches. The other major goal of the proposed project is to allow Dr. Cash to build on a successful record of mentoring and build a mentoring program tailored to the needs of residents and fellows in neurology who are preparing for a career in patient oriented research. The primary aims of this aspect of the proposal are to (a) bolster existing individual mentoring capabilities, (b) create group based career development experiences and (c) broaden the ability of residents and fellows to obtain mentoring and foundational research experiences in translational neuroscience. These goals ultimately are intended to greatly improve the ability of highly qualified, motived junior investigators to reach independence and begin productive patient-oriented research careers."
"9287847","OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program ?Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis?constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC ?Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis? will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities"

"9247794","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Validation of a Virtual Airway Skill Trainer (VAST) Abstract Airway management is one of the most frequently performed procedures in operating rooms (OR), intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency departments (ED) to maintain air supply to the lungs. Yet, there exists no standardized curriculum or training regimen outside the age-old apprenticeship model. Hence, life- threatening scenarios, particularly those associated with the unexpected difficult airway (when an airway cannot be established using traditional methods), are seldom encountered during residency, limiting the opportunity of residents to train in the clinic. It is anticipated that a virtual reality (VR)-base trainer, with visual and haptic (touch) feedback, will be invaluable for training in airway management, allowing trainees to attain competence in a controlled environment with no risk to patients; customized learning; and real time feedback, mentoring and objective assessment. Existing VR-based simulators lack (1) realistic physics-based soft tissue modeling; (2) tissue response governed by models based on in vivo experiments; (3) realistic physical interfaces which can be easily altered to represent various external, and associated oropharyngeal anatomy of a patient known to cause difficulty with airway management [CaPe10] e.g., receding jaw, excessive soft tissue and large neck circumference; (4) cognitive skill training related to higher level mental functions associated with workload management, planning, coordination, and decision-making based on level of difficulty, in addition to psychomotor (hand-eye coordination and motor skills) skill training; and (5) clinical validation. The goal of this projec is to overcome these barriers and design, develop and validate the Virtual Airway Skill Trainer (VAST). A multidisciplinary team has been assembled to achieve the following Specific Aims: (SA1) Design and develop the Virtual Airway Skill Trainer (VAST) platform. Specifically, we will develop (1) physics-based computational models of human anatomy based upon in vivo experimental studies; (2) an immersive 3D high definition (HD) head mounted display (HMD) system to represent the clinical environment (OR/ICU/ED); and (3) an innovative bi-manual force feedback hardware interface with tactile matrix gloves that allows representation of various patient anatomies associated with the difficult airway. (SA 2) Develop simulation scenarios for endotracheal intubation (ETI) and cricothyrotomy (CCT) procedures within the VAST by integrating the computational models and experimental data generated in SA1. VAST will include real time feedback identifying errors; visual, auditory and haptic cues to guide the trainee; display of physiological consequence of complications; effects of alternate procedures and devices as well as automatic real time assessment of skill. (SA 3) Establish the validity of the VAST as a training tool by conducting experiments at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston to ensure that appropriate skills are being learnt on the VAST and performance measured on the VAST reflect the technical skills they intend to measure."

"9461976","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Establishing improved access to pediatric clinical trials is critical given the poor state of health and intractable health disparities that face children in Louisiana, particularly in relation to the four focus areas of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO): obesity, neurodevelopment, asthma, and birth outcomes. Given our current understanding of the developmental origins of health and disease, increasing pediatric clinical trials targeting early disease and risk factors for later health outcomes, particularly in populations including ethnic minorities where risk factors are elevated, is critical. This proposal plans to establish a pediatric clinical trials site in Louisiana in response to RFA-OD-16-001, Clinical Sites for the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (UG1) to address this critical need for pediatric clinical trials in this State. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an innovative consortium based at Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) in Baton Rouge, LA in collaboration with Tulane University in New Orleans, LA. The overall goal is to leverage the existing clinical research expertise of PBRC in obesity and maternal-fetal health with the clinical expertise and experience of Tulane University School of Medicine in asthma, neurodevelopment, and birth outcomes to establish a uniquely skilled collaborative group able to engage, implement, and translate a range of pediatric clinical trials. Moreover, working with the established infrastructure and modeling the processes of inter-institutional collaboration created by the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center (LA CaTS) (PI: William Cefalu; NIH 1 U54 GM104940) will allow for further dissemination and conduct of clinical trials across the State. The investigators will be supported by a research coordinator at each site and a data manager at PBRC. Regularly scheduled meetings between the investigative teams as well as with the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) will be held to discuss developments, progress, and future directions. Year 1 will be focused on administrative planning including identifying targeted recruitment sites, establishing appropriate letters of agreement, and streamlining IRB workflow. Years 2 through 4 will be focused on conducting multiple clinical trials as deemed appropriate by the ISPCTN. By expanding the research infrastructure in Louisiana, creating uniform protocols, and integrating with other sites across the United States, we expect the PBRC/Tulane consortium to rapidly participate in clinical trials, initiated locally as well as within the network, bringing new discoveries to children in Louisiana while simultaneously addressing persistent health disparities."
"9297668","Summary  Tendons connect and transfer the force between the muscles and the bone. Their development, growth, and maturation must take place in coordination with that of their neighboring tissues. In adults, tendons are highly prone to injury and have slow and limited healing potential. By gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating tendon biology we will be able to improve the design of regenerative based therapies for tendon injury and disease. Postnatal tendon cell growth and maturation is currently a poorly understood process. Many studies have focused on the changes occurring in the extracellular matrix as the collagen fibrils grow in size. However, few studies have examined the molecular changes taking place in the tendon cells at postnatal stages on a genome-wide level. In this collaborative proposal, we will apply unique and novel techniques to isolate tendon-specific cell populations and elucidate the gene networks and regulatory regions associated with a specific postnatal developmental transition. This transition was identified through our unpublished studies on cell turnover rates during postnatal and adult periods. We found that there is a specific stage at which the cells shift from high to low cycling rates that resemble the adult state of low turnover. At similar stages, we also observe distinct changes in gene expression levels. Interestingly, this transition stage correlates with alterations in regenerative potential reported in previous studies. Based on this, we will perform RNA-seq of postnatal stage tendon cells to identify transcripts that are differentially regulated between active and low cycling states. Candidates will be validated through gene expression analysis in mouse tendon tissues. Second, we will use ATAC-seq to identify genome-wide changes in regulatory control during high and low cell turnover periods. Regulatory regions will be tested using the zebrafish to identify enhancers with activity in tendon tissues. Together, these aims will reveal the gene expression and regulatory landscape changes that occur as the tendon cells transition from high to low cycling periods during tendon cell growth and maturation. These discoveries will enhance our understanding of tendon regulation on a molecular level and would provide new candidate pathways to test in the context of tendon cell growth, maturation and injury repair."
"9335590","Cirrhosis and its complication, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US. HE is associated with gut dysbiosis that is usually treated with antibiotics, prebiotics or probiotics. However, however HE often continues to recur and cause readmissions despite this standard of care. Multiple episodes of HE can result in cumulative irreversible brain injury. Therefore the prevention of recurrent HE is an important unmet need that requires translational intervention. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is an effective translational approach for recurrent Clostridium difficile. Our preliminary data suggest that a one-time administration of an FMT-enema using a rationally-selected donor via Openbiome is safe in cirrhosis and recurrent HE. However, an upper GI route is preferable for patients and could favorably impact the small intestine, where translocation often occurs. The G3 FMT capsule by Openbiome acts on the small and large intestine and is available for C.difficile. We will use one donor specifically selected from the Openbiome pool whose microbial profile best fulfils the microbiota deficits related to beneficial bacteria in HE patients, utilizing a ?Precision Microbiome? approach. Ultimately the goal is to define oral FMT as a viable treatment approach for recurrent HE patients. Our hypothesis is that fecal transplants from a rationally derived donor delivered via capsules are safe and well tolerated in patients with cirrhosis and HE and are associated with significant improvement in gut microbiota composition, and mucosal defenses. The primary aim is: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of fecal transplant through oral capsules from a rationally derived donor in cirrhosis and HE from a liver disease and symptom standpoint. Secondary aims are (1) To define the changes in microbiota composition of the stool, duodenal and sigmoid colonic mucosa after oral FMT compared to pre-FMT baseline (2) To determine the effect of oral FMT on mucosal defenses by studying antimicrobial peptides, inflammatory cytokine expression and barrier protein expression compared to pre-FMT baseline. (3) To evaluate changes in systemic inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin after oral FMT compared to pre-FMT baseline. This will be an open-label trial of cirrhotic patients with HE carried out in collaboration CTSAs at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Medical College of Wisconsin along with Openbiome. Both CTSAs have expertise in the study of the gut-liver axis and mucosal defenses respectively. This research will form the platform for large, placebo-controlled, randomized trials for efficacy in this underserved population with scientific and clinical improvements in understanding of the gut-brain axis. This proposal is responsive to PA-16-343 by involving two separate CTSA hubs and performing ?Translational studies of the human microbiome? and ?Precision Medicine? as a method to advance knowledge within the CTSA consortium.  "

"9252238","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant supports the enhancement of a recently launched two semester Interdisciplinary Medical Product Development (IMPD) senior design capstone course sequence in the Department of Bioengineering at UIC in two significant ways: (1) development of a Biomedical Clinical Immersion course to serve as a gateway to IMPD, and (2) acquisition of a Fused Deposition Modeling rapid prototype machine. Two complementary directions of proposed curricular innovation will be integrated: a truly interdisciplinary teachingof early product development that is based on an understanding and appreciation of user needs, and an iterative approach to advanced prototyping and testing of medical devices to meet regulations and standards. IMPD is modeled on the nationally recognized Interdisciplinary Product Development (IPD) program developed at UIC a decade ago starting with mechanical and industrial engineering. In IMPD, design teams are comprised of seniors in Bioengineering, MFA Industrial Design students, and MBA students, and the course is co-taught by faculty from all three colleges (Engineering, Architecture and Design, and Business). IMPD benefits from frequent feedback from clinician mentors assigned to each team that are selected based upon the project topic. In addition, the project is sponsored by an industry partner, which provides industry-perspective mentorship to each team. The IMPD program exposes students to the entire medical product development cycle, beginning in the earliest stages of needs assessment. The IMPD course does provide for clinical observation and engaging clinical input from the earliest stages; but, a Biomedical Clinical Immersion course will provide the depth to holistically understand the clinical environment, including process flow, workarounds, and inefficiencies. Proof of concept testing lies at the opposite end of the product development cycle, and necessarily relies upon a physical prototype. The process of iterative prototyping permits refinement of the concept such that it is appropriate in look, feel and function. Acquisition of a Fused Deposition Modeling rapid prototype machine will permit students to quickly actualize and respond to their CAD-based concept designs, and allow them to experience the entirety of the product development cycle in as real world scenario as possible."
"9260193","Abstract Previous studies investigating the neurobiology underlying the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior, an animal model of relapse in drug-addicted individuals, have pointed to the medial prefrontal cortex as a critical node in this circuitry. In contrast, significantly less work has examined how different regions in the lateral prefrontal cortex influence reinstatement. In particular, the insular cortex, a region within the lateral prefrontal cortex, has been implicated in craving and relapse. Functional imaging studies suggest that drug-associated cues activate the insular cortex in individuals addicted to a variety of different drugs. In addition, damage or inactivation of this region disrupts nicotine addiction in both humans and animals. However, despite the evidence suggesting a role for this region in addiction to other drugs, few studies have investigated how different subregions of the insular cortex regulate cocaine-seeking behavior, particularly in animal models that allow for more precise neurobiological investigations into the mechanisms underlying its role in relapse/reinstatement. Our own now-published findings indicate that inactivation of the dorsal agranular insular cortex (AId) attenuates cued reinstatement but has no effect on cocaine-prime reinstatement in rats. However, the circuitry mechanisms underlying the role of the AId in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking remain unknown. Therefore, the present proposal will investigate the projections from the AId to different downstream regions to determine their role in cued reinstatement. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats will undergo cocaine self-administration, followed by extinction training, prior to undergoing cued reinstatement testing. The proposed aim will determine whether chemogenetically inactivating either the AId?nucleus accumbens core or AId?basolateral amygdala pathway reduces lever pressing during cued reinstatement. The findings from this proposal will be instrumental in elucidating the neural circuits by which the AId is regulating cocaine-seeking behaviors."
"9313036","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The applicant's long-term objective is to develop a research program focusing on understanding biological mechanisms underpinning externalizing behaviors, including those associated with PTSD, in order to facilitate the development of improved strategies to reduce these behaviors. This is consistent with the NIMH's mission to reduce the burden of mental illness. The applicant's medium-term objective is to become an independent, NIH-funded investigator and a recognized expert in neural and endocrine mechanisms implicated in trauma and aggression. The applicant will accomplish this by i) deepening an existing competency in fMRI with advanced functional connectivity methods; ii) broadening an existing competency in conducting clinical research by gaining experience working in a residential treatment facility and by acquiring training in PTSD assessment techniques; and iii) gaining new competency in endocrinology research.  PTSD effects an estimated > 21 million Americans and >30% of PTSD patients do not respond to treatment. PTSD may manifest in the brain as increased neural response to threat cues and disrupted neural responses during emotion regulation. Evidence of PTSD may also present in the body; i.e., as high levels of testosterone. The link between testosterone, neural responses and PTSD is poorly understood. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning PTSD would likely facilitate the development of improved interventions. Thus, this proposal aims to (i) determine the extent to which testosterone responsiveness modulates response to threat cues in youth with PTSD and (ii) determine the extent to which testosterone responsiveness modulates emotion regulation deficits in youth with PTSD.  The applicant proposes to accomplish these aims by recruiting 38 adolescent patients with PTSD and 38 comparison adolescents (aged 14-17; half male; controlling for pubertal status) from a large residential treatment program. A counter-balanced repeated-measures design will be employed where participants will complete an fMRI paradigm designed to assess response to threat and emotion regulation following a testosterone manipulation. Pilot data indicates that a testosterone response can be non-invasively elicited by a social challenge paradigm. Participants will complete the fMRI task following this challenge paradigm or following a paradigm designed to reduce T levels. It is anticipated that the proposed study will show the extent to which an increase in T is associated with an increased responsiveness to emotional stimuli and reduced emotion regulation in youth with PTSD. As current intervention strategies for pediatric PTSD do not consider the role of T, these data will be important in the development of novel treatment modalities.  The proposed research would take place at Boys Town, Omaha, NE and Iowa State Univ. Participants will be drawn from the approximately 500 youth in residential treatment at Boys Town and scanned using the on- site dedicated research scanner, while the endocrine research would take place at Iowa State."

This hybrid mass spectrometer (MS) has unique features in comparison to conventional triple quadrapole MS. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) can trigger an Enhanced Product Ion scan when threshold is reached, which can confirm identity. The Selexion Differential Mobility Separation used in conjunction with UPLC for orthogonal separations, will increase S/N and enable high resolution without the need for perfect chromatography. In particular, the Selexion DMS enables resolution of structurally similar lipid species (same MRM transition) into isobaric components without the need for chiral chromatography. The Gerstel MPS will be configured for automated sample derivatization, which will be first used with dansyl chloride for enhanced detection and quantification of amines.The device will be housed and maintained in the Einstein SIMC Facility, a state of the art multiuser core facility. The SIMC is one of the premier shared facilities at Einstein. It has been very successful in giving scientists at Einstein access to the suite of mass spectrometric tools and methodologies necessary for performing metabolomic and lipidomic analyses. Currently SIMC's is limited in providing accurate quantitative metabolite and lipid profiling from small amounts of mouse or patient samples for personalized medicine initiatives. A patient biopsy, or biofluid may be needed for several cores to develop systems biology pictures of disease. Gaining access to an ultrasensitive triple quadrapole mass spectrometer will enable researchers here at Einstein to advance their research programs in a variety of fields. The Einstein Stem Cell and Diabetes Centers will utilize the increased Sciex 6500 sensitivity to examine metabolic profiles of different stem cell lineages and neural populations regulating insulin sensitivity and feeding behavior. Diabetes researchers additionally will be able to metabolically profile a single mouse hypothalamus or a small number of pancreatic islet cells, enabling new discoveries into appetite and insulin sensitivity and secretion. The Einstein Cancer, Diabetes, and Medical Counter-Measures Against Radiation Centers will utilize the increased Sciex 6500 sensitivity to examine intestinal organoid models for dietary influences on cancer development, and for assessing radiation induced gastrointestinal syndrome. As such, there is a substantial large base of pre-clinical and clinical investigators whose research will be greatly expanded by access to this instrumentation.  "

"9266459","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe asthma represents ~10% of all asthma but carries a significantly greater mortality risk especially for African descent (AD) individuals. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution or PM) and genetic factors are likely critical to defining susceptibility to severe asthma and provide insights into tis area of serious health disparity. In this regard, the non-muscle isoform of myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK), encoded by MYLK, actively participates in the pathogenesis of vascular barrier disruption and lung inflammatory cell trafficking, each an essential contributor to asthmatic inflammation. In lung endothelial cells (EC), nmMLCK is a multifunctional cytoskeletal mediator central to regulation of EC actin cytoskeletal rearrangement via phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs). Our previous studies further identified that African ancestry is associated with asthma risk with coding and non- coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding nmMLCK, MYLK, over-represented in AD individuals strongly associated with severe asthma. This R01 renewal will characterize the pathobiological functions of MYLK SNPs associated with severe asthma in under-represented minority backgrounds, thereby directly addressing an important health disparity. To address our hypothesis that nmMLCK expression and functional activity (inflammatory regulation) are dysregulated in severe asthma & influenced by SNPs enriched in AD populations, Specific Aim #1 will evaluate MYLK SNPs found in non-hispanic caucasians, Latino & African descent children and adult populations for association with severe asthma. We will conduct mid-throughput genotyping studies in ~4000 asthma patients (European descent, African descent, Latino Puerto Rican, and Latino Mexican)and identify severe asthma-related SNPs. Specific Aim #2 will characterize the effects of severe asthma-associated SNPs and Paticulate Matter (PM) exposure on nmMLCK mRNA expression and function via effects on MYLK 5'UTR promoter activity, 3'UTR binding activity to miRNAs, promoter CpG island methylation, and mRNA secondary structure. Specific Aim #3 will functionally analyze effects of severe asthma-associated MYLK coding SNPs on nmMLCK protein structure and function (kinase activity, protein binding, and lamellipodial dynamics). Finally, Specific Aim #4 will validate these severe asthma-associated SNPs in vivo, and evaluate novel nmMLCK inhibitors designed to diminish PM-exacerbated asthmatic inflammatory lung injury. Supported by compelling published and preliminary data, we believe these integrated translational studies will lead to mechanistic insights into asthma pathobiology and the health disparity of severe asthma while facilitating the development of novel, potentially population-specific, inflammation-reducing therapies for asthma."
"9361764","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance: Urinary tract stones pose a significant healthcare burden, with costs to the US exceeding $10 billion annually. The impact of stone disease on the healthcare system is expected to continue to grow as risk factors such as diabetes and obesity become more prevalent. Ureteral stones in particular pose a management challenge as they are often symptomatic, and spontaneous passage is a strong function of stone size and location. Watchful waiting in combination with expulsion therapy is the first line approach, but can lead to repeat physician and/or emergency department visits, lost productivity, and stress on the patient. For active intervention, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) often requires repeat or secondary procedures to achieve stone-free status. Ureteroscopy, a minimally invasive procedure, has greater stone free rates than SWL, but higher complication rates. Technology: Burst wave lithotripsy (BWL) is a novel, noninvasive, method of stone fragmentation that has the potential to significantly improve the management of ureteral stones. BWL uses multi-cycle, low-amplitude pulses of ultrasound rather than shock waves to noninvasively induce stone fracture. This approach has the potential to reduce the risk of injury, procedural complications, and additional procedures, as well as result in a significant reduction in procedural time and cost. Furthermore, the low pulse pressure amplitude used may preclude the need for anesthesia, providing an attractive alternative to watchful waiting. Preliminary Data: In-vitro studies have shown the technology is capable of breaking all common types of stones found in humans. Results also show that the fragment size can be controlled by altering the ultrasound frequency to produce small fragments likely to spontaneously pass without further symptoms. Preliminary studies indicate the pressure levels required to break stones are significantly below the pressure levels required to induce renal injury in a porcine animal study. Specific Aims: This is a fast-track proposal that will use Phase I to address the technical question of how BWL parameters should be altered to treat a stone obstructed within a ureter compared to a stone free in a water bath. This will require assembly of a BWL transducer and amplifier (Phase I Aim 1) and in vitro studies to establish the pressure level and dose (time) required to break stones within a ureteral phantom (Phase I Aim 2). Phase II identifies the acoustic windows and critical structures exposed while targeting ureteral stones (Phase II Aim 1) and designs the commercial prototype transducer specific for those windows and operating the acoustic parameters identified in Phase I (Phase II Aim 2). The BWL system will be guided by an ultrasound imaging system with specialized algorithms to enhance targeting and detect cavitation to monitor and control for injury (Phase II Aim 3). The safety and efficacy of the developed system will be tested in a porcine animal model (Phase II Aims 4, 5)."
"9276001","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An interdisciplinary consortium of investigators from the Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, Ophthalmology, Pediatrics and Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, in collaboration with the University of Michigan, Harvard University, and Boston University proposes to increase the pace at which basic science discoveries on disease mechanisms can be translated into therapies for complex visual system disorders and disease, a stated goal of the R24 National Eye Institute (NEI) Translational Research Program on Therapy for Visual Disorders. This scientific partnership will employ its diverse scientific expertise to characterize and test potential therapies for diabetic and other ischemic retinopathies in animal models by using a combination of cutting-edge physiological, chemical, analytical and imaging approaches. By identifying drugs with the capability to inhibit clinically important lesions of the early stages of diabetic retinopathy in animal models, we will accelerate their development before testing in humans. Improving drug delivery to the retina will also be a high priority. Conventional and emerging technologies together with high resolution imaging methods will be used noninvasively to assess various processes in the retina, and document the effect of therapies. Specific goals of this project are to: 1. Use retinylamine as the lead compound to develop and test the ability of other amino-containing compounds (derivatives from chemical libraries and chemicals synthesized especially for this project) to trap reactive aldehydes and/or inhibit superoxide generation by retinal cells incubated in glucose concentrations similar to those found in diabetes. A systems pharmacology approach will be employed to evaluate the ability of a second group of compounds consisting of agonists and antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to achieve similar therapeutic effects. 2. Test the best of these compounds singly and in combination for their ability to (a) inhibit lesions of the non-proliferative stage of diabetic retinopathy (increased capillary permeability and degeneration) in rodents and primates, and (b) inhibit capillary dropout and pre-retinal neovascularization in the oxygen- induced retinopathy model. 3. Assess the retention and efficacy of promising test drugs delivered to the retina by different routes compared to systemic delivery. An important criterion for selection of compounds for further study is that they do not impair visual function at the doses used. Ultimately, results of these interrelated aims will guide us in identifying the most promising therapeutics for further development in reducing retinopathy and vision loss in diabetic individuals."
"9443872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Voltage-gated Na channels (NaV) initiate electrical impulses in neurons and the heart. Mutations in SCN1A and SCN2A, which encode the neuronal channels NaV1.1 and NaV1.2, respectively, cause inherited epilepsy syndromes. Mutations in SCN5A, which encodes the major subtype of NaV channel in heart (NaV1.5), are linked to many cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders, such as Long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS). The main structural components of NaV channels are four homologous repeats, which assemble in a tetrameric configuration within the membrane to control voltage-dependent Na+ conduction, and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD) that serves as a binding site for many auxiliary regulatory proteins and is a hotspot for disease-causing mutations.  Among these auxiliary CTD-interacting proteins, the ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) and fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs; FGF11-FGF14) are of particular interest: many disease- causing mutations are localized to their putative interaction domains within the CTDs of specific NaV channels; FGF14 is itself a locus for the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 27; and Ca2+ regulation of NaV channels by CaM is poorly understood. A lack of structural information for these interactions with the CTD, however, has prevented an understanding of the roles of the CTDs, these auxiliary proteins in channel regulation, and the molecular basis of mutational effects on NaV that lead to disease.  Building on recent success in determining the crystal structure of a NaV CTD in complex with CaM and an FHF; and in defining new roles for FHFs in regulation of NaV channel gating and trafficking, we propose to define the mechanisms of NaV channel regulation by Ca2+/CaM, and FHFs and to uncover the molecular basis of the mutational effects on NaV CTDs and their associated proteins that lead to channelopathies.  To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Structure-function studies to determine how Ca2+/CaM regulate NaV channel function, using electrophysiology and biochemistry, to probe insights gained from structural determination; 2. Structure-function studies to determine how FHFs regulate NaV channel function and how FHFs co-operate with CaM for channel regulation; 3. Physiological investigations of the consequences of FHF regulation of NaV1.5.  Because NaV channelopathies and mutations in FHFs are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy syndromes, and cardiac arrhythmias, the proposed project has great potential to illuminate the molecular basis of multiple channelopathies in multiple organ systems due to NaV CTD mutations and, more generally, to uncover fundamental aspects of NaV channel structure-function."
"9294442","Project summary CLIP Tool Kit (CTK): software package, user interface and tutorials for CLIP data analysis Multiple steps of gene expression regulation rely on co- and post-transcriptional processing of RNA through its interaction with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of protein- RNA complexes, followed by high-throughput sequencing of isolated RNA, has become a gold standard for mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions on a genome-wide scale. However, there remains a lack of software tools that provide flexible, streamlined and comprehensive analysis of CLIP data that incorporates the most recent technical advancements of CLIP protocols and sequencing technology. Here we propose to develop the CLIP Tool Kit (CTK) to fill this gap by building on our extensive experience in this field and enhancing a prototype we have developed for our research over the years. Taking raw sequence reads coming off sequencers as input, CTK will perform a series of analyses using its three major components: 1) quality filtering and mapping of raw reads, followed by a stringent, model-based algorithm to collapse PCR duplicates to obtain unique CLIP tags; 2) an adaptive valley-seeking algorithm to define CLIP tag clusters and perform peak calling; and 3) a statistical method to determine the exact protein-RNA crosslink sites through analysis of crosslink induced mutation sites (CIMS) and truncation sites (CITS). We will implement several novel algorithms as well as important extensions to our current software package, to make significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency, and to keep up with advancement in CLIP protocols and sequencing technologies. In addition, we aim to improve the usability and dissemination of the software. We will implement an interface through Galaxy so that CTK can be integrated into this widely used bioinformatics workflow management system. Multiple tutorials for typical analysis pipelines will be developed and a user group will be established. Thus, this study will provide a valuable resource for the RNA biology research community."
"9324761","Abstract To better support the needs of our aging vivarium, the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of California, Davis (MMRRC-UCD) is driven to improve the infrastructure and equipment within our M3 high-level rodent barrier facility. As a premier distributor of mutant mouse models, the infrastructure of our barrier is a critical factor influencing the health and well-being of the animals we produce and distribute worldwide, currently serving 41 countries. The MMRRC-UCD is the largest center of the four NIH-funded consortiums, and specializes in the cryopreservation and distribution of valuable mutant mouse models. In continued efforts to improve the efficiencies of our operations we have analyzed the deficiencies hindering our optimal production and identified a key factor being aged and outdated equipment. Older animal housing and procedure equipment can lead to increased energy and water use, in addition to excessive noise and vibrations compared to more advanced modernized technologies, all leading to increase stress to the animal. As a result, animal production may be compromised and the costs of operations increased. The laboratory animal community has been strong advocates to promote the ?3R?s? being Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. However, we are now in an era when we must also advocate for what we envision as the ?5E?s?: Efficiencies, Exclusion, Ergonomics, Enrichment, and Education. Our goal is to improve the infrastructure at our barrier facility by implementing lean management principles with an environmentally resourceful emphasis using our innovative 5E?s approach. The current proposal requests funds to upgrade outdated animal transfer stations and biosafety cabinet in the M3 Barrier Facility. Additionally, we will discontinue the use of water bottles as a water source for the animals and convert to using HydropacTM pouches to provide a sterile water source, thus reducing the risk of pathogens and decreasing the environmental resources used. The MMRRC- UCD strives to advantageously integrate innovative concepts for higher efficient, exclusive and ergonomic vivarium designs to transform our standard rodent barrier facility into a state of the art prototype of a Lean- Green animal research facility, to guild other institutions to enable our principles to be applied globally."
"9263319","Molecular and genomic epidemiology approaches have the potential?as yet largely unrealized?to add powerful tools to the malaria elimination toolkit. We are already using highly sensitive molecular testing for national malaria surveillance and to guide mass drug administration in Myanmar. Our haplotype analyses of the emergence and dissemination of drug resistance helped prompt the World Health Organization to launch a regional campaign to eliminate falciparum malaria from Southeast Asia. High throughput protein and peptide microarrays that measure variant-specific antibody responses may prove valuable for estimating exposure to specific parasite and mosquito species. Genome sequencing and genotyping large numbers of clinical samples yields information that can be used to understand parasite migration patterns. The Molecular and Genomics Core will help Project 1 and 2 investigators develop and deploy high-sensitivity and high-throughput molecular, genomics and serological techniques and tools to support these goals, with a focus on facilitating the transition of most of these capabilities to regional laboratories over the course of the study. In Aim 1 we propose to establish, or strengthen capacity for, high-throughput ultrasensitive PCR at regional ICEMR laboratories in Myanmar, China and Bangladesh and incorporate new diversity-reflecting microarray-based sero-surveillance tools to measure malaria and mosquito exposure. In Aim 2, we will develop and implement approaches to increase parasite DNA representation in field samples prior to sequencing. These DNA samples will be used to generate high-throughput sequence data for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in Aim 3, and to design next-generation DNA protein and peptide microarrays. The data generated will be analyzed by all three Projects, to generate accurate estimates of the true malaria burden in the region, to characterize the emergence and spread of drug resistance, and to integrate all these variables into a regional model of malaria epidemiology and transmission, upon which public health interventions can be based. Finally, Aim 4 seeks to disseminate the generated data to the wider scientific community, though the use of public data repositories and a project-specific web portal, to help guide national and regional malaria control and elimination policies. ."

"9248379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): G-protein signaling pathways control virtually every process in the body. At any time, the output of a particular neuron reflects the integration of several signaling pathways, while the neurological response of the organism requires the coordination of many more pathways operating in different brain regions, circuits and cell types. Our laboratory focused on how the diversity and specificity of these signaling pathways are encoded in the ??? subunit structures of the G-proteins. Historically, the diverse ? subtypes were assumed to specify their signaling roles. However, our work has challenged this dogma with the discovery of diverse ? subtypes whose unique signaling functions are identified for the first time. Notably, our production of Gng7-/- mice provides irrefutable proof that the ?7 subtype performs a novel role in the striatum by directing the ordered assembly of a specific G-?olf?2?7 heterotrimer that operates downstream of the D1 dopamine and A2a adenosine receptors in striatum. Forming the basis for this proposal, loss of the ?7 protein disrupts the G-?olf?2?7 assembly and produces defective morphine responsiveness. Because of the global nature of the gene deletion, it is not clear whether the defective morphine responsiveness reflects a requirement for the G-?olf?2?7 heterotrimer acting downstream of the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) in striato-nigral neurons, the A2a adenosine receptor (A2aR) in striato-pallidal neurons, or both receptors. Accordingly, we will use our newly created conditional Gng7mice: 1) to genetically dissect the cell type specific roles of the G- G- ?olf?2?7 heterotrimer in mediating spontaneous and acquired behaviors; 2) to identify the cellular basis and the affected signaling pathway(s); and 3) to explore to what extent the G-?olf?2?7 heterotrimer composition influences the ligand binding properties of these receptors. This new knowledge may eventually lead to the development of better strategies to prevent or ameliorate prescription opiate abuse that currently costs the US government $300 billion a year."
"9329854","Summary Abstract Given the scope of the alcohol problem in the US, our interdisciplinary team has come together with two distinct scientific outlooks to examine the interaction of alcohol and sleep with neurocognitive performance and whether this interaction may help identify strategies to improve treatment outcomes for alcohol use disorders (AUD). AUD psychosocial treatments have been developed that span a number of approaches, but all such interventions depend on intact cognitive function to be effective. Many aspects of neurocognitive function required to learn and apply psychosocial skills, however, are adversely affected by repeated alcohol use and sleep disturbance. Effective use of the skills taught by psychotherapy requires neurocognitive functioning consistent with 1) learning skills, 2) assessing the need for skills both ahead of time and in the moment, and 3) implementing skills when needed. The combination of continued heavy alcohol use and associated sleep disruption likely prevents patients' realizations of the full benefits of effective psychosocial interventions. Approaches to improving sleep in the context of AUD and psychosocial interventions must target aspects of sleep most predictive of impaired neurocognitive functioning, particularly under conditions of repeated alcohol use. The effects of serial (i.e., multi-night) alcohol administration and sleep disruption and their interactive effect on neurocognitive function are unknown. Furthermore, there is a notable lack of alcohol and sleep- related laboratory research in mature adults (defined as 35-50), including assessment of potential male-female differences. Our approach is to test sleep and next-day neurocognitive effects in mature heavy-drinking adults after administering alcohol (targeted BAC of .1g%) on consecutive nights in a controlled laboratory setting under three sleep conditions: nominal (drinking followed by 8.5 h sleep on ?usual sleep schedule?), delayed (drinking followed by 8.5 h sleep 3 h later than usual sleep), and delayed/restricted (drinking followed by 5.5 h sleep 3 h later than usual). These study conditions provide the opportunity to explore neurocognitive consequences of alcohol's effects on sleep, but also to pursue fundamental research questions. These studies will 1) assess the influence of 3 nights' alcohol administration under 3 sleep conditions (nominal, delayed, delayed/restricted) on next-day neurocognitive performance and alertness/sleepiness; 2) assess the associations among serial nightly alcohol administration, rate of alcohol metabolism, and 3 sleep conditions and sleep physiology; and 3) we will explore sleep and alcohol variables for mechanistic influences on next- day neurocognitive functioning."

"9387943","Epileptogenesis has been predominantly studied in the context of neuronal dysfunction, but emerging studies indicate that dysregulation of glia, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, contributes to the pathogenesis and maintenance of an epileptic scar. Under physiological conditions, astrocytes are essential for the maintenance of synaptic function and neuronal survival. Reactive astrocytes in epilepsy display several phenotypic changes, including dys-expression of ion channels and glutamate transporters, as well as aberrant activation of signaling pathways for cell proliferation. Oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) are also present in greater numbers in epileptic foci. Using fresh cortical samples from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, our laboratory has recently characterized a subpopulation of re-activated glia, which overexpress EGFR and are capable of generating neurospheres in vitro. This has lead to our hypothesis that pathological remodeling of mature glia towards a more primitive, immature state, contributes to abnormal activity in an epileptic scar, by turning on transcriptional networks for proliferation while repressing homeostatic mechanisms of ion balance, glutamate transport, and myelin support. The transcriptional changes driving glial re-activation in primary human samples have been challenging to study, however, due to the difficulty of accessing such material fresh, and the inherent cellular heterogeneity present within the tissues in vivo. To this effect, our laboratory has developed a unique strategy for the successful isolation of astrocytic, OPC, and neuronal nuclei, giving us a unique tool to study the cell-type specific molecular dynamics in human lesional tissue. Specifically, here we will profile the epilepsy-associated changes within the nuclear transcriptome (by RNA-seq) and associated open chromatin landscape (by ATAC-seq) of acutely isolated astrocytes, OPCs, and neurons. This analysis will allow us to define, for each cell type, the epilepsy-associated remodeling of transcriptionally accessible loci, and to derive a blueprint for specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites. We will disseminate this data to the scientific community as an open database using the Synapse gateway platform (project Glia in Epilepsy). Furthermore, we will use this data to analyze bioinformatically the TF motifs and binding occupancy present specifically within epileptic astrocytes, in an effort to define better the transcriptional mechanisms driving their altered phenotype in epileptic human tissue. Defining the specific epigenetic landscape and associated transcriptional phenotype in different cell types derived from epileptic human tissue will advance deeply our understanding of the lasting molecular adaptations present in drug-resistant epilepsy. By depositing our data in an open access platform, we will maximize data dissemination and facilitate further investigation into the role of glial pathology in epilepsy, hoping to uncover new avenues for antiepileptic therapy aimed at restoring glial-neuronal homeostasis."
"9251846","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose the development of a novel theoretical framework for the creation of next-generation quantum mechanical force fields (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular and drug discovery applications. The proposed QMFFs are orders of magnitude faster than comparable linear-scaling electronic structure methods because the explicit interfragment orbital coupling is replaced by an empirical term that depends, at most, only on the electron density. The empirical parameters are tuned to reproduce experimental condensed phase properties such as ligand binding affinities, pKa shifts, solvation free energies, and lattice energies. In these ways, the proposed QMFFs will offer improved accuracy and predictive capability for multiscale modeling applications of complex biological and pharmaceutical problems. Specifically, we propose to 1. Create a general theoretical framework for development of new QMFFs for molecular simulations. This framework will allow arbitrary quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models to be integrated to form new QMFFs with accurate, balanced intermolecular interactions. Focus will be placed on the parameterization of intermolecular interactions using highly efficient low-level approximate density-functional tight-binding models, and high-level ab initio density-functional and coupled cluster methods that will be accessible through a specific interface with the PSI4 quantum chemistry package. The methods will take advantage of new linear-scaling methods for electrostatic interactions and generalized solvation effects, and will be implemented into a flexible set of software libraries that have interfaces with molecular simulation programs. 2. Apply QMFFs to thermodynamic properties of crystalline pharmaceuticals. The bioavailability of drugs are affected by crystal polymorph and co-crystal properties, such as solubility, and their thermodynamic characterization is thus an essential part of the drug discovery and chemical process pipeline. Density-functional QMFFs will be developed to study crystalline polymorphs by parameterizing them to reproduce known lattice energies. We will exploit the decomposition of the QMFF energy to compute the relative free energy between polymorphs, and absolute sublimation and solvation free energies of crystals using novel simulation methods that scale the intermolecular interactions. Our QMFF's ability to describe bonding events will be used to explore pKa shifts of drug compounds in co-crystals and make predictions about protonation states that are of pharmaceutical importance. 3. Apply QMFFs to aid in the interpretation of spectroscopic data. We will apply density-functional QMFFs to aid in the interpretation of IR, Raman, and NMR molecular spectroscopy of proteins and nucleic acids. First, small biologically relevant molecules will be used to benchmark the ability of density-functional QMFFs to predict IR, Raman and NMR spectra from molecular simulations. Second, we will apply the QMFFs to probe electric field heterogeneity on ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) with IR and 13C NMR chemical shifts. Third, we will examine the NMR chemical shift distributions in DNA and RNA systems derived from representative ensembles generated from MD simulation, and compare with recent and ongoing experiments."
"9258978","Nearly 30 million patients in North America and Europe have been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD). While all patients suffer from quality-of-life issues due to decreased limb perfusion, unmanaged PAD ultimately leads to about 250,000 annual low extremity amputations in the western world. Surgical and endovascular revascularization is performed in an effort to reopen occluded vessels, but 40% of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) do not qualify for these procedures due to extreme tissue damage and/or diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Even with revascularization, the rate of amputation and five-year mortality rate remain high. Thus, these patients have a critically unmet need for limb salvage therapy.  Biomaterials have shown promise in the treatment of numerous diseases, including PAD. We were the first to show a decellularized skeletal muscle ECM hydrogel improved perfusion, arteriogenesis, and muscle regeneration in rat hindlimb ischemia injury. In side-by-side comparisons of skeletal muscle ECM and a human umbilical cord ECM, only the skeletal muscle ECM improved skeletal muscle morphology and regeneration, suggesting a tissue-specific effect in muscle-dependent regeneration. Others have shown that tissue specific decellularized materials impact tissue specific cell types in vitro, but has not been definitively studied in vivo.  Thus, the goal of this proposal is to mechanistically interrogate tissue specificity of ECM hydrogels on skeletal muscle regeneration through quantitative systems-level analysis. We will be the first group to demonstrate quantitatively and functionally the impact of properly controlled tissue specific ECM hydrogels in a complex in vivo microenvironment. We hypothesize that the tissue specific source of decellularized extracellular matrix will differentially impact whole muscle function, genetic pathway activation, and the spatiotemporal muscle regenerative response in vivo. We propose to develop improved ECM hydrogels for PAD to revascularize and regenerate damaged skeletal muscle with the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Demonstrate impact of decellularized hydrogel tissue specificity on functional whole muscle contractility and blood perfusion.  Aim 2: Determine effects of tissue specific ECM hydrogels on transcriptomic and spatiotemporal cellular responses in muscle regeneration.  This project will use a myriad of multi-scale tools, such as biomaterial fabrication techniques, in vivo animal studies, muscle functional testing, bioinformatics, and immunohistochemistry to accomplish the aims and develop the PI for a career in scientific research. With an aging population the incidence of PAD is expected to increase with no synchronous improvements in treatment strategies. We have the potential to reduce this extreme outcome through mechanistic understanding of minimally invasive, injectable, and easily fabricated decellularized materials."
"9262059","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use exerts a tremendous societal, healthcare and economic burden, and is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Extensive preclinical data indicates pharmacological stressors increase drug seeking/self-administration across drugs of abuse (including nicotine). Clinical translation of thi robust preclinical observation has been limited. My Sponsor (Dr. Greenwald) was first to demonstrate this finding in human substance users. Data from our lab indicate that pharmacological stressors produce a reliable physiological stress response, are medically safe, and increase drug seeking/self-administration. However, no published studies have investigated neurobiological mechanisms associated with stressor-potentiated drug seeking/self-administration. The goal of this application is to expand my Sponsor's work to investigate the effects of an acute pharmacological stress-induction on frontostriatal network function, neurochemistry, subjective internal state, and nicotine seeking/self-administration.  The frontostriatal network (emanating from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]) is implicated in  cognitive processes associated with nicotine seeking/self-administration, including: self-control, delayed gratification, and cigarette/smoking cue reactivity. Using a within-subject randomized crossover design, we will examine the effects of combined oral pretreatment with yohimbine [YOH: ?2-adrenoreceptor antagonist] and hydrocortisone [HYD: glucocorticoid agonist] relative to placebo [lactose] on frontostriatal network function, dlPFC neurochemistry, nicotine seeking/self-administration, and subjective effects (affect, anxiety, withdrawal and craving) among current smokers. Overall hypotheses: YOH+HYD pretreatment will induce a physiological stress response, reduce dlPFC engagement, uncouple dlPFC control of brain reward regions, attenuate glutamate response during cognitive task performance, and potentiate nicotine seeking/self- administration. The experimental design, methods, and hypotheses are based on the strong preliminary and published data from the Sponsor's laboratory and the scientific literature. Significance: Our approach will facilitate investigation f plausible neurobiological mechanisms associated with stressor-potentiated drug seeking/self-administration, an important and understudied clinical phenomenon.  This project represents the first study of a programmatic line of inquiry into neurobiological mechanisms associated with drug seeking/self-administration. Potential future research studies would; A) expand YOH+HYD dose combinations, B) investigate other substance dependent populations (e.g. marijuana, cocaine), and pretreat with C) extended-release guanfacine (?2-adrenoreceptor agonist) or D) distress tolerance/relaxation techniques which may attenuate stressor-potentiated drug seeking/self-administration. I have assembled a collaborative team of mentors, each possessing unique expertise relevant to the current proposal, which will provide me a multidisciplinary training experience consistent with my career goals."

"9259985","CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INVESTIGATORS ABSTRACT  Over its 50 year history, the Harvard-NIEHS Center has been a leader in producing outstanding Environmental Health Science investigators. Residing within the Harvard academic, research community dedicated to producing exceptional scholars, the Career Development Program leverages the rich array of resources available in this academic community to specifically develop environmental health investigators at all levels, by facilitating access, providing support and resources uniquely targeted to environmental health science careers.  The Program fosters the development of talented investigators from a wide range of disciplines by creating opportunities for multidisciplinary environmental health research complemented with access to the Center facilities (e.g. Facility Cores) and resources (e.g. Pilot Projects) for developing innovative research initiatives. The Research Core seminars and workshops and the Center colloquium provide opportunities for new investigators to be introduced into the community of Center investigators. Secondly, the Program assists new investigators in progressing to independent status by enhancing their research skills and by specific assistance in applying for Career Development Awards and independent research grants. This includes multiple opportunities for training and support activities, complemented with specific Center training and support targeted to environmental health issues. All Center investigators are enrolled in formal Harvard mentoring programs with specific mentoring through the Center Research Cores and Career Development Program. The progress of each investigator is monitored and reviewed annually.  Specific salary support is provided for outstanding young faculty as Center New Investigators in partnership with the sponsoring Departments and the Dean. These New Investigators are specifically identified to address the center goals of recruiting scholars from new disciplines, building capacity in genes/epigenetics, diversifying connections, advancing innovative approaches, and promoting outstanding scholarship.  Over the last five years, the Center has seen increased interest with new investigators from a wide range of academic departments and medical institutions in the Harvard Longwood Medical Area. More than half of the Pilot Projects awards have gone to new investigators who have not been Center Members. Three of the Five Center New Investigators have come from disciplines outside of environmental health, and four have joint faculty appointments in Environmental Health and other departments (Epidemiology; Genes and Complex Diseases, and Engineering and Applied Sciences). Center investigators have received 15 career development awards from NIH and 10 more from non-governmental agencies. Finally, 22 Center investigators have received faculty appointments at other academic institutions. All these measures indicate a highly successful Career Development Program producing new leaders in environmental health science."
"9461968","The Rhode Island Child Clinical Trials Collaborative (RI-CCTC) at Hasbro Children's Hospital, Women & Infants Hospital and Brown University will be an ideal clinical center for the ISPCTN. Our State demographic includes many underserved, minority and immigrant children, who have high rates of infant mortality, asthma, obesity, prematurity, mental health problems and special health care needs. This high risk population has not been previously included in many clinical studies; hence, they will benefit both directly and indirectly from the work of the RI-CCTC. Rhode Island is uniquely organized for population-based clinical research: it has one major obstetric hospital (70% of all deliveries in the state), one children's hospital (90% of all pediatric admissions in the state) and one health department, as well as an engaged community. These factors allow for effective enrollment, retention and follow-up of study participants in clinical trials, giving the RI-CCTC the potential to make a strong impact. We will leverage our rich network of collaborations with many existing research, education and public health programs, as well as affiliations with national research networks. These partners share our commitment to children's health and child health research. The Brown University School of Public Health and the Alpert Medical School, including the Departments of Pediatrics and OB/GYN, recently received a large gift to create the Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute (HCHII), which is focused on understanding the prenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors that lead to childhood asthma, obesity and autism. Funding of the RI-CCTC will enable us to leverage the resources of the HCHII to create a much broader and more powerful research network to serve children in the state of RI. Investigators in the Schools of Public Health and Medicine have considerable expertise in the study of environmental exposures and their impact on children. The PI, Phyllis A. Dennery, has had consistent NIH funding for her basic/translational research, has participated in many training grants and multicenter clinical trials, and has won mentoring awards. The Co-PIs, Drs. Abbott Laptook and Thomas Chun, have been active participants in the NIH funded Neonatal Research Network and the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. This team will ensure the success of the RI-CCTC in fulfilling the intent of the ECHO Program to investigate the longitudinal impact of pre-, peri-, and postnatal environmental exposures on pediatric health outcomes. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide new opportunities for patient enrollment in a national pediatric network through collaboration between academic research centers and institutions; 2) Leverage established strengths in public health and epidemiology to identify environmental exposures that will support the prospective trials of the ISPCTN; 3) Develop programs to educate and mentor clinicians and basic scientists to become independent investigators in the area of clinical research"
"9308511","PROJECT SUMMARY Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their legal status, Native American reservations (NARs) and First Nations reserves are important sources of lower- or un-taxed cigarettes in the U.S. and Canada. In some geographic areas and times, the prevalence of NAR purchases reaches over 40%. Data from the 2010-11 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey implies that 5.6 million smokers live in 7 states where the prevalence of NAR purchases is between 15% and 35%. The policy trend towards higher cigarette taxes means that tax avoidance through NARs is likely to grow substantially. The 2014 Surgeon General's Report, the CDC (2015), and the National Research Council Institute of Medicine (2015) stress the public health significance of, and need for additional research into, contraband cigarette markets including NARs. The project's broad goal is to study the impact of NAR cigarette availability on smoking, birth outcomes, and health disparities. Aim 1 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on adult smoking participation. We will analyze individual-level data on smoking from multiple large U.S. and Canada secondary data sets. Our econometric specification will test 4 hypotheses: 1) that state cigarette excise taxes reduce adult smoking; 2) that the impact of taxes on smoking varies depending upon the availability of NAR cigarettes; 3) that the availability of NAR cigarettes has a causal treatment effect to increase smoking; and 4) that the impacts of taxes and NAR cigarette availability on adult smoking varies with socioeconomic status. Aim 2 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on youth smoking participation, cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking initiation. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of youth smoking. Aim 3 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on health outcomes and health disparities. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of health outcomes. Aim 4 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the indirect effects of the availability of reservation cigarettes on the prices charged by off-reservation cigarette retailers. Our econometric analysis will test whether cigarette sales on nearby NARs is associated with lower cigarette prices and sales off-reservation. Aim 5 is to conduct a more structural econometric analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on individuals' joint decisions about smoking, purchase location, and cigarette price paid. We will estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model. The estimated model will directly estimate key mechanisms or links in the chain of causality: the impact of taxes and distance on the probability of NAR purchases; and the impact of NAR purchases on cigarette prices paid.

"9280316","Abstract We will use detailed biophysical (Dynamical Systems) modeling to pursue two large questions critical to integrating and understanding the results of Projects 1-4. What are the physiological origins of the brain rhythms studied empirically in Projects 1-4? How do network level rhythms depend on the physiological properties of the underlying neuronal ensembles? Modeling uses differential equation descriptions of physiology at the level of single cells, synapses and networks. Data from Projects 2 and 4, along with prior models and in-vitro findings, will help to build and refine physiologically-plausible cell circuit models that generate oscillations. Models will help investigate how local brain rhythms, periodic (and aperiodic) sensory inputs and top-down signals combine in Active Sensing. We will rigorously test questions concerning the neuron populations, interconnections and cellular processes (e.g., conductances) that generate specific rhythms (e.g., alpha and delta) in multiple parts of the brain during Active Sensing tasks. Laminar activity profiles sampled concurrently from multiple cortical and thalamic areas in Projects 2 and 4 will allow us to model and constrain rhythmic dynamics at a network level, which is the a-priori level of analysis in Projects 1 and 3. In an ?iterative loop,? models will generate testable predictions at cellular, cell-circuit and and small network levels to be tested in monkeys, and at larger network levels to be tested in humans (Core A), in each case feeding back into the modeling. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are: AIM 1: Model thalamocortical interactions underlying intrinsic sampling rhythms in Active Sensing. AIM 2: Model the physiology of selective thalamocortical entrainment to rhythmic input. An ongoing R21 AIM 3: Model the large scale circuitry orchestrating distinct operational modes of Active Sensing.. CENTER SYNERGIES: This project will use thalamic and cortical data from Project 4 to model cortical and thalamic interactions in selective entrainment to ?extrinsic? rhythms, and data from Project 2 to model cortical and thalamic interactions underlying ?intrinsic? rhythmic sampling of sensory input. After the computational models have incorporated sufficient empirically-derived information, results that make testable new predictions for the physiology studies will be used to refine their analyses. They will also provide tools with which to explain the effects of thalamic projections on cortical coherences seen in the analyses of projects 1 and 3. Specific model predictions will be tested with phamacological manipulations in monkeys, and with direct brain stimulation in monkeys and in selected ECoG sstudies (Core A), and the results will refine the model."

Improving Diagnostic and Management Tools for Neurocysticercosis  (Perú-JHU TMRC Program) PROJECT SUMMARY  Taenia solium neurocysticercosis continues to be a major cause of seizures and epilepsy in most of the world. Our group has continuously worked in NCC for the last 25 years and has provided landmark contributions to its study, diagnosis, and treatment. This TMRC application builds on a recent ICIDR application and uses resources developed and acquired over this period including sample libraries, in vitro and animal models (including three new models recently developed in our settings) and recently available nanoparticle diagnostics and genomic data. Our objective is to provide improved diagnostics and monitoring as well as more efficient antiparasitic and antiinflammatory therapies in order to minimize brain damage which follows parasite death. Early diagnosis and improved treatment should result in reduced frequency of epilepsy secondary to NCC.  The Perú-JHU TMRC application frames three component Research Projects and three Cores to provide a fully functional research network and take advantage of the endemicity of the disease and our existing, highly successful research network in Perú. The scientific core will serve as the foundation to be used by the two research projects, and will include capacities for in vitro and animal models, molecular biology techniques, and analytic processes, and will be supported by the Data Management and Biostatistics Core. An Administrative Core including Ethics and Animal Care units will ensure full compliance with local and international research codes and regulations. Three projects comprise the program:  The three research projects are Component 1 - Improved Diagnostics Assays for Viable or Degenerating Neurocysticercosis; Component 2 - Biomarkers for Monitoring Treatment Efficacy in Human Neurocysticercosis, and Component 3 - Improving the Understanding and Treatment of Brain Inflammation in Neurocysticercosis. The Program will take advantage of the specific objectives of these research projects to provide a unified set of promising tools ready to be tested in clinical trials and translated to human use."
"9332016","PROJECT SUMMARY: Cancers of the colon and rectum are the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, but are potentially preventable through early detection of invasive or precancerous lesions. Of the currently recommended tests for screening average risk people, colonoscopy is the most commonly used in the United States, but stool-based tests such as fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), are the most commonly used globally. However, there is currently no strong evidence to inform highly consequential decisions on these competing screening strategies, which contributes to conflicting recommendations from policy groups including a Canadian task force recommendation against using colonoscopy for routine screening. Microsimulation studies report that FIT and colonoscopy can achieve similar overall lifetime effectiveness, but are based on assumptions of efficacy and adherence to regular screening that are not attainable in real practice. An added challenge is the paucity of well-developed statistical approaches that can account for varying levels of adherence, patterns of use such as cross-overs, and time-dependent confounding when estimating the effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening tests. Our proposed series of studies aim to: 1) estimate the effectiveness of FIT in reducing the risk of dying from CRC when compared with no screening, and 2) compare the effectiveness of FIT in reducing the risk of dying from CRC relative to screening colonoscopy. We will also assess for potential effect modification by race/ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status. We will use a nested case-control design with about 2000 cases and 8000 controls between 2014 and 2018 in a historical cohort of about 2 million screening-eligible people receiving care at Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California. Cases for the study will be men and women who were 52-89 years old at the date of death from CRC, each matched within health plan to four randomly selected controls based on age, sex, enrollment history, and geographic region. As secondary methodological aims, we will: 1) apply novel statistical methods to estimate FIT-colonoscopy comparative effectiveness in varying real-life screening patterns including imperfect adherence and crossover from FIT to colonoscopy; and 2) assess the use of a case-cohort design to inform future studies. As an exploratory aim, we will characterize the resources required to screen with FIT or colonoscopy as inputs for future microsimulation studies. Our study sites provide the full continuum of cancer care ranging from screening through end of life, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of people. We will identify receipt of screening colonoscopy and screening FIT in the 10-year window prior to the reference date, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures with selected chart audits to confirm colonoscopy screening indications. This will be the first observational study to address these critical scientific, clinical, and policy questions. The project will be implemented by an experienced team of high-impact scientists."
"9397720","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) The objective of this proposal is to develop clinically viable strategies for the quantitative estimation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) from dynamic computed tomography (CT) imaging with low radiation doses comparable to those received in common nuclear myocardial perfusion studies. Despite the proven clinical value of quantifying MBF (in ml/g/min), there are no widespread clinical methods to easily measure MBF in absolute units. Dynamic CT offers the potential to quantify flow, but the radiation dose imparted from these studies prohibits widespread acceptance. The specific aims of the proposal are to develop 1) optimal myocardial blood flow estimation methods, 2) low-dose dynamic CT acquisition strategies for MBF estimation, 3) unbiased data restoration algorithms and 4) image reconstruction methods based on trading off spatial resolution for noise reduction and constraining noise with a priori knowledge. These aims will be developed with simulations of dynamic contrast enhanced CT imaging and evaluated with patient exams. We hypothesize that accurate subendo- and subepi-cardial MBF estimates can be determined with low- dose dynamic CT through selection of acquisition strategies and judicious application of noise reduction strategies. This work proposes novel low-dose acquisition and data/image enhancement strategies to enable accurate quantitative estimates of blood flow in absolute units of ml/g/min. These methods will allow for substantial reductions in radiation dose, which is essential for patient safety, clinical application of dynamic CT for MBF measurement, and for other proven applications of dynamic CT. This work will position cardiac dynamic CT as a safe, easy, and widely available tool for quantitative MBF estimation, providing valuable clinical information for quantification of flow limiting disease, minimizing unnecessary catheterization procedures, informing therapy choices, and developing new therapies."
"9330495","Project Summary/Abstract  This project seeks to enhance our understanding of the clinical features, long-term consequences, and genetic underpinnings of delayed puberty, a common condition that affects 2-3% of adolescents. While delayed puberty has been reported to have negative effects on final height, bone mineral density, and self- esteem in adulthood, it remains unclear which patients with delayed puberty are at greatest risk for these outcomes. Furthermore, we have limited understanding of the physiological and genetic mechanisms that underlie delayed puberty.  This project treats delayed puberty not as a single, monolithic entity, but as a clinical phenotype that can be produced by at least two mechanisms. One mechanism is a global slowing of the developmental program that regulates not just the timing of puberty but also the pace of childhood growth and skeletal maturation; this global slowing is often called constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP). The other mechanism is a delay in pubertal timing in the absence of other delays in growth or skeletal maturation, producing an isolated delay in pubertal timing. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and both could potentially contribute to delayed puberty in an individual.  The first Aim of this project explores the clinical heterogeneity in delayed puberty by reviewing clinical records of delayed puberty patients and identifying correlations between variables using univariate and multivariate analyses. Aim 1 will also use latent class analysis, an unbiased, data-driven method, to identify distinct subgroups within delayed puberty.  The second Aim of this project assesses adults with a history of delayed puberty to determine if these adults have impairments in height, bone mineral density, self-esteem, or sperm counts (in men) compared to healthy control adults who had normal pubertal timing. The Aim further assesses whether these outcomes differ for the different subgroups of delayed puberty identified in Aim 1 and/or across predictor variables such as sex, body mass index, and prior treatment with sex steroids.  The third Aim of this project seeks to identify the genetic causes of delayed puberty by examining the contributions of both rare variants (identified through whole-exome sequencing) and common variants (identified through genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms). This Aim will also link these genetic causes to the subgroups of delayed puberty identified in Aim 1 and the adult outcomes examined in Aim 2.  By identifying the pathophysiologic mechanisms and genetic causes underlying delayed puberty, as well as the clinical outcomes associated with these factors, these studies will improve our understanding of a common pediatric condition and may lead to new insights into the mysteries of how the pace of childhood growth and the timing of puberty are determined."
"9276770","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To apply newer electromyographic techniques to upper airway muscles with a view towards identifying important therapeutic targets in obstructive sleep apnea. Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring of trainees and research activities. Research project: Obstructive sleep apnea is an important disease due to its high prevalence and well established neurocognitive and cardiovascular sequelae. Treatment of this disease remains problematic since the existing therapies are either poorly tolerated or have variable efficacy, leading many to advocate for further research into underlying mechanisms. Prior research has established in the importance of the upper airway muscles (such as the genioglossus and tensor palatini) in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. However, multi-unit electromyographic recordings provide an average representation of innumerable motor units yielding fairly incomplete information about the behavior of individual motor units. We have current R01 funding to perform high frequency sampling of the electromyogram to define the various motor units within the genioglossus muscle. These newer studies have revealed marked complexity in the behavior of the genioglossus muscle, with 6 distinct firing patterns being identifiable. A rise or fall in the genioglossal multiunit EMG is therefore difficult to interpret since these changes could be mediated by any of a number of individual motor unit firing changes. We have observed specific units which may be most critical for the maintenance of pharyngeal patency. Such units would thus we logical therapeutic targets which we can address with our neuroanatomy collaborators. We have also begun studies using single fiber EMGs and MacroEMGs which a view towards performing more quantitative assessments of various upper airway muscles. We will use the K24 funding to focus on clinically relevant findings from the R01 such that ultimately clinicians will be able to define upper airway motor function without the need for complex or invasive physiology testing. This K24 award would allow us to pursue interesting hypotheses which may ultimately lead to new easily applicable treatments for sleep apnea. This award will also allow the PI to dedicate more time to training young investigators in the field of sleep and respiratory physiology by reducing his clinical responsibilities. The need for an investigator pipeline has been termed a crisis (Sleep. 2006 29:1260) which the PI would like to continue to address through his research and his dedication to his trainees."
"9461965","ABSTRACT The principal objective of the Hawaii IDeA Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Clinical Trials (HIPACT) is to establish a pediatric clinical trials team in Hawaii to participate in community valued, and scientifically valid multi-center clinical trials, as a partner in the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). The overarching goal is to improve the health and wellbeing of the diverse multiethnic populations of Hawaii. As the western most IDeA-eligible state, Hawaii is home to large populations of diverse rural and underserved populations, including indigenous Hawaiian communities, and immigrant populations of Pacific Islanders and Asians. These communities suffer geographic isolation nationally as well as locally resulting in significant health inequities. Few clinical trials have targeted children from these ethnic groups or Islands. This is unfortunate because these same communities offer a stable population base that is ideal for conducting long- term longitudinal studies. The community-based University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH Manoa) John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) Department of Pediatrics (DOP) will serve as the home for HIPACT with an innovative fusion of local and national entities included as partners. Locally, our first partner is the Hawaii Pacific Health (HPH) owned regional perinatal medical center - Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children (KMCWC) and the HPH Research Institute (HPHRI). The second partner is the largest community health center in the state ? the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC) that largely serves Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders. Nationally, partnerships have been established with the Mountain West IDeA Clinical and Translational Research-Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN), and the Research Centers in Minority Institutions Translational Research Network (RTRN). The following HIPACT Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To launch and implement pediatric clinical trials as an ISPCTN site by providing an experienced, coordinated, and a committed team of pediatric-trained personnel; 2) To engage Hawaii and other IDeA state communities to provide access to clinical trials including rural and underserved infants, children and adolescents, many of who are Asian, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders; 3) To contribute to the ?science? of ISPCTN multicenter clinical trials research in disparate underserved and/or rural communities by better understanding and overcoming barriers, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes; and 4) To increase the number and expertise of JABSOM pediatric clinical trials faculty and their support teams through professional training and education, ultimately to expand ISPCTN research capacity. Hence, HIPACT is well positioned with a unique blend of rural and underserved communities, experienced leadership, committed partners and community leaders to work with ISPCTN and successfully launch and enroll infants, children and adolescents from Hawaii and across IDeA partner institutions in ISPCTN approved trials."
"9298154","The initiation and maintenance of motivated behaviors often are characterized by a high degree of vigor,speed, persistence and work output, and organisms frequently make effort-related decisions based upon cost/benefit analyses. In addition, clinicians emphasize the importance of effort-related symptoms, such as anergia, psychomotor retardation, apathy and fatigue, in major depression and other disorders. These motivational symptoms are among the most common symptoms of depression; they can strongly interfere with activities of daily living, and can be highly resistant to treatment. While catecholamine uptake inhibitors appear to be somewhat effective drugs for treating the psychomotor/motivational symptoms of depression, clinical studies indicate that serotonin transport (SERT) inhibitors such as fluoxetine are relatively poor at treating anergia and fatigue, and in fact, can induce or exacerbate these symptoms. Our laboratory has developed behavioral tasks in rodents that assess the brain mechanisms regulating the exertion of effort and effort-related choice behavior. These tests of effort-related choice behavior allow animals to make choices between high-effort alternatives that lead to more highly valued rewards vs. low-effort alternatives that lead to less valued reward (i.e., less preferred or lower in magnitude). Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that tests of effort-based choice behavior can be used as animal models of the effort-related motivational symptoms of depression. A number of conditions associated with depression in humans can alter effort-related choice in rats, and bias animals towards low-effort options. For example, rats treated with vesicular monoamine transport inhibitor tetrabenazine, which induces or exacerbates symptoms of depression in humans, can alter effort-related choice, reducing selection of the high effort alternative. These effects can be reversed by co-administration of putative antidepressants such as the adenosine A2A antagonist MSX-3, the established antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin), which inhibits catecholamine uptake, and the selective dopamine (DA) uptake blockers GBR12909 and PRX-14040. Importantly, research from our laboratory shows that SERT inhibitors, rather than reversing the effort-related effects of tetrabenazine, actually tend to exacerbate them. Furthermore, our recent studies show that the SERT inhibitor fluoxetine reduces effort expenditure and lowers extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens, which is consistent with the relatively poor effects of these drugs on motivational symptoms in depressed people. The goal of the proposed investigation is to determine if the 5-HT2C receptor mediates these effects by studying the ability of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C antagonists, injected systemically or intracranially, to reverse the effects of fluoxetine on effort-related decision making and extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens. This research could lead to a greater understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie the regulation of effort-related aspects of motivation, and foster the development of treatments that augment the therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT uptake inhibitors."
"9217206","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Traditional means to identify and treat arterial disease are hampered by their inability to direct therapeutics to local atheroma components. Novel targeted acoustic delivery agents (liposomes) with novel ultrasound delivery methodologies may overcome these problems.  Liposomes are phospholipid vesicles enclosing an aqueous space. We have developed a unique methodology that, by process and composition, makes these liposomes echogenic. This formulation allows modification for antibody conjugation and therapeutic (drug/bioactive gas) incorporation. Work by our group has demonstrated that these formulations can incorporate and deliver therapeutics to cells, while retaining their echogenic properties. The latter is important as the addition of therapeutic ultrasound has a unique effect on these echogenic liposomes by increasing cellular delivery.  Our principal aim is to develop a model carrier and a technique that has the ability to incorporate a therapeutic with delivery to a target structure while retaining the therapeutic?s effects.  We have: a) developed robust therapeutic echogenic immunoliposomes (ELIP); b) developed ultrasound parameters for therapeutic delivery of loaded ELIP and c) determined the efficacy of our therapeutic ELIP in slowing/stabilizing atheroma progression.  We will now translate our discoveries for use in unstable atheroma and translate them into the clinical setting. We will develop a novel ultrasound methodology for therapeutic delivery into the coronary arterial beds. We will evaluate our therapeutic-loaded carriers with ultrasound activation in vivo and translate our optimal strategy into the clinical setting.  Development of these agents and techniques would have far reaching implications for the treatment of chronic high risk atherosclerosis."
"9313083","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is projected that by 2050, 3.6 million Americans will be living with a lower-limb amputation (LLA). LLA is associated with impaired balance, decreased physical function, and reduced societal participation. To date, limited research has been done to identify and evaluate modifiable factors that may contribute to impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions among individuals with LLAs. Given that optimal trunk function is critical for foundational activities, such as standing and walking, we believe that the trunk may be an overlooked region of impairments in these individuals. Consider that individuals following a LLA may be bed- bound for 2 weeks or more and may wait nearly 8 weeks before acquiring a prosthesis for gait training. Among healthy, younger adults, being bed-bound has been shown to negatively impact trunk muscle size and function, and long-term muscle impairments persist even after resumption of normal activities. Our previous work, among older adults, demonstrates that poor trunk muscle composition is predictive of reduced physical function, while the work of other investigators demonstrates that reduced trunk extensor endurance is associated with impaired balance and mobility, among older adults. Such relationships are not surprising as trunk muscles (i.e. multifidi, transversus abdominis, psoas, quadratus lumborum) are critical active spinal stabilizers during gait. Among individuals with a unilateral LLA, trunk compensations are common and trunk movement asymmetries are prevalent. Trunk compensations may require muscular function that is beyond the individual's capabilities given the period of immobility and muscular disuse, while trunk movement asymmetries may lead to side-to-side muscle differences. Trunk muscle impairments and asymmetries are modifiable with exercise interventions, but first, relationships between trunk muscle characteristics and function should be established. The central hypothesis of this work is that, among individuals with LLAs, trunk muscle impairments and asymmetries are present and related to poor balance, impaired physical function, and reduced societal participation. We propose a cross-sectional study of 34 individuals with a unilateral LLA [transfemoral (n=17); transtibial (n=17)] who will be compared to matched controls (n=17). The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine whether impairments and asymmetries in trunk muscle function are associated with the presence of a unilateral LLA; (2) to provide the first objective magnetic resonance imaging evidence that trunk muscle morphological findings are associated with the presence of a unilateral LLA; and (3) to determine the extent to which trunk muscle characteristics are associated with balance, physical function, and societal participation among individuals with LLAs. This study will allow us to determine whether trunk muscle impairments and asymmetries are associated with the presence of a LLA. Results will inform future, longitudinal work evaluating whether trunk muscle characteristics predict balance, function, and participation, and thus, should be considered as potential modifiable factors in future interventional studies among individuals with a LLA."
"9251893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have dramatically advanced the study of heritable human genetic cardiac diseases. While these advances will eventually lead to new treatment options and improved patient counseling, these cellular model systems also permit mechanistic insights and provide a platform for modeling human cardiac tissues. The latter is critically important as patients with cardiomyopathies (genetic and non-genetic forms) or heart failure often experience arrhythmias that can result in sudden death. To study the predisposition of genetic disease syndromes to cause arrhythmias in cardiac tissue, iPSC-CMs will be cultivated in engineered heart slices (EHS), developed by our team that recapitulate a natural 3D microenvironment and enable electromechanical interactions among cells and the extracellular matrix. Our EHS support the growth of engrafted iPSC-CMs; provide important topological, biochemical, and mechanical signals to the cells; manifest functional tissue behavior, including coordinated electrophysiological and contractile activity; and can sustain cardiac arrhythmias in a quantifiable manner. In this project, we propose to use EHS to investigate mechanisms underlying the manifestation and progression of arrhythmias that promote sudden death. As a genetic tool for modeling arrhythmias, we will study iPSCs generated from probands of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVC) that affect proteins of the cardiac desmosome. In patients, this disease is highly pro-arrhythmic and can lead to sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Hence, the goal of this project is to investigate how structural defects promote arrhythmias in EHS. Specifically we will determine if 1) mutations of desmosomal proteins operate in the early concealed phase of AC to impair intercellular mechanical coupling, resulting in abnormal electrical coupling, slowing of electrical conduction, and reentrant arrhythmia, and 2) secondary alterations in sodium channel function also result in slowing of electrical conduction and arrhythmia. The project involves three complementary and related Aims. Aim 1 will examine the importance of syncytial interactions and tissue microenvironment on the expression and progression of the disease phenotype in ARVC iPSC-CMs. Aim 2 will develop models of simulated exercise to determine increased risk of arrhythmia in EHS models of ARVC. Aim 3 will investigate the instructive cues of different native, extracellular matrices on cellular remodeling and tissue- level arrhythmia in EHS models of ARVC. The outcome of this research will shed light on mechanisms of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death associated with abnormalities of mechanical junctions that operate not only in ARVC but also in other more common forms of cardiomyopathies. Our study on tissue microenvironment and disease progression in the cardiomyocyte represents a critical step towards the identification of primary and ancillary pro-arrhythmic disease pathways that may prove invaluable to the development of new therapies designed to treat heritable cardiac diseases."

Evidence suggests that individuals with PTSD have an impairment in attention in the presence of threat information, often described as an attentional bias for threat. It is thought that this attentional bias serves to maintain and exacerbate PTSD symptoms. While a bottom-up (i.e., more automatic, sensory-driven) attentional bias to threat has been studied extensively in PTSD, relatively little is known about the role of top-down (i.e., more controlled, effortful, and goal-directed) attentional processes in this line of research. Theory and preliminary evidence suggests that attentional control processes (inhibition, shifting, working memory updating) may be used to override bottom-up, or more reactive attentional bias to threat. Thus, these cognitive processes may be used to alleviate trauma-related distress in the short-term, and perhaps, over longer periods of time as well. The proposed study will utilize innovative translational research methods to elucidate the cross-sectional and prospective roles that top-down cognitive processes play in threat-related attentional bias in PTSD. The use of three assessment sessions, over the course of one year, will allow us to determine the degree to which the use of these cognitive processes to regulate threat-related attentional biases is adaptive over a prolonged period of time. Moreover, we will remedy several limitations of previous research by (a) using state-of-the-art eye-tracking equipment to provide a reliable continuous measurement of attentional biases, (b) measuring the specific components of attentional control via behavioral tasks, and (c) examining both positive and negative emotionally arousing images. Adult participants (2 groups [Trauma-exposed Control and PTSD]) will complete a battery of self-report questionnaires, an eye tracking task, and a comprehensive battery of behavioral measures assessing multiple domains of effortful cognitive processes at a single laboratory session. Additionally, participants will complete all of the self-report measures administered at the laboratory session at two follow-up sessions, six and twelve months after the laboratory session. This study is innovative in that it seeks to examine the interactive effect of top-down and bottom-up attentional processes in order to explicate the nature of threat-related attentional biases in PTSD. This innovative approach, using objective behavioral measures of top-down cognitive processes in combination with eye-tracking equipment, may greatly advance our understanding of the complex nature of threat biases in PTSD, provide more accurate predictions of vulnerability for experiencing prolonged PTSD symptoms, and have important treatment implications. Specifically, identifying the specific cognitive processes that modulate this threat bias may result in the development of clinical interventions that directly target these processes in the service of alleviating trauma-related distress."
"9306642","Harmful alcohol use (heavy use, abuse, and dependence) in adulthood is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Longitudinal data indicate that rates of heavy alcohol use, marijuana use, and daily smoking peak in the 20s and decline slowly thereafter. Rates of abuse and dependence on alcohol and illicit drugs follow a similar trend. However, there is a substantial portion of the population whose substance use persists or even escalates through young adulthood. Sustained alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana misuse can progress to dependence and contribute to failure to successfully adopt adult roles and to the emergence of social, health, and mental health problems. The proposed study uses data from the longitudinal International Youth Development Study (IYDS) to examine the persistence and desistence of alcohol use and related harms in adulthood. The current proposal seeks support to follow-up the Washington State (WA) IYDS cohort at ages 29 and 31 years. Support to follow up the Victoria, Australia (VIC) cohort is being provided separately. The IYDS is a gender-balanced, multiethnic, representative sample that used matched assessments and methods in the two states (WA and VIC). The panel of 1556 participants was previously interviewed 4 times at ages 13, 14, 15, (2002-04, funded by NIDA) and 25 (in 2014-15 with Australian research funding). Sample retention at age 25 was over 87% in both states. IYDS measures have been designed from a theoretically guided approach to identify varied patterns of substance use and risk and protective factors at the family, school, community, peer and individual levels. The study aims to: 1) compare patterns of persistence and desistence of alcohol use and related harms, 2) identify adolescent and concurrent adult risk and protective factors that predict alcohol use and related harms, and 3) pull together adolescent, young adult, and adult risk and protective factors into lifecourse mediational models. Cross-national comparisons are an integral part of all three aims. Understanding how adult influences lead to reductions in alcohol and other drug use is important in the current historical context where adult roles (e.g. marriage, child rearing, and education) are being progressively delayed. The proposed project will contribute to scientific understanding of modifiable factors that influence adult alcohol problems and will more precisely identify the processes that influence whether and why adults persist or desist in alcohol use and related harms during adulthood. The use of a cross-national design provides a unique and important opportunity for testing existing theories and prevention models of harmful alcohol use. Results will inform the development of effective prevention and treatment interventions aimed at reducing harmful adult alcohol use and related problem behaviors."
"9414809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) and a history of psychiatric hospitalizations are struggling with a cycle of institutional recidivim (repeated hospitalizations, incarcerations, and homelessness) and a lack of personal recovery. These problems are in part driven by fragmented, inaccessible community services; unengaged local stakeholders who could be partners in community support after hospitalization; frequent police contacts and poor communication between mental health and the police; and limited recovery support. For many, the promise of modern conceptualizations of recovery remains an unrealized promise. The Opening Doors to Recovery (ODR) model was developed to help such persons reduce institutional recidivism and engage in recovery. It does this by providing the participant with community support from a team of three Community Navigation Specialists (CNSs): a licensed social worker (the Professional CNS), a peer specialist with lived experience (the Peer CNS), and a family member of someone with SMI who has experience with the stress imposed on family members by the SMI and a complex, fragmented mental health system (the Family CNS). This team provides community navigation (mapping of all available community resources) and is embedded within the local community. They also provide ongoing recovery support by focusing on: (1) ensuring adequate treatment, (2) maintaining safe housing, (3) developing a meaningful day, and (4) using technology to support recovery. At least two other features of ODR distinguish it from other community-based services: a group of collaborative local partners is committed to supporting ODR and the work of the CNSs, and a novel linkage system with the police allows CNSs to respond immediately when one of their clients has an encounter with local law enforcement. All of these components of ODR work together to reduce institutional recidivism and promote recovery. Through a large-scale pilot/demonstration project involving 100 participants, we have demonstrated all aspects of feasibility, thoroughly established acceptability from diverse stakeholders, and shown promising effects in terms of reduced hospital stays and enhanced recovery. ODR is now ready for a more definitive randomized, controlled trial, and the research team is ideally suited and highly experienced to carry out such a trial. We will randomize 240 persons with SMI and a history of >2 inpatient stays in the past 6 months to ODR (n=120, followed for 12 months, with a maximum CNS caseload of 40) versus the existing Community Support Team (CST) model (n=120). Assessments will be conducted at baseline (at hospital discharge), and at 4, 8, 12, and 18 months. Our hypotheses center on ODR participants having fewer days of hospitalization, fewer arrests, better housing outcomes, and greater recovery, the latter measured with a diverse set of recovery measures (e.g., community adjustment, mental health recovery, community navigation competencies, meaningful day activities, hope, and empowerment). If our hypotheses are proven, we will have the needed evidence to move forward with dissemination activities for this new service model."

"9307067","This proposal is submitted in response to the RFA, ?Research answers to NCI's provocative questions?, in particular, question 10, which asks, How do microbiota affect the response to cancer therapies? Our preliminary data show that when tumor cells colonize the omentum, a fatty tissue in the peritoneal cavity, they trigger a profound Treg-mediated tolerogenic response that prevents tumor-specific CD8 T cells from clearing the tumor. Interestingly, this activity is specific for the omentum and involves a subset of Tregs known as visceral-adipose tissue (VAT)-associated Tregs. VAT-associated Tregs uniquely express the transcription factor PPARg and also express the ST2 component of the IL-33 receptor on their surface. These cells are found exclusively in adipose tisses and are not found in conventional lymhoid organs (like the spleen and lymph nodes) and are not found in peripheral sites. Importantly, VAT-associated Tregs are found in the omentum, which is the site of ovarian cancer metastasis. In additioin to showing that VAT-associated Tregs profoundly impair immunity to tumors that colonize the omentum, we also found that this activity is completely dependent on gut microbiota. As a result, VAT-associated Treg activity is impaired and anti-tumor immunity is restored in the omenta of germ-free mice. These results are surprising, since published data show that microbiota promote (rather than prevent) the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy. These results were explained by the ability of chemotherapy to compromise the gut epithelium, allowing the translocation of microbiota and thereby triggering an IL-17 response, which facilitates the effects of chemotherapy on the clearance of tumors. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the microbiota play opposing roles in promoting the immune suppressive Tregs under steady state conditions and by promoting the immune stimulatory Th17 responses following chemotherapy. Moreover, these types of responses are location dependent, with VAT-associated Tregs residing and responding primarily in fatty tissues like the omentum. Thus, therapy for ovarian cancer, which routinely metastasizes to the omentum, may have different outcomes than therapy to tumors in other locations. The experiments in this application test this hypothesis using a spontaneous mouse model of ovarian cancer and determine the mechanistic links between the gut microbiota and immunity in the peritoneal cavity using and ectopic model of ovarian cancer."
"9274540","PROJECT SUMMARY We are requesting a basic transmission electron microscope for the Electron Microscopy Core Facility (EMCF) at UT Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, TX. The EMCF is a campus-wide, institutionally supported, fee for service facility that provides electron microscopy services for basic and clinical science investigators at UT Southwestern. The requested instrument is intended to replace a nearly thirty year old microscope that is no longer state of the art and is frequently out of service due to failing components that are no longer manufactured and are difficult to find. Acquisition of the new microscope will enable the health related research of the 9 research laboratories listed in this application, as well as many other laboratories who use the EMCF in support of their NIH funded research. Among other projects, the requested microscope will be used to to study lung function and repair, the role of cell death in cancer and neurodegeneration, the causes of pre-term birth, the regulation of body fat metabolism, the molecular mechanisms of muscle disease, the role of adult stem cells in cancer proliferation, and the etiology of macular degeneration."
"9314888","ABSTRACT The purpose of this project is to develop a peer-based educational intervention to improve knowledge, attitudes, and uptake of the most effective contraceptives for teenagers, long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC). This project will be the first to use peer narratives to increase teenage contraceptive use, which is highly dependent on peer influences.1-10  Dr. Patel is a board-certified obstetrician gynecologist who has published 9 articles on contraceptive research11-19 and independently secured funding for one of her projects through the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists.15 Dr. Patel proposes to use a detailed career development plan involving obtaining an MPH, attending local and national seminars and conferences, obtaining one-on-one mentoring, writing manuscripts, and participating in hands-on research activities. These activities will allow her to establish a deeper understanding of qualitative methods, theoretical models of health behavior, and statistical tools.  Dr. Patel's advisory committee will consist of a primary mentor (Dr Abbey Berenson, MD, PhD) and 2 co- mentors (Dr. Deborah Thompson, PhD, and Dr. Peggy Smith, PhD). Dr. Berenson is a pediatric obstetrician gynecologist at UTMB with more than 20 years of experience in adolescent contraceptive research, having maintained federal support since 1994. Dr. Thompson is a senior faculty member at the Baylor College of Medicine with more than 15 years of experience leading research in designing and testing web-based programs to promote positive behaviors in children and adolescents. Dr. Thompson has received funding through the NIH and USDA, including 2 R01 awards. Dr. Smith is a professor in the Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Psychology, and Pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine and is the director of the Baylor Teen Health System, a system of 10 clinics that provides adolescent healthcare annually to more than 20,000 inner city teens across the Houston metropolitan area.  The proposed project will obtain testimonials on LARC use, via semistructured interviews from teenagers who use LARC. These testimonials will then be narrated by teen actors and converted into professional videos. Teen focus groups will be used to choose the most culturally effective narratives for the final intervention. These videos will be uploaded onto an electronic tablet so they can be viewed conveniently in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Future application through a web-based platform or delivery in nonmedical facilities can increase viewership and promote preventive healthcare in the community setting. The combination of experiences from this research project and the resources described in the career development plan will enable Dr. Patel to complete an R01 application to perform a larger RCT to test the intervention, leading her to an early career as an independent investigator."
"9331778","Project Abstract For over 40 years, the Society for Epidemiologic Research has offered a Doctoral Student Dissertation Workshop prior to its annual meeting where student dissertation research is reviewed, critiqued, and discussed in a supportive and constructive atmosphere by highly respected senior epidemiologists who are productive researchers and have a variety of epidemiologic, clinical, and methodological expertise. However, there is an unmet need to work toward creating a new generation of students that actively think about how to make their work more consequential. Thus, we propose to realign this workshop to introduce and train doctoral students to translate their findings back to the community of stakeholders and to look for ways to use their research to foster meaningful interventions that either prevent or reduce the burden of adverse health outcomes. This translation aspect has emerged as a significant priority area of epidemiology and public health and there is a critical need for student training that is often unmet by their institutions. Thus, the aims of this workshop will be to a) connect students with established senior mentors who will assess the scientific rigor and impact of their research, b) provide training in how to disseminate and translate research not only in the scientific literature, but also in clinical practices and communities that are most strongly affected, c) educate the students on how the findings of their dissertation can be implemented to prevent adverse health outcomes, particularly among various ethnic, racial and underserved populations, and d) provide preferential slots for underrepresented minority doctoral students and students from less well-established programs to optimize the workshop?s training impact. This workshop aligns with the goals of NCATS by a) training doctoral students to describe how their research lends itself toward translation of findings into clinical and preventive care, b) ensuring that doctoral student research is geared toward improving the health of all populations, with a particular emphasis on improving minority health and reducing health disparities, c) offering additional training to underrepresented minority doctoral students and students from less well-established programs to support a broader and more diverse research workforce, and d) sensitizing doctoral students to the importance of disseminating their research to the entire community of stakeholders, not just to the community of their peers."
"9333600","Excessive binge alcohol intake (large amount of drinking within a short period of time) has been widely recognized as a high risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common arrhythmia in diagnosed clinical practice. Although significant efforts have been made to date to reduce binge drinking, repeated binge remains prevalent nationwide and consequently the prevalence of alcohol associated AF is high. This causes a tremendous economic burden on our society due to expensive AF ablation procedures and high rate of recurrent AF after ablation if patients have coexisting cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, currently available pharmacological therapies for alcohol-provoked AF genesis remain ineffective due to a lack of understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Our proposed studies would fill this important knowledge gap by identifying stress-response c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as an important regulator in alcohol-provoked AF genesis. JNK is known to contribute to alcohol associated cell death and tissue injury. We have recently reported for the first time that activated JNK is critical in AF substrate formation and AF development. This JNK-AF relationship provides a logical pathway through which alcohol may increase propensity for AF. Indeed, our preliminary human and animal results indicate that excessive binge alcohol exposure dramatically increases JNK activation, which enhances calmodulin type II kinase (CaMKII, a well-known pro-arrhythmia molecule) dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca leak and aberrant diastolic Ca sparks/waves, thus increasing propensity for atrial arrhythmias. Inactivated JNK transgenic mice with dominant negative mutations attenuated these alcohol-provoked abnormal Ca activities. In this proposal, the JNK contribution on RyR channel dysfunction and abnormal Ca activities will be dissected using unique mouse models with genetically manipulated JNK or CaMKII activities or RyR2 single channel function. To potentially translate results from mouse models to humans, we will perform validation studies in human donor hearts. We will use complementary electrophysiological approaches (voltage/Ca dual channel optical mapping and confocal Ca imaging in intact atria/isolated atrial myocytes as well as in vivo AF induction) and biochemical techniques to gain a comprehensive picture of the relationship between alcohol-activated JNK and Ca-triggered AF via increased RyR2-mediated SR Ca leak (Aim1). The mechanistic basis of how alcohol-evoked JNK alters RyR2 channel function to increase SR leak and sparks/waves (Aim 2) will be detailed at the levels of permeabilized atrial myocytes and single RyR2 channels in mice with clinical applicability verified using human donor heart tissue. This proposal integrates important functional measurements and fundamental mechanistic studies along with appropriate alternative approaches. Pharmacological interventions that limit JNK activity and modify RyR2 channel function will be tested as potential therapeutic options to prevent and/or treat AF. JNK?s RyR2 action may also add to arrhythmia risk tied to other stresses (e.g. aging, obesity, heart failure, etc.). Thus, the underlying mechanism defined and therapeutic interventions tested here may extend the potential significance beyond alcohol associated AF."

"9291376","A common need for clinical developers of cell therapies, such as immunotherapeutic and stem cells, is a non- invasive means to visualize the fate of cells following injection. Imaging of cell trafficking can provide critical feedback regarding the persistence, motility, optimal routes of delivery and therapeutic doses. This project aims to synthesize and biologically evaluate innovative new imaging probes for sensitive in vivo cell tracking using fluorine-19 (19F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We will advance the formulation science of a compelling new class of ?metallo-perfluorocarbon? (MPFC) nanoemulsion imaging probes. These agents will be a key element to a multi-pronged strategy to advance cell detection sensitivity by an order of magnitude over current 19F MRI cell detection technologies. Overall, in 19F cell tracking, cell populations of interest are initially labeled in culture using perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions. Following transfer to the subject, cells are tracked in vivo using 19F MRI. The fluorine inside the cells yields cell-specific images, with no background signal. One of the bottlenecks preventing the broader adoption of 19F based cell tracking is sensitivity limits to sparse cell numbers. The sensitivity of this technology can be improved by a three-pronged approach: (1) molecular design and synthesis to improve the intrinsic sensitivity of the molecular signal generator and (2) nanoemulsion probe formulation with cell targeting to enhance intracellular delivery and uptake, and (3) employing MRI data acquisition schemes that have a more efficient signal-to-noise ratio per acquisition time (SNR/t). Recent results have demonstrated dramatically-enhanced sensitivity of fluorine MRI by molecular design. We have created a new class of molecules that combine highly fluorinated nanoemulsions with the magnetic properties of metals that are solubilized into the fluorous phase. Solubilized paramagnetic metal ions provide a dramatic reduction in the 19F spin-lattice relaxation time thereby enhancing SNR/t and cell detection sensitivity. It was discovered that iron is most effective metal at enhancing the fluorine MRI signal. Building on these preliminary results, the proposal has four Specific Aims: Aim 1. Chelation strategies for MPFCs. We will evaluate a range of suitable chelate molecules and synthesis strategies to stably incorporate metal ions into PFC. Aim 2. Enhanced cell delivery of MPFC nanoemulsion using cell penetrating peptides (CPPs). Successful MRI detection of cells critically requires optimal intracellular delivery of emulsified MPFC ex vivo. We will develop novel MPFC nanoemulsion formulations incorporating CPPs attached to the nanoemulsion surfactant to rapidly and optimally label cells for cell tracking. Aim 3. ?Smart? in vivo targeted nanoemulsions. As an exploratory extension of this work, we devise MPFC nanoemulsions that target tumors in vivo. Aim 4. In vivo imaging methods to track immunotherapeutic T cells in cancer. To evaluate new MPFC nanoemulsion probes, we will label T cells and deliver these to immunotherapeutic cancer models. To image these models, sparse sampling MRI acquisition methods (e.g., compressed sensing) will be implemented and optimized for MPFC agents to maximize SNR/t."
"9305382","Abstract Poor oral feeding with subsequent growth failure is an enormous problem for infants with complex congenital heart disease (CCHD) because persistent growth failure is associated with higher mortality following cardiac surgery, more post-operative complications, and delayed neurodevelopment. More than a quarter of all infants with CCHD and at least half of those with single ventricle disease have a feeding disorder by age 2 years, yet a thorough understanding of the specific issues with feeding in these infants is lacking. Clinical management for feeding often differs between infants with single ventricle disease and infants with biventricular disease, and both groups have feeding issues. However, differences in specific feeding behaviors and developmental skills between these two groups have not been described. Feeding is a dynamic process affected by multiple factors, conceptualized in dynamic systems theory as constraints that are defined as boundaries or limits on the ability to coordinate a task. Feeding constraints could be supportive (e.g., prescribed protocols) or limiting (e.g., severity of infant disease). The overall long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions to support and enhance oral feeding in infants with CCHD. The specific aims of the proposed project are to (1) characterize oral feeding dynamics during the initial hospitalization in newborn infants undergoing operative intervention for CCHD in the first month of life, (2) compare oral feeding dynamics and feeding constraints between infants with single ventricle versus biventricular disease, and (3) identify the relationships among feeding constraints, oral feeding dynamics, and feeding-related outcomes. Oral feeding dynamics (readiness to feed, behavioral and physiologic response) will be measured using the Early Feeding Skills (EFS) assessment tool for an overall assessment and the dynamic-EFS for a second-by-second analysis of videotaped feedings for relationships between behavior and physiologic response. Physiologic response will include continuous measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and heart rate variability. Task constraints will be measured by type of milk consumed (breast milk or formula). All infants will be bottle fed, which is standard for these newborns with CCHD, and rate of milk flow will be controlled with exclusive use of Dr. Brown?s Preemie nipple. External constraints will be measured with unit feeding guidelines and prescribed feeding protocols. Internal constraints will be measured by infant severity of disease and age at surgery. Outcomes will be measured for individual feedings using measures of feeding performance including total intake, proficiency (percentage of prescribed intake), efficiency (rate of milk intake), and feeding duration. Outcomes at discharge will include feeding milestones, growth, use of occupational therapy services, tube feeding at discharge, and length of stay. Knowledge of the unique characteristics of feeding in this population will inform and enable development of interventions tailored to specific capacities for feeding, thus promoting the health and well-being of these vulnerable infants through reducing morbidity and mortality and enhancing neurodevelopment."

"9406971","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In cardiomyocytes L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels mediate the ultimate cellular response to electrical activity: a change in intracellular Ca2+. The essential CaV1.2 channels are subject to multiple control mechanisms that when perturbed cause arrhythmias and heart failure. In this application we build upon our previous studies to address new aspects of CaV1.2 regulation and dysregulation with the overarching goal of exploring how fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) confer previously unrecognized regulation upon CaV1.2. A deceptively named subgroup of fibroblast growth factors (FGF11-14), FHFs are neither secreted nor function as growth factors. Rather, FHFs remain intracellular and were discovered to modulate voltage-gated Na+ channels. Here, we focus on our new findings, which reveal that FHFs are unexpected components of macromolecular complexes that influence CaV1.2, to explore CaV1.2 regulation and dysregulation by FHFs. We propose: 1) To determine how FHFs regulates CaV1.2 channel trafficking and targeting in cardiomyocytes. This builds on our preliminary data showing that FHFs affect trafficking and targeting of CaV1.2 to T-tubules in cardiomyocytes; and upon our discovery of specific FHF binding partners that may regulate these processes. We will exploit a new rapid knockin method to test informative mutants in cardiomyocytes. 2) To determine how FGF13 affects function and dysfunction within the heart. Here, we build upon new data showing that FGF13, the dominant FHF in rodent heart, regulates not only CaV1.2 function, but consequences of CaV1.2 function, such as the intracellular Ca2+ transient and the ventricular action potential. We have developed new mouse models to determine how FGF13 affects cardiac function at baseline and at stress. 3) To analyze the consequences of mutations in human FGF12. We have identified several mutations in FGF12, the FHF dominant in human heart, in patients with arrhythmia syndromes. We propose to examine how these mutations lead to arrhythmias using the novel and validated knock-in method in ventricular cardiomyocytes."
"9286612","PROJECT ABSTRACT Gene regulation ? how genes are turned on in the right place, at the right time and in the right amount ? is a problem central to most areas of biology and medicine. Our understanding of gene regulation began with classical studies in bacteria, which introduced the idea that proteins called ?transcription factors? (TFs) determine which gene is turned on by binding to regulatory DNA sequences and recruiting RNA polymerase (RNAP). The situation in eukaryotes, however, is far more complicated. We focus in this proposal on two critical aspects of eukaryotic gene regulation that are not addressed in the bacterial paradigm. First, eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin and accessibility to TF binding sites is dynamically re-organised by continuously expending external sources of energy, such as ATP. Second, in eukaryotes multi-protein co- regulators such as mediator and CREB-binding protein (CBP) intercede between TFs and RNAP, serving as ?integrators? of regulatory information. Pioneering studies from several laboratories have identified many of the molecular components involved in this regulatory complexity, however, the quantitative concepts used to reason about how eukaryotic gene regulation are still largely based on the bacterial paradigm. This is an alarming discrepancy in light of the central importance of gene regulation. In recent work, we used mathematical models rooted in physics to show that this bacterial paradigm cannot account for experimentally measured data in eukaryotes. We examined, in particular, the question of how sharply a gene is turned on in response to a TF, an important property in many contexts. We introduced new concepts for analyzing information integration by co-regulators and energy expenditure and showed how these processes could explain the observed sharpness. In this proposal, we seek to build upon this highly-productive, inter-disciplinary collaboration. We will integrate mathematical theory with quantitative experiments in the well-studied model organism Drosophila melanogaster to identify which molecular mechanisms of information integration and energy expenditure are involved in regulating the developmental gene hunchback, whose sharp expression is crucial for patterning the early fruitfly embryo. As in the classical bacterial studies, we anticipate that a deep analysis of this particular gene will provide a new foundation on which to understand in quantitative terms the regulation of other eukaryotic genes and thus, that this study will have broad impact across biology and medicine."
"9297901","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. The current standard of care for the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia is intravenous (IV) infusion of recombinant factor VIII (FVIII, for hemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX for hemophilia B). These protein products are expensive, require frequent repeated IV injections (which is painful and inconvenient), and are often targeted by antibody (?inhibitor?) responses; thereby complicating/neutralizing therapy, creating immunotoxicities, and further increasing costs. In fact, inhibitor formation, an antigen-specific CD4+ T helper cell-driven B cell response, is widely considered the most serious complication of current therapy for hemophilia. Forming an interdisciplinary research team to address this problem, our laboratories have been closely collaborating since 2007 to develop a bioengineering-based approach. We conceived and now validated the concept that oral delivery of bioencapsulated FVIII and FIX antigens produced by the chloroplasts of transgenic plants could suppress inhibitor formation in animal models of hemophilia. FVIII and FIX antigens were effectively delivered to the epithelium of the small intestine when expressed as fusions to a transmucosal carrier, and subsequently taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) in the lamina propria (LP) and Peyer's patches (PP). Tolerance was established (over a wide range, including very low antigen doses) by induction of multiple subsets of regulatory T cells (Treg) in an IL-10 dependent manner. In addition, this approach prevented and also reversed anaphylaxis against FIX. Importantly, we were able to generate chloroplast transgenic edible crop plants (lettuce), and scale up of production was successful to a commercial system that is used to cost- effectively generate GMP material. To further advance this approach, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Generate the next generation of transplastomic edible crop plants expressing FVIII antigen using cutting-edge chloroplast genomics tools and alternative transmucosal carriers. 2. Continue to define the mechanism of oral tolerance induction/immune regulation, in part through use of a model antigen. 3. Identify optimal plants for oral tolerance induction in hemophilia A mice; perform translational studies in hemophilia A dogs; and further strengthen oral tolerance by enhancing immune regulation or manipulating T cell metabolism. This work will facilitate translation of oral tolerance for hemophilia into clinical trials, define the mechanism of how plant cell-based oral tolerance is accomplished, pave the way for future combination protocols for optimal oral tolerance induction, and further advance genetic engineering of plants for biomedical applications."
"9252261","The mission of the Center for Environmental Exposure and Disease (CEED) is to improve human health by  performing transdisciplinary research to elucidate how the total environment, the genome and the epigenome  interact to mitigate the risk of disease. CEED research focuses on: 1) assessing and modeling exposures, 2)  discovering and applying biological response indicators which link exposures to mechanisms of pathogenesis,  3) developing and implementing targeted prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies, 4) reducing  exposures by influencing public policy, planning and regulation, and 5) engaging and informing stakeholders.

"9209555","This is a competitive renewal of our currently funded project that focused on the impact of dietary amino acids on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) function. Our data demonstrates that amino acids have varying anabolic or catabolic effects. There are 20 common dietary amino acids and our data demonstrates that the aromatic amino acids have the most potent anabolic effects, particularly in the aging mouse model. Aging (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice fed a low protein diet lose bone but this loss is prevented by dietary supplementation of aromatic amino acids. Our central hypothesis is that AAs are not just fuel, broken down to provide ATP for cell function, but rather that AAs normally function as ?nutritional hormones? binding to extracellular receptors and activating cell signaling pathways. Our data are consistent with the aging process resulting in the loss of the ability of BMSCs to ?sense? these normal anabolic signals from nutrients through epigenetic mechanisms. Further aging is associated with the accumulation of toxic breakdown products of these metabolites that interfere with their normal anabolic actions. We propose to characterize these nutrient related changes so as to develop effective countermeasures. Therefore, the specific aims of the proposal are: (1) Test the hypothesis that age-induced epigenetic changes in stem cells resulting in impaired function can be reversed by dietary interventions; and (2) Test the hypothesis that age-induced epigenetic changes in stem cells resulting in impaired function can be reproduced by dietary interventions. This project also will explore synergize with the other projects included in this application looking at effects of these amino acids and metabolites in aging muscle (Project 2), inflammatory cytokines (Project 3) and histone deacetylation (Project 4)."
"9264040","Core C Project Leader: Wall, Dennis P. Project Summary / Abstract The study of miRs and their regulatory control has led to impressive bioinformatic innovations with respect to algorithm design, target prediction, evolutionary canalization and divergence, and much more. What has not happened and is unique to this plan is the combination of these informatics advances with comprehensive and integrated functional analysis in the intact animal. Core C, through its interactions with Core B and the three driving biological projects targeting regulatory influence of miRs on sleep, associative learning and memory, and the neuromuscular system will provide this innovation in a model organism where neural circuits can be analyzed at many levels from behavior to cellular and molecular details. Specifically, Core C will develop the informatics infrastructure necessary to store and analyze all experimental data coming from these 4 sectors of the center proposal and, through reciprocal design, enable fast characterization of the functional impacts of specific miRs to study the impact on target networks and to determine instances of functional convergence. Core C will deliver the tools necessary for each driving project to form hypotheses about the influence of specific miRs on gene networks through microRNA recognition elements (MREs) in target mRNAs, and help steer the design of new experiments that have the highest likelihood of revealing the mechanisms of regulatory control that impact phenotype."
"9280313","Active exploration (Active Sensing) in the visual domain uses two different processes: overt exploration that occurs about 3-5 times per second via moving the eyes, and covert search utilizing a `spotlight' that continuously scans the visual scene by moving to new locations at a rate of up to 20 times per second. While overt exploration is considered a rhythmic behavior, the spotlight of attention utilized during covert search has traditionally been characterized as a single sustained spatial mechanism. Recent behavioral evidence has called this concept into question.!First, the attentional spotlight, rather than being sustained, flashes rhythmically, sampling the visual environment at frequencies in the theta band (4-8Hz), with alternating temporal windows of relatively enhanced and diminished processing. Second, our recent behavioral work supports the existence of two spatial mechanisms, concurrently sampling the visual scene: (i) a fixed spotlight that rhythmically samples the most relevant location, and (ii) a moving spotlight that rhythmically monitors less relevant locations. Thus, covert attention used during Active Sensing may fall into the class of rhythmic behaviors just like its overt counterpart. In this project, we will investigate the neural basis of rhythmic covert attention and relate it to neuronal oscillatory rhythms underlying overt search by recording simultaneously from multiple nodes of the network utilized during visual exploration in monkeys trained in both covert and overt attention tasks. In Experiment 1, we will use laminar multielectrodes to simultaneously record laminar profiles from area V4 and FEF and from their interconnected zone in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. Monkeys will be trained on a visual threshold detection task that parametrically examines rhythmic sampling from a location at which attention is sustained as well as rhythmic monitoring of one or two locations outside the focus of attention. We will specifically emphasize rhythmic cortico-cortical intra-areal interactions and the influence of the pulvinar in mediating communication between cortical areas. In Experiment 2, we will record from these areas while monkeys are engaged in an overt search task to detect visual objects; this task will be combined with the visual detection task that induces rhythmic sampling at an attended location used in Experiment 1 to directly compare mechanisms utilized during overt and covert search. We will also obtain ECoG signals from low impedance electrodes placed over the two cortical areas to relate these signals to the laminar profile acquired simultaneously. Such comparison will be beneficial for interpreting results from Project 1 that proposes to use similar tasks in human ECoG studies. Our findings, and those of Project 4, which uses similar tasks and recording methods to study auditory Active Sensing, will feed data to biophysical cellular- circuit modeling in Project 5. Across the Center, our studies will aim at establishing a neural basis for rhythmic overt and covert explorative behavior in the visual and auditory domains, and at constructing robust models that represent Active Sensing' s neuronal substrates at local circuit and brain network scales."
"9272400","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ?exible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still dif?cult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signi?cant developments in Arti?cial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identi?ed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains."

"9252486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood lead exposure is associated with many adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including reduced cognitive ability and increased behavioral problems. These neurocognitive and neurobehavioral outcomes are broadly hypothesized to result from abnormalities in neurodevelopment. However, while investigations of early brain development report reduced neuronal growth and impaired white matter maturation (hypomyelination) in response to lead exposure, these studies have exclusively been performed in animals. It is unclear if, and how, these key neurodevelopmental processes are similarly altered in human children; and at what level of exposure abnormalities become significant. Thus, there are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the neurotoxic actions of lead on the developing human brain, and how potential alterations ultimately give rise to cognitive deficits. This research aims to address these gaps by examining the relationships between blood lead level (BLL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of myelination and neurite (combined dendrites and axons) density in a preliminary longitudinal study following children from 12 to 24 months of age. As a first step, we will recruit 36 healthy toddlers between 10 and 14 months of age with blood lead levels between 0 and 10?g/dL, who will receive MRI and a comprehensive cognitive and behavioral assessment. BLL, MRI and neuropsychological assessments will be repeated at 12 month follow-up. From this complement of data, we will investigate the relationships linking BLL, brain structure, and cognitive ability t each age-point; as well as the relationships between the longitudinal changes in each of these measures. This study will provide the first and earliest evidence of brain structure alteration in children with varying degrees of lead exposure, and establish their relationship to concurrent measures of cognitive and behavioral functioning. We hypothesize that increased levels of blood lead will be significantly associated with reduced myelin and neurite content, and that these structural abnormalities will mediate the relationship between blood lead levels and cognitive ability. This preliminary investigation will provide crucial new insight into a pressing public health issue that carries significant social and economic cost. Results are anticipated to have far reaching consequences in regard to current screening and prevention policies."
"9259800","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selenium is an essential trace element that is incorporated into 25 human proteins as the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Interestingly, the co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine occurs at in-frame stop codons (UGA) that are found upstream of RNA structures known as selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements, which reside in the 3' UTR of all selenoprotein mRNAs. We have recently demonstrated that the factors known to be essential for Sec incorporation are, in fact, sufficient. These factors include a specialized elongation factor (eEFSec), a SECIS binding protein (SBP2), and a specialized transfer RNA (Sec-tRNASec). Significant progress has been made regarding which protein domains are important for Sec incorporation activity, but the mechanism by which these factors allow Sec incorporation has not been subjected to study in vivo, particularly in the context of embryonic development. In addition, an SBP2 paralogue exists, termed SECISBP2L, but it does not participate in Sec incorporation in vitro and its function remains unknown. As such, the study of selenoprotein synthesis and function is still an emerging field and requires the development of novel and affordable model systems. Here we propose to develop a zebrafish model system in which to study both the mechanism of Sec incorporation as well as selenoprotein function. The use of zebrafish is warranted for four major reasons: 1) the factors required for Sec incorporation are conserved in all vertebrates; 2) the complement of selenoproteins in fish is very similar to that in humans; 3) the cost of developing fish models is vastly lower than that in mice and 4) as a tractable model for vertebrate development, the use of zebrafish will allow unprecedented access to the mechanisms by which selenoprotein function during early development. In the first Aim we will lay the groundwork by investigating expression dynamics and developmental profile for Sec incorporation factors, after which we will determine the function of the SBP2 paralogue, SECISBP2L. Although SECISBP2L was identified at the same time as SBP2, its function has remained elusive. Our preliminary data derived from embryos injected with anti SECISBP2L morpholino oligonucleotides suggests that it may play a role in hematopoeisis and/or vascular development. In the second aim, we propose to model human disease in fish by introducing specific mutations in endogenous SBP2 and determining the effects on selenoprotein production. In addition, although we expect that SBP2 deletion will result in embryonic lethality, we propose to precisely define the developmental process that is altered in the absence of selenoproteins. Importantly, this methodology will allow the resolution of the long-sought function for the N-terminal half of SBP2, which is vertebrate-specific and has no known function. Finally, as an initial foray into studying the basic functions of selenoproteins in zebrafish, we propose to study macrophage function in order to determine the underlying basis for the role that selenoproteins are known to play in macrophage migration."
"9234497","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of limited resection vs. stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. However, approximately 25% of patients are diagnosed with early, potentially curable disease. While the standard treatment for stage I NSCLC is lobectomy, full resection is precluded in many patients due to limited lung function or high burden of comorbidities. These patients are managed with less aggressive, but still quite effective, limited lung resections. More recently, SBRT, has emerged as an alternative treatment for high operative risk patients with tumors ?5 cm in size. Despite rapid adoption, evidence supporting the use of SBRT is very limited. Phase I-II trials showed that SBRT is associated with 3- year survival rates comparable to limited resection. However, these studies likely overestimated the effectiveness of SBRT as they included patients without biopsy proven cancer. Moreover, all phase III studies evaluating SBRT have been closed prematurely due to poor accrual. Limited information is also available about adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QOL) following these treatments. Unfortunately, this knowledge gap is a major challenge in selecting the best treatment for patients at high risk for lobectomy and to translates into poorer outcomes. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) compare overall (primary outcome), lung cancer-specific and disease-free (secondary outcomes) survival of patients with stage I NSCLC ?5 cm in size treated with limited resection vs. SBRT; 2) evaluate rates of severe AEs among patients with stage I NSCLC ?5 cm in size treated with limited resection vs. SBRT; and 3) assess differences in lung function and QOL among patients with stage I NSCLC treated with limited resection vs. SBRT. To achieve these Aims, we will conduct a multisite prospective observational study of 450 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC ?5 cm in size who are high risk for lobectomy and thus, being consider for limited resection or SBRT. Management of these patients (including treatment decisions) will be conducted according to routine care. Participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline (pre-treatment) evaluation to collect data about patient and lung cancer characteristics and will be followed at 7- and 30-days, 3- and 6-months, and 1-year of treatment to collect data on the surgical or SBRT regimen, AEs, lung function, and QOL. We will interview the treating physicians and review medical records to obtain information about the treatment plan, complications, and cancer recurrence. Survival will be assessed at the end of the study via a National Death Index search. We will use propensity scores and instrumental variable analysis to compare outcomes of patients treated with limited resection vs. SBRT while controlling for allocation bias. The study will rapidly provide practical information to guide treatment decisions and will inform policy recommendations regarding the use of these potentially life-saving therapies."
"9262152","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Telomeres are evolutionarily conserved protein-DNA complexes at the physical ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. The initial length of the repetitive telomeric DNA set at birth shortens with age in most human cells, thus serving as a marker of proliferation history and pre-determining cellular lifespan. Mutations in telomere maintenance genes lead to premature aging and a number of age-related disorders. Mean telomere length in humans shows considerable inter-individual variation and appears to be under strong genetic control, but the exact nature of factors establishing telomere length set point remains elusive. Here we propose to identify and characterize genetic factors establishing telomere length set point in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In our preliminary results, we show that, similar to humans and yeast, natural Arabidopsis populations display significant variation in telomere length set point, and we identify a major effect telomere length QTL on chromosome 5. The main approach of this proposal takes advantage of the major recent technical breakthroughs in Arabidopsis QTL mapping using genetically advanced Recombinant Inbred MAGIC Lines to discover genetic factors establishing population-specific telomere length set point. Aim 1 takes advantage of the remarkable genetic diversity of natural Arabidopsis populations and the easy assays for precise monitoring of telomere length. We will continue measuring telomere length in the MAGIC population and fine-map one major and several minor QTL using a combination of candidate gene approach and population- wide comparative sequence and expression analysis. In Aim 2, we will utilize multiple genetic assays, such as knock-out and transgenic rescue experiments, to functionally characterize candidate genes and validate their role in telomere biology. Our results will lead to better understanding of genetic differences underlying telomere length polymorphism in natural Arabidopsis populations, and may also provide important insights into the molecular basis for different rates of aging among humans and predisposition to aging-associated diseases."
"9268447","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses a doctoral research training program that focuses on uncovering neurocognitive mechanisms of self-management in heart failure (HF) patients. A plan of coursework, seminars, and a research study are presented. The research training environment at Case Western Reserve University provides a rich set of resources for this training, including a new P30 Center of Excellence in Self-Management Research focused on uncovering the brain-behavior mechanisms of self-management of health, a neuroscience lab, and faculty with strong programs of research in heart failure self-management.  Heart failure patients must self-manage their chronic disease to prevent exacerbations and hospitalizations. Influencing factors of self-management have been identified and include anxiety, depression, cognitive status, comorbidities, physical activity, and sleep quality. On the whole, interventions that target these factors have been unsuccessful. A promising cognitive mechanism underlying successful self-management may be interoceptive awareness, which is the ability to consciously sense stimuli in the body and is related to taking action. If interoceptive awareness is related to self-management, interventions targeted to increase interoceptive awareness can be tested. Therefore, the purpose of study is to test the following aims: Aim 1: Determine if there is an association between interoceptive awareness and self-management maintenance (adherence to sodium restriction, medication, and weight monitoring) and symptom management.  Aim 2: Assess the potential moderating effects of influencing factors (anxiety, depression, cognitive status, comorbidities, physical function, and sleep quality) on the relationship between interoceptive awareness and self-management maintenance (adherence to sodium restriction, medication, and weight monitoring) and symptom management.  Using a descriptive cross-sectional study design, a sample of 109 HF patients will be recruited from a prior study. To ensure adequate variance in self-management outcomes in this sample, we will evaluate the 24 hour urine sodium levels (an objective indicator of sodium intake) of participants from the prior study. Measures of interoceptive awareness will be obtained and its relationship to self-management assessed. The project will be completed with support from the student's interdisciplinary mentorship team. Dr. Dolansky has advanced knowledge and experience in heart failure self-management and Dr. Hughes has expertise in cognitive factors in heart failure."
"9250736","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of mortality, accounting for ~5 million deaths per year and up to 15% of healthcare expenditures worldwide. Chronic pain exacts a similarly high toll on individuals and society. In the U.S., chronic pain affects ~116 million persons and generates $635 billion in costs yearly. The interplay between chronic pain and smoking has been evident for decades - it appears that a positive feedback loop exists in which individuals smoke to relieve their pain, smoking exacerbates the pain, and individuals smoke more in response. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship will provide insights into new behavioral or pharmacological therapeutic interventions. Little is known about CNS mechanisms that may contribute to the adverse relationship between smoking and chronic pain. We recently determined that activation of ?4?2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) by microinjection of the prototypic agonist epibatidine in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a critical brainstem relay for bulbospinal pain modulation, produces antinociception. However, the efficacy of epibatidine is greatly diminished under conditions of persistent inflammatory pain produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the hind paw. The mechanistic reason for this decrease is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanistic intersection of smoking (nicotine use) and chronic pain. Having established that persistent inflammatory nociception decreases the antinociceptive efficacy of epibatidine in the RVM, SA 1 tests the mirror hypothesis that chronic exposure of the RVM to an ?4?2 AChR agonist enhances the heat hyperalgesia induced by CFA. SA 2 tests the hypothesis that persistent inflammatory nociception decreases the number or affinity of ?4?2 AChRs in the RVM, determines whether this decrease is transcriptional or translational in nature, and confirms that intra-RVM infusion o epibatidine produces the expected upregulation of ?4?2 AChRs. SA 3 determines whether persistent inflammatory nociception decreases the presynaptic or postsynaptic actions of epibatidine in specific populations of spinally-projecting RVM neurons. This proposal is innovative in that it 1) examines the intersection of smoking and chronic pain at a mechanistic level, and 2) focuses on the role of bulbospinal pain modulatory pathways as a contributing mechanism. The hypotheses and methods address my desire to develop as a pharmacologist and neuroscientist, and will provide me multidisciplinary training in cutting-edge methods and quantitative approaches ranging from system to cellular levels. My professional development will be further augmented by the training environment provided by the University of Iowa Pain Research Program. I will gain valuable feedback through weekly interactions with broadly-trained investigators, as well as presentation of my work to the local and larger scientific communities and to my thesis committee, which includes 3 physician-scientists. As a whole, this proposal outlines the investigation of a critical clinically-based question conducted in an outstanding environment and will facilitate my future success as a physician-scientist."
"9271967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic manipulations at the DNA level and RNA interference (RNAi) have been the mainstream tools for functional studies of proteins. However, inducible protein knockout has a number of advantages over these traditional approaches, including the potential to induce fast and reversible response by the ligand, tunability (dosage-dependent quantitative depletion), depletion of the target protein from a specific cellular pool only, and depletion of a specifically-modified form of the target protein. However, a general inducible protein knockout system that can deplete specific endogenous protein(s) remains to be developed. Most recently, we have defined the first molecular mechanism for allosteric activation of E3 ubiquitin ligases. RNF146 is an intrinsically inactive E3 in the absent of a ligan, and becomes robustly activated in the presence of its ligand (iso-ADPr, a structural unit of poly (ADP-ribose)). With well-defined molecular mechanism and structural basis for this allosteric switch, we aim to use RNF146/iso-ADPr as the template to develop an inducible, tunable protein knockout system. The bottle neck for this development is to design cell-permeable iso-ADPr orthologue(s) and engineer the RNF146 protein accordingly, so that the engineered protein responds to the orthologue compound but not to the endogenous iso-ADPr moiety in PAR polymers. In this project, we will overcome this bottleneck and validate the desired binding and activation specificities for our co-engineered orthogonal protein/ligand pairs, using the depletion of endogenous ?-catenin, a central effector of Wnt signaling, as a model system. Development and optimization of a general inducible protein knockout system will not only provide a powerful tool for biological research, but may also have profound implications in medicine."
"9262278","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last 10 years, the lysosome-mediated degradation pathway macroautophagy has gained prominence in the field of adult onset neurodegeneration. Macroautophagy is an essential cellular pathway responsible for the elimination of cytosolic proteins, lipids and organelles. It is the most conserved of the three forms of autophagy, and its importance in mammals can be seen in a wide array of processes from the earliest stages of development to the maintenance of the aging brain. Although neurons were among the earliest cell types to be examined for macroautophagy, subsequent biochemical and genetic studies in liver and yeast caused the interest in neuronal macroautophagy to wane. Nonetheless, as the importance of macroautophagy in neurodegenerative diseases continues to grow, it is clear that we must refocus our attention on neural macroautophagy if we are truly to understand how this essential pathway impacts the adult brain. In this proposal, we will examine two key questions that will define how fundamental macroautophagic events are relevant in the healthy and diseased adult brain. In Aim 1, we will define how membrane cholesterol impacts macroautophagy, and how disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis may lead to dysfunctional autophagy in the mammalian brain. Then in Aim 2, we will determine if aggregation-prone proteins are indeed eliminated by macroautophagy in the adult brain, and establish the minimal components essential for this process. By answering these questions, we will not only further our mechanistic understanding of key macroautophagic processes, but we will also understand them in a context that will further our understanding of how macroautophagy can impact neurodegenerative disease."
"9265710","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a rigorous training program that will enable the applicant to become an independent nurse scientist with a sustainable trajectory of research. The program will provide a solid foundation of research experience under the mentorship of established scientists in research-intensive academic and clinical environments. The broader long-term objective of this program is to enable the applicant to advance the science of biobehavioral factors that contribute to cognitive function following breast cancer chemotherapy in a direction of theoretically based translational research. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to identify modifiable psychosocial (stress, social isolation) and behavioral (physical inactivity, sleep disturbance) factors that may contribute to cognitive function (memory, attention, processing speed, executive function performance) both directly and indirectly, by examining biological (inflammatory markers [IL-6, TNF-?]) factors in breast cancer survivors (BCS) ages 21 to 65 one to five years after chemotherapy. The specific aims are (1) to assess the impact of the aforementioned psychosocial and behavioral factors on inflammatory markers after controlling for individual factors; (2) to assess the impact of inflammatory markers on cognitive function after controlling for individual factors; and (3) to explore direct and indirect (through inflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF-?) effects of psychosocial and behavioral factors on cognitive function after controlling for selected individual  factors. This study will be a nonexperimental, cross-sectional analysis of a sample of 80 women ages 21 to 65 who have a history of non-inflammatory, non-metastatic breast cancer (stages I-III) who have received chemotherapy, and who have been in remission for one to five years. The study will take place in a community setting (the greater Austin metropolitan area). Participants will be recruited through the applicant's relationships with Texas Oncology, the Breast Cancer Resource Center, and the Central Texas Oncology Nursing Society. Data collection will include both unmodifiable and modifiable factors: demographic and treatment-related factors; self-report measures of stress, social isolation, physical inactivity, and sleep disturbance; an objective measure of BMI; neuropsychological assessment of memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function; and biological measures of IL-6 and TNF-?. Each participant will complete questionnaires (containing self-report measures and demographic and treatment-related factors), undergo anthropometric and neuropsychological assessments, and provide blood samples, once. Data analysis will consist of hierarchical regression methods to assess psychosocial and behavioral contributions to cognitive function, as well as mediation analyses to explore the indirect effects of modifiable factors on cognitive function by examining inflammatory mediators. The proposed study is aligned with the mission and research priorities of the National Institute of Nursing Research-specifically, to delineate causative mechanisms underlying symptoms and to advance science through the integration of the biological and behavioral sciences."
"9307130","Project Summary/Abstract  With every breath, the lung is exposed to an array of environmental agents, which must be discriminated as harmful or harmless by the local mononuclear phagocytes (MPs). Dendritic cells (DC) in the lung, part of the MP system, are key to this recognition and to the initiation of immune responses to foreign antigens. However, our current knowledge of the types, functions and locations of DCs in the human lung is extremely limited, and based largely on analogies with more detailed studies in mice. A direct understanding of human DC signaling is a critical step in developing human immune-based therapeutics.  In this grant, we propose a detailed functional characterization of human pulmonary DCs. We hypothesize that we will be able to identify two clearly differentiated types of DCs (called here hDC1 and hDC2) playing separate functional roles. Based on mouse models developed in our lab and others', we expect hDC1 and hDC2 populations to have functional characteristics associated with antiviral and antifungal immunity, respectively, though hDCs may also be quite different from mouse DCs in function. More specifically, we will test the hypotheses that hDC1 selectively phagocytose dying cells, express and are activated through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), cross-present cell-associated antigen, and promote the induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. By contrast, hDC2 are expected to be incapable of ingesting apoptotic cells, will express different TLRs (e.g. TLR7) and C-type lectins such as Mincle and Dectin1, and will predominantly present soluble and particulate exogenous antigen to CD4+ T cells.  Aim 1 is to investigate the selective acquisition of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) by human pulmonary DCs. The physiological importance of knowing the efferocytic DC (i.e. cross-presenting DC) has been clearly outlined for viral immunity, intracellular pathogens, and cancer. In Aim 2 we examine gene and protein expression by the proposed human pulmonary DCs, including pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and responses to their ligation. Since antigen-bearing DCs need to be directly stimulated by their cognate PRR to drive the differentiation of effector T cells, characterizing the PRRs, specifically TLRs, expressed by human pulmonary DCs will provide key information for successful activation of target pulmonary DCs in induction of adaptive immune responses. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the two candidate human lung DCs differ in their ability to present exogenous antigens, resulting in the differential induction of CD4 and CD8 T cells. The net outcome of these studies will be a detailed functional analysis of the human pulmonary migratory DC populations ? as complete as can be achieved without true in vivo studies, but making optimal use of non-diseased human lungs, along with their attached draining lymph nodes. These studies will heighten our understanding of the human pulmonary immune system and enhance our ability to develop targeted immune therapies for multiple diseases such as lung cancer and COPD."
"9198733","?     DESCRIPTION:      The purpose of this CDA-1 proposal is to provide Dr. Melissa Papesh with the support and mentorship necessary to make the transition from basic science research to clinical research of central auditory system dysfunction in Veterans. Specifically, her present proposal investigates the influence of exposure to high- intensity blast waves on the neural filtering of auditory information and the potential for blast-related neural dysfunction to contribute to difficulty understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. This proposal will provide Dr. Papesh with the tools and experience necessary to engage in clinical research and generate data which will be used in applying for future funding such as the CDA-2. The career plan is made up of coursework, publication and presentation of results, shadowing in mental health, and mentoring from Drs. Frederick Gallun, Curtis Billings, Robert Folmer, Marjorie Leek, and Bret Fuller.  Blast-related injuries are the signature injuries of recent military conflicts, with estimates of up to 850,000 Veterans having suffered exposure to high-intensity blasts since 2002. A significant percentage of these Veterans suffer long term consequences affecting both sensory and cognitive function. Within the auditory domain, blast-exposed Veterans often report increased difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, difficulty following long conversations, and decreased tolerance to environmental sound. Such complaints are common even when auditory thresholds are found to be normal, thus indicating a central source of dysfunction. Cognitive complaints of blast-exposed Veterans frequently include increased distractibility, poor selective and sustained attention, and poor memory and recall. Blast-related cognitive and sensory complaints may arise from a common source of neural dysfunction. The present research proposal investigates the hypothesis that blast exposure damages portions of the brain involved in the pre-attentive filtering of sensory information for relevant content. This process o filtering sensory information, also known as sensory gating, normally functions to protect higher cortical centers of the brain from being bombarded by irrelevant or redundant sensory information. This hypothesis is supported by numerous lines of evidence including the similarity between symptoms expressed by blast-exposed Veterans and those of populations known to have sensory gating impairments, data from clinical and animal studies indicating that blast exposure is likely to impact centers of the brain involved in sensory gating, and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies indicating that the brains of blast-exposed Veterans show a reduced ability to encode novel stimuli compared to neurologically normal participants. If sensory gating is impaired following blast exposure, this is likely to lead to difficulty with speeh understanding in noise due to an inability to devote neural resources to processing the speech stream of interest while filtering out irrelevant background noise.  The present proposal investigates the extent to which blast exposure impairs sensory gating processes by using established auditory EEG protocols to assess sensory gating in blast-exposed Veterans and in a control group consisting of age- and hearing-matched previously-deployed Veterans with PTSD severity similar to the last-exposed Veteran group. This carefully matched control group will help to control for common comorbidities in the Veteran population which may otherwise confound test results. It is hypothesized that blast-exposed Veterans will display reduced ability to encode novel auditory information as well as increased neural representation of redundant and irrelevant auditory information compared to control participants. In addition, the relationship  between speech-in-noise (SIN) understanding and sensory gating capacity will be investigated by comparing EEG measures of sensory gating with behavioral measures of SIN performance. A positive correlation between sensory gating capacity and SIN understanding is hypothesized such that those with poor sensory gating will also display poor performance on tests of speech understanding in noise."
"9428953","PROJECT SUMMARY We seek to establish an interdisciplinary training program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) focused on Infectious Diseases in the Immunocompromised Host. The purpose of the program is to train physician-scientists and post-doctoral PhD scientists to perform basic, translational and clinical research in the biology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in high-risk immunocompromised patients. Novel drugs and biological agents to treat autoimmune diseases, advances in transplantation techniques and cancer treatments as well as increased survival of these patients have resulted in a significant growth in the population of patients with immunosuppression in the United States. Infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality for immunocompromised hosts, and with millions at risk or affected by emerging and established pathogens, there is increasing demand for research training in this field. The Infectious Disease Sciences Program of the Fred Hutch has partnered with the University of Washington in training 50 Infectious Disease fellows and postdoctoral scientists in laboratory or translational research in the area of Infectious Diseases in the immunocompromised host over the last 25 years. We have an excellent track record of transitioning trainees to full career independence at the conclusion of their training with more than 80% of our trainees now working in academia, government research or industry leadership positions. There is a clear need to both expand our training program and solidify funding for trainees in this specialized area of Infectious Diseases. We are requesting funding to support two qualified trainees (MDs and/or PhDs) per year, for two years of training for each of the trainees. This funding will be utilized for training in one of 4 research tracks that represent the unique strengths of our immunocompromised host program and its mentors: 1) Epidemiology, Pathogen Dynamics, and Clinical Trials; 2) Immunology/Immunogenetics; 3) Microbiome and Pathogenesis; and 4) Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology. These tracks provide training in unique aspects of this field and will assure that trainees develop expertise in epidemiology, diagnosis, management and host-pathogen interactions. All trainees will participate in a rigorous core curriculum consisting of courses, lectures, retreats, research, and targeted career development activities; trainees also have the opportunity to complete a Masters in Public Health degree at the University of Washington. The proposed training program will help to address the national need for researchers that focus their clinical and/or laboratory investigation on Infectious Diseases in the Immunocompromised Host, and will provide those trainees with the skills and expertise to successfully transition into independent research careers."
"9412709","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure of cells or tissues to environmental stressors during critical periods of development can permanently reprogram normal physiological responses to increase susceptibility to disease later in life, a process termed developmental reprogramming. Developmental reprogramming is thought to occur via disruption of the epigenome, and is now appreciated to increase risk in adulthood for metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We were the first to identify non-genomic (or more accurately pre-genomic) signaling as a direct mechanism for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to disrupt the epigenetic machinery and induce developmental reprogramming. Activation of kinases in pre-genomic signaling pathways that phosphorylate readers, writers and erasers is extremely attractive as a central mechanism for environmental stressors to engage the cell's epigenetic machinery. However, tremendous knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of how the epigenomic machinery is disrupted by pre-genomic signaling during developmental reprogramming. We do not know:  1) Which kinases/pre-genomic signaling pathways beyond PI3K/AKT are activated by obesogens in the liver (or other tissues); 2) Which epigenomic programmers are targeted by these kinases or how phosphorylation (or other PTMs) modifies their activity (up or down); nor 3) Which specific epigenetic marks placed on reprogrammed genes are altered to change gene expression and increase susceptibility to obesity (or other diseases) in adulthood. The goal of this application i to fill these knowledge gaps with a detailed mechanistic understanding of how EDCs utilize pre-genomic signaling to disrupt the epigenome, and to better understand how this developmental reprogramming alters metabolic set-points in the liver to promote obesity."
"9289696","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this R01 proposal is to develop high-performance antimicrobial fluoride-releasing dental materials (composite and dentin bonding agent). Secondary (recurrent) caries and bulk fracture are the leading causes of failure of composite restorations and thus limit their service life. Much effort has been directed towards the development of dental materials that can inhibit bacterial biofilms and reduce secondary caries. However, the composites containing soluble anticariogenic agents or (nano)particles of ACP or CaF2 usually have poor mechanical properties. The antibacterial materials containing silver nanoparticles usually have unacceptable dark shade. In our previous funding period (R01DE019203), we synthesized several novel F-releasing methacrylate monomers and antibacterial monomer containing long-chain quaternary ammonium salts (QAS). We developed a series of novel antibacterial fluoride-releasing materials (dental composites, bonding agents and sealants). They have shown enhanced fluoride-releasing and recharge capabilities, promising antibacterial effect, and good mechanical properties or bonding strength. However, the amount of antibacterial monomers that could be incorporated in these materials was rather limited (~3%) thus limiting its antibacterial activity. To overcome this limitation, we synthesized several new antibacterial monomers bearing different chain lengths and we discovered that a small amount (1-1.5%) of a short-chain QAS monomer, when used together with other long-chain QAS, could significantly increase antibacterial effect. Additionally, it could improve the mechanical properties of the composite. We have also developed new translucent silica-zirconia- yttria ceramic nanofibers and  white gallium (hydrous)oxide-loaded mesoporous silica nanopartilces (Ga@MSN). Gallium (III) ions and compounds are safe antimicrobial agents but they have not been used in resin-based dental materials. We hypothesize: (1) the synergistic combination of antibacterial monomers containing varying chain lengths (enhanced contact-killing) and gallium (hydrous)oxide nanoparticles (pH- responsive controlled release of Ga ions) can significantly increase the antibacterial and biofilm-inhibitory effects; and (2) the new antimicrobial fluoride-releasing dental material system will possess significant anti- caries efficacy, excellent mechanical properties, desirable aesthetics, and a long service life. In this proposed project, we will further develop novel high-performance antimicrobial fluoride-releasing dental materials with three aims: In Aim 1, we will formulate and optimize a series of high-performance antimicrobial fluoride- releasing dental materials (composite and  dentin bonding agent) by blending the fluoride-releasing monomer and new antibacterial monomers, Ga@MSN, translucent ceramic nanofibers and halloysite nanotubes, fluoride-releasing glass particles, and photoinitiators. We will test and optimize the physical and mechanical properties, bonding strength, cytotoxicity and biocompatibility.. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the novel antimicrobial F-releasing dental materials will significantly reduce cariogenic bacterial biofilms and secondary caries using an in vitro biofilm-artificial caries model on extracted teeth. In Aim 3, in collaboration with Dr. Hyun Koo at University of Pennsylvania, we will test the hypothesis that the novel antimicrobial F- releasing dental materials will significantly reduce secondary caries using in vivo animal (rat) caries models. Our long-term goal is to develop a new generation of dental materials that have a high efficacy to inhibit oral biofilm formation as well as excellent mechanical properties. The novel dental materials developed in this project will have significantly longer service life and will be excellent candidates for clinical trials of high caries-risk patients."
"9254562","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal proposal for the currently funded one-year R01 grant (EY019466). Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is defined as a long-term enhancement of visual task performance as a result of visual experience, is regarded as a manifestation of visual and brain plasticity and is seen as a promising tool with which to improve vision that has been degraded due to visual disorders. Over the one-year funding period, we have made significant progress in clarifying specificity of VPL.  However, we have yet to address an important question: How can the visual system be sufficiently plastic to adapt to environmental changes, but stable enough to protect existing visual information from being replaced with new information? Our long-term goal is to resolve this dilemma in VPL. Developmental studies of vision have resolved the dilemma by setting a window (critical period) during which the visual system is highly plastic in one's early life. This inspires us to investigae the mechanisms of plasticity periods in VPL with adults. We have found two plasticity periods in VPL. The short-term plasticity period may begin during each visual training session and last less than one hour after the end of the session. The long-term plasticity period may last for at least several days, during which a reorganization of visual processing gradually occurs until performance levels for the trained task saturates. Thus, we need to examine the mechanisms of these two periods separately.  In Aim 1, we will conduct systematic psychophysical investigations to better understand the two plasticity periods in VPL. We have found that 3-hour monocular deprivation (MD) enhances plasticity of monocular processing possibly by abolishing inter-ocular inhibition, whereas reward priming enhances plasticity of binocular processing in a descending way. We will examine how 3-hour MD and reward priming influence the plasticity and stabilization of these two plasticity periods.  In Aim 2, we will examine roles of excitatory and inhibitory processing in the two plasticity periods. The start and end of a visual critical period are associated with changes in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory signals (E/I ratio). We will address the question of whether and how the two plasticity periods in VPL with adults also relate to E/I ratio changes by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Strong preliminary results have led us to the perspective that the results from Aims 1 and 2 will be consistently and constructively integrated so that functional and neural mechanisms of the two plasticity periods will be better clarified. The results would also be used to develop effective interventions for visual disorders. Although VPL is likely to be associated with changes both within and beyond the visual areas, as our initial approach we will focus on examining visual areas in this proposal."
"9268047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance of proposed research: Untreated hypertension and renal injury are risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease, yet early markers of progressive disease have not been identified and therapies to prevent the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes have not been defined. Circadian blood pressure, as defined by 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, is more accurate than clinic blood pressure in defining secondary hypertension and abnormal nocturnal blood pressured dipping has been linked to progressive renal disease in other diseases.         Methodology/Aims: A randomized feasibility trial of losartan will be conducted among 40 adolescent HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (11-19 years) with abnormal nocturnal blood pressure dipping. During this six month feasibility trial, two dosing strategies of losartan (titraed to keep BP <95th percentile vs. <75th percentile) will be analyzed for safety and effect on restoring normal circadian blood pressure. A prospective cohort study among HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (6-19 years) will also be conducted to evaluate the incidence of hypertension and role of monitoring potential biomarkers of kidney injury and hypertension. Cohort participants will undergo annual evaluations of hypertension and markers of kidney injury (24 hour blood pressure monitoring for participants = 11yrs; Blood: uric acid; Urine: Cystatin-c, Kim-1, NGAL, B2M). Expected Results: At the completion of the feasibility trial, vital background information will be obtained to design a definitive multicenter trial of hypertension in sickle cel disease. At the completion of the cohort study, the incidence of pediatric hypertension will be identified and the role for monitoring blood and urine biomarkers will be better understood.         As therapy for patients with renal failure is dismal, it is imperative that SCD patients at risk ar identified early and that therapeutic trials are conducted that prevent progression."

"9252430","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents;1-3 nearly half will have initiated use before high school graduation.17 Even recreational use is associated with negative behavioral, social and cognitive outcomes.2,8 Leading health organizations recommend screening and intervention for marijuana use during primary care visits11-14 and the majority of adolescents report wanting to discuss substance use with their provider.16 However, substance use screening in clinical visits is inconsistent;16 this gap has been attributed to physician discomfort, lack of training, uncertainty over management of positive screens limited time, or lack of reimbursement.22-24 NIDA has recognized the need for effective brief interventions for illicit drug use, including marijuana,9, 4 and the US Preventive Service Task Force has called for research to identify strategies for adolescent drug screening and tailored interventions.15 This study will address these needs by developing a marijuana screening and brief counseling intervention and testing it for use with adolescent users in pediatric primary care settings. The intervention is based on the Public Health Service 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) model,21,22 which has demonstrated success with adult tobacco smokers36 and has been adapted for other health behaviors.47-55 We are currently testing an adolescent adaptation of the 5As tobacco intervention in a NCI-funded national trial (R01 CA140576). Our specific aims are to (1) Develop a marijuana screening and brief counseling intervention for adolescents based on the 5As and (2) Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the 5As marijuana intervention in pediatric primary care practice. We will pilot the marijuana screening/brief counseling intervention for feasibility and acceptability in a sample of [10] practices from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) practice-based research network. Intervention content will be drawn from content experts, current literature and themes gathered from focus groups and in-depth interviews with clinicians, adolescents and parents. The control arm of this study will use a comparable-burden intervention focused on social media use; adapted from our ongoing R01. Up to [80] clinicians, 100 parents and [1020] adolescents will participate in the three phases of this study. We will conduct follow-up interviews with a sample of adolescent marijuana users and non-users [enrolled at intervention sites] to assess physician-delivery of the intervention and any change in use, attitude or behavioral intentions towards marijuana since their clinical visit. Findings will inform the development of a future large-scale trial of adolescent marijuana use, screening and cessation counseling in pediatric primary care. Our long-term goal is to improve clinical preventive services for adolescent marijuana cessation. Conducting this work within the AAP PROS network will lead to rapid dissemination of effective interventions."
"9269017","PROJECT SUMMARY: At present, Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than 4 million people worldwide, with numbers expected to nearly double by 2030. PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and there are no disease-modifying therapies. Currently, the diagnosis of PD relies almost entirely on clinical examination, with no laboratory-based confirmatory testing available. While clinical accuracy is reasonably high in longitudinally followed patients with moderate symptoms, it is much lower in earlier stages of PD. As a consequence, both for clinical care and to accelerate the development of much-needed therapeutics, a confirmatory diagnostic biomarker would be of great utility. To meet this need, we previously used a novel aptamer-based technical platform to measure nearly 1000 proteins from the plasma of 64 Parkinson's disease and 30 normal control individuals recruited at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). We identified candidate biomarkers differentiating the two groups, then narrowed these candidates by stability selection to an eight-protein panel. This eight-protein panel classified an independent test set of 32 PD and 15 control subjects from UPenn with 91% accuracy. Furthermore, these same eight proteins differentiated PD individuals from a cohort of 25 AD individuals with >90% accuracy as well. Together, our preliminary findings suggest that a blood test based on just eight plasma proteins has the potential to serve as a confirmatory diagnostic test for PD. While our preliminary work already contains a replication (as we have employed a training/test set design to avoid over-fitting of data), we seek further replication in national or international cohorts of patients recruited outside of our university. This will allow us to understand the generalizability of our findings and pave the way for clinical development of a blood test to confirm PD diagnosis. To do this, we propose three specific aims:  (1) To evaluate the robustness of candidate proteins nominated in UPenn subjects  through the Somalogic platform. We will do this through (a) the analysis of 38  quality control samples using the aptamer-based array, (b) the analysis of  duplicate aliquots of 30-50 samples previously investigated on the Somalogic  panel, using a mass spectrometry-based approach to quantitative proteomics.  (2) To repeat the aptamer-based screen on 319 samples from the Parkinson's  Disease Biomarker Program biorepository, representing PD as well as controls,  with both PD and controls originating from two clinical sites. Using our existing  data, as well as the PDBP data, we will determine whether our 8-marker panel  can reproducibly identify PD samples.  (3) To test a small panel of proteins that pass quality control in Aim 1 and are  replicated in Aim 2, using alternative, low-cost assays, in 450 samples from PPMI."
"9287534","Project Summary/Abstract  Defining the brain mechanisms that mediate multidimensional representation of emotion states, such as fear, is an important problem in neuroscience with high relevance to human health, including psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. The study of fear in animal models has been dominated by the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, and a focus on the amygdala. However there is a need to extend the study of fear circuitry to extra-amygdala systems, as well as to paradigms for innate fear where emotion states can be studied without the additional complexities introduced by learning. There is also a need to expand the study of such circuits from a focus on single nuclei to meso-scale connectivity and function. The medial hypothalamic defensive circuit mediates innate defensive responses to predators. Recent data have identified neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) expressing the transcription factor SF1 as necessary and sufficient for defensive behavioral and autonomic responses to a predator. However little is known about the precise role of these neurons, and their targets, in representing threatening stimuli, and transforming this representation into emotion states and defensive responses. To fill this gap, we are using state-of-the-art tools for recording, imaging and perturbing neural activity in this system, using SF1+ neurons as a point-of-entry. Our broad, long-term objective is to understand how emotional stimuli are represented and transformed into internal states and behavioral responses. The central objective of this proposal is to determine how VMHdm/c SF1+ neurons, and associated circuitry, represent multi-modal threatening stimuli, and generate defensive responses. The rationale for this research is that the study of evolutionarily ancient brain circuits that control conserved emotion states such as fear is likely to yield general principles of multidimensional emotional representation. To achieve our objective, we will characterize how SF1+ neurons represent multi-modal threatening sensory cues (Aim 1); determine the relationship of neuronal activity in VMHdm/c SF1+ neurons to observable responses to threatening stimuli (Aim 2); investigate meso-scale circuit interactions controlling defensive responses by recording simultaneously from multiple regions during exposure to threatening stimuli (Aim 3); and investigate the circuit-level mechanisms underlying experience-dependent influences on acute responses to threatening stimuli (Aim 4). The contribution will be to apply state-of-the-art genetically based tools to study the representation of multimodal threatening stimuli and their causal functions. This contribution is significant because it will advance our understanding of the micro- and meso-scale circuit dynamics underlying emotional representations and responses. The contribution is innovative, because it represents the first time that this circuitry has been studied using such multidimensional systems-level approaches. The work proposed in this application will therefore increase our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms of emotion representation, with potential relevance to understanding and treating human psychiatric disorders."

The program focuses on five substantive areas: a) biodemography, including indices and models of aging, vitality, and frailty, b) health disparities (by race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status) among the elderly; c) international comparative studies of the health of aging populations in both developed and developing countries; d) important life course transitions (e.g., family changes, work and retirement, morbidity and disability) that relate to the health and well-being of aging persons; and e) the economics of aging. These areas require a core of researchers with doctoral and postdoctoral training who are skilled in state-of-the-art analytic methods and population modeling. The training program is administered through the Duke Population Research Institute (DuPRI), an interdisciplinary research organization of Duke University, and the Department of Sociology. Established in 2006, DuPRI constitutes a reorganization and expansion of population studies at Duke and replaces the Center for Demographic Studies, which was historically associated with this training grant. Predoctoral training is carried on with the full collaboration of the graduate training programs of the Departments of Sociology, Economics, and Public Policy in which doctorates are awarded. The training takes place at DuPRI, the Departments, and the Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development. The facilities at all these sites are utilized by both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Eight predoctoral trainees with various background levels will be appointed in each year to conduct aging studies through the completion of their doctoral dissertations, normally four to five years for entering students with B.A. degrees. Trainees must fulfill all theory and methods requirements of a Ph.D. in sociology, economics, or public policy. In addition, all trainees must take required courses in the demography of aging and in demographic and statistical models and methods. At the postdoctoral level, two appointments of persons with a Ph.D. or equivalent degree will be made. These postdoctoral trainees typically will be recruited with varied levels of experience for two-year periods of training. They gain first-hand experience under direct supervision of preceptors on major ongoing research projects. They also are provided the opportunity of taking appropriate courses to obtain advanced training knowledge in needed methodological and substantive areas."
"9418960","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of heritable neuropsychiatric disorders whose symptoms, which include deficits in social interaction skills, impaired communication ability, and ritualistic-like repetitive behaviors, appear in early childhood and continue throughout life. In particular, repetitive, stereotyped and perseverative behaviors cause severe disruptions in the quality of life of ASD individuals and their families. Despite their clinical importance, the studies concerning these behaviors are relatively small in comparison with the investigations of other aspects of ASD symptomatology. Consequently, there is a significant need to understand the pathophysiology of these motor disturbances and the establishment of mechanism-based therapeutics to treat repetitive behaviors. The goal of this research proposal is to study how altered structural and synaptic plasticity in the striatum leads to repetitive, stereotyped and perseverative behaviors, and to identify new molecular targets to develop mechanism-based therapeutics to treat ASD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that exaggerated cap-dependent protein synthesis in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) causes altered plasticity resulting in repetitive, stereotyped, and perseverative behaviors. The novel eIF4E transgenic mouse (eIF4E Tg) model of ASD will be utilized to address three specific aims. Aim 1 will be performed during the mentored phase (K99) and is to determine whether eIF4E Tg mice display alterations in structural and synaptic plasticity in a specific subset of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs). The remaining two aims will be initiated during the mentored phase (K99) and will be completed during the independent phase (R00). Aim 2 is to determine whether increased expression of eIF4E restricted to a specific subset of striatal MSNs is necessary and sufficient to generated ASD-like motor behavior. Aim 3 is to determine the identity of proteins whose synthesis is altered in a specific subset of striatal MSNs in the eIF4E transgenic mice. Lack of understanding of ASD pathogenesis hampers our search for new mechanism-based targets. This proposal will provide insight into how abnormal striatal synaptic physiology contributes to ASD etiology and molecular targets for the design of novel therapeutics for ASD."
"9327347","Project Summary:  Developing neurons must assemble synapses of the proper size and strength to establish a functional nervous system. Disruption of synaptic growth mechanisms can result in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. While there is some understanding of the genetic aberrations that cause the development of these disorders, molecular targets for therapeutics that would ameliorate the effects of malformed synapses remain elusive. Preliminary evidence in Drosophila suggests that the MAP3K Wallenda (Wnd) is a driver of aberrant synaptic growth in larval models of neurodisorders. Previous work has shown that as a MAP3K, Wnd activates downstream MAP2Ks and MAPKs in a canonical kinase cascade to positively regulate synaptic growth. The preliminary data demonstrate that numerous upstream effector molecules are required to restrain flux through the Wnd cascade at baseline; if this level of regulation is lost, excess Wnd has the capacity to cause significant growth defects at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This proposal will employ classical genetic epistasis studies, biochemical techniques, and powerful CRIPSR- Cas9 genome engineering to test the hypothesis that hyperactive Wnd signaling drives malformed synapses in larval genetic models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Further, this project will define novel upstream molecules and mechanisms that typically restrain signaling through the Wnd pathway, thus preventing synaptic deficits in a normal nervous system. Finally, as Wnd has an evolutionarily conserved homolog in mammals called Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK), this application will explore if DLK is required for the synaptic deficits observed in mouse models of these disorders as well. This proposal aims to demonstrate that Wnd/DLK is a novel protein implicated in the dysfunctional synaptic development associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. This work has tremendous translational potential as it may provide evidence that DLK is an excellent candidate for a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of pathologies associated with human developmental disorders."
"9221852","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC); globally, it is the third most common cancer. Colorectal cancer rates are rising in LMICs. Outcomes of patients with CRC are poor in LMICs, largely because patients have advanced disease. Colorectal cancer screening lowers mortality by identifying precancerous polyps (which can be removed) and diagnosing cancer at an early stage. In high-income countries (HIC), screening modalities include stool-based tests and endoscopies. Due to cost, high incidence of benign rectal bleeding, limited access, and lack of point of care (POC) options, these tests are rarely used in LMICs. The large majority of patients at high-risk for CRC in LMIC do not undergo any CRC testing. Thus, there is an unmet need for a cost-effective CRC diagnostic to identify patients at higher risk for CRC and polyps, thereby minimizing the number of costly negative colonoscopies. We propose using the research network we have built in Nigeria to implement a unique urine-based POC metabolomics test that can be performed in centers in LMICs to diagnose patients with early-stage CRC and/or precancerous polyps. Our goal is to validate our sensitive, affordable handheld biosensor device. We have shown that our 14-metabolite urine test sensitivity is 82.3% for polyp diagnosis and 95% for CRC diagnosis. During the UG3 phase, using urine from 450 Nigerian patients (150 with CRC, 150 with polyps, and 150 with normal colons), we will refine our metabolite signature to 3 metabolites and modify the biosensor to make it highly sensitive for Nigerian patients. During the UH3 phase, we will pilot test the biosensor device in Nigeria with 75 patients with CRC, polyps, and normal colons. We will then use the POC in real-time on urine from 645 patients >40 years of age with rectal bleeding, with a family history of CRC, or with a personal diagnosis of CRC. All patients will then receive a colonoscopy. Microcosting will be conducted to inform a cost-effective analysis, based on World Health Organization thresholds for cost-effective or very cost-effective, of the POC testing for each study group at the current projected price. Finally, we will determine beliefs and barriers related to urine testing for CRC. Our team is comprised of experts in CRC screening and management in HICs and LMICs (Memorial Sloan Kettering [MSK], Obafemi Awolowo University [OAU], and University of Alberta [UA]). Memorial Sloan Kettering and OAU have collaborated on 2 prospective studies. We also have experts in metabolomics, engineering, development of biosensor POC tests, and manufacturing and marketing of medical devices (UA and Metabolomics Technologies, Inc.). To ensure the device is appropriate for the Nigerian health system and global CRC guidelines, we have created an advisory committee with cancer care, CRC screening, and medical device development experts. Our POC biosensor will reduce CRC mortality in LMICs, where there are currently no alternatives."
"9226899","Project Summary Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent disease that has become an increasingly recognized, potent cause of cardiovascular disease. Cumulatively, SBD is associated with ~3 fold increased odds of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, which can be reversed with effective treatment. The prevalence and severity of SDB are greatly amplified at high altitudes (>2500m above sea level), in which an estimated 150 million people live worldwide. In our research center located in Puno, Peru (3825m above sea level), we have documented an ~80% prevalence of SDB in a population-based community sample, indicating that highlanders are exposed to significant reductions in oxyhemoglobin saturation and recurrent apneic episodes during sleep. Nevertheless, SDB remains largely unrecognized and untreated in Peruvian highlanders, adding significantly to their overall burden of cardiovascular disease. The current proposal addresses this critical unmet need for an easily deployed SDB therapy in highland populations of low to middle income countries (LMIC). It is based on recent data from our highland cohort, which demonstrates that: (1) sleep greatly amplifies daytime hypoxemia and exposes subjects to recurrent apneic episodes, (2) oxygenation improves markedly when highlanders sleep on an incline rather than in the horizontal plane, and (3) SDB in highlanders is closely linked to markers of cardiometabolic stress. These findings lead us to hypothesize that a simple, readily deployed nocturnal postural maneuver will effectively treat SDB and reduce cardiometabolic stress in highlanders. To address this hypothesis, we will conduct a 12 week Phase II single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial in 60 highlanders to examine SDB treatment responses and adherence, and related cardiometabolic outcomes in Puno, Peru. Our primary hypothesis is that subjects who sleep on an incline compared to sleeping flat will demonstrate significant improvements in SDB including mean nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation and apnea-hypopnea index. Our secondary hypotheses are that (1) participants will adhere to the intervention, and that (2) postural therapy will decrease metabolic dysfunction (fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, lipids), cardiovascular stress (blood pressure, vascular reactivity), and markers of hypoxemia (hemoglobin, erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1). If successful, this study will demonstrate that postural therapy is well tolerated and reverses underlying nocturnal defects in ventilation and oxygenation in highlanders. It will inform the design of a pivotal phase III trial with estimates of sample sizes for clinically relevant cardiometabolic outcomes. It will also set the stage for head to head comparisons of postural therapy with conventional devices (e.g., non-invasive positive pressure ventilation), which are costly, cumbersome, poorly tolerated, and often ineffective in treating SDB at altitude. We can also envision scenarios in which similar benefits of postural therapy can be applied broadly to patients with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases who usually have SDB, regardless of altitude."
"9328816","Emerging evidence suggests that astrocytes are not passive support cells in the central nervous system, but rather play active roles in modulating neuronal activity through ionic buffering, metabolic support, and neurotransmitter uptake. Specifically, astrocytes show selective expression of a subset of neurotransmitter transporters, including GLT1 (glutamate transporter) and GAT3 (GABA transporter), which raises the possibility that astrocytes can influence neuronal activity by changing neurotransmitter uptake. Studies investigating astrocytic calcium transients have largely characterized responses using slice or in vitro preparations rather than in vivo; likewise studies into the role of neurotransmitter uptake have almost exclusively been conducted in slices in situ. Previous work has shown that large-scale astrocytic somal calcium transients can be elicited in vivo by diffuse release of neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine. Yet, it remains unclear how small calcium transients in the distal processes of astrocytes relate to neuronal activity and how astrocytes influence cortical sensory processing. Our lab has developed a novel visual stimulation paradigm using natural movies that reliably drives both neuronal activity and astrocytic process calcium transients in the mouse primary visual cortex. In Aim 1, I will correlate astrocytic process calcium transients and local neuronal calcium activity simultaneously using dual-calcium imaging in vivo. Using transgenic Cre lines to restrict neuronal calcium imaging to excitatory and inhibitory neuron subpopulations, I will be able to dissect how calcium activity in astrocytes relates to specific components of the cortical circuit. In Aim 2, I will use pharmacological and genetic manipulations of GLT1 to explore how astrocytic glutamate uptake contributes to excitatory synaptic activity during visual processing. In Aim 3, I will use pharmacological and genetic manipulations of GAT3 to determine how astrocytic GABA uptake contributes to inhibitory synapse activity during visual processing in the cortex. By exploring astrocytic calcium activity and neurotransmitter uptake during sensory processing in the mouse visual cortex, this work will increase our understanding of astrocytic roles in cortical processing and may provide insight into disorders characterized by imbalances of excitation and inhibition such as epilepsy and schizophrenia."
"8849377","A large and growing number of older adults experience progressive declines in physical function, culminating in age-related physical disability with no clear connection to a single disease. Although the etiology of age-related physical disability is complex and multi-factorial, emerging evidence implicates the mitochondria as playing a key role in the initial onset and progression of functional decline in many older adults. Additionally, our pilot data strongly suggest functional declines are associated with reductions in mitochondrial respiration, as well as decreases in oxidative mitochondrial enzyme activities and enzyme content. These changes were linked to a large decline in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1&#945;) and specific Sirtuins (i.e., SIRT3) in skeletal muscle, both of which are regulators of mitochondria biogenesis. The natural compound resveratrol appears to oppose the reductions in mitochondrial function associated with aging by affecting the expression of key genes, such as PGC-1&#945;, which support oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. In another recently completed pilot study, we found resveratrol, at a dose of 1000 mg/day, significantly enhanced resting muscle oxidative metabolism (measured using near infrared spectroscopy), as well as cognitive and physical function, in older adults (age > 65 years). Despite promising findings from one recent clinical trial involving obese, middle-age men, no study to date has examined the effects of resveratrol supplementation on mitochondrial function in older adults, or whether the hypothesized changes in mitochondrial function translate to improvements in physical functioning. Thus, the proposed randomized, parallel study will determine, in older men and women (> 70 years), whether 90 days of resveratrol supplementation is associated with (i) increases in muscle mitochondrial function (State 3 & 4 respiration), (ii) increases in levels of PGC-1&#945;, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Sirtuins (i.e. SIRT1 and SIRT3), and (iii) improvements in functional performance, as well as metabolic risk factors. To achieve these aims, 60 moderate to low functioning participants will be randomized to receive a placebo (n=20), 1000 mg/day of resveratrol (n=20), or 1500 mg/day of resveratrol (n=20) for a 90-day period. We will collect muscle specimens from the vastus lateralis and blood at baseline and 90 days for biochemical analyses, as well as monitor blood chemistries and adverse events at monthly clinic visits. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will be the first to show that resveratrol improves mitochondrial function in muscle, and that these changes are associated with increased levels of physical function in moderate to low functioning older adults ¿ the population who is at greatest risk of functional decline and physical disability."
"9252364","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, the American trypanosomiasis, is a chronic disabling parasitic disease caused by the flagellate protozoon Trypanosoma cruzi. It is considered a neglected tropical disease. With an estimated total of 100 million people at risk, about 8-10 million already infected, and about 40,000 new cases/year, Chagas disease represents a major health, social and economic problem in Latin America. The infection is naturally transmitted by triatomine vectors (kissing bugs), from the southern USA to the south of South America. However, chagasic patients are in fact dispersed worldwide due to migration from the endemic region to economically-developed countries. Therefore, Chagas disease is emerging in many non-endemic countries (Australia, Japan, Spain, etc). Infected people in Argentina are estimated at about 1,600,000 and in the USA at about 300,000-1,000,000.  Although crucial in its life cycle, T. cruzi is unable to synthesize sialic acids. The parasite scavenges it from the mammalian host glycoconjugates through an enzyme known as trans-sialidase. This enzyme is a shed virulence factor that induces alterations in the host immune system, favoring the parasite colonization process.  Our long-term aim is to fully clarify the relevance of this virulence factor to parasite biology, life cycle virulence and pathogenesis, and to understand the alterations induced on the immune system physiology. Understanding the manipulation of the immune response by pathogens allows a better fight against the infection and also helps to learn more about the immune system physiology, and eventually to transfer this knowledge to the therapeutic handling of other pathologies (autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, inflammatory responses, etc.).  This project proposes to disclose the relevance -to pathogenesis and parasite biology, at cellular and molecular levels- of the acquisition process of the sialyl residue performed by the trans-sialidase acceptor molecules on the parasite and lymphocyte surfaces. To achieve these goals we will a) use genetically-modified parasites transfected with modified transporters to accurately determine TS intracellular trafficking; b) follow the unnatural sugars approach as bioorthogonal chemical reporters to clearly identify acceptor molecules and their fate and function on parasite and white cell surfaces; c) search for the induced alterations of known immune responses using T-cell receptor transgenic and KO mice models; and d) test genetically-modified parasites to analyze the association of TS inactive isoforms with virulence factors and pathogenesis."
"9239388","ABSTRACT  Heart failure (HF) remains an enormous public health problem despite advances in treatment. Disease progression and response to therapy in HF varies widely between individuals, but breakthrough technologies such as genomics and metabolomics are helping to unravel the disease heterogeneity that confounds patient management. Perturbed energy metabolism may be a key contributor to cardiac dysfunction and the development of clinical HF. Evidence from a variety of sources indicates that impaired structure and function of the energetic apparatus in the myocardium contributes to disease severity, progression, and may influence response to treatment. However, in order to advance these observations toward meaningful interventions for HF patients, several key steps are still needed: 1) confirming the importance of metabolic variation in human HF, 2) developing noninvasive markers of myocardial energetic status, and 3) identifying promising targets for intervention. Our proposed project is a series of interwoven translational investigations in humans and dogs with HF to define the association of plasma metabolite levels with disease severity, myocardial energetics, and disease progression. This project leverages substantial infrastructure already in place a large existing genetic cohort study, available plasma samples suitable for metabolomic profiling, comprehensive translational laboratory capabilities, and a cohesive multidisciplinary research group focused on HF. Together the planned studies will address the overarching hypothesis that the peripheral metabolomic signature can indicate disease progression/treatment responsiveness in HF patients and that this is driven by altered myocardial energy metabolism. If true, then these data will help advance personalized therapy and identify novel targets for HF intervention, leading to improved outcomes for HF patients."
"9254217","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nutrition and infection are key determinants of child growth and survival. Chronic inflammation, which results in part from an increased lifetime burden of infectious disease, is an underlying determinant of adult cardiometabolic disease. The modifiability of this risk by improving nutrition in early life is unknown. Our principal objectiveis to determine whether improvements in early-life nutrition can attenuate the development of cardiometabolic risk. We will collect new data from the INCAP (Guatemala) Nutrition Supplementation Trial cohort. From 1969-77, 2392 children received atole, a high protein and calorie supplement, or fresco, a low calorie drink, for up to 8 y. Children who received atole in the first 3 y of life grew better in childhood and recovered more quickly from diarrheal illness episodes than did children who received fresco. We have followed this cohort prospectively. We propose to re-contact the surviving members of the cohort. The cohort will be 38-53 y old, an ideal age to assess cardiometabolic risk. We will conduct clinical examinations, including (for the first time in this cohort) collection of biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. We will assay the samples for established and novel biomarkers, including highly innovative metabolomic profiling. We will update and enhance the extensive life-course data that we collected in previous surveys. We will link the new data to our existing rich database to address critical questions regarding the long-term effects on cardiometabolic health of both chronic under-nutrition and an effective intervention to combat under-nutrition, in the context of a community-randomized trial that controls for otherwise intractable questions of endogeneity. The study will be unique in its ability to address unanswered questions relating to early life determinants of adult health. This prospectively-studied cohort has reached an age where the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk is non-negligible. The highly productive research team has extensive experience with survey work among this cohort, demonstrated capacity to link data across study waves, and extensive experience with the appropriate field methods, laboratory methods, and statistical approaches to data analysis. The resulting extensive repository of data and samples will enhance the value of the cohort for future research. Taken together, these elements ensure that the study will be well positioned to successfully address critical understudied questions in human health and development."
"9314727","Crohn?s disease (CD)  is chronic intestinal inflammatory disease that affects more than 700,000  individuals in the US and is becoming more common worldwide. The use of biologics such as anti-TNF  and anti-adhesion molecule medications has significantly improved the quality of life of CD  patients, however biologics tend to lose efficacy with time and have significant side effects. New  cell based therapies that utilize the immunosuppressive capacity of adult mesenchymal stem cells  (MSC) for immune mediated diseases like CD are currently in clinical trials. A cumulative body of  data, including our own work shows that locally injected MSC are a promising therapy for patients  with perianal fistulae refractory to anti-TNF?s. However, systemic MSC therapy for luminal CD has  lower efficacy, which may be due to myriad reasons with many inadequately investigated. All the  murine studies performed demonstrate the benefit of MSC therapy in mouse models that require  manipulation to develop inflammation and are focused on treating large intestinal inflammation.  Though, nearly two thirds of human CD patients have small intestinal involvement. Thus, there is a  critical need to study MSC therapy in disease relevant and preclinical murine models of CD. In this  study, we propose to study the SAMP-1/YitFc (SAMP) mouse for treatment with human MSC (hMSC).The  SAMP strain is a unique model that spontaneously develops CD-like small intestinal (SI)  inflammation which has impressive similarities to the human disease. My strong preliminary data has  shown that SAMP mice with established SI inflammation treated with one dose of bone marrow derived  human MSC (hMSC) had significantly lower inflammation and had mucosal healing. Therefore, our  hypothesis is that hMSC treat SI inflammation in SAMP mice by a mechanism involving the modulation  of transcriptome of host tissue to an anti-inflammatory and tissue regeneration pathway. I will  test this hypothesis in 2 specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will use the SAMP mice, our new SAMP  medical recurrence model, novel techniques including 3D stereomicroscopy (for mucosal healing) to  test the subhypothesis that hMSC can treat, prevent SI inflammation and determine the optimal route  of hMSC administration. In addition, using a novel hMSC optimized for immunosuppression, we will  determine if we can enhance the treatment efficacy of MSC therapy. In aim 2, using human and mouse  MSCs transduced with triple reporter, state-of-the-art imaging techniques, laser capture  microdissection, single cell RNA sequencing of host cells and MSCs we will investigate the  mechanism(s) of healing in SAMP after treatment with MSC. Our preclinical experimental design that  tests 1) treatment of established disease, 2) maintenance of remission, 3) the optimal route of MSC  administration, 4) use of enhanced immunosuppressive hMSC 5) hMSC effect on mucosal healing, and 6)  comparative biology approach to understand the mechanism (s) of healing has high relevance for  human IBD. The data generated from this grant will lead to a more mechanistic approach to human  clinical trials for treating CD patients and may identify novel molecules that promote tissue  regeneration and healing that will form the basis for mechanistic R01s in the future. Thus, we have  generated a proposal that builds upon our preliminary findings by generating new scientific ideas  that have relevance not only to CD, but potentially to other immune mediated diseases where MSCs  are currently in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials."
"9278413","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Auditory interhemispheric communication remains a neurobiological mystery. Processing of auditory signals at cortical level requires coordination of sensory input between the two hemispheres. Abnormal circuitry underlying interhemispheric communication may explain deficits in communication and social behavior observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), one of the most prominent symptoms in schizophrenia, affecting approximately 70% of patients. However, the organization and functionality of these circuits remain unclear. The inferior colliculus (IC) is a major processing center in the auditory pathways. Particularly, IC is a major center for processing of information used in localizing sound sources in space. Importantly, a subset of neurons, in the layer 5 of the auditory cortex (AC), project to the IC (CCol neurons) and to the contralateral AC (CCort neurons). Callosal projections to layer 5 cells originate in layer 2/3 and layer 5 of AC. Determining the functional effects and connectivity of layer 2/3 and layer 5 callosal projections onto these neurons is critical for understanding auditory processing at both cortical and subcortical levels. The objective of this proposal is to dissect if both layers have a similar effect on the contralateral cortex. In particular, both layers could excite CCol and inhibit CCort neurons. Alternatively, layer-specific stimulation could have differing effects on layer 5 neurons, and a different balance of input to CCol and CCort neurons contributing to different responses of these neurons. Our findings will establish a new framework for understanding the roles of layer 2/3 and layer 5 callosal projections in the modulation of cortical and subcortical auditory processing required for the continuity of sensory input between the two hemispheres. The aims of this proposal are (1) Determine the synaptic organization of layer 2/3 and layer 5 callosal projections onto CCort and CCol neurons in AC. (2) Establish the synaptic mechanism of callosal disynaptic inhibition onto CCort and CCol neurons in AC. (3) Determine tone-evoked responses in AC during optogenetic stimulation of layer 2/3 and layer 5 callosal projections. The approach for addressing these aims will use the mouse as the experimental model, retrograde and optogenetic labeling, specific opto-physiological recordings of synaptic connectivity in defined pathways, and in vivo electrophysiology to quantify the excitatory and inhibitory component of the interlaminar, intralaminar, and the subclass projection specificity of the neurons recruited during photoactivation of the callosal projections. Discoveries from this work will be significant because they will provide foundational knowledge regarding circuit and functional aspects of AC neurons contributing to interhemispheric communication which is clinically relevant to cortical neuropathologies."
"9288929","Abstract: The ultimate success or failure of implantable materials is invariably a function of the local host tissue response to the materials and the associated remodeling process at each anatomical site. The interaction of the immune system with implantable materials has historically been considered to be a negative occurrence associated with tissue degradation, implant encapsulation, and/or failure. Recently, the role of the innate immune system, particularly that of macrophages, in the response to implantable materials has received renewed attention. It has now been shown that macrophages, depending upon plastic and context-dependent polarization profiles (e.g. M1 pro-inflammatory vs. M2 anti-inflammatory), are also capable of affecting improved tissue integration and performance following implantation. This emerging understanding of the constructive, regulatory, and essential role of macrophages represents a departure from classical paradigms of host-implant interactions. Indeed, it now appears desirable that biomaterial-based approaches to tissue reconstruction should both accommodate and promote involvement of the immune system to facilitate positive outcomes. However, the ability to promote such activity is predicated upon an in-depth, context-dependent understanding of the host response to biomaterials. The proposed work seeks to define the host response to biomaterials in the context of aging. Despite the increasing usage of implantable medical devices in aged patients, the impacts of aging upon the host response have never been investigated. Immunosenescence, dysregulation of macrophage function and polarization, and delayed resolution of acute immune responses in aged individuals have all been demonstrated. This would suggest that the host response to biomaterials in aged individuals should differ significantly from that in younger individuals. However, studies examining the effects of aging upon the host response to biomaterials and the implications of this response for long-term integration and function in aging individuals have never been performed. Thus, there is a clear need to elucidate the impacts of aging upon the host response in order to develop implantable materials which address the needs of an increasingly aged population. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to define the effects of aging upon the host response to implantable materials, to explore the mechanisms by which aging alters the host response, and to develop methods that manipulate the host response to improve remodeling outcomes in aged individuals."
"9300324","PROJECT SUMMARY Challenges exist in recruiting and retaining minorities in research on Alzheimer?s disease (AD), thereby limiting the ability to elucidate mechanisms for health disparities in AD risk and to adequately measure treatment efficacy in underserved populations. African Americans represent an especially important group to target for research due to their two-fold risk of AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Advances in technology to evaluate cognitive functioning, particularly the use of mobile applications such as smartphones, offer the promise for overcoming barriers that may limit African American research participation including scheduling difficulties, associated study costs, and examinee/examiner cultural mismatches. Remotely administered neuropsychological measures can be performed at an individual?s convenience, and outcomes can be collected at multiple time points. In the proposed R03 study, we will leverage the resources and volunteers who have signed up for a new community initiative at our institution, the Emory Healthy Aging Study, involving remote engagement of individuals through smartphone technology. The Co-PIs have selected tasks from the cognitive neuroscience literature that are non-proprietary and have strong behavioral and neuroimaging correlates in APOE-?4 carriers, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD patients, and healthy aging groups. The proposed grant will pilot these measures when administered via smartphones to middle-aged and older African Americans and Caucasians, with the overall goal of determining whether group differences exist that could have diagnostic relevance in future studies. Sixty African American and 60 non-Hispanic Caucasian adults 45-75 years of age will complete the traditional versions and the smartphone adaptations of the cognitive measures in the clinic setting and will then complete the smartphone applications remotely at 3 and 6 months post-baseline assessment. Specific Aims are to 1) Establish reliability of the smartphone applications (both internal consistency and in comparison to the traditional version (inter-modality reliability)) 2) Establish test- retest reliability of the smartphone measures; and 3) Assess adherence rates of the remotely administered smartphone measures. A secondary Aim is to examine factors (i.e., quality of education, socioeconomic status, and vascular comorbidities) that we expect to be correlated with performance on cognitive measures administered via smartphones and that are underlying factors often associated with cognitive performance differences between African Americans and Caucasians. The long-term goal of a future study is to validate these mobile cognitive measures against neuroimaging, genetic, and CSF biomarkers of central amyloidosis."
"9249664","Excess airway fibrosis is among the most significant sequelae of long-term asthma. Airways in patients with chronic asthma are often remodeled, becoming thickened and less elastic, resulting in reduced airflow despite increased respiratory effort. The remodeling airway contains cytokine producing immune cells, particularly eosinophils (EOS) and activated fibroblasts (Fb) that generate pathologic amounts of profibrotic mediators and extracellular matrix (ECM), Fb ECM production is driven by excess levels of profibrotic cytokines, especially TGF-(31 that are principally elaborated by activated EOS, Despite its importance in key physiologic processes such as wound healing and tissue homeostasis, the signaling cascades elicited in Fb or EOS by TGF-(31 remain incompletely understood, and have yet to be effectively targeted for therapeutics to block or attenuate airway remodeling. We hypothesize that Pin1 modulates TGF-pi signaling by interacting with and isomerizing proximal Smads (3 and 6) as well as Pl-S-Ky and Akt, We further hypothesize that ablation of Pin1 in pulmonary Fb or peripheral blood EOS will attenuate airway remodeling in allergen challenged rodents. In order to test these hypotheses, we propose to: Aim 1: Identify how Pint influences Smad6 function. We have shown that Pin1 binds to and controls the intracellular location of Smad6, We will first identify and then mutate Smad6 sites that mediate an interaction with Pin1. Mutant Smad6 proteins will be expressed in Fb and EOS and the functional consequences on Smad6, Smad3, Pin1 function and location and TGF-(31 induced gene expression will be determined. Aim 2: Determine how Pin1 and PI-3-Ky affects Smad3 function and signaling. TGF-pi induces Pin1 to bind to both PI-3-KY and Akt, Furthermore, inhibitors of PI-3-K or Pin1 prevented Smad3 translocation and ECM production, suggesting a common pathway. Thus, we will define how Akt function and interaction with Smad3 are controlled by Pin1 and PI-3-K in both murine and human Fb and human EOS. Aim 3: To test the effects of tissue and cell selective Pin1 KO on airway remodeling, EOS inflammation, cytokine expression, Fb proliferation and ECM production following acute and chronic allergen challenge. In aggregate, these studies will characterize how Pin1 regulates TGF-pi signaling and ECM production."
"9248333","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV, respectively, are the two most prevalent chronic viral infections. Among the 1.2 million people living with HIV, 25-30% are HCV/HIV coinfected, but HCV prevalence is highest (80.8%) among HIV+ people who inject drugs (PWIDs). Currently, most PWIDs are excluded from HCV treatment despite national guidelines recommending otherwise. With the availability of more tolerable and better HCV treatments, however, a Treatment as Prevention (TasP) approach could drastically tip the balance towards increased and potentially targeted HCV treatment approaches. Though eradicating HCV will require a strategic combination of prevention AND treatment, HCV treatment costs may become staggering and require strategic targeting of PWIDs - the only ones who can transmit virus. Treating PWIDs most effectively, however, requires a better understanding of injecting networks and understanding such structures may help guide informed treatment strategies. With the expectation that HCV treatment will be markedly easier by early 2015, it is timely to examine the influence of injection-network structures and model treatment strategies for HCV TasP in the U.S. that have the highest likelihood of success while doing so without excessive costs. The specific aims are to: 1) simulate injection networks using a measurement-calibrated network model of injection partnerships based on secondary data recently completed from a large, U.S. respondent-driven sample (RDS) of PWIDs; and 2) develop a HCV dynamic transmission model that incorporates injection network structures and agent-based simulations to achieve two goals to: a) analyze the effect of injection network structure on HCV incidence and prevalence; and b) evaluate the effectiveness of various HCV TasP strategies within US PWID injection networks. We will first develop an injection network model that we will calibrate using secondary data from the US PWID network. Calibration will involve fitting several graph models to the real injection network data, extracting a set of parameters that describe the network properties, and using the parameters to generate synthetic networks that are statistically similar to the original injection partnerships observed i US PWIDs. We will then simulate a dynamic HCV transmission model using a combination of the selected network model and agent-based micro-interactions. Last, we will evaluate the effectiveness of 4 potential TasP strategies on chronic HCV prevalence and incidence over 10 years. Findings should help guide future HCV TasP strategies focusing on active PWIDs who are now excluded from treatment by most HCV clinical experts and help to allocate scarce resources more effectively and produce better treatment and prevention outcomes. This research is significant and innovative in that it focuses on the two most prevalent and costly chronic viral infections. It comes at a time of rapid advances in HCV treatment and improves upon existing HCV transmission modeling strategies. It also provides guidance for how HCV TasP strategies should (or could) be deployed. Last, it takes advantage of a comprehensive injection network of PWIDs in the U.S. to inform domestic models and brings together researchers in the fields of mathematical modeling, networks analysis and HCV clinical care management."
"9252375","The discovery of antibiotics nearly 80 years ago was a major milestone in the battle against infectious  disease, yet bacterial infections continue to be a significant cause of death worldwide. In fact, management  of many bacterial infections is becoming progressively more difficult due to the emergence of new and  rapidly evolving pathogens with increased virulence, resistance to antibiotics, a greater ability to evade host  responses, and heightened transmissibility. To reverse this trend, a systematic understanding of the complex  dynamics between the pathogen and host is needed at every level of interaction, including those between  cells, individuals, microbial communities, and populations.  We will develop and implement an integrated experimental framework that provides systematic and  complementary insights into bacterial infections encompassing single cells, animal models, and human  patients, to investigate cellular genomics, transcriptional networks, and host microecologies. Three of the  most deadly and costly bacterial pathogens will be used as examples to develop this framework and probe  the host-pathogen interaction. Specifically, we will dissect the interaction between Mycobacterium  tuberculosis and its host at the single cell level to gain a deep and highly resolved characterization of the  host cellular states that contribute to susceptibility to infection. We will follow the dynamics of  uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection in animals and humans to gain insights into the role of  UPEC, the host and the host microbiome in the persistence of recurrent urinary tract infections. We will track  the movement and evolution of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as they emerge in  patient populations contributing critical details about how CRE and the resistance elements that they carry  are transmitted among patients and patient populations.  There are two goals of this work. One is to develop an adaptable framework of multi-omic approaches to be  applied to a wide-range of pathogens for the dissection of bacterial infection at the single cell, infected  individual and clinical population levels. The second is to capitalize on the output from this framework to  identify points"
"9212291","PROJECT ABSTRACT The OVERALL OBJECTIVES of this proposal are to define the lipotoxic mechanisms linking hepatocyte injury with hepatic inflammation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most common pediatric liver disease. NASH is characterized by elevated levels of circulating saturated free fatty acids (SFA)s, hepatocyte lipotoxicity and macrophage-mediated liver inflammation. Hepatocyte lipotoxicity and liver injury are, in part, induced by SFAs and their intracellular metabolite lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking hepatocyte lipotoxicity to macrophage-associated liver inflammation are undefined. Emerging data implicate extracellular vesicles (EV)s released during hepatocyte lipotoxic stress as important mediators of cell-to-cell communication. In published and preliminary experiments, we have discovered that, in hepatocytes incubated with lipotoxic mediators: i) the stress kinase mixed lineage kinase (MLK)3 promotes the induction of C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10) by a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1-dependent mechanism; ii) MLK3-dependent c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation promotes the release of CXCL10-enriched EVs; and iii) CXCL10-enriched EVs activate macrophage chemotaxis. Based on these novel observations, we have formulated the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS of the proposal that during hepatocyte lipotoxicity, activated MLK3 mediates the release of chemotactic EVs, therby promoting macrophage-associated liver inflammation by inducing CXCL10 expression and stimulating CXCL10 sorting and release into newly formed EVs. We propose to employ current and complementary, molecular, biochemical and cell biological approaches to test this hypothesis. Our following independent SPECIFIC AIMS will test three integrated hypotheses. FIRST, we will directly test the hypothesis that MLK3 activation during hepatocyte lipotoxicity promotes CXCL10 induction i) by a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) relay module resulting in STAT1 phosphorylation, and ii) by a direct STAT1-dependent transcriptional activation of CXCL10. SECOND, we will test the hypothesis that during hepatocyte lipotoxicity, MLK3 induces CXCL10 release into EVs i) by JNK-facilitated sorting of CXCL10 into EVs, and ii) by JNK-dependent formation, transport and release of a specific EV subpopulation from hepatocytes.Third, using an animal model of NASH, we will test the hypothesis that i) liver inflammation is attenuated in mice that lack CXCL10 or its receptor CXCR3, and ii) MLK3 pharmacological inhibition is protective against liver injury. We have established the requisite cell and animal models to study lipotoxicity, MLK3 and CXCL10 signaling and EV biology. This proposal is technically and conceptually innovative, as it seeks to integrate the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocyte injury with liver inflammation, and links hepatic pathophysiology with nanomedicine. This research will advance our understanding of the signaling pathway linking MLK3 activation to liver inflammation, and has the potential to identify new therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse liver injury in human NASH."
"9254593","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pathologic changes in the small airways represent the key element in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as they precede the development of emphysema and contribute to progressive irreversible airflow obstruction, the hallmark of COPD. However, specific molecular mechanisms and cellular origin of COPD-associated small airway disorder in humans remain largely unknown. Based on the knowledge from murine studies that signaling via fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 in distal airway epithelial progenitors is critical for the establishment of distal lung epithelial architecture and branching morphogenesis during lung development, and our preliminary evidence that FGFR2 pathway is down-regulated in the small airway epithelium (SAE) of smokers and smokers with COPD in association with suppression of the key molecular features of the distal lung phenotype, and that FGFR2 is expressed in basal cells (BC), the stem/progenitor cells of the airway epithelium, where it is suppressed by smoking and smoking-associated epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, the central hypothesis of this project is that smoking-dependent suppression of FGFR2 signaling in SAE BC stem/progenitor cells of COPD smokers renders these cells less potent in generating normally differentiated SAE and less capable of maintaining small airway integrity via SAE repair and regeneration. Capitalized on our recently developed methodology to isolate BC from the human SAE and characterize stem/progenitor functions of these cells in vitro, the goal of this project is to test this central hypothesis by addressing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. T evaluate the hypothesis that BC from the SAE of COPD smokers have reduced capacity to generate normally differentiated SAE and regenerate SAE after injury but, instead, produce an altered SAE phenotype similar to that present in the SAE of COPD smokers in vivo. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that FGFR2 signaling is important for human SAE BC function relevant to differentiation and maintenance of the adult human SAE and that suppression of SAE BC FGFR2 by smoking-related factors will result in an altered SAE BC phenotype similar to that exhibited by SAE BC of COPD smokers as defined in Aim 1. Aim 3. To assess the hypothesis that normalization of FGFR2 signaling in SAE BC of COPD smokers by lentiviral vector-mediated FGFR2 overexpression, application of FGFR2-activating signals and suppression of smoking-induced EGF and TGF-beta pathways will restore the capacity of these cells to generate and maintain normally differentiated SAE. If proven correct, restoration of FGFR2 signaling in SAE BC of COPD smokers could be a novel therapeutic approach to prevent progression of COPD-associated small airway disorder at the earliest stages."

"9412624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to become an independent cancer epidemiologist using molecular approaches, including molecular pathology, to understand cancer etiology in the population overall and between different racial and ethnic populations. Toward my career goal, the objective of this application is to gain training and develop expertise in molecular pathological epidemiology, with focus on the laboratory methods, advanced statistical methods, and tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer etiology. Obesity, in particular, central adiposity may play an important role in breast cancer risk among African-American (AA) women, and this association may differ be- tween tumor subtypes; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. The phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase/Akt/mammalian target of the rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway, which is important in regulation of cell growth and proliferation, can be activated by obesity, and aberrant activation of this pathway has been implicated in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and basal-like breast cancers, commonly seen in breast cancers of AA women. To better understand the role of the mTOR pathway in the association between obesity and breast cancer subtypes, we will conduct a molecular pathological epidemiology study leveraging tumor tissue and data from 1,400 AA and 422 European-American (EA) women with breast cancer in the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS). We aim to examine differences in mTOR pathway activities between ER+ and ER- breast tumors and intrinsic subtypes among AA women (Aim 1), to assess the association of mTOR pathway activities with obesity among AA women (Aim 2), and compare these associations between AA and EA women. The expectation of this research is to provide a better understanding of which key components of obesity (general obesity, central adiposity, body composition, and weight gain) are associated with mTOR pathway activities and whether the associations are more frequently observed for specific breast cancer subtypes. The results of this project will serve as a stepping stone to developing a highly competitive R01 project in a large consortium of AA women. This project is well tailored for me to apply the knowledge and skills that will be obtained from training activities and my mentors: 1) molecular pathological epidemiology and breast cancer pathology (Dr. Thaer Khoury, Co-Mentor); 2) advanced statistical methods (Dr. Song Liu, Co-Mentor); and 3) breast cancer etiology with emphasis on body size and race (Dr. Christine Ambrosone, Primary Mentor, and Dr. Elisa Bandera, Co-Mentor). The training activities include molecular pathological and statistical courses, a six-month rotation in pathology laboratories and regular office-based rotations with Dr. Khoury, regular attendance and presentations at institute and at international meetings, continue publication in breast cancer sub- types and R03 and R01 grant writing, and participation in molecular pathological epidemiological research pro- jects. Roswell Park Cancer Institute and the University at Buffalo, SUNY, both provide an outstanding environment for me to achieve my career goal."
"9274804","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Shared Instrumentation Grant supports the acquisition of the Xstrahl SARRP, a small-animal focal x-ray irradiator with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for precision preclinical x-irradiation. State-of-the-art imaging and dose delivery capabilities of SARRP will enable investigators across UCSF to undertake research in diverse areas spanning from normal tissue biology to cancer therapeutics. Biomedical research into the effects of radiation exposure requires the ability to deliver ionizing radiation in a precise and conformal manner. The SARRP replicates image-guided external beam radiotherapy commonly employed to treat human cancer patients. Modern clinical x-ray radiotherapy (XRT) selectively targets the tumor while sparing surrounding normal tissue. This is achieved by coupling patient positioning using CBCT with delivery of collimated x-ray beams at multiple angles. Robust experimental models employing radiation benefit from volumetric dose calculations (volumetric dosimetry) and reproducible animal positioning systems. The SARRP incorporates these capabilities into a single platform. This proposal describes numerous research plans that will benefit from the acquisition of the SARRP, including from the three major users?Trever Bivona, MD, PhD; Jean Nakamura, MD; and William Weiss, MD, PhD ? as well as multiple additional UCSF investigators who will be major or minor users. Projects to be supported are diverse and include: (1) molecular mechanisms altering neuronal function that cause cognitive deficits after XRT; (2) effects of XRT on salivary gland regeneration in HNSCC models; (3) various combinatorial therapies with targeted XRT for glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, HNSCC, prostate, lung, and skin cancer; (4) subsequent malignant neoplasm following XRT; (5) XRT- induced metastasis and resistance to XRT; (6) biomarkers of therapeutic response to XRT; (7) synergy between thermal ultrasound therapy and XRT; and (8) lesioning brain regions of songbird involved in song learning and control in order to gain general insights into sensorimotor and vocal learning relevant to human speech acquisition. The SARRP will be housed within the Laboratory Animal Research Center barrier facility on the fifth floor of the Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building. Principal Investigator Bruce Faddegon, PhD will be responsible for technological oversight of the equipment, ensuring correct set up and running and, together with Young Ho Seo, PhD and Jean Nakamura, MD, will assist in training users and trouble-shooting. Access to and utilization of the SARRP will be managed by the NCI- supported Preclinical Therapeutics Core (PTC) facility, which undertakes small animal preclinical therapeutic studies for UCSF scientists and affiliates (such as UC Berkeley and the Gladstone Institutes) on a fee-for-service basis. The SARRP would add to a growing list of imaging and therapeutic options available through the PTC, which has management systems in place to accommodate this acquisition."
"9248878","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this new R21 grant are to determine a) how a novel Chlamydia-specific transcription factor designated GrgA controls chlamydial growth by regulating gene expression, and b) whether GrgA is a target for benzylidene acylhydrazides, which have been recognized as novel antichlamydials. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a unique developmental cycle. It is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen. Sexually transmitted chlamydial infection often leads to infertility, abortion, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease. Transcription not only controls chlamydial growth and pathogenicity, but also represents an effective therapeutic target for chlamydial infections. We have identified a highly novel transcription factor that we call GrgA. Encoded by chlamydiae only, GrgA activates transcription in vitro from promoters that require the primary or housekeeping ? factor (a subunit of the RNAP polymerase) designated ?66 by interacting with the non-conserved region of the ? factor. Further evidence support the hypothesis that GrgA plays a critical role in the regulation of chlamydial growth, and is potentially a target for antichlamydials with therapeutic and prophylactic potentials. We propose two Specific Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will identify the regulon of GrgA, and determine how alterations in the GrgA activity affect the transcriptome expression, and growth and developmental properties in Chlamydia. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of GrgA in chlamydial growth inhibition by benzylidene acylhydrazides, a new group of antichlamydials with undetectable toxicity to host cells and beneficial lactobacilli that dominate the vaginal microbiome of healthy, reproductive-age women. We anticipate three significant outcomes from this study: a) this research will yield insights into transcription regulation in chlamydia; b) we may confirm that GrgA is a target of benzylidene acylhydrazides; and c) with an elucidation of the drug targeting mechanism, benzylidene acylhydrazides could prove valuable as chemical probes for studying chlamydial biology."
"9314882","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exacts a steep toll on the well being of civilians and veterans alike. Alternatives to standard treatment are urgently needed. Typical PTSD therapy, e.g. long-term treatment with a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) coupled with psychotherapy, does help a significant number of patients, but it fails to treat the majority of PTSD sufferers. Recently, patients with treatment-resistant PTSD have achieved dramatic and durable remission of their symptoms with a surprising treatment, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. The recreational drug MDMA, also known as ?ecstasy?, had been used as an aid to treat anxiety and PTSD prior to its illegalization in 1985. Recently approved clinical trials demonstrate that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is safe and effective for PTSD. MDMA enhances feelings of trust, emotional openness and empathy, helping PTSD patients overcome obstacles to therapy, such as extreme anger, emotional numbing and overwhelming anxiety. This project aims to define the biology and the neurophysiology that create the prosocial effect of MDMA. By defining the mechanism for MDMA's prosocial, therapeutic effect we can begin creating new treatments that harness the same underlying biological processes. Improving the quality of social interaction has implications for many disorders where sociability is impaired, from autism to major depression. Remarkably, patients in preliminary clinical trials have experienced years-long remission of PTSD after a single dose of MDMA in the context of psychotherapy. Further, MDMA's therapeutic onset can be measured in minutes and hours rather than the weeks and months typical of SSRIs. MDMA's rapid onset and lasting therapeutic effect suggest that it is a powerful catalyst for behavioral recovery by means of therapeutic synaptic plasticity; an acute change in behavior reflects plasticity at the level of neural circuits, neurons, and synapses. This well-defined time window dramatically simplifies the search for an underlying neural mechanism of its prosocial effect. If we can measure MDMA's most salient therapeutic aspects on this short time scale, we can design experiments that explicitly test the requirements for its mechanism, using tools ideally suited to acute measurement and intervention. Recent studies of social reward and interaction in mice implicate serotonin and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain area centrally involved in reward and social interaction. This project will systematically evaluate the role of each of these elements in MDMA's mechanism using behavioral pharmacology, brain region-specific drug injection, optogenetics, and imaging of neurons' activity during behavior. Finally this study will carry out a detailed examination of how MDMA produces both short- and long- term effects on synapses in the NAc."
"9306266","Symptomatic meniscal tear with knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, disabling and costly problem. Recent trials have shown that physical therapy (PT) -- including therapist-supervised exercises, manual therapy and a home exercise program -- leads to similar levels of pain relief as surgical management in patients with symptomatic meniscal tear and OA. As a result, referral for PT is recommended as the treatment of choice for these patients. However, a PT regimen has never been compared with placebo or simple prescription of home exercise in this population. Therefore, several important questions remain unanswered: How much of the pain relief associated with PT-based regimens can be attributed to physiologic effects vs. attention placebo effects? Is therapist-directed exercise coupled with a home exercise program any more efficacious than a home exercise program alone? Can the efficacy of the home program be optimized by employing innovative methods to maximize exercise adherence? These questions led us to propose the TeMPO (Treatment of Meniscal Problems in Osteoarthritis) Trial. The long term objective of this research is to define the most effective and cost effective nonoperative regimen for managing symptomatic meniscal tear with OA. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To conduct a multicenter, parallel, four-arm RCT in subjects ?40 years old with symptomatic meniscal tear and radiographic or pre-radiographic OA to establish the efficacy of components of the typical PT regimen. The four arms include:  Arm 1: Prescription of an information-based (pamphlet, DVD) home exercise program  Arm 2: The information-based home exercise program with adherence optimization  Arm 3: Same as Arm 2 plus a clinic-based, therapist-directed sham PT intervention  Arm 4: Same as Arm 2 plus clinic-based, therapist-directed exercise and manual therapy The primary outcome is change in pain from baseline to 3 months. Subjects will be followed for 12 months. Aim 2: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a home exercise regimen with adherence optimization and a therapist-directed exercise and manual therapy program coupled with an optimized home exercise regimen. The results of the proposed trial and cost-effectiveness analysis will help clinicians, patients and policymakers make evidence-based decisions about management of symptomatic meniscal tear in the presence of OA, one of the most frequent musculoskeletal conditions seen in general practice. "
"9258518","Research focused on child and adolescent health lags behind that conducted with adults, due in part to the difficulty of recruiting investigators into the field. The goal of this Multidisciplinary Training Program in Child and Adolescent Health is to address the need for well-trained pediatric researchers by attracting talented trainees, equipping them with the tools to succeed and retaining their commitment to child health research. We believe Northwestern University (NU) and the NU Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS) are uniquely poised to innovatively address these challenges. We propose two approaches, a post-doctoral training program for clinical and basic scientists and a Summer Immersion Program (SIP) to attract underrepresented minorities to child and adolescent health research careers. In the postdoctoral program, we will apply our established expertise in recruiting and training young scientists and clinicians in translational science focused on child health. Each year, two pediatricians and two engineers (or similar PhD scientists) will be selected for a two-year training program, with a total of eight trainees in the program at one time. A rigorous selection process will examine the likelihood that the proposed training will lead to a career in which scientific approaches and clinical insight will be combined to advance child and adolescent health. The program plan is innovative and includes robust mentoring teams for each trainee. Primary mentors will be supported, as appropriate, by additional mentors with expertise in complementary scientific approaches; in Research Design, Analysis and Methods (RAMP); and in Community Stakeholder involvement. The trainees will undergo a unique orientation and individual development planning process to help them effectively utilize the breadth of resources and opportunities available to them. Core training elements will include a course in fundamentals of child-health research and a peer-mentoring program that has been highly successful at NU. Team science and mentoring workshops will be provided by national experts, to support mentors and mentees in navigating their roles on the mentoring team. Specific programming will address retention of women in child and adolescent health research. In the second approach, the SIP program will encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in child health research. Each year, four highly-qualified Masters' students at Chicago State University will be selected to spend 10 weeks with TL1 mentors, complemented by ongoing interaction with SIP leadership before, during and after the program. This TL1 program is based on our successful track record at NU of training engineers and clinician-scientists in translational research, and benefits from unique strengths at NU that include top-tier clinical resources in Lurie Children's Hospital and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, strong and accelerating research programs at NU's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and Feinberg School of Medicine, and NUCATS."

"9317877","Project Summary/Abstract  The proposed research focuses on how H. pylori, along with gastric acidity, is able to injure the gastric mucosa and trigger development of advanced disease. H. pylori infection is highly prevalent worldwide and at a minimum causes gastric inflammation. Some of those infected will progress to develop gastric or duodenal ulcer disease, gastric atrophy, and cancer. Treatment is becoming more difficult with emerging antibiotic resistance. It is not definitively known how the bacteria are able to evade the immune system, leading to lifelong infection, or what factors contribute to development of advanced disease, although multiple bacterial and host factors have been studied. The objective of this research is to develop a new model system for co- culture of H. pylori with gastric cells, then to use this model to study the effect of H. pylori on a specific cell adhesion protein, the Na,K-ATPase and to study the movement of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through the epithelial barrier. Preliminary findings suggest that the presence of H. pylori leads to downregulation of the Na,K-ATPase, which would lead to weakening of connections between cells. H. pylori appears to specifically interfere with interactions between the transporter subunits and endoplasmic reticulum chaperones. This result will be confirmed, mechanism investigated, and the effect on barrier function determined. The ?1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, involved with connections between cells, and the ?1 subunit, which connects with the cytoskeleton, will be overexpressed in gastric epithelial cells to determine if changes in barrier function indcued by H. pylori can be overcome. The possibility that post-translational modifications to the Na,K-ATPase or associated proteins are involved in the mechanism of downregulation will be investigated by specialized quantitative mass spectometry techniques. LPS is a component of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria, including H. pylori. The presence of LPS facilitates chronic infection and may interfere with barrier function. The movement of LPS through the epithelial barrier will be studied as a means of understanding gastric injury and possibly distal consequences of infection. The goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms of gastric injury and advanced disease associated with H. pylori infection, which will lead to discovery of better treatment targets and gastric protective measures."

"9264036","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression is essential to many aspects of nervous system development, function and plasticity. Among several classes of gene regulatory factors, non-coding RNAs have emerged as a rich potential source of regulatory mechanism in the central nervous system. In particular, microRNAs (miRs) provide sequence-specific control over target mRNA translation and stability that can tune the levels of downstream proteins quite precisely thus improving the stability and robustness of molecular networks. However, comprehensive analysis of miR function within the intact nervous system has been very challenging, leaving open key questions such as: How complex is the miR regulatory landscape for neural circuits that mediate essential behaviors? Are these miRs acting mainly during neural development or are they reused to manage ongoing neural circuit activity and adaptation to stimuli? To what extent are miR mechanisms utilized in many parts of the brain, or do they regulate distinct sets of target genes in different cell types and/or developmental stages? In order to address these questions, we have assembled a team of accomplished investigators prepared to work in unison using multiple robust behavioral and cellular assays as part of an integrated program. Our team includes Drs. David Van Vactor (Harvard Medical School), Leslie Griffith (Brandeis University), Ronald Davis (Scripps Institute), and Dennis Wall (Stanford University), who will each assume responsibility for key components of this joint program. We will use Drosophila as a model organism that offers many sophisticated genetic tools complementary to the innovative tools we will develop. Drosophila has proven to be particularly effective for identification and dissection of cellular and molecular  mechanisms underlying well conserved behaviors. This model is also accessible to a full range of techniques for determining the detailed cellular and physiological phenotypes of mutants in specific pathways, thus offering a system ideal for mapping out miR functions on a comprehensive scale followed by mechanistic dissection that will effectively leverage a wealth of tools and knowledge. Together, we will (i) build and apply new genetic tools, (ii) apply these tools to identify miRs required in multiple neural circuits, (iii) discover the mechanisms and regulatory strategies for miR function in each context, and then (iv) compare each model to distinguish general and specific strategies and examine their conservation. This will be the first analysis of its kind in the nervous system. Our preliminary findings already identify convergence between different circuits that will prioritize our detailed studies of several miRs: miR-13, miR-92, miR-190 and let-7. Preliminary analysis of miR-92 already points to a series of highly conserved downstream genes implicated in both neural circuit development and synaptic plasticity from insects to mammals, providing a set of specific mechanistic hypotheses that we will test in the three model circuits to define the regulatory logic for each validated target."
"9249662","There is a fundamental gap in understanding how eosinophils (EOS) participate in inflammation and remodeling in asthmatic subjects. The lack of knowledge in this field is problematic to develop appropriate drugs to better treat a heterogenic disease such as asthma. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which EOS contribute to the development of asthma, particularly the more severe phenotypes. The objective in this Project 1 is to identify how activated EOS produce pro-inflammatory and remodeling factors that are relevant in allergic asthma. The central hypothesis is that IL-3 activates EOS to produce 1) the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1B and 2) the pro-fibrotic membrane protein, semaphorin7A (SEMA7A). We propose that IL-1 B drives the increase of the highly inflammatory cytokine, IL-17 in lymphocytes in the context of an allergic response. SEMA7A induces fibroblasts (Fb) differentiation toward myoFb, amplifying airway remodeling. Our preliminary data will allow us to test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the expression of IL-17 in the ainways after segmental allergen challenge in patients with asthma. Measure IL-1B release from blood and ainway EOS, and connect the release of IL-1B with IL-17 expression in vivo and with EOS ability to increase IL-17 by CD4+ T lymphocytes in vitro. 2) Define the mechanisms responsible for IL-3-induced IL-1B. The mechanisms analyzed include mRNA stability and IL-1B maturation through the inflammasome. 3) Analyze the expression and regulation of SEMA7A on blood and ainway EOS and determine the effect of SEMA7A on human bronchial Fb. The approach is innovative addressing new functions attributed to EOS. The release of bioactive IL-1B by EOS, as well as the expression of SEMA7A on EOS, are both novel. The implication of EOS in IL-17 production has never been shown and the function of SEMA7A on human Fb is unknown. These mechanisms will be analyzed in IL-3-activated EOS in vitro or in vivo in the context of a segmental allergen challenge. This latter in vivo approach, which mimics natural allergic asthma, arguably sets our group apart in our abilities to analyze airway EOS in humans. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding ofthe role of EOS in asthma, and of EOS potential function in the development of severe asthma. Ultimately, the knowledge acquired by these studies, will help to define new potential targets for drugs in needs for patients refractory to current treatments. RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose that IL-3 contributes to eosinophil function in asthma by 1) influencing CD4+ T cell production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17, and 2) inducing expression ofthe profibrotic molecule semaphorin 7 A. The focus on IL-3 is a paradigm shift from current IL-5-targeted therapies. Understanding the cellular and biomolecular mechanisms down-stream of eosinophil activation by IL-3 will reveal novel pathways with therapeutic implications in asthma and other eosinophils-related diseases."
"9167020","Abstract Binge drinking, the consumption of five or more standard drinks for a man or four or more drinks for a woman in about a two hour period leading to intoxication, is a risky behavior practiced by17% of the U.S. population including nearly 30% of adults 18-34 years of age. Binge drinking is associated with multiple consequences and risk of progression to physical dependence on alcohol. Treatment of binge drinking includes psychosocial interventions but, overall, individuals that regularly binge drink are less likely to seek and to receive treatment. There is no FDA approved medication for binge drinking. Preclinical evidence is laying out a neurobiology of binge drinking with relevance for medication development. Recent work has shown that activating the brain melanocortin system potently reduces binge drinking in a mouse model. Furthermore, because the endogenous opioid ?-endorphin inhibits melanocortin actions, a combination of a melanocortin activator and an opioid antagonist has a synergistic effect to reduce binge drinking. This latter finding is intriguing given the recent successful clinical trial and FDA approval of Contrave? for obesity. Contrave? is a combination of bupropion (a melanocortin activator) and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) with a target dose of 360 mg and 32 mg respectively. Therefore we hypothesize that activation of melanocortin systems +/- opioid antagonism will significantly reduce binge drinking in humans. The primary objective of the present proposal is to conduct a proof-of-concept, Phase IIa translational trial to assess for efficacy and tolerability of activating melanocortin systems +/- opioid blockade to reduce binge drinking. 60 men and women with recurrent binge drinking (at least 5 episodes a month for men and 3 for women in the prior 3 months) will be recruited and randomized to either placebo + placebo, bupropion XL 300 mg/d + placebo or bupropion XL 300 mg/d + naltrexone 50 mg/d. The trial will last 12 weeks with a 3 month follow-up to assess stability of change. Primary outcomes include frequency and intensity of binge drinking and changes in biomarkers of heavy drinking (gamma-glutamyl transferase and carbohydrate deficient transferrin) as well as adverse events. Medical Management will be provided to encourage progress towards drinking goals and to enhance retention and compliance. In summary, the present proposal is an innovative and translational clinical trial derived from exciting preclinical findings to test the hypothesis that treatment with a melanocortin activator can reduce binge drinking in humans and to test whether this action is augmented by an opioid antagonist. Evidence for an efficacy signal with good tolerability would form the foundation to conduct a well-powered Phase II/III trial. The development of an effective pharmacotherapy for binge drinking would be a significant clinical advance and one that would be expected to expand the identification and treatment of this common and highly destructive problem."
"9231481","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and lung ischemia/reperfusion are devastating prevalent acute clinical syndromes that have no effective pharmacotherapy. The derangement of endothelial monolayer in the pulmonary vasculature is the common key component of their pathogenesis. In particular, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in endothelial caveolar endosomes mediate harmful pro- inflammatory abnormalities in these cells, unleashing the vicious cicle of mutual propagation of inflammation, oxidative stress and tissue injury. We have designed nanocarriers (NC) for targeted endothelial delivery of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents, which exerted protective effects in animal models of ALI and I/R unmatched by untargeted counterparts. Results of pilot studies indicate that: i) antioxidant delivery in caveolar endosomes further boosts the protective effect; ii) antibody- targeted elastic nanogel carriers (Ab/NG) accumulate in the pulmonary caveoli despite being larger than caveolar entrance; and, iii) inflammation boosts caveolar targeting of large rigid Ab/NC that otherwise do not accumulate in the lungs of naïve mice. We will use Ab/NG and Ab/NC targeted to caveolar target PV1 versus previously characterized non-caveolar target PECAM, to define mechanism of the endothelial targeting of antioxidants, characterize its benefit-risk ratio and enable its clinical translation by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Control targeting to caveolae in normal and pathologically altered endothelial cells; 2) Characterize benefit/risk ratio of Ab/NG and Ab/NC in clinically relevant animal models using clinically relevant readouts; and, 3) Re-engineer affinity moieties of Ab/NG and Ab/NC in a molecular format useful in human patients and test their endothelial targeting and activity in perfused and ventilated isolated human lungs. We posit that carriers targeted to caveolar endosomes will be unrivaled in mitigating inflammatory abnormalities typical of ALI and I/R. Nevertheless, Aims 2 & 3 are not dependent on Aim 1, since they will for the first time determine benefit/risk ratio of PECAM-targeted carriers with already established superiority to untargeted counterparts. This study will enable clinical translation of a promising approach for ALI and I/R treatment."
"9152617","PROJECT SUMMARY Vagal control of the heart has seen renewed interest due to the now well-recognized potential of manipulating cardiac vagal activity for novel therapeutic opportunities in treating heart disease. Recent anatomical and physiological evidence shows that vagal cardiac control is multimodal at both pre- and post-ganglionic neuronal levels. Coordination between multiple modes of control (e.g., of heart rate, ventricular contractility, etc) is essential for heart health. Disruption of such coordination is a hallmark of heart failure and arrhythmias, for example. Studies thus far have largely focused on the physiological effects of the vagus on heart rate without delving into the underlying neural networks, where insights are likely to yield targets for fine-grained manipulation of vagal activity to treat heart disease. Our project is aimed at addressing this unmet need by focusing on the central neuronal as well as cardiac ganglionic circuits driving chrono-, dromo- and iono- tropism. We will pursue an integrated multiscale modeling strategy that combines fine-grained anatomical tracing of control circuits and high-throughput transcriptional analysis of single neurons identified based on circuit connectivity, with computational modeling of the multiscale closed loop vagal cardiac control. These involve hemodynamics, brainstem neuronal networks, and cardiac ganglionic circuits involved in the coordinated inotropic and chronotropic control of the heart. We will develop detailed electrophysiological models of neuronal excitability in nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus (DMV), as well as the targeted cardiac ganglia, and incorporate the transcriptional changes identified from coronary artery ligation experiments in these models. We hypothesize that coordination and integration of the control of rate and contractility occurring at the level of the NA/DMV and the level of the cardiac ganglia are the basis for cardioprotective vagal cardiac outflows. We will test this hypothesis in three Aims: (1) Develop a multiscale network model framework integrating the key modules controlling SA node and left ventricle. (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms affecting the coordination involved in cardiac functional control in heart disease by linking gene regulatory networks and neural network behavior. (3) Test model predictions in selective manipulation of function experiments. Our multiscale computational modeling framework will enable us to combine and interpret the anatomical, transcriptional, and physiological results from experiments. Our investigative team has previously collaborated in modeling the baroreflexes and comprises complementary expertise in all aspects of the proposal. Our approach is expected to identify the relative contribution of brainstem circuits and cardiac ganglionic circuits to the coordination of multimodal vagal control. Our expected results, by uncovering the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the source and maintenance of coordinated vagal outflows, have significant implications for identifying targets for early diagnosis, prevention, and even novel palliative therapy in treating heart disease."
"9347014","PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This STTR Phase I proposal is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of developing tanshinone small-molecule analog (TSA) 521 as an effective and safe small-molecule therapy for patients with sepsis and septic shock. In the US, more than one million people develop sepsis every year. Yet, no effective anti-sepsis treatment exists other than antibiotics and supportive care. We have discovered that high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a pivotal proinflammatory mediator released by macrophages during sepsis. We have also discovered that tanshinone IIA sodium sulfonate, in high doses, decreased circulating levels of HMGB1 and improved the survival rate in the endotoxemia and cecal ligation and puncture models of sepsis. To further enhance the solubility and the binding affinity for HMGB1, we generate TSA521 by opening up tanshinone?s orthobenzoquinone and introducing a carboxylic group. The affinity of TSA521 for HMGB1 is 55-fold higher than that of the tanshinone IIA sodium sulfate. TSA521 also potently inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines known to aggravate and perpetuate inflammation in sepsis. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that TSA521 can be developed as an effective and safe therapeutic agent to treat patients with sepsis and septic shock. To advance TSA521 towards its ultimate clinical use, we will identify its most effective dose and therapeutic window to attenuate organ injury and improve survival in an animal model of sepsis. We will then determine TSA521?s safety and pharmacokinetic profile. These proposed studies will provide critical feasibility information to further develop TSA521 as an HMGB1-suppressing agent to treat sepsis. Our ultimate goal is to obtain commercial utilization of TSA521 as a novel and effective treatment for patients with sepsis and septic shock."
"9333760","Dementia is one of the greatest global health challenges we face in the 21st century. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common form of dementia among people under the age of 60 and its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a predominantly motor neuron disease, share many clinical, pathological, and genetic features. The rapid identification of an array of genes that cause FTD/ALS has opened exciting opportunities to dissect shared pathogenic molecular pathways that may be effective targets for therapeutic intervention. In this appalication, we study the most common genetic cause of FTD/ALS, a GGGGCC repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene. This genetic mutation may cause disease through multiple mechanisms, including neurotoxicity induced by dipeptide (DPR) proteins generated through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. To study these diverse pathogenic mechanisms, we take advantage of the power of Drosophila genetics including genetic suppressors and enhancers of different FTD/ALS disease genes. Such studies often reveal totally unexpected molecular pathways that shed light on pathogenic mechanisms and suggest novel therapeutic targets. In addition, cortical neurons differentiated from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and human patient brain tissues will be used as a complementary approach. This integrated approach?combining genetic, cellular, molecular, electrophysiological, and bioinformatics analyses?will enable us to make significant contributions to dementia research in the years to come."
"9268783","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with chronic HIV-infection are at increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease including myocardial infarction and stroke compared to HIV-uninfected control populations. Adipose tissue dysfunction-including visceral and pericardial lipohypertrophy-may be an important contributor of risk. Compared to what is known about vascular risk, less is known about intrinsic myocardial disease or risk of heart failure in the current era of effective combination ART. The ability of imaging and biomarkers to identify early structural heart disease and prognosticate heart failure risk is an area of intense investigation i the general population, but has been scarcely investigated in the HIV-infected population. Furthermore, the impact of non-AIDS comorbidities may be greater in sub-Saharan Africa, though few studies of CVD have been conducted in patients on ART in this setting. The overall objective of this proposed K23 research plan is to use biomarkers and non-invasive imaging to identify HIV-infected patients with early structural heart disease and to understand the mechanisms of these changes, so that risk-reduction therapies can be appropriately targeted and novel preventive strategies may be developed in the future. This project aims to develop a novel pericardial fat score that will predict cardiometabolic risk in a 3 year longitudinal cohor of 360 patients in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group study. In a cross-sectional study of 300 subjects, we will investigate whether pericardial fat is altered in HIV-infected subjects compared to age-, gender-, and smoking-matched HIV uninfected controls in Cleveland, Ohio and Kampala, Uganda. We will additionally investigate whether pericardial fat and mean attenuation correlate with biomarkers of inflammation and cardiac stress or sensitive measures of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. These studies will provide a comprehensive view of how adipose tissue, inflammation, immune activation, and biomarkers of cardiac stress relate to early structural heart disease among HIV- infected subjects on ART in the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. These cohorts will be followed in future longitudinal studies of cardiac function and incident heart failure risk in HIV. The PI, Dr. Longenecker, is an exceptional candidate who is seeking to become an internationally recognized clinician-investigator in the field of cardiovascular complications of HIV/AIDS. He has a solid track record of publishing in top-tier HIV/AIDS and cardiovascular journals with his current and prior research mentors. He also has four years of experience conducting clinical research in Uganda. As a cardiologist with a focus in non-invasive cardiovascular imaging, he is uniquely positioned to contribute to the research goals outlined in the NHLBI's AIDS Working Group strategic plan (September 2012). Dr. Longenecker has strong institutional support from Case Western Reserve University and the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at University Hospitals. He will have guaranteed 75% protected research time and access to a wealth of campus resources that will ensure a successful transition to independently funded investigator. His robust training plan includes: 1) high quality mentorship from his primary mentor, Dr. Grace McComsey, as well as three cardiology co-mentors, a biostatistician, and a group of collaborators; 2) coursework in fundamental immunology with a focus on chronic HIV infection; 2) intensive training in clinical research design and statistics; 3) experience in multi-site interdisciplinary team science; and 4) Field experience in integrating clinical care and research programs."
"9453743","Geisinger Health System (GHS) is fully prepared and ?shovel-ready? to participate as a Regional Medical Center Healthcare Provider Enrollment Center for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). GHS is an integrated healthcare delivery system serving regions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania with a total population of >3M, of which a significant portion resides in small towns and rural areas. This area is densely rural, with significant socioeconomic and health disparities. The population is notable for its very low rate of relocation in/out of the area and the large number of multi-generation families receiving their healthcare in this single integrated system. This stability provides tremendous opportunity for genomics research and implementation ? along with a century-old tradition of trust between the system and its patients. In brief, GHS patients represent a generally rural, underserved and lower socio-economic population, an important component of PMI diversity. A pioneer in utilization of EHRs and clinical informatics, GHS adopted Epic in 1996 and now has two decades of longitudinal clinical data on its patients. In addition to Epic, we have a well-established comprehensive enterprise clinical data warehouse, extensive experience extracting clinical information from the EHR and data warehouse and a patient population already partnering with us in precision medicine research. That partnership dates back to 2006 when after extensive engagement with patients and other stakeholders, GHS created a system-wide program for genomics research, the MyCode® Community Health Initiative. MyCode® is designed to recruit participants, regardless of health or disease status, from the health system and now provides an effective framework for precision medicine research and implementation of genomic medicine through a return of results program. To date, MyCode® has enrolled ?113,000 participants, all of whom have extensive longitudinal EHR data (average of ~13 years) covering primary, specialty, inpatient, and emergency care, as well as geocoding for integration with public databases including environmental data. MyCode® closely mirrors the proposed design of the national PMI cohort including participant engagement; informed consent for broad research use; data sharing and return of results; longitudinal EHR data; collection of additional participant data via diverse mechanisms and engagement strategies (online patient portal, mobile technologies, mail and telephone surveys, and in-person interactions). MyCode® demonstrates GHS?s capabilities in precision medicine. We propose to leverage our MyCode® experience and infrastructure with the additional elements defined by the PMI Steering Committee to create a separate PMI recruitment initiative at GHS. The combination of a large stable population and a long standing trusting relationship makes Geisinger the perfect place for longitudinal studies like the PMI."
"9306555","Project Summary The objective of this study is to investigate and develop long-term storage of cells using cryopreservation in the context of improving health of islets for islet transplantation as a Type1 Diabetes treatment. The goal is to develop a high subzero cryopreservation method that cools cells inside protective immunoisolation devices to extend preservation time to weeks and months. Our approach is based on the best strategies employed by freeze-tolerant and hibernating animals in nature augmented with complementary strategies developed using recent scientific understanding and bioengineering principles. Importantly, our approach does not seek to solve all the problems needed for vitrification or classical cryopreservation, but rather be the first to develop tissue preservation in a controlled, partially frozen equilibrium state using high subzero temperatures (ranging from -5 to -20 °C) combined with metabolic depression. These are temperatures and strategies used in nature by species able to survive months in a state of ?suspended animation,? with the whole animal, including every single organ being ?banked? without injury. Specific Aim 1 (SA1) is to select and optimize the cryostasis cocktail with components that are essential for cell survival post freezing. Non-metabolizable 3-O-methyl-d- glucose (3-OMG) and trehalose mix will be used to prevent cellular dehydration and intracellular ice formation during cryopreservation. Unisol will be used as the base solution for testing the interaction of multiple doses of 3-OMG, trehalose with storage time as a function of temperature using ?TC3 cells. Specific Aim 2 (SA2) is to achieve active suppression of metabolic rate and enhancement of stress tolerance. ?TC3 cells will be stored in the cryostasis cocktail developed in SA1 as well with multiple dose testing of antioxidants (AO), anti-apoptotic (AA) and metabolic suppressors (MS). Human islets will be cryopreserved and stored in the standard culture, in DMSO, and in the optimal dosage, additives, temperature and storage duration established through SA1 and SA2. Quality assessments of these islets include oxygen consumption rate (OCR) normalized to DNA, percent recovery as measured by DNA to assess viability, and glucose stimulated insulin secretion to measure function. Specific Aim 3 (SA3) is to test encapsulated islets in the TheraCyte device using the most promising cryostasis cocktail established from SA1 and SA2. Islets will be cryopreserved and stored using the standard culture methods and the best conditions from SA1 and SA2. Once thawed, islet quality assessments from SA2 will be performed immediately post-thaw and after the 48 hour culture recovery period. Specific aim 4 (SA4) is to test cryopreserved, encapsulated human islets in a diabetic nude mouse model. Human islets within Theracyte immunoisolation devices that have been cryopreserved and stored in standard culture and the new cryostasis cocktail will be transplanted into diabetic nude mice. Mice will be monitored for diabetes reversal by taking daily blood glucose and weekly intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests over 30 days. Explanted devices will be assessed by device OCR/DNA, GSIS, and histology to analyze islet health within the device."
"9256401","This Project focuses on the mechanisms by which beta amyloid (Aß) accumulation and inflammation  (specifically interieukin 1 beta; IL-1ß) impair plasticity and neuronal health. We propose that these molecules  interfere with endosomal trafficking of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB,  leading to impaired neuronal health, function and synaptic plasticity. Our data reveal that IL-1 ß and Aß both  interfere with retrograde axonal flow of BDNF-TrkB and impair events downstream from BDNF-TrkB  signaling, including nuclear gene transcription. In addition, we found that IL-1ß impairs the stabilization of  BDNF-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) by preventing actin polymerization in spines. These data  indicate that Aß and IL-iß deteriorate synapses by targeting both pre and post-synaptic components,  impairing signal transduction and synaptic plasticity and placing neurons at risk for degeneration. We  propose that impairment of endosomal trafficking is a common mechanism by which Aß and IL-1ß impair  retrograde signaling and spine plasticity. Supporting the hypothesis that dysfunctional endosomal trafficking  is an important contributor to AD pathogenesis, several recently identified genetic risk factors for AD impact  function of endocytotic pathways (e.g., PICALM, BINI, CD2AP). In this proposal, we will evaluate how Aß  and IL-1ß impair endosomal trafficking, focusing on BDNF-TrkB trafficking, and investigate how signaling  events downstream of BDNF-TrkB are impacted. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will evaluate mechanisms by  which Aß and IL-1ß interfere with endosomal trafficking and axonal retrograde transport of BDNF-TrkB.In  Aim 2, we will determine if IL-1ß impairs postsynaptic activity-dependent BDNF-TrkB trafficking and plasticity  in dendritic spines. We also will eviaute how PICALM can modulate BDNF TrkB trafficking.. Aim 3 will  translate the in-vitro data to an in-vivo paradigm, to investigate if IL-1ß impairs hippocampal-dependent  learning and if select intervention strategies can protect against the detrimental effects of IL-1ß on  endosomal trafficking, and learning. Our project incorporates data sharing and multiple collaborations with  the team: e.g., Glabe (effects of Aß oligomeric species on BDNF-TrkB trafficking), LaFeria (IL-1ß, Aß and  endocytic dysfunction). Tenner (Clq protection from IL-1ß evoked impairments of BDNF-TrkB F signaling),  and Cribbs (impairment of endosomal function by IL-1ß and Aß in endothelial cells)."
"9287829","Peru-JHU TMRC Program Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): GARCIA, Hector H. Component 2 - Biomarkers for Monitoring Treatment Efficacy  in Human Neurocysticercosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Human neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a frequent cause of seizures and other neurological disease in most developing countries also present in industrialized countries because of travel and immigration from endemic regions. Treatment of NCC involves symptomatic measures as well as interventions to destroy (antiparasitic treatment) or excise the parasites (surgical procedures). The efficacy of these interventions is usually monitored by neuroimaging techniques, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), that are performed three or six months after treatment. The response rate to antiparasitic drugs is currently poor and the decision to retreat is frequently delayed until clinical relapse and/or obvious regrowth, which would be expected to lead to increased risk for complications and likely a more difficult course of retreatment. In addition, CT and MRI are expensive and not accessible in poor rural areas, where NCC is highly endemic. There is thus is an important need for an assay for early documentation of the response to therapy. Given the variability of clinical presentations of NCC, a single test or a time point in the follow up may not be the best choice for all scenarios. This component will attempt to develop one or more assays for early assessment of response to treatment in the main types of NCC, taking advantage of newly available test formats and our vast collection of archive samples in addition to additional prospectively collected baseline and post-treatment serum and urine samples to define a test, a sample and the time point of choice to better predict partial and complete responses to treatment for each of the main types of NCC."
"9236087","Project Description Cochlear implants are highly successful neural prostheses that enhance or restore hearing to the severely hearing impaired. However, performance varies considerably among cochlear implant listeners, particularly in noisy environments and for spectrally complex stimuli like music. We have developed fast and reliable tools to assess patterns of perceptual responses that are fairly predictive of variability in performance outcomes. These new procedures, established in adults, will allow for the first systematic investigation of single-channel performance measures and their relation to listening performance in children with cochlear implants. The results will guide the refinement of listener-tailored programming methods, leading to improvements in listening abilities. Three aims are proposed: 1) to develop and assess listener-tailored cochlear implant programming, based on the focusing or deactivation of select channels, that will improve performance on complex listening tasks; 2) to assess the degree to which chronic listening experience enhances performance with listener-tailored strategies; and 3) to establish our first understanding of basic psychophysical measures in prelingually deaf and early implanted children to define the best route towards pediatric, listener-tailored programming approaches. The results of these studies are expected to advance our understanding of how cochlear implants should be programmed to best deliver spectrally challenging stimuli. Ultimately, the findings may lead to improved functional outcomes for both pediatric and adult cochlear implant listeners and provide insight into how the auditory system develops with altered input through a cochlear implant."
"9240659","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) proposal describes a five- year training program for career development in academic pulmonary medicine. The principal investigator, William Oldham, M.D., Ph.D., is an Associate Physician and Instructor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School. He has a background in chemistry and biochemistry and completed doctoral research in pharmacology while a member of the NIH Medical Scientist Training Program at Vanderbilt University. He completed clinical training in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Disease, and Critical Care Medicine in 2012. His goal is to develop a successful career as an independently funded physician-scientist investigating redox metabolism in pulmonary vascular disease. With the support and protected time provided by the K08 award, Dr. Oldham will develop expertise in the fields of energy metabolism, redox biochemistry, mitochondrial physiology, and dynamic modeling from formal coursework, independent study, and practical experience with relevant experimental techniques. Dr. Joseph Loscalzo, an internationally recognized expert in these areas with over 30 years of mentoring experience, will mentor Dr. Oldham with the support of an advisory committee composed of outstanding scientists in metabolism and pulmonary disease. As the award period progresses, Dr. Oldham will develop the skills necessary for a successful R01 grant submission. Dr. Oldham will work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in the Department of Medicine at BWH, an outstanding scientific and mentoring environment located within the heart of the Harvard Medical School community. Pulmonary arterial hypertension affects 15-50 people per million and elevated pulmonary artery pressures con- tribute to increased morbidity and mortality of millions more affected by lung disease, heart failure, and other conditions. Metabolic abnormalities in PAH offer a rich potential for the development of much-needed disease modifying therapies for this condition. Dr. Oldham's long-term goal is to define the metabolic derangements underlying PAH and to develop therapies targeting the resulting metabolic vulnerabilities. The overall objective of this application is to define the role of L2HG in the pathogenesis of PAH as the first step toward his long- term goal. The central hypothesis is that L2HG production supports pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH by increasing pro-proliferative reactive oxygen species generation in pulmonary vascular cells. The rationale for this proposal is that, once the links between L2HG metabolism and PAH pathogenesis are defined, these bio- chemical pathways can be targeted pharmacologically, resulting in novel and disease-modifying therapies for PAH. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Determine the biochemical link between L2HG metabolism, glycolysis, and cellular redox state using biochemical and kinetic modeling approaches; (2) Determine the impact of L2HG metabolism on pulmonary vascular cell phenotype using genetic manipulations of L2HG levels and readouts of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species production; and (3) Determine the role of L2HG metabolism in the development of PAH using genetically modified mice. The contribution of this work is expected to be a mechanistic understanding of how L2HG metabolism regulates cellular redox homeostasis in support of pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. This contribution will be significant because it will define a critical role for L2HG in normal and diseased metabolism that will enhance our understanding of the cellular response to hypoxia and other stressors. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by defining an important role for L2HG metabolism in cellular redox homeostasis. This research will open new horizons in the study of intracellular redox signaling. Moreover, this pathway has not been previously associated with PAH and represents a new area for mechanistic investigations of disease pathogenesis. Since L2HG is not an intermediate in any known metabolic pathway, its metabolism may offer safe and tractable experimental and therapeutic tar- gets for manipulating cellular redox state, which would provide a valuable tool for future investigations of this deadly disease."
"9264944","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sepsis is a severe life-threatening condition that damages multiple physiological systems which manifest in a devastating acute critical illness. After discharge from the hospital, 70-100% of severe sepsis survivors report sustained weakness which prevents them from resuming a normal lifestyle. As the mortality rate of sepsis declines due to advancements in critical care medicine and the incidence rate increases due to an aging US population, there are more than 1 million new sepsis survivors every year. It is predicted that the rate of sepsis survivors will continue to rise as the population ages and advancements continue to be made in treatment of sepsis. However, despite recognition of this clinical issue, the molecular mechanisms contributing to chronic muscle dysfunction after sepsis are not well understood due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. Current models are either too mild to induce muscle weakness or are too severe and cause death within a few days. To circumvent this problem, I developed a clinically relevant ICU-like sepsis resuscitation protocol with which 70% of middle-aged mice are rescued from otherwise completely lethal sepsis. The Aims of this project are (1) to test whether the mice that are rescued from lethal sepsis by the ICU-like resuscitation protocol exhibit muscle weakness, and (2) to identify the primary mechanism(s) responsible for muscle weakness after sepsis. Muscle functional analyses will be performed using in vivo and ex vivo strength tests at different time points after sepsis, which will be carefully designed so that the presence of atrophy and/or myopathy can be detected. I have already found that animals with lethal sepsis but rescued using my resuscitation protocol have significant muscle weakness 2 weeks after sepsis induction. Although the mechanisms by which sepsis-induced muscle weakness becomes a chronic condition are unknown, my preliminary data suggest that mitochondria are involved. Therefore, a series of molecular analyses will be performed to assess the time course and severity of muscle dysfunction and how it may cause reduction in force generating capacity by oxidizing sarcomeric proteins. These studies will promote the development of numerous scientific skill sets including proper animal research design, implementation, and interpretation as well as an assortment of molecular analysis techniques. Successful completion of this project will yield an understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for muscle weakness after sepsis which could help elucidate a novel therapeutic target to prevent sepsis-mediated from developing in patients."
"9261599","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oscillatory network dynamics provide an intermediate phenotype that, in some human imaging studies, has proven to be a more fruitful correlation target than behavioral measures for identifying genetic biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. Using rodent models, we propose to study oscillatory long-range synchronization and its alterations in schizophrenia, as well as disturbances in developmental trajectories of oscillatory networks from adolescence to adulthood. The primary focus is the impaired rhythmic coordination between activities in the hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) which is particularly important for specific cognitive functions in the adult and was also shown to play an important role in early neurodevelopment. Abnormal functional connectivity between HC and PFC has been demonstrated in schizophrenic patients and in chronic animal models of schizophrenia. Since pathological alterations of the key elements of neuronal oscillatory networks are present in both HC and PFC, impaired cortico-hippocampal synchronization can originate from the pathology of either or both structures. We propose to examine this issue using a novel approach that can precisely define the spatial distribution of rhythmic generators and quantify their interactions, including the essential directional influences. We will systematically investigate the spectral structure, the anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology of these interactions in normal rats and in pharmacological models of schizophrenia. We further hypothesize that impaired oscillations also adversely affect the maturation of cortical networks and their long-range connections. Understanding the ontogeny of temporal dynamics and their control is a severe gap area in the field, because oscillations are critical for normal cognition ad seem to be impaired not just in schizophrenia, but also in autism, and other mental illnesses. Thus we will also investigate the normal development of HC-PFC relationship through adolescence and early adulthood and its pathological alterations in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia using daily electrophysiological recordings; such a longitudinal design has not been attempted in prior studies. Specific Aim 1 is to establish the pattern of PFC- HC interactions including directional information. We propose that long-range influences synchronizing neuronal activity and gamma oscillations between HC and PFC are active in both directions, with an overall HC dominance. We will investigate the anatomical substrate of these bidirectional interactions and their role in a cognitive task which requires dynamic PFC-HC coupling. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the impaired PFC-HC interactions in pharmacological models of schizophrenia using NMDA receptor antagonists and dopamine D4 receptor agonists which, besides schizophrenia-relevant symptoms, are known to significantly alter brain oscillations and to reduce performance on cognitive tasks requiring functional PFC and HC networks. Specific Aim 3 is to define how oscillation networks develop through the periadolescent period in normal rats and in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. We propose a longitudinal study to investigate how the adult pattern of oscillatory synchronization develops and when and how the developmental trajectories in the schizophrenia model diverge from normal."
"9279982","TR&D 2: Bioprinting Patterning for Cell-Laden Constructs Project Summary A major challenge for tissue and organ engineering is the production of three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic, cellular tissue constructs of clinically relevant size, shape, and structural integrity needed for the replacement of damaged or injured tissues. To address this need, we have been investigating 3D bioprinting technologies, which are designed to print cell-laden hydrogel bioinks as well as polymeric biomaterials, to manufacture complex, multi-cellular living tissue constructs that mimic the structure of native tissues. In addition, we have been optimizing the formulation of biomaterials to serve as the scaffolding for 3D bioprinting, and providing the biological environment needed for the successful delivery of cells and biomaterials to specific locations within the 3D structures. It has become evident that the patterning design of the cell-laden biomaterials is critical for achieving adequate nutrition and functional outcomes. In this project, we will (1) develop bioink formulations and functionalize to control cell positioning with high printability, (2) fabricate biofunctional bioink formulations to control the cell microenvironment, and (3) validate bioprinted multiple cell populations with interacting functionalities for bone tissue regeneration in vivo. The results of this project - which will be shared with the broad community - will be to establish the ideal parameters needed for cell positioning during 3D printing of tissues, thus establishing a community wide approach for engineering tissues."
"9402999","PROJECT SUMMARY (Description)  Microglia are intimately involved in brain homeostasis and synaptic maturation. Recent studies suggest that developmental brain disorder may induce pathological microglia to impair the neural network. In this project, we will test whether these perinatal injury-induced pathological microglia have a unique lineage origin. The current prevailing view holds that microglia are derived exclusively from early CNS settlers of a yolk sac, and do not receive contributions by peripheral monocytes and derivtatives. Yet, our pilot studies suggested a far more complex situation, which bears great implications for perinatal brain injury/infection-related cognitive derangements. This project will test the hypothesis monocytes readily contribute to the brain microglial pool prenatally, but cease doing so shortly after birth. However, perinatal brain injury or infection widens the window of monocyte-to-microglia conversion to produce chronic pro-inflammatory microglia in adult brains. Aim 1: Generate CCR2-CreER mice using BAC recombineering to identify monocyte derivatives. We will produce tamoxifen-inducible CCR2-CreER mice using bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering transgenesis to detect monocyte-derivatives in the R26R-GFP reporter line. We will donate CCR2-CreER mice to the Jackson Laboratory to make this powerful transgenic tool readily available the research community. Aim 2: Compare monocyte-derived microglia in normal development or maternal immune activation (MIA) with and without mild hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in the neonatal period. We hypothesize that Monocytes transform to pro-inflammatory microglia to damage nearby synaptic structures after maternal immune activation (MIA) or endotoxin-sensitized hypoxia/ischemia (LPS/HI) in neonates. Aim 2a compares the number and morphology of monocyte-derived microglia in normal development and after MIA with and without mild HI injury. Aim 2b uses fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by RT- PCR analysis to compare gene expression by monocyte-derived microglia. Aim 2c employs confocal imaging analysis to compare the relationship of monocyte-derived microglia with adjacent synapses."
"9329237","Project Summary Carbon-halogen bonds are ubiquitous in agrochemicals1 and pharmaceutical compounds at every stage in development.2 Although much attention is paid to the unique properties of the carbon-fluorine bond,3-6 carbon-chlorine bonds are in fact more numerous within FDA-approved drugs.2 The most numerous type of C?Cl bond in pharmaceuticals by far is the aryl C?Cl bond.7 Traditional chemistry for forming aryl C?Cl bonds, such as electrophilic halogenation and halogen exchange with organometallic arenes, are harsh and suffer poor functional group tolerance.8 Modern transition metal-catalyzed C?H halogenations8 can still be challenging, and the electronic preferences of the substrate can only be overcome with elaborate directing groups.9 Enzymatic catalysis, in contrast, are able to exert remarkable regiocontrol in aryl C?Cl bond formation. Flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs)10,11 are able to halogenate a variety of electron-rich (hetero)arenes, such as phenols,12 pyrroles,13 and indoles14 via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism by a lysine chloramine intermediate.15 The tryptophan halogenases, which halogenate the indole of the tryptophan sidechain, perhaps offer the most detailed glimpse into how highly tunable this class of catalyst is. Different tryptophan FDHs have been discovered that are able to halogenate at either the 5-16, 6-17, or 7-position14,18 of tryptophan, overriding the electronic preferences of the indole for C2-halogenation. The diverse regioselectivity in this set of homologous enzymes hints at evolvability toward new function not found in nature.19 One FDH, RebH, has been subject to extensive engineering efforts, including directed evolution for thermostability,20 altered regioselectivity,21 and expanded substrate scope.22,23 Despite these accomplishments, the engineered RebH variants remain unable to halogenate electron-deficient arenes, and alternative halogenase biocatalyst discovery strategies that may further expand substrate scope remain largely unexplored. The aim of the proposed research is to extend FDH halogenation to electron-deficient arenes, characterize new halogenases from genetic sequence databases, and extend halogenase activitity to large, biologically relevant molecules. Specifically: 1a) I will use directed evolution to establish and extend the limit of arene electron deficiency accessible to RebH-catalyzed halogenation; 1b) I will use rational active-site mutagenesis and amber codon suppression to incorporate electron-deficient lysine residues within the RebH active site to extend halogenation activity to particularly electron-deficient heteroarenes such as unactivated quinolines; 2) I will mine genetic databases for putative FDHs, characterize their halogenase activity on a library of structurally diverse arenes, and link the discovered substrate scope to phylogeny using bioinformatics and to structure using X-ray crystallographic analysis; and 3) In collaboration with Prof. Scott Snyder, I will use directed evolution of the newly discovered FDHs to halogenate large, structurally complex resveratrol oligomers. The sum of the research proposed will improve our understanding of FDH catalysis as well as generate useful catalysts for functionalizing molecules important in medicinal chemistry."
"9296901","Project Summary Stroke survivors and spousal caregivers face significant challenges, yet interventions to support couples after stroke are largely lacking. Depressive symptoms post-stroke occur in 30-50% of survivors and partner caregivers, and have significant consequences on function and quality of life. Further, mood and psychosocial well-being are reciprocal in couples, meaning if one partner is depressed, the other is more likely to be depressed. Sustaining well-being in both partners is important for continued engagement in rehabilitation and re-integration into the community, yet existing interventions are aimed at the individual rather than the couple. This study will address this gap by testing an innovative dyadic (couples-based) intervention using a new approach based on positive psychology that focuses on the strengths in the relationship in order to foster resilience in the couple. Using a randomized waitlist control design, this pilot study aims to determine whether an 8-week dyadic positive psychology-based intervention (PPI) can improve mood and subjective well-being as assessed by established outcome measures in 24 couples coping with stroke. The intervention consists of self- administered PPI activities, such as expressing gratitude and practicing acts of kindness, which participants complete individually and as a couple. Two potential pathways will be explored for the PPI: (a) enhanced quality of interactions as couples deal with daily life demands and (b) improvements in mood that are ?contagious? among couples. If found effective, couples with greater well-being may be better emotionally equipped to cope with the sequelae of stroke by reducing stress and depressive symptoms, and increasing participation in meaningful activities and quality of life."
"9280312","Visual perception is limited by two fundamental rhythms, a 7-10 Hz theta/alpha rhythm that describes fluctuations in psychophysical performance and a 3-5 Hz rhythm related to saccadic eye movements. The structure of a task may impose or entrain an additional rhythm, such as when a target stimulus follows a cue at a fixed interval. The goal of this project is to identify in humans the neural correlates of these rhythms and determine their relationship to intrinsic rhythms of spontaneous activity. Neural activity is measured using electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy. In Expt. 1, localizers are conducted to identify electrodes that respond to saccadic eye movements, foveal stimuli, and/or show spatially selective responses to peripheral stimuli. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to identify the large-scale brain network associated with each electrode. In Expt. 2 subjects are cued to detect a target under conditions of temporal uncertainty. In the one-location condition, the target only appears at the cued location. In the two- location condition, the target appears equi-probably at one of two locations. Consistent with previous studies indicating a fixed sampling rhythm, performance should fluctuate in the 1-location condition at twice the frequency as the fluctuations in each location of the 2-location condition. We then identify the neural correlate(s) of this rhythm in electrodes identified by the localizer. These correlates may be associated with local field potentials, modulations of band-limited power, or phase-amplitude relationships that couple low frequencies to high frequencies. In addition, we determine whether these correlates can be identified in intrinsic activity measured at rest. Expt. 3 compares the 1-location and 2-location conditions when the interval between the cue and target is fixed, corresponding to a task-imposed rhythm and temporal certainty. The question is whether the neural correlates of the task-imposed rhythm are independent of the intrinsic rhythms measured in Expt. 2. Finally, Expt. 4 compares the neural rhythms that are generated when subjects process foveal stimuli during a sequence of saccades as compared to the same foveal stimuli when fixation is maintained. We test the hypothesis that saccades produce a phase reset that aligns the maximal excitability phase of internal rhythms with incoming sensory signals. This hypothesis predicts that high gamma sensory evoked responses and behavioral performance should be facilitated by saccades. We also determine the relationship between the neural correlates of the saccadic rhythm, the 7-10 Hz sampling rhythm, and spontaneous rhythms measured at rest. We will interact closely with Project 2, which uses 2 of these tasks in monkey intracortical recordings, and with Projects 3 and 4 that study parallel auditory tasks in humans and monkeys, respectively. Along with Project 3, we will supply data to dynamical network modeling studies (Project 5), and use their findings to refine and/or modify our paradigms as work progresses. Integration of findings across these studies will build more robust models of brain mechanisms operating in Active Sensing."
"9280317","ABSTRACT Electrocorticography (ECoG) refers to recording from the surface of the brain. ECoG has been used for decades for select clinical purposes ? most commonly to identify functional and epileptic brain areas in people with epilepsy ? and occasionally for research. The important role of ECoG for basic research long been under-appreciated. Over the past several years, the unique qualities of ECoG have become widely and increasingly recognized by scientists engaged in basic and translational research. The primary sources of human ECoG data are patients with epilepsy patients, who receive subdural implants to map epileptic foci and function prior to invasive brain surgery. Thus, data collection is limited to the 125 class-IV epilepsy centers across the country that perform such surgeries, and to about 5-10 patients in each of these centers per year. Hence, larger-scale human ECoG studies and integration with animal ECoG studies, such as those proposed in this application, require that data are collected at multiple medical centers. However, each of them uses variable data collection protocols, data collection software, data collection hardware, data formats, and methods and procedures to keep track of meta information (e.g., the current cognitive status of the subject or other comments). These variations greatly impede, and in practice often prohibit the conduction of ECoGbased studies across multiple sites. Thus, achievement of the scientific goals of the proposed Center relies considerably on the effectiveness and efficiency of the mechanisms to address or mitigate these issues. The Data Management/Sharing (DMS) Core facilitates data collection, integration and sharing of human and animal electrocorticographic (ECoG) data across participating Center sites and projects. While ECoG data provide enormous opportunities for achieving the scientific goals of the Center, each of the five human ECoG sites (and the one monkey ECoG site) in the Center will provide data from only a few subjects each year, and there are important variabilities across subjects and technical setup at each of these sites. Thus, the overarching goal of the DMS Core is to remove or mitigate these variabilities so as to maximize the scientific value of the ECoG datasets produced by the Center and to minimize the difficulty in accessing them. In specific terms, AIM 1 is to provide support for implementation of experiments in standardized software; AIM 2 is to coordinate data collection at ECoG sites using standardized protocols; AIM 3 is to interface with those sites to aggregate data and to verify data integrity; and AIM 4 is to make data available to the Center's four scientific projects using robust and easy-to-use mechanisms."
"9262793","PROJECT 3 PROJECT SUMMARY Impact of Environmental Modifications on Pathogenesis and  Immunity of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Hydropower dam and irrigation initiatives to improve and sustain agricultural productivity are underway in Ethiopia and Kenya. However, there is very limited knowledge of how these water and land use modifications will affect diverse malaria ecosystems and impact ongoing vector interventions that have decreased but not eliminated malaria transmission. Research in this project will address topics pertinent to understanding how rapid changes in intensity and geospatial features of Plasmodium falciparum vivax and P. vivax transmission resulting from environmental modifications impact naturally acquired immunity (NAI) to malaria disease pathogenesis and parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes. From a translational perspective, the goals are to 1) develop, evaluate and validate in vitro correlates of NAI adaptable to standardized formats as population surveillance and diagnostic tools that could be used to predict resurgences or reductions of malaria morbidity, and 2) advance understanding of naturally acquired P. falciparum antibody-mediated transmission reducing activity. From a basic perspective, our goals are to 1) define the mechanistic roles of antibodies and complement in malaria immunity, and 2) fill in major gaps of knowledge related to NAI to P. vivax pathogenesis in Africa. These goals will be achieved through a collaboration involving field and laboratory facilities in two malaria endemic sites in western Kenya and three malaria endemic sites in Ethiopia with malaria research teams in the U.S. and Australia that have long standing working relationships with research scientists and malaria public health experts in Ethiopia and Kenya. This is integrated with the Epidemiology project, which will generate biological samples, clinical data, and antibody seroconversion data, and the Transmission project, which will determine whether vector species composition, biting behavior and spatial patterns of exposure to anopheline mosquitoes correlate with changes in transmission reducing immunity. The Administrative and Data Management and Biostatistics Cores will be critical to the logistics, management, and scientific value of this project."

"9263323","With the heaviest malaria burden in the region, Myanmar is central to the newly launched campaign to eliminate malaria from Southeast Asia. Malaria prevalence, incidence, and transmission risk are both highly heterogeneous and do not fully overlap, posing serious challenges for targeting elimination interventions. Research that enhances the understanding of space-time malaria risk dynamics and transmission pathways will improve elimination prospects. Project 3 addresses Research Area B, Transmission, focusing on the two major transmission pathways: human and mosquito. A suite of geospatial techniques will be introduced to model vector and parasite presence/abundance in space and time and establish relationships between human mobility and malaria transmission at multiple scales. The first aim will establish spatially explicit relationships between environmental conditions, vector abundance, and malaria burden along a multi-seasonal temporal gradient to enable the development of a predictive malaria risk system at study sites in Myanmar and near its borders with China and Bangladesh. This will be accomplished through applying a combination of field sampling of mosquito abundance at high temporal density, DNA- based speciation of mosquitos, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax presence/abundance (from Project 1), satellite-derived environmental parameters, and random forest analytical framework. Tools will be developed to forecast falciparum and vivax malaria burden as a function of environmental conditions. The modeling results will be compared with the outcomes of Project 1 serological analyses that quantify the exposure of study participants to site-specific parasite sub- populations as defined in Project 2 genomic epidemiology studies. Aim 2 will identify spatial drivers for malaria transmission and the relationships between patterns of human mobility and risk. Spatial network modeling approaches will be used to study human mobility at the village level based on the daily activities of individuals as reported through travel histories and traffic analyses. Longer-distance movements at a regional level, reported through travel histories and other travel data (e.g. rail, water travel, airways) will be used to assess regional transmission patterns and how populations may become vulnerable to infection. Human mobility patterns will also be linked to genetic information from Project 2 about parasite population structure and movement to assess the relationships between population movements and parasite migration. Together with the Mapping Core, this project will improve the ability of National Malaria Control Programs to target interventions much more precisely?and therefore more effectively and efficiently?than is possible with current tools and approaches."
"9276176","Diseases transmitted by insects (vector borne) account for over 17% of the infectious disease burden globally. Most of these diseases lack efficient mammalian vaccines or treatments, and thus heavily rely on vector control to prevent or reduce transmission. Anopheles and tsetse fly are the two vectors involved in malaria and sleeping sickness transmission, respectively. Current vector control methods largely involve the use of insecticides that are environmentally undesirable, and have diminishing efficacy in light of the emergence of insecticide resistance observed in insects. Understanding the mechanisms that influence vector-parasite transmission biology can help develop new control methods. There is growing evidence that the capacity to transmit parasites (vector competence) is influenced by vector innate immune responses and associations with native microbes. The two disease vectors, mosquitoes and tsetse flies, have varying life histories and different associations with gut microbiota. An important component of the innate immune response to pathogens involves Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins, PGRPs, which recognize pathogen specific molecules and regulate host immune responses that ultimately clear pathogens. We have identified that the PGRP repertoire and functions in tsetse and mosquito vary in accordance with their different life histories and symbiotic associations. We also found that native microbiota influence vector competence through essential roles they play in host immunity and metabolism. This proposal builds on our preliminary studies and expands our previous findings to: 1) characterize and compare PGRP functions that differ in Anopheles and tsetse focusing on PGRP-LB and PGRP-LD and 2) investigate immune and metabolic contribution of the gut microbiota to vector competence. Implementation of our goals will expand our knowledge on 1) the structure and regulation of PGRPs contributing to vector competence, and 2) influence of metabolic interactions between vectors and microbiota on disease transmission traits. These findings have the potential to advance knowledge on tripartite interactions between vectors, symbionts and parasites, and to develop novel targets for disrupting pathogen transmission."
"9262219","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinalization of the esophagus, termed Barrett's esophagus (BE), is thought to develop in response to chronic acid and bile reflux and carries great clinical significance because it is the precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of BE is quite high, estimated to be found in at least 1:100 people. While relatively few with BE progress to cancer there is great importance to being able to detect those at risk of progression. Efforts to screen for high risk disease in those with BE have, to date, not been very successful. Therefore, there is profound need to define the process by which BE progresses into EAC, to develop biomarkers to diagnose early progression and assess progression risk in BE tissues. The objective of this mentored research career development proposal is to investigate the molecular underpinnings of Barrett's esophagus progression with the long term goal to develop better screening strategies and biomarkers to identify those at risk of progression at an early curable stage. To determine when and where key alterations in BE progression occur, laser capture microdissection and sequencing of histologically defined areas of BE, dysplasia, and EAC will be performed. These alterations will then be modeled in both an in vitro and in vivo setting to determine their functional significance. The role of acid and bile exposure to BE progression and how these exposures interact with genetic alterations will be investigated using the same model systems. These research studies encompass a wide array of disciplines including gastrointestinal pathology, Barrett's biology, massively parallel sequencing/genetics, and in vitro and in vivo (mouse) model development, which together will help define the process of BE progression as well as provide a well-rounded career development pathway to becoming an independent investigator through the following specific aims: Aim 1: To define the timing of TP53 mutations and genomic doubling in Barrett's esophagus progression relative to onset of dysplasia and acquisition of other genomic alterations. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis in in vitro and in vivo models of Barrett's esophagus that TP53 mutations facilitate acquisition of genomic doubling, aneuploidy, and oncogene amplification leading to neoplastic transformation. Aim 3: To determine the effect of acidic pH and bile salt exposure on Barrett's epithelial progression. This career development award candidate is a M.D./Ph.D. with board certification in anatomic and molecular genetic pathology. The research proposed in this grant application will be conducted under the co- mentorship of Drs. Massimo Loda and Adam Bass at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The candidate is committed to a career as a physician scientist and seeks further training to facilitate his transition to become a NIH-funded independent investigator in the field of gastrointestinal disease."

"9396227","Project Summary  Animals, including humans, interact with their chemical environment through specialized receptor cells found within the nasal epithelium. Upon odorant binding, these neurons transmit information to the olfactory bulb, the initial site of olfactory sensory processing. However, at present, our understanding of how these cells ultimately communicate information about odor identity and concentration to the brain in intact animals is limited. I propose that olfactory receptor neurons are a highly diverse population of cells in terms of their odor responses within a sampling event. Furthermore, heterogeneous activity among receptor neurons may be a mechanism to preserve non-redundant information about the sensory environment. Aim 1 will examine how populations of olfactory receptor neurons encode odor mixtures. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that individual olfactory receptor neurons heterogeneously respond to odors. Together, these aims will provide novel insights into mechanisms of sensory transduction in the mammalian olfactory system."
"9412223","PROJECT ABSTRACT Candidate. My career goal is to reduce cancer health disparities in cancer survivorship by addressing sleep disturbance and other quality of life issues (e.g., distress, cognitive impairment, fear of cancer recurrence) in minority cancer populations. I received a solid foundation in observational cancer quality of life research, but my training has not provided the skills I need to develop mHealth behavioral interventions or the skills needed to reduce cancer health disparities. I look forward to taking the next steps in my career development, and the K01 provides an ideal opportunity to develop the necessary skills to achieve my career goal. This line of research has the potential to significantly improve cancer survivorship because of A) the large impact that sleep disturbance and other quality of life issues have on well-being, B) growing evidence of disparities in cancer survivorship, and C) the large and growing population of minority cancer survivors. Career Development Plan. My career development plan builds on my training in observational cancer quality of life research. I propose to develop the skills necessary to become a leader in the field of developing mHealth behavioral interventions for sleep disturbance and other quality of life issues in minority cancer survivors. Training will be obtained through participation in scientific conferences (mHealth, sleep medicine, behavioral medicine), methods workshops (designing mHealth interventions, health disparities research, clinical trial analyses), coursework (health disparities, qualitative methods, mobile app development), and structured mentorship from experts in intervention development (Dr. Sharon Manne), cancer health disparities (Dr. Elisa Bandera), sleep disturbance (Dr. Martica Hall), qualitative interviewing (Dr. Shawna Hudson), mHealth methodology (Dr. Lee Ritterband), developing culturally targeted interventions (Dr. Cathy Meade), and grant writing. This training will ensure that I achieve my goals, which are to: 1) Learn the health disparities research skills that will help me conceptualize and implement culturally targeted behavioral interventions for sleep disturbance and other quality of life issues, 2) acquire the skills necessary to develop and test behavioral interventions, including qualitative interviewing, mHealth methodology, and clinical trial analyses, and 3) Develop a deeper understanding of sleep disturbance and other quality of life issues in cancer survivors. Research Plan. We propose a sequential mixed methods approach to develop and pilot test a new mHealth behavioral intervention for cancer-related sleep disturbance that is culturally targeted to African American breast cancer survivors. We plan to take a holistic approach to cancer-related sleep disturbance as compared to standard treatment for primary insomnia, which is less effective in cancer survivors than in the general population. We will first identify predictors of cancer-related sleep disturbance in a unique cohort of African American breast cancer survivors as well as collect qualitative data on the barriers to standard treatment and opportunities for cultural targeting (Aim 1). Using data gathered in Aim 1, we will iteratively develop an mHealth intervention to address cancer-related sleep disturbance in African American breast cancer survivors (Aim 2). This intervention will address predictors of cancer- related sleep disturbance, reduce barriers to motivation and usage, and be culturally targeted to this population. It will also be tailored to patients' unique sleep patterns, adjusting recommendations based on automatically gathered objective sleep data via actigraphs (unobtrusive wrist-worn devices). Lastly, we will test this intervention for acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy (Aim 3). Thus, this project will address a health disparity for a distressing quality of life issue in a large and growing population. Mentorship Team. Each member of the mentorship team has external funding, including eight R01s between the five mentors. The team has excellent publication and mentorship track records. Collaborations with this esteemed mentorship team will result in 3-4 publications per year (2-3 first-authored). Environmental and Institutional Commitment. The research environment, facilities, and resources at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey are ideal for career development in cancer survivorship disparities research. Numerous training opportunities are available across campus. I will carry out my K01 activities as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Division of Population Science with strong institutional commitment, including from Associate Director for Population Science Dr. Sharon Manne. Conclusions. Cancer-related sleep disturbance is a common and distressing survivorship issue. African American breast cancer survivors are at urgent need for a culturally targeted intervention that addresses the factors that make cancer-related sleep disturbance different from primary insomnia. In the proposed sequential mixed methods study, I will develop a new, tailored, mHealth, and culturally targeted intervention for cancer-related sleep disturbance in African American breast cancer survivors. The use of mHealth methods will ensure wide disseminability. The K01 award period will culminate in a R01 proposal. The K01 mentored career development award will support my transition to independence and position me as an expert in reducing cancer health disparities in cancer survivorship."
"9382112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, established in 1984, proposes to continue and expand its research into the underpinnings of Alzheimer's and related dementias with 5 major goals. First, we will focus on the earliest stages of the disease process, when symptoms and signs are subtle, or even undetectable, by bringing to bear an integrated multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists. Second, we will continue to provide critical infrastructure and resources to support Alzheimer disease and dementia related research across a range of institutions including Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard School of Public Health as well as supporting national initiatives. Third, we will innovate with technical developmental projects in each Core, targeting the boundaries of cognitive ageing and disease. Fourth, we are committed to mentoring, educating, and developing future leaders through formal training or mentoring programs in each Core. Fifth, we continue to reach out to the surrounding community in order to communicate the urgency of understanding this devastating disease, and to enhance recruitment of a diverse pool of subjects and patients for critical studies. These broad aims are distributed among the mandated Administration, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology and Outreach Cores, along with a new Neuroimaging Core. Each Core provides support for, and helps catalyze, the MADRC's mission, including active participation in national programs (e.g. NACC, ADNI, ADCS, ADGC, DIAN), more than 40 local clinical initiatives, and pilot projects. Three small R01 style projects leverage these Cores and are designed to marry cutting edge science with the clinical programs. Project 1, led by a new junior investigator, Dr Hedden, uses state-of-the art fMRI and Connectome techniques (a new technology that illuminates white matter pathways) as well as quantitative structural MRI approaches to study the neural system basis of the earliest cognitive impairments. Project 2, led by Dr Gomez-Isla (a senior investigator recruited to our Center in the current grant period) combines resources with 5 other ADCs to define the neuropathological phenotype of individuals who are amyloid imaging-positive and cognitively normal. Project 3, led by Dr Hyman, explores a new transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease that develops tangles in entorhinal cortex and widespread plaques and compares it to human neuropathological samples - to examine experimentally the neural system biology of this early point in the disease process. Together these efforts are aimed at targeting early disease phenotypes - as national efforts towards early intervention and prevention strategies unfold. Along with parallel ongoing multidisciplinary studies of established dementias, we believe the MADRC has made, and is well positioned to continue to make, strong contributions to Alzheimer research."

Because of its central role in biological circuits and the potential for therapeutic intervention, the Ub system is an intense research area. Yet, Ub biology is highly complex?in humans it is supported by over 500 Ub ligases and 95 deubiquitinases. Currently, this complexity and our limited understanding of players and their interactions are a severe hindrance for targeted intervention in many diseases. Considering all possible ways to address the complexity, sample multiplexing in mass spectrometry-based proteomics arguably has the greatest potential to fundamentally revolutionize the throughput of these measurements. Through efforts within the previous grant cycle, the level of multiplexing was increased, facilitating the quantitative comparison of expression and conjugate levels for 10 samples. In this proposal, enabling advances in sample multiplexing will be explored and applied to study ubiquitin-dependent biology. In Aim 1, we will evaluate isobaric reagents that have multiple reporter ions such that a 16- and a 32-plex reagent set can be synthesized using relatively few heavy atoms (4 and 6, respectively). In Aim 2, two large obstacles to sample multiplexing will be addressed?sensitivity and proteome depth. Using a real-time database search algorithm, reporter ion quantification scans (SPS-MS3 scans) will only be collected when the MS2 scan is successfully matched to a peptide or PTM-containing peptide. This will be a very disruptive technology as MS2 scans are recorded at a blistering rate of 22 Hz. Highly optimized MS3 scans will then be collected based on any filter desired since the identity and modification state of all peptides will be known in real time. We expect dramatic improvements in the quality and depth of discovery proteomics experiments while reducing the analysis time by at least 3 fold.  In Aim 3, we will explore two new multiplexing workflows based on the technologies developed in the first two aims. One workflow will be dedicated to targeted proteomics where up to 32-plex experiments targeting hundreds of peptides will be developed. In these assays, triggering peptides and a real-time database search will obviate the need for retention time scheduling or precursor detection in survey scans prior to MS3 analysis using pre-selected SPS ions. Using panels of trigger peptides, assays to monitor the protein levels in six ubiquitin-dependent pathways will be created. The second workflow will be dedicated to discovery proteomics where up to 32-plex experiments will be conducted for full proteome or conjugate analysis in as little as 24 hr. This will be applied to characterize CRISPR deletions in the mTOR amino acid sensing pathway and specifically the mechanism of action of the GATOR2 complex where 3 ubiquitin ligases of unknown function are present. The realization of all three aims ushers in a paradigm shift in Quantitative Proteomics where hundreds to thousands of samples can be accurately compared across entire proteomes or in targeted assays in a matter of days or weeks using up to 32-plex reagent sets and real-time database searching."
"9267953","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine (DA) signaling in the CNS is essential for modulating complex behaviors such as movement, cognition, reward, and motivation. Aberrant DAergic transmission is directly linked to Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and addiction. The plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) is central to DAergic signaling, and both limits extracellular DA availability and maintains presynaptic DA stores. Importantly, DAT is the primary target for both addictive and therapeutic psychoactive drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), and the antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin), all of which competitively inhibit DAT activity. A wealth of data supports the premise that DAT constitutively traffics to and from the cell surface, and that protein kinase C (PKC) activation rapidly decreases DAT cell surface expression by acutely modulating DAT trafficking rates. While some progress has been made investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern regulated DAT trafficking, a detailed understanding of this complex process has yet to be achieved. Further, the physiological relevance that DAT trafficking imposes onto DAergic function is poorly understood. Our laboratory reported that neuronal GTPase, Rin (RIT2), specifically binds to the DAT carboxy terminus and is required for PKC-stimulated DAT internalization. In the proposed studies, I plan to investigate the molecular underpinnings required for DAT/Rin interactions, and how these interactions potentially mediate synergy between cytosolic DAT domains. Aim 1 studies will use co-immunoprecipitations and FRET microscopy approaches with chimeric DAT proteins to define the intracellular DAT domains that are necessary and sufficient to confer DAT/Rin interactions. Chimeric and point mutant transporters will further reveal the potential synergistic requirement of DAT amino- and carboxy-termini for PKC-stimulated DAT internalization. Aim 2 studies will directly test the potential role of Rin-mediated DAT trafficking in DAergic behaviors in vivo, using cell-specific, AAV2-mediated Rin knockdown in DAergic terminal regions. Taken together, these studies will provide the first investigations that directly examine how DAT trafficking potentially impacts rewarding behavior. Moreover, completion of this investigative line will provide me with outstanding training in molecular and behavioral neuroscience."
"9257947","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Chronic  cocaine  exposure  causes  maladaptive  neuroplasticity  in  brain  reward  circuitry  that  leads  to  compulsive  drug  use,  loss  of  control  over  intake,  and  vulnerability  to  relapse,  even  after  protracted  abstinence. Initial drug reward is mediated by the nucleus accumbens in the ventral striatum, and early  goal-­?directed  drug  intake  is  dependent  on  this  structure.  As  drug  use  transitions  from  goal-­?directed  to  compulsive, there is a corresponding anatomical transition from dependence on the ventral striatum to  dorsal  striatum  habit  circuitry.  MicroRNAs  (miRNA)  are  small  (~21-­?23  nucleotide)  non-­?coding  RNA  sequences  that  regulate  mRNA  stability  and  translation  by  complementary  binding  to  the  3?  UTR  of  the  mRNA.  Each  miRNA  can  regulate  the  binding  of  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  mRNA.  Our  lab  has  previously  identified  that  miR-­?212  regulates  cocaine  intake  under  extended  access  conditions,  but  not  during  restricted  access.  Specifically,  overexpressing  miR-­?212  in  the  dorsal  striatum  decreases  cocaine  intake during 6-­?hour self-­?administration sessions, whereas using a knocking down miR-­?212 in this region  augments cocaine intake in rats. The precise cellular mechanism of action of miR-­?212 is not known. The  dorsal  striatum  is  primarily  composed  of  medium  spiny  neurons  (MSNs;  95%  of  cells),  which  can  be  further  broken  down  by  their  receptor  composition  and  anatomical  projections.  Dopamine  D1  receptor  (DRD1)  expressing  neurons  form  a  direct  pathway  that  innervates  the  substantia  nigra  (striatonigral  pathway), and neurons expressing the D2 receptor and the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) project to the  pallidum (striatopallidal pathway). These cell populations have opposite contributions to tasks involving  movement, and more notably reward, such as cocaine conditioned place preference. This proposal seeks  to  examine  the  contributions  of  miR-­?212  specifically  in  each  of  these  two  cell  populations  in  order  to  elucidate  its  mechanism  of  action  in  regulating  cocaine  seeking.  To  do  this,  in  aim  1  I  will  use  novel  genetically  modified  mice  to  create  conditional  knockouts  of  miR-­?212  in  either  DRD1-­?expressing  MSNs,  or  in  A2AR-­?expressing  MSNs.  These  mice  will  be  tested  under  either  restricted  or  extended  access  to  cocaine, and the contribution of miR-­?212 during each of these phases will be assessed.  In aim 2, I will use  a novel high throughput screening following crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-­?CLIP) technique to  examine mRNA targets of miR-­?212 specifically in striatonigral vs striatopallidal neurons. Together, these  aims  will  provide  me  with  excellent  training  in  mouse  genetics  and  behavioral  models,  as  well  as  advanced  RNA  biochemistry  and  large  high  throughput  screening  data  sets,  including  bioinformatics  analysis of such data sets. "
"9330461","Project Summary/ Abstract Despite evidence that physical activities (PA) targeting leg strength and balance reduce falls, less than 12% of older adults engage in these activities on a regular basis and fall rates continue to increase. Research examining intervention strategies that motivate older adults to engage in PA is scarce and inconclusive. The proposed research aims to address this gap in fall prevention science. The objective of this proposal is to identify behavioral change strategies that elicit increased PA, sustained for 12 months and, in turn, lead to a reduction in falls and improved quality of life (QOL). Building on prior research, the proposed study will use a factorial experimental design to test the relative influence of behavioral change strategies separated into two components. These components are comprised of distinct sets of behavior change strategies that represent two different ways of motivating people to take action: inter-personal and intra-personal, consistent with theories of behavioral change and life-span development, as well as empirical evidence. These components will be combined with core intervention content that includes Otago, an evidence-based, fall-reducing PA protocol, and a PA-monitor for self-tracking. We will recruit 308 community-dwelling adults > 70 years old and randomly assign them to one of four conditions: (a) Otago + PA-monitor; (b) Otago + PA-monitor + inter- personal component; (c) Otago + PA-monitor + intra-personal component; and (d) Otago + PA-monitor + inter-personal + intra-personal components. Content within all conditions will be delivered over 8 weeks to small groups in community centers. We will re-assess all participants post-intervention: immediately, 6 months and 12 months to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of the intervention components. We hypothesize that participants receiving the inter-personal component, relative to participants not receiving this component, will have a) clinically meaningful increases in PA at all 3 follow-up time points; and b) reductions in falls and improved quality of life 12 months post-intervention. We will also explore the effects of intervention components on targeted mechanisms, motivational constructs (social support; readiness; self- regulation) and physical markers of fall risk (functional balance and strength), and whether these mechanisms are associated with PA and fall outcomes. We hypothesize that receiving the inter-personal motivational component, relative to not receiving this component, will elicit increases in motivational constructs and physical markers of fall risk, which will mediate the intervention?s effects on PA and falls. The proposed research is innovative, because it represents a substantive expansion of biomechanically-oriented fall-reducing PA protocols to a) examine which behavioral change strategies elicit sustained effects (e.g., 12 months) on increased PA, as well as on falls, and QOL; and b) explore underlying mechanisms of PA and falls. The long-term intent of the proposed research is to optimize a PA intervention for older adults that can be used by community-based organizations to promote PA, reduce falls, and improve QOL."
"9276942","Project Summary/Abstract There has been a significant decline in the number of research psychiatrists and research fellowships for psychiatrists in the past two decades (Fenton et al. 2004, Pincus et al. 2005). To address this gap, it is critically important to provide early research training in psychiatry residency. Such training (a) promotes research literacy for all trainees, (b) encourages future participation of clinicians as research collaborators, (c) provides experience that can foster choosing a research career, (d) expands clinical knowledge through the formulation of patient-oriented research questions, (e) attracts medical students into psychiatry training, and (f) maintains and facilitates research interest among residents with investigative backgrounds (IOM 2003). In response to this need, investigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Department of Psychiatry and McLean Hospital collaborated with the leadership of the MGH-McLean General Adult Psychiatry residency to develop a Research Concentration Program (RCP) within the residency training program. The goal of the RCP is to prepare residents for careers as investigators in academic psychiatry by facilitating greater exposure to research activities and training during residency. Through its first federally funded period, the RCP has been successful in attracting and recruiting talented psychiatrist-scientists and has developed an effective research education program. We have developed a well-coordinated research education program with appropriate infrastructure that has attracted clinician-scientists to careers in psychiatry and provided them both mentorship and research experience to prepare them for an independent investigator career in psychiatry and neuroscience following residency. The ongoing specific aims of this competitive renewal application for the research education training program are to: (1) attract and train excellent residents to become future psychiatrist-investigators in basic, translational, and patient-oriented research, by integrating core research and clinical didactic programming, as well as clinical and research rotations, during the four years of residency training; (2) provide dedicated time and training for research over the course of the four-year adult psychiatry residency training program; (3) increase the number of residents who benefit from the research education program; (4) broaden and deepen the research education program by providing greater and more intensive training in research literacy to all residents in the residency training program; (5) provide seed funding for pilot research projects designed by the residents enrolled in the RCP; and (6) partner with training programs within MGH and McLean Hospitals as well as the Harvard Catalyst, the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC), so that all residents will benefit from the CTSC educational resources. Newly developed specific aims for this competitive renewal application are to (1) create an NIH K award grant writing and review program to facilitate an accelerated path to national level funding; and (2) create five research training tracks within the RCP with specific training curricula to build the residents' research skill set."
"9316844","Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke, and in general it must be administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Because of this time constraint, as well as dangers associated with this drug, it is estimated that only about 5- 10% of stroke patients are treated with tPA. There is thus a significant need for new and effective approaches to treat stroke. It is now clear that the complement system plays an important role in the propagation of inflammation and injury following cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (ischemic stroke), and the overall goal of this project is to develop and characterize a novel, effective and safe strategy of site-targeted complement inhibition that can be applied several hours after stroke, and that will improve long-term cognitive and functional recovery. To identify the most effective complement inhibitory approach, we will prepare and characterize various complement inhibitors that block different parts of the complement pathway and that are targeted to the site of ischemic brain injury via a novel approach. The constructs will be investigated using a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, and we will investigate the effect of our constructs on cerebral injury, repair and neuroregeneration, and acute and chronic cognitive and motor function outcomes. Following identification of the optimum type of complement inhibitory construct, we will complete a series of pre-clinical determinations that will assist in future drug development. These studies will include PK and PD determinations, dose response, treatment window, dosing schedule, and effect in young and aged mice (since the risk of stroke increases with age). Finally, we will investigate our strategy of complement inhibition in the context of tPA therapy to determine whether there are any adverse effects associated with co-administration of the two pharmacological reagents."
"9352672","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been historically evaluated by consumption-based outcomes, such as the percentage of days abstinent from alcohol (PDA). There are many advantages of alcohol consumption as a primary outcome, given that it is easily quantified (e.g., via standard drinks) and because alcohol consumption is inherently associated with AUD. However, researchers, clients, and treatment providers have all agreed that the process of recovering from AUD involves more than consumption alone (e.g., Donovan et al., 2005; Kaskutas et al., 2014; Neale et al., 2015). Recent efforts have called for a shift away from defining consumption as the marker of AUD treatment success (Witkiewitz, 2013a), given that defining treatment success primarily by amount of consumption often fails to adequately portray the recovery process (e.g., Donovan et al., 2012; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2012; Tiffany et al., 2012). Yet, efforts to move toward including non-consumption outcome measures have been stymied for two primary reasons. First, it is assumed that consumption measures are more sensitive and, therefore, consumption must be used as a surrogate measure for more clinically meaningful non- consumption measures (FDA, 2015, p. 2). Second, research is needed to direct researchers toward the best gold standard measures to use among AUD populations and studies of measurement invariance over time of these measures are largely non-existent. The aims of the proposed study will address these two concerns via secondary data analysis of two of the largest AUD treatment research studies conducted in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH (Anton et al., 2006; Project MATCH Research Group, 1997). The present study will examine the sensitivity and specificity (Aim 1), as well as the reliability, validity, and measurement invariance (Aim 2), of non-consumption measures available in the COMBINE study and Project MATCH. The non-consumption outcome variables to be examined are consistent with the variables identified as important to researchers, clients and their loved ones, and treatment providers: 1) alcohol-related problems, 2) mental health, 3) craving/temptation, 4) psychosocial functioning/quality of life, 5) physical health, 6) financial status, and 7) self-efficacy. Sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated using Receiver Operatin Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses (Hanley & McNeil, 1982) predicting outcome data from immediately post- and 12-month post-treatment for: 1) abstinence, 2) no heavy drinking days (Falk et al., 2010), 3) the World Health Organization risky drinking levels (European Medicines Agency, 2010), and 4) a composite clinical outcome defined by consumption and alcohol-related problems (Cisler & Zweben, 1999). Reliability, validity, and measurement invariance will be assessed using latent variable modeling approaches. The two aims of this study will address longstanding and untested assumptions that have prevented researchers from shifting toward more clinically meaningful definitions of treatment success that include non-consumption outcomes."
"9248791","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and remains a largely intractable disease. Nearly all cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC) are characterized by activating mutations in the Kras gene. Attempts at pharmacological inhibition of Kras and its downstream signaling effectors in PDAC have so far been unsuccessful. Cancer cell metabolism has become a new area of interest for the development of targeted therapies. Through activation of various signaling pathways, oncogenic Kras induces a metabolic transformation that makes pancreatic cancer cells more reliant on glycolysis and less reliant on mitochondria-based metabolism. The proposed study focuses on Nix, a protein involved in mitochondrial maintenance and turnover, which might be responsible for the metabolic transformation seen in Kras-mutant cells. Our preliminary studies show that Nix is upregulated at the RNA and protein levels in murine pancreatic tumors. Additionally, ablation of Nix or Kras leads to a decrease in the number of mitochondria and the proliferative capacity of Kras-mutant, but not Kras wild-type, cancer cells. These results suggest the exciting possibility that Nix might be a legitimate drug target for the treatment of Kras-mutant pancreatic cancer. The proposed study will further elucidate the role of Nix in pancreatic cancer using genetically engineered mouse models and a novel pancreatic ductal organoid culture system. First, we will evaluate the metabolic consequences of Nix ablation using the organoid system. For the first time in vitro, this system will allow us to compare the metabolic phenotype of normal, pre-neoplastic and neoplastic pancreatic cells expressing or lacking Nix. Second, we will determine the role of Nix in pancreatic tumor intiation and maintenance using genetically engineered mouse models and an orthotopically transplanted organoid mouse model (respectively). We have crossed mice expressing a conditional Nix allele into our KPC mouse model, characterized by pancreas- specific expression of mutant Kras and mutant p53, to study the effects of Nix on pancreatic tumorigenesis. To study PDAC maintenance, we will transplant organoids infected with inducible short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Nix into the pancreata of wildtype mice. These shRNAs will be induced after tumor formation in vivo to assess the effects of Nix knockdown on tumor maintenance. Results from these studies will not only validate the legitimacy of Nix as a suitable drug target for pancreatic cancer, but will also elucidate the role of Nix in the metaboli transformation of pancreatic cancer to provide a better understanding of this therapeutic target."

"9461972","Rural children, like those in Vermont and northern New York, are underrepresented in pediatric clinical trials. The University of Vermont (UVM) serves a large catchment area in this region, where children receive primary medical care in community-based primary care practices and specialty care at UVM Children's Hospital. We have a strong referral base and established collaborations with primary care practices throughout the region and across subspecialty practices. This will enable access to pediatric clinical trials through the ISPCTN for all children in our area, including underserved and minority populations. The objective of this proposal is to expand the infrastructure and expertise in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials at UVM, in order to address disparities and improve access to clinical trials in rural, underserved areas. UVM is committed to becoming an integral component of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN), and will advance the goals of the network through the following specific aims: 1. UVM will establish a comprehensive pediatric clinical trials site within the ISPCTN. In collaboration with the ISPCTN, UVM will build a strong foundation by training a core team and establish the infrastructure to initiate and maintain a pediatric clinical trials center. This award will support a team that will subsequently build and enhance collaborative opportunities in multi- center ISPCTN pediatric clinical trials. 2. Through training, mentoring, and participation in ISPCTN trials, we will expand local expertise in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials in the UVM Network. Health Care Professionals/faculty, coordinators, and data management personnel will be strategically trained to conduct pediatric clinical trials. An ongoing program of courses, staff training, and mentoring by the core team (developed in aim 1) will be established to carefully expand a well-trained team who will serve pediatric clinical trials throughout our network. Our clinical investigators, nurses, support staff, and data managers will develop next-generation expertise through experience and specific mentoring and training. 3. UVM will enhance access for rural, underserved, and minority children in VT and northern NY to pediatric clinical trials through ISPCTN participation, with the goal of improving the health of all children. By building a comprehensive outreach program and a confidential registry of available participants for ISPCTN clinical trials, we will assure access to state-of-the art clinical trials for rural, underserved, and minority children of VT and northern NY that will have a meaningful impact on the health of all children. Metrics for enrollment of underserved populations will be established. Our outreach program will leverage our existing relationships and collaborations with rural networks of health providers and patients to offer participation in pediatric clinical trials.

"9248865","PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiple genetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset for AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD for individuals with 2 copies of the apoE4 allele (~2% of the population) is ~70% by the age of 85. By comparison, the lifetime AD risk estimate for individuals with two copies of the apoE3 allele is ~10% by the age of 85. Although many of the apoE4 homozygotes develop early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), some of them (~20%) stay asymptomatic over age 85. Understanding the susceptibility of the former group and the resistance of the latter group to AD might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay AD in people at risk. Like AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. About 20-50% of FTD cases are inherited, and heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are one of the most common causes of the inherited forms of FTD. However, homozygous PGRN mutations unexpectedly cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) rather than FTD. Understanding how the same mutation within a single PGRN gene causes different phenotypes depending on gene dose is crucial for unraveling the pathogenesis of both FTD and NCL and for their therapeutic developments. Because neurons cannot be obtained directly from patients, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from AD or FTD patients hold great promise as in vitro models for studying disease pathogenesis in human neurons. This proposal aims to capitalize on this promise by building on our previous efforts to generate a well- characterized repository of human iPSC (hiPSC) lines from AD and FTD patients and, by using them, to study disease phenotypes, reveal novel mechanisms, and identify new therapeutic targets. The goals of this project are to address the following two questions: (1) why are many apoE4 homozygotes vulnerable to AD pathogenesis at young ages when others (~20%) can stay asymptomatic by age 85 and over? (2) How do heterozygous and homozygous mutations within a single PGRN gene cause different clinical phenotypes, i.e., FTD and NCL, respectively? To answer these questions, we will compare the phenotypic differences (e.g., A? production/secretion and tau phosphorylation/fragmentation) among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 1); determine the transcriptomic and proteomic differences among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 2); and explore the underlying mechanisms by which heterozygous PGRN mutations cause FTD but homozygous PGRN mutations cause NCL (Aim 3). These studies should significantly accelerate AD and FTD research and related therapeutic development by enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels."
"9289078","Dementia is a common and greatly feared condition associated with aging. In the United States, the prevalence of dementia is expected to nearly triple to 13 million persons by 2050. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a risk factor for dementia, is also rapidly increasing. Emerging data suggests the first line treatment for T2DM, metformin, may decrease dementia risk. In animal models, metformin improves memory and appears to protect against dementia. If this finding is established in humans, it could inform clinical decisions including how early in the course of diabetes to initiate metformin and whether to continue metformin when patients transition to insulin. However, definitive data are lacking. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not been conducted to study whether metformin prevents dementia in humans. It would be premature to conduct an RCT given the current state of the literature and the high cost and long follow-up time required. Inconsistent results from extant observational studies may be due to inadequate control for confounding.  The current proposal uses rich electronic health data resources from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and Group Health (GH), an integrated healthcare system in the Northwest United States, to conduct a rigorous retrospective cohort study of the association between metformin use and incident dementia. We will use electronic health records (EHR) to identify a cohort of about 100,000 VA patients and 20,000 GH patients who have T2DM and are free of dementia and not taking diabetes medications at baseline. We will use a new user design and state of the art analytic methods including propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for potential confounding factors including diabetes severity. The long observation periods (17 years in VA and 20 years in GH) will ensure adequate power. The rich EHR data including diagnoses, procedures, laboratory and vital signs measures will enable us to control for many potential confounding factors such as hemoglobin A1c levels, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and the use of concomitant medications. The primary analysis will use VA data, and findings will be replicated using GH data; independent replication in two unique large healthcare systems will improve the validity of our findings. We will address the following specific aims: 1. Compare risk of dementia in people initiating metformin for T2DM versus those initiating a sulfonylurea. 2. Compare risk of dementia in people initiating metformin vs. those delaying initial pharmacologic therapy, 3. Determine if the metformin ? dementia association varies by age groups (50-65 vs. >65 years of age) and by gender. Exploratory analysis will investigate metformin dose and duration and risk of dementia. By using the same measures and methods to replicate results in very different patient populations, we will generate the strongest evidence to date regarding metformin?s potential to reduce risk of dementia. Results will inform provider-patient discussions about metformin use and could guide design of a subsequent, efficient RCT that targets people most likely to benefit from metformin."
"9249072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropathic pain (phantom limb pain) after traumatic amputation is a common problem. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain are not well understood, though several mechanisms were proposed in the past. Our recent research findings suggest central sensitization as a plausible mechanism mediating phantom pain after traumatic amputation. We have recently developed a non-pharmacological intervention - Breathing-controlled electrical stimulation (BreEStim) for neuropathic pain management. This novel non- pharmacological intervention is found to result in central desensitization according to our recent studies in healthy pain-free subjects. The goal of this proposal is to explore the effectiveness of BreEStim via its central desensitization in phantom limb pain in patients after traumatic limb amputation. It is therefore hypothesized that BreEStim could provide non- pharmacological analgesic effects for patients with chronic phantom limb pain after traumatic amputation via central desensitization effects. Specific Aim 1: To compare analgesic effects on phantom pain between BreEStim and EStim. It is hypothesized that BreEStim has better analgesic effect than EStim, and the analgesic effect is accompanied by elevated electrical pain thresholds. Specific Aim 2: To examine the dose-response effect of BreEStim on phantom limb pain It is hypothesized that there is a dose-response analgesic effect of BreEStim, i.e., an increased dose of BreEStim will have a greater impact on reduction of phantom limb pain. At the completion of this project, the findings will provide evidence that BreEStim is likely to be effective for management of phantom limb pain after traumatic amputation. The findings will also provide the basis for future mechanistic studies, such as imaging studies and endorphin measurement, particularly regarding differential management of affective component of neuropathic pain with electrical stimulation."

GN2 includes new code for comparative and translational analysis of eQTL data sets and network graphs. In this grant we extend GN2 in four specific ways: far more capable data entry and export APIs and workflows, QC, and simulation routines (Aim 1); new high performance tools for the analysis of complex cross populations, comparative and translational analysis of systems genetics data sets (Aim 2), a new plug-in application programming interface (API) architecture with backend use of GPU web service systems (Aim 3), and statistical methods for correlated high dimensional data and predictive Bayesian modelling (Aim 4). We anticipate that this open and scalable architecture and modular code will become a core resource for both molecular biologists and data scientists, particularly those working in predictive modeling and precision medicine. All members of our team work closely with the systems genetics community and are training the next generation of young scientists interested in scalable integrative models of disease risk and treatment."

"9378836","?PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control ? Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities ? Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials."
"9264607","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal requesting support for the pathogen free, pedigreed and genomically characterized Vervet Research Colony (VRC). For the past five years the VRC has responded vigorously to an increased demand for VRC resources, including the distribution of 404 animals to the national research community and more than 100 in just the prior year. Future demand is projected to be strong owing to increased use of vervets for vaccine development, cardiometabolic disorders, and dementia studies, and because of substantial difficulties surrounding the international transportation of monkeys for research, including those from the Caribbean. The genomic sequencing of all individuals in the VRC and the resulting genomic resources now provides investigators the opportunity to apply modern systems biology to the study of disease pathobiology and to the development of new therapies and interventions for the chronic, degenerative, and infectious disorders posing the greatest risks to public health. The development of the genomic resource and updating of the pedigree continues to involve a strong collaboration with investigators from UCLA, who have partnered with Wake Forest scientists for more than a decade. As a national, multicategorical research resource, the VRC provides access to well-characterized monkeys for research on- or off site, including investigations focused on the nutritional context. The three specific aims for the VRC for the next grant period are: 1) to ensure both a minimum of 85 pathogen-free, genomically characterized vervets to the national biomedical community and the accompanying data and tissue repositories required to facilitate the systematic study of human disease and therapies; 2) to enhance the VRC's translational value by developing data and tissue repositories from controlled, repeated assessments while consuming a `Western' vs. usual laboratory chow diet, thereby providing a relevant nutritional context for understanding chronic disease risk and facilitating `omic' approaches to the study of animals across the lifespan; and 3) to continue providing the VRC as a platform for training veterinarians and other professionals in biomedical research, husbandry, clinical care, and the management of animal resources. It is important to note that the data and tissue repositories are enriched by regular collection and assay of blood, muscle, fat, and CSF; other collections, including liver, bone, and multimodal imaging (PET, MRI, CT, DXA, MEG) are available on request. To encourage maximum use of the resource and associated repositories, the VRC investigators engage in a program of scientific outreach that includes an annual national symposium, a pilot study program, a website, and a regular newsletter. The funds supporting scientific outreach are provided entirely by the Wake Forest School of Medicine. The VRC also engages in community outreach, focused largely on students in grades 4 - 12 and their teachers."
"9248837","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by extracellular plaques formed by the deposition of amyloid-? (A?) peptide and intracellular tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated forms of the tau protein. Gliosis and inflammation are associated with areas of heavy pathology and likely play a key role in shaping disease progression. Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are increasingly recognized for their critical roles in the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The strongest genetic risk factor for both AD and CAA is ?4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, but recently the TREM2 locus was identified as a risk factor for AD with the most significantly associated coding variant as rs75932628 (encoding R47H) with an odds ratio rivaling that of APOE. Because human and mouse Trem2 differ by ~25% at the amino acid level, we aim to create novel knock-in mouse lines that express normal human TREM2 or the TREM2-R47H variant in place of the endogenous mouse Trem2 locus. Characterizing these novel lines along with our existing Trem2-/- mouse line either at baseline or upon immune stimulation will allow us to fundamentally answer whether the TREM2-R47H variant functions as a loss of function or gain of function. Additionally, we have recently found that TREM2 can serve as a receptor for lipoproteins. These mice will be critical in developing new therapeutics that target TREM2 in the context of neurodegeneration and in testing the functional effects of lipoprotein binding to normal vs R47H variant of TREM2."
"9314865","Abstract for Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Hypertension is prevalent among older adults. Hypertension increases risk for stroke and myocardial infarction, and can result in end organ damage to the kidneys, retina and brain. Medication adherence is critically important to prevent the deleterious effects of hypertension; yet, adherence is often calculated at only 50%. We developed and tested the Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention (MPMI), a behavioral intervention, using theories of prospective memory and aging to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. The MPMI was tested among older adults (? 65 years of age) and improved adherence by 35%. The MPMI was efficacious over the short term, but after an additional 5 months without the ongoing presence of the interventionists, adherence declined. The purpose of the current study is to create an evidence-based smartphone application and companion website in order to provide continuous use of the efficacious strategies to sustain adherence. We are at an exciting time since among persons with hypertension the potential benefits of improved health can be achieved through improved adherence. The recent SPRINT study (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) supports improved outcomes (lower fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause) by targeting a lower systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg compared to using the previously recommended guideline of 140 mm Hg.2 These outcomes will not be achieved unless we can help people take their medications as prescribed and as intended. Specifically using iterative usability, cognitive walk-through and heuristic evaluation, we will build, test and modify a mobile application (App) and companion website, the Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM). Mobile devices are ubiquitous and can be leveraged to capture the prospective memory strategies and improve adherence. The development of the MEDSReM will be based on the strategies from the MPMI, human factors in aging, preferences, needs and requirements of older adults taking medications using technology and iterative testing to assure usability for older adults. The strategies will be translated to technology and add decision support. Decision support will provide the patient with assistance in taking medications if they have missed a dose. A decision tree will be created with knowledge of pharmacotherapeutic and pharmacokinetics based on the patient's medication time to peak, duration and half-life properties to determine a safe interval for taking missed doses. The final MEDSReM will include a website that can easily be accessed with links in the App for educational support and ongoing coaching. Taking a human factors approach to inform the preferences, needs and requirements for technological support to take medications as intended, and iterative testing for usability of the App and website among older adults, will result in a superior product for the mobile App and website and improve health outcomes. This final product will be field tested and consequent improvement in adherence assessed."
"9317915","Project Summary Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 2 per million in North America (just over 600 new diagnoses in the United States each year). The large majority of cases may be caused by autoimmune destruction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); accordingly SAA can be treated and often cured by either immune suppression therapy (IST) or marrow replacement through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) is considered the standard for initial therapy of younger, newly diagnosed patients with long-term survival rates of up to 95-100% in patients under 20. However, only 20% of patients will have matched family donors, consequently, the large majority of patients receive IST for initial therapy. We propose a pilot study at eight pediatric centers comparing up front matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT with IST for children and very young adults with SAA. The pilot study will assess key feasibility issues with the clinical design including acceptance of randomization, timely acquisition of donors, and safety of HSCT. In addition, we will test the feasibility of acquiring, shipping and processing key biological specimens obtained from patients located at institutions across the country that will allow us in the future to elucidate the immunologic phenotype and genomic landscape of the marrow, and to understand the mechanisms of response and toxicity. This pilot study will lead to a paradigm shifting phase III trial to be carried out in 27 institutions nationwide where we will test our hypotheses that initial therapy with MUD HSCT will lead to improved immune suppression-free survival with superior hematopoietic recovery by 2 years from diagnosis, and will also result in a decrease in the high risk of late progression to MDS/AML. Success of this pilot study and the subsequent phase III trial is strengthened by the joint effort between two strong, established consortia: the North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium (NAPAAC) and the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC)."

"9351735","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that can cause cognitive impairment (CI). Physical interventions, such as continuous positive airway pressure, may help to prevent OSA, but the discomfort of wearing such a device during sleep hinders its practical use. This limitation highlights the clinical importance of pharmaceutical interventions that can prevent OSA or its major sequelae. In this study, we will test and validate animal models that are susceptible to OSA-triggered CI and will determine the efficacy of a novel compound in preventing this CI in a relevant mouse model.  OSA does not cause CI in every patient; rather, it occurs in only one-quarter of the susceptible patients. Although it is unclear what may lead to the development of this subgroup of patients susceptible to CI, we recently discovered that G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 (GRK5) deficiency does so in mice. In fact, GRK5 deficiency makes the subjects susceptible to CI that is triggered not only by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) or OSA but also by mutant human ?-amyloid (A?) precursor protein (APP) and aging. The underlying mechanisms are a series of cascading events that all begin with a selectively impaired M2 muscarinic receptor desensitization that is caused by the loss or deficiency of GRK5. Omitting much of the detail, the high selectivity on M2 receptors limits the entire impact on the cholinergic system, which includes not only the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons but also the postsynaptic cholinoceptive neurons that are widely distributed in the hippocampus as well. The actual impact of GRK5 deficiency on the cholinergic system is to rather inconspicuously make the cholinergic and cholinoceptive neurons vulnerable, which invites secondary degenerative insults such as A? or CIH to trigger neurodegeneration. Owing to the high selectivity of GRK5 deficiency on M2 receptors, a selective M2 blockade was found to be highly effective in preventing the cascading events. In this regard, CN158 is a novel M2 selective antagonist (patent pending) that outperforms other known M2 antagonists. Moreover, it had outstanding pharmacological properties in our preliminary in vivo studies and therefore will be tested in this project.  We hypothesize that CIH-triggered CI is more likely to occur in GRK5-deficient subjects and that an M2 blockade by CN158 can effectively prevent CIH-triggered CI and the underlying neurodegeneration in the BF cholinergic and hippocampal cholinoceptive neurons in GRK5-deficient mice. We will address our hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1. To verify whether GRK5 deficiency leads to susceptibility to CIH-triggered CI and the underlying neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system, we will expose GRK5-deficient mice to various CIH conditions before assessing their behavioral and neuropathological changes.  Aim 2. To determine whether M2 blockade by CN158 effectively prevents CIH-triggered CI and the degeneration of the cholinergic system, we will treat GRK5-deficient mice exposed to an optimal CIH condition with CN158 and a known M2 antagonist control (anthranilamide derivative 23) in a randomized trial with the same behavioral and neuropathological analyses used in Aim 1.  The success of this project is expected to establish empirical evidence that CIH-triggered CI in GRK5-deficient subjects is pharmaceutically preventable and that CN158 may serve as a lead compound in fulfilling such a purpose."
"9282978","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this U01 application is to develop novel approaches for multiscale modeling in cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia research. To accomplish this goal, we will use innovative combinations of experimental and computational studies at multiple spatial scales and across multiple conceptual scales. Because cardiac cells are complex systems involving dozens of interacting molecular entities, mathematical modeling has long been a valuable technique for uncovering arrhythmia mechanisms. However, established methods for combining modeling with experiments have important limitations, including: (1) most studies test only a limited number of model predictions; (2) models usually predict the response of a sample considered representative of a population, thereby ignoring differences between individuals; and (3) tissue-level simulations may incorporate physiological differences between regions but do not account for the fact that each cell in the tissue is different. We will address these limitations using innovative and synergistic computational and experimental methodologies developed by the PIs. These methods allow for rigorous parameter estimation, systematic and quantitative predictions, and testing multiple perturbations in each experimental sample, and quantitative mappings between different cell types. To achieve our overall goals, we propose to:  1. improve heart cell models through rigorous experimental testing and the development of mathematical  models specific to each cell studied.  2. calibrate models of heterogeneous cell populations and experimentally test predictions regarding ionic  current variation and co-variation across populations  3. develop models to predict the effects of perturbations in one species based on recordings made in a  different species  4. predict how variability between individual cells influences arrhythmia risk at the tissue level. The research is likely to demonstrate improved, broadly applicable methods for rigorous and systematic coupling between experiments and simulations at multiple spatial scales. By so doing, the combined studies will provide important insight into the consequences of variability at both the cellular and tissue levels."
"9258333","Abstract Scientific Core 1 Scientific Core 1(SC1) provides imaging capabilities that are used broadly throughout the Program Project. The core performs: a) microscopic imaging; b) in vivo thrombosis and angiogenesis models; and c) isolation of cells from mice for ex vivo experiments. Microscopic imaging is by far the major service of this Core. This portion is organized to take advantage of the existing instrumentation and expertise within the Lerner Research Institute of the Cleveland Clinic. The instrumentation includes 6 Leica DM Microscopes, two Leica DMI6000 microscopes for time lapse imaging, a TIRF system, two Leica TCS-SP2 laser scanning confocal microscopes, a Leica SCN 400 slide scanner, a Leica laser microdissection system, LI-COR Odyssey, laser-based scanning system for gels, in-cell Westerns, ELISA/FLISA, EMSA/Gel Shift, Protein Detection, and a new FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with an 11MPix Gatan Orius 832 CCD camera. Beyond the instrumentation is the true expertise of the Core Co-Director, Dr. Judy Drazba, who has more than 20 years of experience in microscopy, hands-on familiarity with all of the instruments and the ability to train investigators from all of the projects in the appropriate use of instrumentation and in the interpretation of data. The in vivo portion of this core performs thrombosis, hemostasis and angiogenesis models in mice. The models to be performed are FeCl3 and rose Bengal induced thrombosis to the mesenteric and carotid arteries, tail bleeding to quantify hemostasis, and matrigel plug and RM-1 prostate tumor as angiogenesis. The portion of the Core is led by Dr. Eugene Podrez, who is experienced in the performance of these models and led a similar and successful core in the previous funding period. The third element of SC1 performs isolation of murine endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. These cells are used in two of Projects and having these isolations performed by experienced technologists adds to the success of establishing such cultures and the uniformity of behavior of the cells. By providing skilled leadership and organization, SC1 epitomizes the value that can be gained from centralization of key functions and expertise within a Core within the Program Project."
"9279979","Project Summary The fabrication of complex engineered tissues remains a grand challenge in regenerative medicine. These complex tissues ? bone, cartilage, vasculature, and cardiac ? are characterized by dense cellularity, patterned cellular composition, and controlled matrix presentation. The proposed Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) will address this critical need by applying three-dimensional printing (3DP) strategies to the engineering of complex tissues. This BTRC brings together research leaders at the University of Maryland, Rice University, and Wake Forest University, all highly regarded collaborators in the field, to lead the development of the Center for Engineering Complex Tissues (CECT, [sees-t]). Strong and effective administrative leadership will maximize productivity, enhance ongoing collaborations, and ensure sound fiscal and compliance management for this BTRC. The technical components of CECT consist of 3 Technology Research and Development Projects (TR&Ds), 6 Collaborative Projects (CPs), and 6 Service Projects (SPs). An External Advisory Committee (EAC), that will guide and advise the strategic direction of the Center, will be assembled from world-renowned researchers with biomedical expertise relevant to the CECT. A Local Executive Committee (LEC) will coordinate the effort across the participating institutions involved in the day-to- day operations of the Center. We will also focus on growing a community engaged in developing and utilizing complex engineered tissues by offering a series of programs to help develop and establish these technologies. Communications programs will also be developed for the dissemination of the Center?s activities to enable a broader use of the technologies. The long-term plan for the CECT is that it will become a national hub for transforming current 3DP and tissue engineering technologies into new and improved platforms for everyday uses in regenerative medicine and biomedical device development."
"9308535","Abstract Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and the risk for stroke increases with age. The mechanisms that contribute to post-ischemic injury after stroke are not completely understood, and as a result most clinical trials conducted to date for stroke therapeutics have failed. Failure to consider white matter (WM) injury is a critical gap in the development of successful stroke therapy. As mechanisms of WM injury differ from those in gray matter and change with age, an ideal stroke therapeutic must not only be directed towards neuronal and axonal protection across age, but also must restore function when applied after injury. One of our significant research achievements during the previous funding cycle established that Class I HDAC activation contributes to excitotoxicity during ischemia and contributes to oxidative injury during the post-ischemic period by impairing mitochondrial structure and function. Class I HDAC inhibition promotes axon function recovery when applied before or after ischemia in young and aging WM through unknown mechanisms. Our current proposal focuses on the mechanisms of post-ischemic protection conferred by Class I HDAC inhibition in young and aging WM.  While little is known about the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this protective phenomenon, an intriguing reciprocal relationship has emerged between levels of HDACs and miRNAs affecting cellular survival following stroke. Among ischemia-regulated miRNAs, miR-331 is predicted to target Class I HDACs. Ischemia up-regulates Class I HDAC levels in young and aging WM. Our preliminary findings show that ischemia led to decreased levels of miR-331 concomitant with increased HDAC expression and HDAC inhibition upregulated miR-331 above control levels. Consequently, an miR-331 mimic suppresses HDAC levels, indicating a reciprocal regulation between Class I HDACs and miR-331. Furthermore, WM ischemia activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), leading to oxidative injury via mitochondrial dysfunction, and Class I HDAC inhibition attenuates NOS activity. In light of this information, we propose to further extend these studies by testing our novel hypothesis that Class I HDAC activation mediates WM ischemic injury by contributing to increased oxidative stress, impairing mitochondrial function, and down-regulating glial expression of miR-331. Our overall goal is to determine whether Class I HDACs act directly or recruit NOS or interact with miR-331 to exert post-ischemic injury in young and aging WM. Electrophysiological, biochemical, and mouse genetic in vitro and in vivo approaches will be employed to test the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 is designed to investigate whether Class I HDAC activation recruits NOS in an age-, cell-, and isoform-specific manner; Aim 2 is designed to determine whether Class I HDAC activation directly mediates mitochondrial injury during ischemia; and Aim 3 is designed to establish whether Class I HDACs interact with miR-331 to mediate ischemic WM injury. Overall, the present project will unravel the role of Class I HDAC activity in WM ischemic injury in order to help in the design of novel therapies to minimize post-ischemic injury in patients."
"9242678","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the long-term effects of a universal preventive intervention for couples expecting a first child on parent adjustment, parenting, and child outcomes from six to eight years after birth. A key innovation of this transition-to-parenthood model, called Family Foundations (FF), is the focus on enhancing the coparenting relationship, based on evidence that coparenting is a causal influence on parent adjustment, parenting quality, and child outcomes (Feinberg, 2002, 2003; Minuchin, Rosman, & Baker, 1978). Given the positive results of FF to date in two trials, and the program's potential population reach, it is critically important to understand the potential of FF for enhancing child well-being over a longer period of time and across both family and school settings. Thus, we propose to assess not only children's self-regulation and emotional/behavioral adjustment (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behavior problems), but children's school adaptation and academic achievement in the early years of elementary school as well. Additionally, we propose to leverage the experimental design to test the causal pathways in the underlying theory, thus providing a test of whether program impact on coparenting and parent adjustment lead to change in parenting quality, which in turn together influence children's self-regulation and adjustment."
"9412005","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop new strategies for addressing the persistent gender gap in science achievement by targeting the mechanisms by which maladaptive beliefs that interfere with achievement arise. The persistent underrepresentation of women in science limits women's cognitive and economic attainment and-due to the growing number of households relying on the sole income of a female earner-contributes to child poverty and its concomitant negative effects on child physical, emotional, and cognitive development. Increasing the representation of women in science is a crucial way to help girls and women optimize their opportunities for cognitive development, and will also help to close the gender-linked earning gap, decrease rates of child poverty, and improve child health. Maladaptive beliefs-that scientists are a distinct kind of person, that being a scientist requires innate talent, and that scientists are deeply different from non-scientists-reflect an essentialist conception of science that interferes with female students' achievement. This project aims to discover: (a) what experiences cause girls to develop these beliefs, (b) what is responsible for girls having those experiences in the first place, and (c) how to intervene to stop the processes by which these maladaptive beliefs arise. This projects tests the hypothesis that these maladaptive beliefs are transmitted via pervasive but subtle linguistic cues-for example, by asking children to be scientists instead of to do science. These linguistic cues implicitly describe success in science as involving membership in a particular category, thus eliciting maladaptive essentialist beliefs. The planned studies test (a) whether hearing these linguistic cues causes girls to develop maladaptive, essentialist beliefs about science, (b) whether adults' own beliefs cause them to produce these linguistic cues, and (c) whether targeting adults' beliefs and language can help children develop more adaptive beliefs and increase girls' engagement in science. By partnering with a major cultural institution that provides informal educational opportunities to children and by involving educators directly in this work, this projec maximizes the opportunities for this research to lead to rapid changes in educational practices that will benefit children."
"9273771","ABSTRACT This Shared Instrumentation Grant proposal requests $482,395 to acquire a suite of instruments to enable single-cell genomics to support research programs at Case Western Reserve University [CWRU] and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The instruments will be placed in an established, successful Core Facility at CWRU. Development of the Single Cell Genomics Service using these instruments, however, will be an inte- grated effort involving 3 existing Core Facilities with relevant expertise, experience and an impressive roster of instruments. The combined capacities of these Cores are essential to capitalize on a broad spectrum of geno- mics technologies required to fully exploit the potential of the requested instrument suite. The equipment will be used solely as a shared resource, under the direction of the 3 Directors of the CWRU Core Facilities who have established histories for providing high quality services and for inter-core collaboration. Leveraging the resour- ces and expertise of these 3 Core Facilities ensures the availability of the requested comprehensive array of offerings for the Single Cell Genomic Service and promises rapid equipment installation and service provision through establishment of integrated single cell workflows. Rapid implementation of the instrumentation suite will also be assured by established communication with the extensive User Communities of the 3 collaborating Core Facilities which ensures easy access to and high visibility of the new instruments and service. Establishment of single cell genomic capability will allow investigators to identify rare [disease] cells with spe- cific genomic and interaction patterns within a sample. Without these instruments, contributions and interac- tions between individual cells in tumors and cellular-based disease processes are masked by the majority of the cell population and can't be studied. The requested technology opens previously unavailable approaches to analysis of the role of population heterogeneity. Identification of genetic markers and their mechanistic inter- actions in critical cell subpopulations will play increasing roles in our understanding of disease, drug resistance, cancer diagnosis and monitoring, biomarker exploitation and targeted drug development. In addition to the unique single-cell capability the requested equipment will facilitate interrogation of very small amounts of nucleic acid, which provides the ability to conserve rare and valuable samples. It will also result in rapid and economical execution of customized expression and genotyping studies and pursuit of projects requiring ability to perform custom amplification of small targets in large sample sets. The cutting-edge capabilities of the requested instrument suite will immediately and directly benefit funded CWRU investigators and will stimulate new research capabilities. Currently, this comprehensive integrated sin- gle cell genomic technology is not available in Northeast Ohio. By bring this state of the art technology to CWRU, the Institution will strengthening its academic research infrastructure, enhance its ability to recruit more top scientists and expand its collaborations across Ohio."

"9209558","Bone mass, strength, and marrow adiposity are linked in physiological and pathophysiological conditions including aging and altered nutrition, as both aging and nutrient deprivation lead to osteopenia with a concomitant increase in bone marrow fat that elevates fracture risk. Recent studies show that conditional deletion of the epigenetic enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) in osteoblast progenitors mimics this phenomenon, causing osteopenia, skeletal fragility, and increased marrow adiposity even in young animals. Unifying these observations, preliminary studies establish that Hdac3 expression and activity are reduced in bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC)-derived osteoprogenitors from aged humans and aged wild-type mice as compared to young controls. Lipid droplet formation is abundant in both aged and young Hdac3-depleted BMSC-derived osteoblast cultures, which preliminary data suggest is due in part to mechanisms of lipid storage by committed osteoblast lineage cells. This transformative paradigm suggests that osteoprogenitors are epigenetically primed to store lipids when Hdac3 levels decline, and that these lipid-containing cells constitute a distinct component of marrow adipose tissue. Preliminary data suggest that age-related suppression of Hdac3 is downstream of aging- related stimuli and upstream of deleterious changes in BMSC and osteoblast function that reduce bone density and increase marrow adiposity. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that Hdac3 governs the propensity for lipid storage by osteoprogenitors at the expense of bone formation, contributing to decreased bone mass and increased marrow fat with age. The significance of this line of research is that Hdac3 and its downstream modulators of lipid storage represent novel targets for treatment and prevention of age-related bone loss, possibly through modulation of nutrient-related stimuli. The objective of the proposed research is to uncover the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which Hdac3 regulates lipid storage in osteoblast progenitors with aging and altered nutrition. Animal models and in vitro experiments with murine and human primary and immortalized cell lines will define relationships between age, Hdac3 expression, and conditions that increase marrow fat and decrease bone mass. Expected outcomes include the identification of aging-related stimuli that suppress expression of Hdac3 in osteoprogenitors as targets for preventing osteoblast dysfunction with age, and determination of how loss of Hdac3 in osteoprogenitors affects key cellular processes directly related to bone formation and lipid storage."
"9461961","PROJECT SUMMARY The vast majority of research conducted in children in the United States (US) today does not include children living in the 24 IDeA eligible states/territories identified by the NIH such as Arkansas. Consequently, findings may not be generalizable to a substantial proportion of children who carry the highest disease burdens such as obesity, diabetes, pre-maturity, lung and neurodevelopmental disorders. Future therapeutic and non- therapeutic trials must be available to these children if their health status is to be improved. Arkansas Children's Research Institute (ACRI) is prepared to immediately address the overarching program goals of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trial Network (ISPCTN) and thereby, work to close the ?clinical trial gap? for children living in IDeA states. To this end, we have formed the Arkansas Center for Advancing Pediatric Therapeutics (ArCAPT). Our efforts will be directed by the central hypothesis that ArCAPT will enable the participation of diverse groups of infants, children and adolescents in expertly designed, innovative clinical trials of the highest quality and scientific value. We will leverage our unique patient base, intellectual capital and established inter-institutional resources to enhance pediatric clinical trials funded by the NIH and other supported research. Our established clinical trial enterprise and cadre of senior pediatric clinical investigators will enable us to explore the impact and intersection of ontogeny, environmental exposure and disease in four high priority areas: upper and lower airway disease; obesity; neurodevelopment and pre-, peri- and postnatal development. Our hypothesis will be tested by executing three specific aims: 1) Link established inter- and intra-institutional resources supporting pediatric clinical trials. We will partner with Arkansas Children's Hospital and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to increase the scope of pediatric trials, address the impact of racial and ethnic minority health issues and the intersection of environmental factors and disease as they relate to therapeutic endpoints. 2). Provide supervised professional development in research and clinical trial implementation. We will maintain and expand our existing clinical research teams and train the next generation of pediatric clinical researchers through high quality education in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials. 3). Create a state-of-the-art clinical trial platform for infants, children and adolescents. Using a cross-disciplinary team involving multiple pediatric subspecialists, we will expand clinical research and test and validate new technologies, tools and approaches for evaluating the interface between race/ethnicity, ontogeny, environment, disease and treatment response. The outcome of this proposal will improve the health of children of Arkansas and beyond by systematically addressing the unique health challenges of IDeA state populations."
"9234005","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two out of every three adults is overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity is associated with significant medical and psychological comorbidities. To date, the most successful weight loss treatment is behavioral weight loss (BWL), which includes nutrition and physical activity education, as well as behavior therapy techniques. Although many adults lose weight in these programs, studies suggest that one third to one half do not respond. Additionally, for those who do lose weight, weight loss maintenance becomes a significant challenge. We have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity, called Regulation of Cues (ROC), which is based on Schachter's Externality Theory. The ROC program targets two theorized mechanisms for overeating in Schachter's Theory; decreased sensitivity to appetitive cues and increased sensitivity to external food cues. We have tested the ROC model with overweight adults who binge eat in a pilot trial. Our initial data showed that participants significantly decreased their BMI during treatment and continued to decrease their BMI at the three month post-treatment time-point. The objective of this proposed study is to further evaluate the ROC program with overweight and obese adults. Considering that BWL has merit for some people, but fails to facilitate maintenance, we propose a 4 arm randomized controlled trial that will compare ROC, BWL, ROC+BWL combined and an attentional control (AC). We will recruit and randomize 280 overweight/obese adults and will assess them at baseline, mid-treatment (month 6), post-treatment (month 12), mid-follow-up (month 18) and follow-up (month 24). Primary and secondary aims are as follows. Primary Aim 1: Compare ROC and ROC+BWL to AC on body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge eating over the course of treatment and follow-up. Primary Aim 2: Compare ROC and ROC+BWL to BWL on body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge eating over the course of treatment and follow-up. Secondary Aim 1: Compare ROC, ROC+BWL, BWL and AC on sensitivity to appetitive cues, sensitivity to food cues, inhibition, restriction, caloric intake, overeating, and physical activity over the course of the treatment and follow-up. Exploratory aim 1: Evaluate mediators (sensitivity to appetitive cues, sensitivity to food cues, inhibition, restriction, binge eating, overeating in response to food cues) and moderators (demographics, baseline BMI, binge eating status) on BMI over time in each treatment arm. This program of research is an important next step in the development of treatments for overweight and obese people, and could change the paradigm of obesity treatment. This study will contribute to the study of basic behavioral mechanisms and food intake, could provide a novel model for the treatment of obesity, and could inform clinical decision making regarding obesity treatment."

"9312110","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation therapy is rarely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma. The dose required to provide effective local control (80-100 Gy) causes too much damage to surrounding normal tissue to be delivered routinely and safely. Despite the introduction of effective systemic chemotherapy, osteosarcoma patients who cannot achieve a complete surgical resection are never cured. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of effective local control measures for patients whose tumors are unresectable. Our group has been studying a radiopharmaceutical, 153Sm-EDTMP, for this purpose. This agent can deliver cytotoxic radiation to tumors with exquisite precision, sparing surrounding normal tissue more than 2 mm away. So far, efficacy has been limited because of difficulties delivering sufficient radiation by this means. In the proposed clinical trial, we are testing the hypothesis that tandem treatments with 153Sm-EDTMP can deliver sufficient radiation to allow more tolerable doses of external beam radiotherapy to be administered, and that if the biological equivalent dose of the combination treatment reaches 80-100 Gy, effective local control can be accomplished. Our project will also test the hypothesis that calculating the tumor absorbed dose after administration of a small activity of 153Sm-EDTMP will allow us to calculate a larger activity to administer that will allow us to precisely reach our target dose of 80-100 Gy. Our published work has demonstrated a linear relationship between administered activity and absorbed dose in each patient (though not between patients) after administration of fixed amounts of activity. Our current treatment plan will allow variation in the second administration, with the administered activity to be based on dosimetry calculations after the first treatment. Finally, in previous clincal trials we found little correlation between tumor absorbed dose and clinical response. It is not clear what characteristics account for this variable response to treatment. Hypoxic tumors are less responsive to standard radiation than normoxic tumors, probably because part of the cytotoxicity of radiation therapy involves the generation of oxygen free radicals. We will use a novel technique, [18F]-MISO PET to test the hypothesis that hypoxia makes tumors resistant to radiopharmaceuticals, just as it contributes to resistance to external beam radiotherapy. In summary, this work will build on our prior experience treating osteosarcoma patients with 153Sm-EDTMP, using individualized dosing, combining the radiopharmaceutical with standard external beam radiotherapy, and evaluating the ability of [18F]-MISO PET to predict response to therapy. These results will allow us to continue to develop this promising agent for a group of patients not normally treated with radiation. In addition, this treatment approach can provide the basis for combining radiopharmaceuticals with external beam radiotherapy for other tumor types as well."

"9403376","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect and is the leading non-infectious cause of death in the first year of life. Malformations of the aortic valves are arguably the most common type of cardiac malformation as bicuspid aortic valve alone has an estimated prevalence of 1-2% in the population. The mechanisms underlying the development of aortic valve abnormalities are not well understood. We were the first to report that heterozygous mutations in NOTCH1 were associated with bicuspid aortic valve in humans but there remains a major void in our understanding of the mechanisms by which aortic valve malformations occur. We have generated a new mouse model of highly penetrant aortic valve malformations (bicuspid aortic valve) using Notch1 heterozygote mice backcrossed into a Nos3 (endothelial nitric oxide synthase)-null background. These mice display a near 100% incidence of aortic valve abnormalities including thickened, bicuspid and dysfunctional aortic valves. Our preliminary studies suggest that Nos3 genetically interacts with Notch1 in the valve endothelium to cause valve stenosis. Additional studies suggest that loss of Nos3 inhibits Notch1 signaling in endothelial cells to cause valve defects by an epigenetic mechanism. The overall hypothesis is that deficiency of Notch1 in endothelial cell lineages leads to BAV by disrupting the remodeling of developing aortic valve cushion mesenchyme. In this proposal, we will elucidate the cellular and molecular abnormalities in this clinically relevant model of aortic valve malformations. The specific aims of the proposal are: Specific Aim 1. To define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of bicuspid aortic valve. Specific Aim 2. To determine the cell lineage requirement for Notch1 signaling for normal aortic valve morphogenesis. Specific Aim 3. To determine the mechanisms by which nitric oxide regulates Notch1 in the remodeling aortic valve."
"9259962","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this research proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification in order to identify novel target(s) for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-dependent vascular calcification. Vascular calcification is closely associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. In fact, more than half of all deaths in CKD subjects can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that a central event in the pathogenesis of CKD-dependent vascular calcification is increased expression of phosphorylated activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4 is a member of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) family of basic zipper-containing transcription factors that regulates osteogenesis and also mediates unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our hypothesis is based on the following evidence derived from a series of preliminary results from our lab: 1) total and phosphorylated ATF4 protein levels were induced by a number of positive regulatory factors for vascular calcification, such as inorganic phosphate, inflammatory cytokines (TNFa) and saturated fatty acids through the activation of the PERK-elF2a axis of the UPR in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); 2) adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ATF4 induced mineralization of VSMCs; 3) ATF4 knockdown, on the other hand, attenuated vascular calcification; 4) serine-phosphorylation of ATF4 (p-ATF4) was induced by PKA activation by forskolin, which is known to promote vascular calcification; 5) PKA and ERK inhibitors inhibited the phosphorylation of ATF4, resulting in the reduction of vascular calcification; 6) Total ATF4 and p-ATF4 proteins were increased in the aortas of murine models of atherosclerotic calcification such as ApoE knockout mice with 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 nx), and medial calcification such as DBA2/J mice with 5/6 nx and klotho knockout mice; 7) ATF4 targets (CHOP and GADD34) increased in these models and 8) ATF4 regulates the expression of Pit-1, a major phosphate transporter in VSMCs. To determine the pivotal role of ATF4 in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification, we propose three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine whether global ATF4 deficiency and overexpression modulate CKD-dependent medial and atherosclerotic calcification. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether VSMC-specific activation and inhibition of ATF4 influence CKD-dependent medial and atherosclerotic calcification. Specific Aim 3: Elucidate molecular mechanisms by which ATF4 regulates osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs."
"9329532","Project Summary Four out of five youth in the juvenile justice system show evidence of being under the influence during their offenses, and over half test positive for substances at the time of their arrest. Further, 92% of arrested juveniles who tested positive for drugs tested positive for marijuana (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 2004). Although some treatment programs for juvenile offenders exist, most have focused on detained and incarcerated juveniles, who only represent one third of arrested youth (Puzzanchera et al., 2010). As a result, little is known about how to improve the continuum of care for the remaining two-thirds of this population, which consists of court involved but non-incarcerated youth (CINI). Court recommendations and referrals for CINI have mostly relied on outside community-based services, thus decreasing the likelihood CINI youth and their families will take the additional steps to seek intervention. Given that motivational interventions (MI) are brief, relatively easy to implement and have a greater reach than typical substance use treatment programs, researchers have recently directed their focus to interactive, computer-delivered MI protocols to further increase their reach as well as facilitate their implementation. Online interventions can be delivered at a lower cost, with less demand on staff time for training, and increased protocol fidelity, portability, and ease of use. While counselor-delivered MIs for adolescent substance use have been tested fairly widely, only a few studies have been published on the efficacy of computer-assisted MIs. Further, little research has focused on the efficacy of such interventions with marijuana using adolescents in general, and more specifically with CINI adolescents. In addition, combining such interventions for adolescents with brief parenting interventions is important but yet rarely implemented. Therefore, this application proposes to examine the feasibility and acceptability of integrating a computer-asssisted,, brief intervention protocol into the juvenile intake procedures at the Rhode Island Family Court (RIFC) for marijuana using adolescents and their parents. Following an open trial of the brief protocol, , 80 adolescents who screen positive for marijuana use at juvenile intake will be recruited from the RIFC and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a computer-assisted adolescent MI plus an online parenting program ; or 2) usual care. Outcomes will be examined at 3 and 6-month follow-ups. This small trial will provide some initial evidence regarding utility of this protocol with CINI youth and whether a larger, fully powered trial is indicated in the future."
"9311008","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patients with a pathologic bladder have chronic medical problems with urinary incontinence, infections, and potential renal failure. Conventional surgical management of the pathologic bladder uses detubularized bowel as a patch (enterocystoplasty) to enlarge the bladder. Although enterocystoplasty provides functional improvement, it is associated with significant short- and long-term complications. Thus, alternative methods to enterocystoplasty have been explored through tissue engineering by seeding cultured bladder cells on bioscaffolds as an augmentation patch. With these techniques, marginal success has been noted but regeneration of fully functional normal bladder tissue has yet to be achieved. Several obstacles currently limit advancement in this research field including the choice of a relevant animal model; appropriate cell types for seeding, adequate neovascularization of the seeded graft, tissue innervation, and primitive bioscaffold design. Thus, alternative cell sources, advancements in bioscaffold design, and applicable animal models are needed to address these unmet clinical needs. Bone marrow stem/progenitor cells (BMSPCs) represent a highly defined population of cells that are easily accessible and may be used for bladder regeneration. BMSPCs are non-exclusively comprised of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). MSCs have been shown to be capable of smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and are involved in the bladder regenerative process, while HSPCs have demonstrated the ability to facilitate the growth of new blood vessels in regenerating tissue while aiding in peripheral nerve and urothelium regeneration. Recent developments in elastomer chemistry and scaffold design have allowed for the development of synthetic scaffolds that have controlled kinetic release of growth factors that are important for the regenerative process and that can mimic the mechanical properties of the bladder. Lastly, we have established a unique animal model of bladder augmentation in a nonhuman primate. This model is highly homologous to its human counterparts with regards to anatomy and physiology. This proposal will utilize these recent advancements in stem cell biology and elastomer chemistry along with our newly established bladder model to determine whether the use of autologous MSCs and HSPCs in conjunction with novel elastomer scaffolds can enhance current tissue engineering techniques to promote bladder regeneration. These include muscle and peripheral nerve regeneration, angiogenesis, and rapid urothelium growth. Preliminary data strongly suggests that these two cell types can accomplish these goals as demonstrated in vivo."

"9248851","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prior work has associated air pollution with accelerated atherosclerosis and with the incidence of stroke. Moreover, recent epidemiological studies associate air pollution with accelerated cognitive decline of normal aging. Associations with Alzheimer disease are being studied, supported by postmortem findings that humans exposed to extreme urban pollution have premature brain inflammation and deposits of diffuse amyloid-beta (Abeta). Rodent models support these emerging associations of cognitive dysfunctions with air pollution. After exposure to various urban air pollutants, several rodent genotypes show synaptic changes and increased Abeta, as well as induction of TNFa and other inflammatory responses. Our model uses chronic exposure of mice to nano-scale PM (nPM) derived from urban traffic, which shows greater cytotoxicity than larger PM. Under controlled exposure by duration and dose (nPM density), mice show a 30% decrease of the hippocampal GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit, with little change in other AMPA receptor subunits, or in NMDA receptor subunits, while in vitro studies show that nPM exposure increases excitotoxic damage. Because of its role in fast excitatory transmission and in spatial memory, GluA1 decreases could contribute to cognitive decline in association with air pollutants. Another potential link to brain aging involves interactions of AMPA receptor subunits with Abeta.  This proposal addresses key gaps in experimental models for epidemiological associations and postmortem findings: the impact of nPM exposure on hippocampal neuronal physiology associated with cognitive processes, and associations of pro-amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing with GluA1 changes. These studies use C57BL/6 mice of both sexes, because gender effects of air pollution on brain functions are understudied. Aim 1: Effects of chronic nPM exposure on hippocampal-dependent learning and cellular correlates. After behavioral testing of chronic nPM exposed mice, hippocampal slices will be analyzed for changes in the AMPA GluA1 vs GluA2 receptor subunits at excitatory Schaffer-collateral hippocampal synapses and in long-term potentiation (LTP). Subcellular fractionation of cortical tissue will address alterations in AMPA receptor trafficking, which regulates synaptic plasticity. The processing of the APP will also be examined in relation to glutamate receptor function. Aim 2: Manipulation of APP processing in male mice with two drugs: a novel gamma secretase modulator (BPN-15606) and with memantine to test the role of endogenous Abeta in cognitive changes and down- regulation of GluA1 during chronic in vivo nPM exposure.  Indications of glutamatergic involvement in responses to air pollution nPM are relevant to the epidemiological findings of cognitive impairment because of the role of glutamate receptors in learning and memory and because of AMPA receptor sensitivity to Abeta. Findings will enable deeper analysis of synaptotoxic mechanisms of air pollution, which are needed to identify therapeutic neuroprotection and to adjust permissible environmental limits of ultrafine PM."
"9271358","Project Summary Transgender women are at significantly higher risk of contracting HIV, yet analysis of the iPrEx study indicates use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) had no effectiveness in preventing HIV in this group on an intention-to- treat basis. While significantly understudied, qualitative work suggests that trans women experience unique, trans-specific issues, including prioritization of hormone therapy and transition-related medical care over HIV prevention, and real and perceived trans-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. The result is a significant group who is highly vulnerable to HIV infection and its negative health consequences, yet is less likely to benefit from PrEP. Research is urgently needed to understand how trans women perceive their HIV risk and make decisions about PrEP, as well as how healthcare providers address stigma and structural barriers to treatment, so that appropriate interventions can be developed. Utilizing perceptual mapping and vector modeling techniques, we will conduct a mixed methods study in San Francisco and Philadelphia combining in-depth qualitative methods with quantitative surveys to assess trans women's perceptions of PrEP, and get feedback on stigma and structural barriers to accessing healthcare from providers. Using vector message modeling, these maps will be used to identify specific message strategies to be embedded into larger interventions to address trans women's PrEP barriers and providers' barriers to treating trans women. Specific aims of the research are: 1: To create perceptual mapping survey instruments for trans women and healthcare providers to assess perceptions of PrEP, trans-related stigma, and barriers to healthcare. To accomplish this we will conduct focus groups (n=60) and interviews with healthcare providers (n=10) serving trans women and then develop perceptual mapping surveys based on findings; 2. To develop highly targeted messages to enhance PrEP decision-making in trans women and address structural barriers and beliefs in providers using perceptual mapping and vector modeling. To accomplish this aim we will conduct perceptual mapping surveys with trans women (n=100) and healthcare providers (n=50) and perform perceptual mapping and vector message modeling analysis to develop messages; 3. To assess the messages for cultural salience and get insight into acceptable communication channels and intervention activities to enhance decision making around PrEP use in HIV-negative trans women and address stigmatizing beliefs and structural barriers in providers. We will accomplish this by conducting focus groups with trans women (n=40) and interviews with providers (n=10) to get feedback on how messages would be best delivered in an intervention and analyze data to identify the most effective messages and delivery strategies. We expect our innovative methods will have wide application for designing effective, tailored messages to address barriers to PrEP and concerns about structural barriers to receiving healthcare, an important strategy for eliminating health disparities among an at- risk trans women."
"9379111","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer metastasis, not the primary tumor, is the main cause of death from breast cancer. To metastasize, a cancer cell must leave the primary tumor, survive in blood or lymphatic circulation, invade and colonize distant tissues and establish metastatic foci. Most carcinomas are thought to disseminate via the blood stream and the lymphatic system in parallel. Lymph node metastases are thought to arise from tumor cells that have entered the natural lymphatic drainage of the breast tissue to colonize the downstream sentinel nodes. Beyond this general level of understanding about lymphatic metastasis, there are fundamental biologic questions about lymphatic dissemination that remain unanswered such as: How do tumor cells enter the lymphatic drainage? What is the efficacy of lymphatic metastasis in vivo? Do metastatic and non-metastatic tumors both shed cells into the lymphatic drainage? Are the tumor cells that enter the lymphatic drainage a specialized subset of the parental tumor population? What specialized molecular mechanisms do these cells use to enter the lymph, thrive in the lymph fluid, and colonize the lymph node? To answer these questions, first, our laboratory has developed an innovative microsurgical technology to collect lymph, and the lymph circulating tumor cells (LCTC) contained therein, in an immunocompetent breast cancer animal model. Subsequently, in a collaborative effort with medical surgeons in our community, and those in Indiana University School of Medicine, we successfully applied this same technology to collect, for the first time, LCTC entering the lymph drainage in women with metastatic breast cancer. Second, we propose that the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathways is a major molecular determinant of tumor cell entry into the lymphatic drainage. TLR signaling is known to regulate pathogen sensing and homing of immune cells. This pathway also regulates cytokine and lymphokine release that are part of lymph node activation during the early stages of infection. In the present proposal we will evaluate expression levels of TLRs and key proteins associated with TLR cell signaling pathways for the first time in breast cancer cells (LCTC) entering the lymphatic drainage in the rat model of breast cancer as well as in women with breast cancer. We will use these unique cells (LCTC) to evaluate the functional role of activating or suppressing the TLR pathway on the extent of lymph node metastasis in the rodent model. In women with breast cancer we will correlate expression levels of TLRs and proteins associated with TLR signaling pathways in LCTC with the extent of metastasis in the sentinel node. Understanding the factors that contribute to the first step of lymph node metastasis can lead to a new class of therapies that suppress dissemination, essentially turning a malignant tumor into a benign tumor. Direct access to the tumor cells entering the lymph circulation provides a completely novel paradigm for prognosis and individualized therapy."

Remodeling of adipose tissue in which older, dysfunctional adipocytes are replaced by new, smaller and insulin sensitive adipocytes, appears to be required to maintain the 'health' and 'optimal function' of the tissue. The mechanisms that regulate the recruitment of adipose progenitors and their differentiation into adipocytes are rapidly being unraveled. BNORC investigators, through efforts that have been fostered and facilitated by the Adipocyte Core outlined herein, have made substantial contributions to our understanding of adipogenesis and the role of the adipocyte and adipose tissue in nutrient metabolism. Metabolically important tissues possess highly sensitive biochemical systems for sensing the availability of specific nutrients and changes in the hormonal environment (e.g. insulin, catecholamines) via specific signaling receptors and transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, via hormone production (e.g. leptin and adiponectin), the adipocyte sends signals to the brain about the status of energy stores, and to the brown adipose tissue, liver, muscle and bone to coordinate systemic nutrient homeostasis, regulating body composition and immune function. Additional signals originate in muscle (e.g. irisin), liver and immune cells add to the complexity of metabolic regulation that influences white adipose tissue function. Dysfunction of these metabolic and endocrine loops plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Clearly, deeper understanding of the basic biology of adipocyte nutrient metabolism and hormone production, and how alterations in diet quantity and quality affect these organ networks is essential to the prevention and treatment of obesity and related diseases. The research needs of BNORC investigators have progressively expanded beyond the adipocyte per se, where the Adipocyte Core has historically focused most of its efforts. Thus, we have renamed our 'Adipocyte Core' o include a basic characterization of whole body glucose metabolism and  immunometabolism.  The purpose of the Adipose Tissue Biology and Nutrient Metabolism Core is to:  1. Facilitate and foster research on mechanisms regulating white, brite (cells in white adipose tissue with  metabolic characteristics of brown) and brown adipose tissue mass, distribution, nutrient signaling and  depot-specific metabolic and endocrine functions in health and disease.  2. Provide easy and cost-effective accesse to carefully quality controlled rodent and human  preadipocytes and adipocytes, and banked cell and tissues and their products (e.g. RNA, cDNA,  tissue or cell lysates, conditioned media).  3. Develop and standardize methods in adipocyte biology as needed by our research base in this rapidly  evolving field.  4. Provide consultative advice, support and training for new investigators and established investigators  from the nutrition and obesity fields, as well as other fields who wish to understand the role of adipose  tissues and adipocytes in their clinical/translational studies or model systems.  5. Facilitate and foster the translation of basic research findings from cell and animal models into  clinical/translational studies.  6. Organize the Adipose and Metabolic Tissue Seminar Series, which serves as an incubator for new  collaborations, and as a training ground for pre-doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows.  7. Organize workshops on controversial topics and the application of new technologies to our field."
"9461963","Abstract Dartmouth is home to a robust pediatric academic program centered in the Children's Hospital at Dartmouth (CHaD). While it can demonstrate pockets of excellence in clinical trials targeting children and pregnant women, it lacks a coordinated home to resource such trial activities and to foster professional development. The IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) offers a timely opportunity to craft a center for pediatric clinical trials, to leverage existing resources and develop new ones, to recruit investigators and groups to this core, and to engage local as well as multi-center clinical trials. Organization of our regional presence in the form of the Dartmouth Regional Pediatric Clinical Trials Unit (DRP-CTU) will allow recruitment of a diverse pediatric population, including those who are rural and underserved. To accomplish this, we propose a partnership of three Enrollment Centers, one located at Dartmouth- Hitchcock-Lebanon (Coordinating Center), one at DH-Manchester (urban with large rural catchment area), and one at the Dartmouth CO-OP (extensive rural access) ? to provide flexible and robust access to regional populations. A Senior Advisory Committee composed of campus leaders will provide guidance and support navigation of institutional challenges. We will also engage local and ISPCTN resources to establish a program of faculty and staff professional development and create a Mentoring Committee for pro-active implementation. Finally, we plan to stimulate and support our pediatric research community in the multicenter study of pediatric conditions and processes. We also plan to collaborate with our neighboring ISPCTN applicant - the University of Vermont Children's Hospital - and conduct a joint Pediatric Clinical Trials Forum annually. This initiative will provide a much-needed central coordinating platform for the conduct of pediatric clinical trials in the Dartmouth community. It will support existing and new investigators, expanding our clinical trials universe, stimulating expansion of our portfolio, and offering new opportunities for professional development with the resultant recruitment/training of new faculty and research staff. !"
"9261513","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms involved in the storage and periodic elimination of urine exhibit marked changes during prenatal and postnatal development. Although the mature micturition reflex becomes functional during the postnatal period, the neural pathways underlying the mature voiding reflex are present at birth but are not active. Injuries or diseases of the adult nervous system can lead to the reemergence of primitive functions that were prominent early in development but suppressed during maturation. There is no model in the literature to explain this developmental switch. We have developed a novel model to be evaluated in this competitive renewal application that focuses on the plasticity (expression, localization, function) of two classes of ion channels in micturition reflex pathways: the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid family (TRPV) and Ca2+- and/or Ca2+ - and voltage-activated K+ channels. Our overall hypothesis is that plasticity in the sensory limb (e.g., urothelium, dorsal root ganglia) of the micturition reflex during the early postnatal period or following spinal cord injury (SCI) involving TRPV4 Ca2+  signaling and Ca2+  - (SKCa) and/or Ca2+ - and voltage-activated K channels (BKCa) underlies micturition reflex maturation and reemergence of primitive voiding function in the adult. We propose a novel paradigm whereby the TRPV4/Ca2+signaling complex acts as a brake to the mature micturition reflex during the early postnatal period and underlies reemergence of primitive voiding following SCI in the adult. Aim 1: We hypothesize that TRPV4 is co- expressed in urothelium and/or bladder sensory neurons with SKCa and/or BKCa during the early postnatal period. Plasticity (tissue/cell distribution, density) in the TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling complex in the urothelium and/or bladder sensory neurons during postnatal maturation determines the pro-inhibitory (brake) or pro- excitatory state of the distention-induced voiding reflex. The tissue/cellular distribution an density of the TRPV4/Ca2+ complex favors the pro-inhibitory (brake) state of the distention-induced voiding reflex during early postnatal development. Aim 2: We hypothesize that TRPV4 functions as a brake to the mature voiding reflex during early postnatal development through interactions with SKCa and/or BKCa in urothelium and/or bladder sensory neurons. The TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling complex elicits hyperpolarization and prevents transmitter (e.g., ATP) release. Aim 3: We hypothesize that SCI-induced plasticity (tissue/cell distribution, density, function) in the TRPV4/Ca2+signaling complex in the urothelium and/or bladder sensory neurons results in the reemergence of the pro-inhibitory (brake) state of the distention-induced voiding reflex and reemergence of primitive voiding reflexes (perineal-to-bladder). These studies will advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying micturition reflex maturation and recapitulation of ontological events following SCI and provide insights into potential lower urinary tract targets to improve voiding function."
"9297973","Project summary/abstract The Guttmacher Institute collects a wide range of data on sexual and reproductive health. Although Guttmacher researchers publish extensively from the data collected, resource constraints limit the ability to explore and analyze much of these data. As a result, many such datasets are underutilized. At the same time, other scholars and students could benefit from access to the data Guttmacher has collected. The purpose of the proposed project will be to create new public-use datasets and make them freely available to the wider research community, providing new resources for researchers and students (especially graduate students) to examine a wide range of fertility and reproductive health topics not covered by other publicly available national data, for use in analyses, dissertations, theses and other academic publications, as well as classroom exercises. Guttmacher will produce a total of four public-use datasets using R03 funds. The datasets will include data collected in both the U.S. and in developing countries. These datasets will include nationally representative surveys of family planning providers and the patients they serve, as well as population-based surveys of women and men of reproductive age on reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. All datasets will be cleaned, deidentified and thoroughly documented to ensure ease of use. Datasets will be housed at the Data Sharing for Demographic Research (DSDR) archive at the University of Michigan. A parallel index will be maintained on the website of Guttmacher's population center to facilitate access by different audiences. The availability of these datasets will be publicized broadly at professional meetings such as PAA and IUSSP, electronically via listserves and social media, and through other channels. In sum, the proposed project will enable researchers around the globe to benefit from access to data not previously available in order to answer questions across the domain of fertility and reproductive health, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of women, men and families worldwide."

"9261594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory is an essential cognitive function central to virtually all behaviors. Despite the fact that we know which brain areas and which neuromodulators are involved in working memory, we know very little about which neurons need to be activated when to enable working memory. This gap in our knowledge arose because of the technical difficulty in manipulating and monitoring neural activity in genetically- and anatomically- defined cell-types with sufficiently high temporal resolution. In order to overcome this challenge and elucidate some of the causal neural dynamics for working memory, we propose to combine multiple synergistic approaches, including a rat optogenetic model that we have previously developed to target dopaminergic neurons, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and fluorescence-based monitoring of neural activity in freely behaving animals (with gCaMP6). In Aim 1, we will optogenetically inhibit several cortical and striatal circuits eiter during the updating, maintenance, or readout of working memory to determine which aspect of working memory each circuit supports. In Aims 2, we will monitor neural activity in dopaminergic neurons using gCaMP6 to determine how dopaminergic dynamics correlate with working memory performance. In Aim 3, we will generate different patterns of dopaminergic stimulation (e.g. tonic vs phasic) to determine the causal relationship between working memory performance and dopaminergic activity dynamics. In Aim 4, we will integrate dopaminergic stimulation with electrophysiological recordings in dorsal striatum and prelimbic cortex to isolate the downstream changes in neural activity mediated by dopaminergic activity. Together, this work will provide new insights into the neural circuit mechanisms underlying working memory, with implications for both basic science and an understanding of the working memory dysfunction in various psychiatric disorders."
"9284814","Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally, recently surpassing HIV/AIDS. The WHO has set goals for the eventual elimination of TB, but there are few, if any, reliable tools to monitor progress toward this goal. Additionally our understanding of the spatial and demographic variability of TB transmission and incidence is inadequate, making the allocation of limited resources challenging. This project proposes to develop methods to estimate transmission and incidence of TB in real time using data sources that are widely available. In Aim 1, we will develop improved estimates of the serial interval and duration of disease at time of diagnosis by using existing data (ours and published). These estimates will make use of statistical methods and novel modifications of these approaches to make them relevant to TB. These estimates provide the foundation of monitoring TB, further modeling work to guide policy, and provide valuable insights into TB epidemiology. Aim 2 will focus on developing methods to estimate the reproductive number of TB in real time, providing insight on transmission patterns. We propose to modify methods we and others have developed for diseases with short latency to TB, relying on routinely collected surveillance data. We will extend these methods to estimate heterogeneities in the reproductive number spatially, across demographic characteristics, and according the presence/absence of drug resistance. In Aim 3 we address the challenge of estimating disease incidence. Current estimates are given on a countrywide basis and result from annual reports of newly diagnosed individuals supplied to the WHO by individual countries. This data does not provide granularity in incidence estimates and is hampered by substantial reporting issues, which are not well-understood. We propose a novel Bayesian approach to estimate TB incidence from TB prevalence surveys, using our estimates of duration derived in Aim 1. TB prevalence surveys are detailed cluster sampled surveys with spatial, clinical, and demographic information on all participants. They are performed throughout areas with a high burden of TB. This approach will provide more detailed information on TB incidence and its heterogeneities, allowing for more targeted allocation of resources. We will create R packages to disseminate the methods that we develop in all the aims for widespread use. This work will enable policy makers to better understand the incidence of TB as well as groups and areas that are carrying the highest burden of disease. This knowledge will guide intervention efforts, with the eventual goal of elimination."
"9077097","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):            Our hands are the primary means by which we explore and manipulate our environment. They perform thousands of intricate movements without conscious thought or even visual attention. Sensory feedback is a critical element of these complex activities. Lack of sensory feedback in myoelectric upper limb prostheses makes fluid and complex motions difficult and requires the user to maintain visual attention on the prosthesis to perform even the simplest task. In this project, we will address the need for sensory feedback by implanting non-penetrating cuff electrodes on the residual upper limb nerves. Our central hypothesis is that direct nerve stimulation with selective, non-penetrating cuff electrodes on the residual upper limb nerves can elicit graded sensation and proprioception at multiple locations in the perceptual hand. Further, restoration of sensory feedback with cuff electrodes will reduce visual and cognitive load during prosthesis usage, improve functional performance, and result in embodiment of the prosthesis. In the first funded merit review, the electrode and stimulation technology was developed and fully prepared for clinical implementation. The FDA and local IRB approved investigation of the system in amputees under an investigational device exemption, IDE #G110043. The first subject was implanted in May of 2012. In the first subject, stimulation through 19 active contacts produced 19 unique locations of sensory perception on the subject's perceptual hand. The locations of the perception and the stimulation parameters continue to remain stable, which is more than six month at time of this proposal submission. Further, by modulating stimulation patterns, several perceptions can be produced at each location on the phantom, including pressure, slip, tingling, and pricking. We have, for the first time, shown peripheral nerve stimulation produces highly selective, stable, and normal sensory perception in many places on the phantom of the person with limb loss. The purpose of this project is to study these results in a full cohort of five subjects, demonstrate home use of sensory feedback, and demonstrate improved usage and sense of embodiment resulting from natural sensory feedback. We have a strong working relationship with Otto Bock and Hanger Clinic, providing a solid team poised to make a significant and real impact on veterans, wounded warriors, and the upper limb loss community, as a whole. Specifically, the aims for this project are: Aim 1: Characterize sensory perception. Upper extremity peripheral nerve stimulation elicits graded sensory perceptions in more than one location on the phantom limb and the perceptions are stable up to at least two years. Aim 2: Demonstrate functional improvement. Stable sensory perception elicited by cuff electrodes will reduce attention and visual load required for adequate prosthesis control and will improve functional performance. Aim 3: Demonstrate embodiment. Stable sensory perception elicited by cuff electrodes in synchrony with physical stimuli applied to the artificial limb will result in embodiment of the artificial limb. Aim 4: Design and verify an implantable stimulator for  permanent sensory restoration. To reach a larger population, a fully implanted system will be required. While it is premature for investment in a fully implanted device, the stimulation circuity will be developed in a bench-top system to prepare for future implant development. In collaboration with Otto Bock, the Michelangelo AxonBus hand and wrist system will be our prosthesis development platform. Collaboration with Hanger Clinic will provide valuable patient-centric guidance and access to a substantial candidate pool. Following successful execution of the work proposed, we expect to show permanent improvement in upper limb prosthesis performance and user embodiment due to permanent, natural sensory feedback through peripheral nerves."

"9242465","Project Summary Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a severely disabling form of chronic pain that can occur after mild trauma such as fracture or minor surgery. There are approximately 50,000 new cases in the US each year that contribute to the estimated $635 billion per year in medical treatment and lost productivity from chronic pain conditions. CRPS shows two distinct phases: an acute phase that demonstrates a prominence of peripheral findings including limb warmth, edema and skin cytokine production, and a chronic phase that exhibits a cool, often atrophic limb with new onset cognitive and emotional deficits. Currently available treatments are limited in efficacy but particularly ineffective during the chronic phase. Monocyte lineage cells are a key component of the innate immune response to injury both peripherally as ?inflammatory? monocytes, and centrally, as yolk sac-derived microglia. These cells express similar receptors, making them historically difficult to distinguish, however, discerning their individual, unique contributions is crucial to understanding pain chronification as both cell subsets have been implicated in CRPS. The aim of this work is to use specific genetic and pharmacologic approaches in our well-validated rodent model of CRPS to investigate the contribution of these cells peripherally and centrally to the acute phase and subsequent transition to the chronic phase of CRPS. This will be done using a combination of approaches including the use of two innovative techniques with the potential for translation to humans. Specifically, we will use high- parameter mass cytometry to provide unprecedented systems-wide perspective of the functional status and interactions among all major immune cell subsets. We will also be taking advantage of innovative approaches to monitor glial cell activation over the course of disease progression using the positron emission tomography ligand, 18F-GE-180, targeting the 18 kDa translocator protein, TSPO, to monitor microglial activation in the spinal cord. Successful completion of this work will not only improve our ability to tailor treatments to individual patients and rationally develop new immune-glial directed therapies but will also provide insight into the utility of peripheral immune phenotyping and glial neuroimaging as translatable diagnostic approaches. Dr. Tawfik has a background in anesthesiology, pain medicine and basic pain research with a focus on neuroimmunity. The detailed career development and research plan presented in this application will provide the required resources and mentorship for her to become an expert in three domains critical to her long-term career goals: 1) Clinically-relevant rodent models of pain; 2) Advanced training in the neuroimaging of pain in live subjects; and 3) Application of advanced molecular genetics tools to study individual immune cells."

"9252218","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating parasitic diseases worldwide, responsible for an estimated 207 million clinical cases and 627,000 deaths in 2012 alone. Major virulence factors of malaria are parasite replication in the blood that leads to severe anemia, and in the most lethal form, Plasmodium falciparum-infected red cells block capillaries of organs in a phenomenon linked to lethal outcomes. Blood-stage replication is part of a complex life cycle in multiple hosts involving both sexual and asexual stages that requires very tight developmental control of gene expression. Recent studies in our lab have implicated post-transcriptional control as a major player during parasite development in certain types of genes associated with virulence. The mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulatory control represent new potential targets for drug intervention. We recently demonstrated that a knock- out of the P. falciparum CAF1 gene altered expression of ~20% of the genome, dramatically shifting expression of virulence genes in late trophozoites and many genes of late-stage proteins involved in parasite replication (egress and invasion). In other organisms, CAF1 is a major player controlling gene expression as a deadenylase regulating mRNA decay in the cytoplasm and as part of the CCR4-NOT complex regulating transcription in the nucleus. We hypothesize that CAF1 is integral for proper control of P. falciparum gene expression as a post-transcriptional regulator. The long-term objective of these studies is to understand P. falciparum post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to identify key players suitable as novel drug targets. We seek here to elucidate some of the mechanisms behind this regulatory control in P. falciparum by using our existing CAF1 knockout and gene expression data, computational tools and other biochemical assays. Further, we believe that illuminating the mechanisms behind the post-transcriptional layer of gene regulation will yield unique insights into P. falciparum biology  and has the potential to provide valuable information for the development of new interventions targeting parasite egress and invasion."
"9211062","Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stages, poses a significant burden to the community and health care system. Several other pathologic processes often co-exist with AD pathology. Characterizing the multi-faceted aspects of brain changes present in aging and (prodromal) AD not only provides insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes, such as amyloid deposition, small vessel ischemic disease(SVID), and neurodegeneration or functional change, but also leads to biomarkers of these pathologic processes. In this proposal, we aim to capture the heterogeneity of various imaging patterns that reflect pathologic processes occurring with aging and prodromal AD, by applying state of the art heterogeneity analysis machine learning methods recently developed in our laboratory to multi-faceted imaging data (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, amyloid imaging). These methods allow us to quantify the different ways/patterns in which an individual can fall off the normative brain aging trajectories. Our goal is to arrive at a new ?Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases?(iSTAGING), each dimension of which will reflect a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropathological heterogeneity in quantifiable and replicable metrics. Moreover, we aim to link these neuroimaging phenotypes with neurocognitive phenotypes, as well as with progression from cognitively normal aging to MCI and to dementia. This will allow us to place each individual into a new dimensional brain coordinate system of aging and map his/her trajectory, as well to determine predictive indices emanating from multi-parametric imaging data. Prior to achieving these aims, we will strengthen and apply various imaging harmonization methods, which are critical in ensuring that data across studies and scanners can be integrated in a constructive way. In particular, Aim1 will apply inter-site imaging harmonization methods, and hence develop a platform that will allow us to integrate multi-parametric imaging datasets from more than 10,000 participants to several studies spanning ages 45 to 89; we will therefore form a large multi-modal imaging database capturing the heterogeneity of normal brain aging and prodromal AD. Aim 2 will use machine learning methods to integrate spatial patterns of brain atrophy, SVID, A? deposition and functional connectivity in this population, and will derive normative brain aging curves. Aim 3 will use state of the art semi-supervised learning methods to disentangle the heterogeneity of imaging patterns distinguishing resilient from advanced brain aging: this will lead to the dimensional system (iSTAGING) capturing the diverse dimensions/patterns of advanced (non-resilient) age-related brain change relative to resilient brain aging, which reflect underlying neuropathological processes. Aim 4 will relate iSTAGING coordinates and longitudinal trajectories to cognition, risk factors, and clinical progression from normal cognition to MCI to dementia, in order to further elucidate the clinical correlates of these neuroimaging dimensions."
"9284875","ABSTRACT  The goals of this project are to use genomic approaches to identify, in the human genome, powerful chromatin insulators and powerful erythroid specific enhancers. Use of powerful insulators in therapeutic gene therapy vectors will increase safety by decreasing the risks of vector-related genotoxicity. Availability of powerful erythroid specific enhancers will increase the efficacy of gene therapy in patients with severe thalassemia.  With the studies of the first specific aim we will discover powerful chromatin insulators in the human genome using the novel genomic screening approaches we have developed. Special emphasis will be given in identifying powerful barrier insulators which also possess powerful enhancer blocking activity. Such insulators are expected to improve both the safety and the efficacy of integrating gene therapy vectors. We will determine the structural characteristics of the new insulators and we will investigate the structural basis of the variation in their potency.  In specific aim 2 we will discover new powerful erythroid specific enhancers in the human genome using molecular and informatics methods. We will verify the erythroid lineage specificity of the new enhancers, we will characterize them and will use them to identify the molecular features that determine erythroid lineage specificity.  With the studies of Specific Aim 3 we will produce a new generation of globin gene therapy vectors. The most powerful insulators of Specific aim 1 will be used to determine the optimal sizes, the highest titers and the highest protection from genotoxicity required for the gene therapy vectors. The most powerful enhancers of Specific Aim 2 or enhancer cassettes will be used for quantitative assessments of their potency in supporting globin gene expression. The best insulators and enhancers will be incorporated in globin gene vectors and their therapeutic potency will be assessed ex vivo in the erythroid cells of thalassemic patients and in vivo in thalassemic mice."
"9287828","Peru-JHU TMRC Program Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): GARCIA, Hector H. COMPONENT PROJECT 1 - IMPROVED DIAGNOSTICS ASSAYS FOR VIABLE  OR DEGENERATING NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS Summary  Taenia solium cysticercosis is the main cause of acquired epilepsy in developing countries and among the most common causes of this neurologic disease worldwide. The number, size, location, viability of CNS parasites, and the degrees of inflammation lead to highly pleomorphic clinical presentations, making neuroimaging examination (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) the diagnostic tool of choice. CT and MRI, however, are expensive and not accessible in poor rural areas, where neurocysticercosis (NCC) is highly endemic. Serologic tests play an important role in confirming the diagnosis in patients in whom imaging studies are not diagnostic. However, current serologic assays are clearly sub-optimal in three settingsCurrent serologic assays for the diagnosis of NCC are clearly sub-optimal in two settings: a) current tests are not sensitive in patients with a single brain lesion, due to poor sensitivity, and b) in extraparenchymal NCC, a type of NCC with a progressive course and bad prognosis, because the background prevalence of antibody in endemic regions results in a poor predictive value to discriminate these cases at higher risk of disease progression and severe morbidity.  We have defined two diagnostic scenarios for which a confirmatory laboratory test is urgently required, Patients with a single viable or degenerating brain cyst, and Detecting extraparenchymal NCC. Single brain lesions have long differential diagnosis list. Since the prognosis and management of these conditions vary enormously a confirmatory test with higher sensitivity and specificity is needed. In the US, patients with single cysticercal lesions frequently undergo brain biopsy due to diagnostic uncertainty. Conversely, single lesions falsely thought to be single cysticercal cysts are sometimes unnecessarily left untreated in the watch and wait approach. The second target, a test which could accurately predict the presence of extraparenchymal NCC would permit identification of individuals with more severe disease for more complete studies resulting in earlier treatment and reduced morbidity and mortality. In many regions of the world there is no readily available brain imaging.  Alternative assays or improvement of existing assays are urgently needed to overcome these drawbacks. Our preliminary findings using new antigens, and new assay technology suggest that we are poised to significantly improve the diagnosis by testing a series of novel techniques and platforms.Our overarching aim is to develop improved immunodiagnostic tests to solve defined clinical needs in human neurocysticercosis. And our specific aims are a) To develop a sensitive and specific test to confirm whether single brain lesions are due to cysticercosis and b) To develop and optimize a serodiagnostic assay to identify individuals who harbor extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis.  This project will take advantage of a long established collaboration between the USA and Peru. The problem cannot be addressed easily in the United States because of the lack of the necessary infectious agent. Ultimately, if assays are efficacious, they will be applied in a medical setting to patients in the USA who are mainly from Latin American or other foreign countries."
"9266470","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a research plan into the role of bone marrow microenvironment in modulating retinoid homeostasis with implications for both normal as well as malignant hematopoiesis and a training program to develop the principal investigator, Dr. Gabriel Ghiaur from a junior faculty into an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Ghiaur studied normal hematopoiesis as a graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. David Williams and then as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Jose Cancelas at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. As a hematology fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Richard Jones, Johns Hopkins University, he focused on the role of retinoic acid (RA) in hematopoiesis. Dr. Jones was the first investigator to identify retinaldehyde dehydrogenase as a marker of normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cell and is a recognized expert in the field. Upon completion of his clinical and research fellowship, Dr. Ghiaur has joined the Hematological Malignancies division, at Johns Hopkins in July 2013 as an Instructor and was recently promoted to Assistant Professor of Oncology and Medicine. This laboratory based tenure track position assure Dr. Ghiaur 80% protected time for research and this grant will support his goal of pursuing a career as a laboratory based translational researcher in hematologic malignancies.  Regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function during steady state conditions as well as during disease states is an area of intense research. Multiple cell-intrinsic and environmental cues have been proposed to connect physiological needs and stem cell behavior. Studies comparing HSC with their more committed progenitor cells, revealed RA as a potential regulator of HSC function. To this end, HSCs appear posed to differentiate if not protected by a RA-low niche maintained via stromal expression of CYP26, a RA- metabolizing enzyme. Thus, modulations of CYP26 expression by inflammatory signals for instance could change RA levels in the niche and thus, adjust HSC behavior to respond to hematological stress. More so, since RA therapies have revolutionized the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia but unfortunately had no impact on other hematological malignancies, tempering with stromal CYP protective mechanisms could expand the clinical applications of differentiation therapies. A better understanding of niche drug metabolizing properties and how they change during hematological stress and during therapy is needed to before the develop CYP inhibitors as clinical tools in hematology.  The overarching hypothesis of the proposed research is that P450 enzymes expressed by various hematopoietic microenvironments create drug-free sanctuaries in the bone marrow and modulate HSC homeostasis as well as chemotherapy resistance. This proposal aims to: 1) Determine how the bone marrow niche controls RA bioavailability to modify HSC behavior; specifically  what stem cell niche (endothelial, mesenchymal or endosteal) depends on CYP26 activity to maintain  human HSC, how the local (niche) control of RA levels compares to systemic (hepatic) metabolism and  how RA metabolism changes during hematological stress. 2) Study the effects of stromal cytochrome P450 on drug resistance, initially as it relates to resistance RA  therapy and then as it relates to chemotherapy in general. The investigators hypothesize that a sophisticated understanding of local drug metabolism will aid in designing optimal strategies to bypass the chemical barriers posed by stromal drug metabolizing enzymes and thus, opening the malignant stem cell niche to systemic chemotherapy."
"9262792","PROJECT 2 PROJECT SUMMARY  Impact of Environmental Modifications on Vector Ecology and Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Most of the population in sub-Saharan Africa faces the constant threat of famine. Approaches to the famine problem need to address the underlying conditions that make food shortages endemic. Construction of dams and irrigated agricultural farms has been widely recognized as a key solution to promoting food security and alleviating poverty. A large number of dams, microdams and irrigated farms have been developed in Africa in the past decade, and many are under construction or being planned. These water resource development projects are anticipated to cause major changes in the ecology of malaria vectors. How changes to the vector ecology alter transmission dynamics is however not clear. New interventions that can effectively suppress malaria transmission while simultaneously increasing agricultural productivity are urgently needed. The central objective of this project is to examine the impact of environmental modifications from water resource development projects on vector ecology and malaria transmission in Kenya and Ethiopia. The central hypothesis is that malaria transmission dynamics is strongly influenced by environmental modifications from water resource development projects. These water resource development projects create more stable and productive breeding sites and disrupt transmission. As a result, seasonality, spatial distribution, vector community structure, and vector competence get altered. We propose four specific aims: 1) assess the impact of environmental modifications from water resource development projects on vector bionomics and malaria transmission dynamics, 2) determine the effects of environmental modifications on vector population genetics and vector competence, 3) evaluate the impact of next-generation nets recently introduced as a part of the public health program, on malaria incidence and vector insecticide resistance under different environmental conditions, and 4) model the cost-effectiveness of novel integrated vector management approaches suitable to areas with extensive environmental modifications. The project will significantly enhance our understanding of the impact of environmental modifications on malaria vector ecology and the underlying ecological and genetic mechanisms for altered transmission. Through modeling of cost-effectiveness of new integrated vector intervention approaches, this project will provide important information that can guide future field trial design and inform policy makers of new malaria control approaches. Malaria outdoor transmission, pyrethroid resistance, and environmental modifications are presently of great concern and urgent issues that need to be addressed globally. Thus, our results can have far reaching and broad implications on malaria prevention and control."
"9259982","COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT CORE  ABSTRACT  The COEC has successfully forged and nourished relationships with various neighborhoods and local groups  in the Boston area, particularly in the Dorchester neighborhood. Over the past four years, we have organized  and participated in numerous community events such as science fairs, clean air fairs, focus groups and  community forums. This year, we are creating a new structure that is designed to strengthen our link to the  neighborhood by soliciting input from community stakeholders and healthcare advocates, and working on  environmental issues that they have identified as most important to them.  We call our new initiative the Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Homes, Healthy People Program. It is a direct  response to a 2012 Dorchester Health of Boston Forum where participants identified the environment's role in  children's elevated obesity and asthma levels as the most important health concern to the neighborhood. Our  new approach entails convening a Board of Stakeholders that consists of leading local healthcare and  community advocates. This Board will help the Center to expand its neighborhood networks and strengthen its  relationships with the community and its health professionals. The COEC will focus on: 1) Citizen/Community  Science - Street-level (ground-based) and stationary measurement of air quality by monitoring PM2.5 levels.  This will be used to promote the development of low pollution biking/walking routes, and to provide data to  Center researchers so that they can refine the spatial resolution of remote sensing satellite data for use in  future epidemiologic studies; 2) Education around Integrated Pest Management for newcomer families living in  low-income housing; 3) Education about the Asthma-Obesity Connection for low income newcomer families; 4)  A summer internship program through the Boston Public Health Commission's Y2HC (Youth to Health Care)  program to inspire young people to become interested in health care and the environment; and 5) Outreach  regarding the Asthma - Obesity Connection and other pediatric environmental health issues of interest to  pediatric health professionals and informed by Center research.  The COEC will also continue to pursue ongoing, broader goals that involve other regional and national public  health initiatives in partnership with other Centers and environment groups. Examples include the  environmental effects of fracking with the UPenn COEC, the Cambridge Science Festival with the MIT COEC,  the UTMB Galveston - Harvard WorldMap training program, and the UW-Milwaukee environmental health  nursing initiatives, among others."
"9262791","PROJECT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY Impact of Environmental Modifications on Plasmodium falciparum  and P. vivax Malaria Epidemiology and Disease Burden Severe droughts have plagued the African continent for centuries. Most people in African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture, making these populations vulnerable to drought and famine. Construction of dams and initiating rural irrigation schemes has been widely recognized as key solutions to food security and economic growth in drought prone regions. In the past decade, sub-Saharan African countries have experienced a new era of large dam constructions and expansion of irrigated agricultural farms. These environmental changes may have unforeseen ecologic consequences that adversely affect human health. To date, there has been limited basic or translational research evaluating the impact of environmental modifications on the epidemiology of malaria. The overarching objective of this project is to assess the impact of environmental modifications from water resource development projects and shifting agricultural practices on the change of epidemiology of malaria at the molecular, individual, field and population levels. The central hypothesis is that ecological changes and large-scale human population movement resulting from dam construction, flooding of the dam catchment and shifting of agriculture practices will modify the transmission and risk of malaria in the area. We will test this hypothesis by monitoring ecological changes, conducting repeated cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohort studies in the community, and passive surveillance for malaria in health centers and hospitals. The three specific aims are to: 1) compare symptomatic malaria burden and spectrum of disease severity in areas of diverse eco-epidemiologic settings with drastic environmental modifications and differing prevalence of Plasmodium species, 2) examine the effect of human migration associated with construction of dams and irrigation farming on the landscape genetics of malaria parasites, and 3) assess the effectiveness of recently introduced primaquine treatment strategies on the risk of Plasmodium vivax recurrence and P. falciparum transmission under different environmental conditions in Ethiopia. Because the irrigated area of sub-Saharan Africa and the number of large hydropower dams are anticipated to increase dramatically in the next decade, understanding the impact of water development projects on malaria epidemiology and subsequently developing strategies to reduce transmission and morbidity will be of paramount importance. Although this study is conducted only in highly populated areas in Kenya and Ethiopia, we anticipate that our findings and tools will have broad implications for malaria prevention and control in other regions of sub-Saharan Africa that are undergoing similar environmental modifications."
"9287830","Peru-JHU TMRC Program Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): GARCIA, Hector H.  COMPONENT PROJECT 3 ? IMPROVING THE UNDERSTANDING AND  TREATMENT OF BRAIN INFLAMMATION IN NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS  PROJECT SUMMARY   Human infestation by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium is a major public health  problem in most resource-poor countries. Clinical manifestations in humans are predominantly due to  central nervous system involvement, known as neurocysticercosis (NCC). Seizures occur in nearly 80% of  people with NCC and in about 50% of the patients recurrent seizures occur.10-13 NCC is the most important  risk factor for epileptic seizures in many endemic regions, and epidemiologic studies suggest that up to one  third of active epilepsy is attributable to NCC. The mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis in NCC patients  are still poorly understood. Paradoxically, anti-parasitic treatment often leads to increased edema and  inflammatory response, and results in recurrent, sometime severe, seizures.9 Animal models for seizures  and epilepsy, in particular models for focal brain inflammation and associated seizures, are scarce and  limited. We have recently developed a rat brain NCC model in which rats are intracranially infected with  culture-grown T. solium oncospheres and develop brain cysts or metacestodes, with characteristics  identical to those developed in the natural host. This novel animal model of NCC is very similar to human  NCC because the oncosphere, which is the natural stage of infection that results in cysticercosis, is  localized to parenchymal or extraparenchymal (ventricles or meninges) brain tissue and allowed to develop  into a metacestode, with identical morphologic characteristics as those found in the natural host. In the  proposed study we will test in a comprehensive, quantitative and longitudinal approach the involvement of  BBB breakdown, brain inflammatory response and astroglial activation in the development of seizures and  epilepsy in the NCC rat model. We hypothesize that a) inflammation-related BBB dysfunction will be  associated with the astroglial response in brain tissue and will result in further damage in the surrounding  brain, and b) that inhibition of TNF-alpha or MMPs will block the inflammatory response and preserve BBB  integrity. Data obtained in Specific Aim 1 will be used to plan the time window of anti-inflammatory  treatment, directed to reduce inflammatory signaling, BBB breakdown and glial activation using three  (including two recently available) FDA-approved anti-inflammatory approaches, for work under Specific Aim  2."
"9262276","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroelectric oscillations reflect synchronous excitability fluctuations in ensembles of neurons, ubiquitous in the waking (and sleeping) brain, and are believed to be fundamental instruments in adaptive brain function. Despite recent progress in understanding the physiological underpinnings and functional significance of neuronal oscillations, the cellular physiology of the reset and entrainment processes, that allow the brain to harness oscillations as building blocks of perception and cognition, are unclear. Recent findings suggest that it is possible to manipulate neuronal oscillations using weak transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) both with direct and alternating currents (tDCS and tACS respectively). This raises possibilities for causal manipulations that can help to confirm the role of specific oscillatory dynamics in specific aspects of perception and behavior, as well as the possibility of treating neuropsychiatric disorders in which disruptions of brain dynamics underlie cognitive deficits. We propose to examine effects of tDCS and tACS with a combination of electric field measurements and modelling, electrophysiological and behavioral measurements in awake-behaving macaque monkeys. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Optimize models to target specific brain regions with tDCS and tACS. Widespread. macro-scale intracranial recordings with chronically-implanted, 48 channel stereotactic EEG (s-EEG) arrays will determine how intracranial electric fields are affected by stimulation parameters, e.g., intensity, frequency (tACS) and variations in stimulating electrode nu    mber (up to 8) and positions. 2) Define physiological and behavioral effects of tDCS and tACS in active sensory processing. We will use a limited (24 channel) version of the macro-scale network analysis (AIM 1), along with micro-scale measures in monkeys performing auditory discriminations and making manual responses to targets. Micro-scale measures include laminar field potential (FP), current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles sampled with multielectrode arrays across the layers of selected neocortical areas. CSD and MUA analyses are used to define the profiles of synaptic activity (indexed by current sinks and sources) and envelope of concomitant neuronal firing across the cortical layers, thus linking stimulation effects to specific cell populations, circuits and physiological processes engaged in oscillatory dynamics. Measuring network and cell-circuit activity patterns during sensory processing, target detection and motor responding will provide robust and sensitive means to gauge electrical stimulation effects on brain dynamics underlying these key processes. Success will support and inform a broader effort to develop a more detailed concrete picture of the properties of neuronal ensembles that create brain rhythms and organize them to perform fundamental cognitive operations. Improved mechanistic understanding of brain stimulation effects may lead to improved brain stimulation protocols, treatments disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and ADHD, in which sensory entrainment at both low and high frequencies is demonstrably or putatively impaired."
"9177101","Hazelbauef' Gerald L Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): PROJECT SUMMARY (See instruc{ions):  Receptors that mediate chemotaxis in Escherichia coli are paradigms for the large family of bacterial sensory receptors and a larger family of two-componenf' receptors. This application for an extension of my MERIT Award for its second five years focuses on functional mechanisms and structures of chemoreceptors and the signaling complexes they form. This focus is consistent with the NIGMS mission of basic research that increases understanding of life processes and lays the foundation for medical advances. Studies will emphasize E. coli chemoreceptors and utilize biochemical, mutational, biophysical, and structural approaches. Some approaches involve collaborative efforts with other research groups and most exploit advantages of chemoreceptors inserted in Nanodiscs, water-soluble plugs of lipid bilayer surrounded by a protein annulus, which are effective for manipulating bilayer-inserted receptors. Specific aims address issues central to understanding chemoreceptors. 1) Structure and conformational changes of signaling of the chemoreceptor dimer, the fundamental receptor organizational and functional unit. Receptor structure and conformational changes will be characterized using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ONDP relaxometry, structuralelectron microscopy including high-resolution cryo-EM and X-ray diffraction. Results will define the structure of this crucial unit and identify fundamental mechanisms of receptor intra-molecular and transmembrane signaling. 2) Functional and structural properties of core signaling complexes, the fundamental unit of kinase activation and control. Functional characterization of soluble core signaling complexes will provide basic insights into its functional capabilities, allosteric interactions and kinase activity. Structural properties will be characterized by biophysical assays, advanced techniques of electron microscopy and, if preliminary results merit, X-ray crystallography. In summary, the proposed research aims to substantially advance our understanding of bacterial chemoreceptors, a paradigm for biological sensory signaling. (See instructions): ability to sense and respond to the environment is an essential biological process shared by all cells. investigate this process in bacteria, which are easier to manipulate than cells from higher organisms, the aim of discovering basic principles. Knowledge of these principles will aid understanding and  of the many human health problems caused by defects in the ability to sense and respond."
"9293591","Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have progressed rapidly through technological advances that allow recording chronically from large numbers of neurons, more computational power, better training, and better regression algorithms for estimating neural tuning. However, current BMIs rely almost exclusively on fixed, linear models of neural encoding that are the same for all types of movements. These fixed models are the same whether the movements are fast or slow, and the same no matter which degrees of freedom require the most precision for a particular task. In part, this limitation of current BMIs reflects inadequate basic knowledge concerning how the brain controls movement at different levels of precision. To advance the field, the present project will test the hypotheses that 1) specific changes occur in the neural activity of the motor cortex depending on the precision required, and 2) more flexible, non-linear algorithms that adjust precision and actively select from multiple linear decoders will enable BMI performance closer to that of normal humans.  This general hypothesis will be tested with two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine selective neural encoding of movement precision when the instructed precision is varied systematically in a reach and grasp task. Aim 2 will examine improving BMI performance using novel neural signal input to BMI output transforms. This novel BMI experiment will focus on using multiple dimensions of neural activity to improve precision along a given degree of freedom.  In pursuing these Specific Aims, I will receive additional training to advance my career and transition from my current post-doctoral associate position to that of an independent, tenure-track faculty member by developing a research program that bridges the fields of neural control of movement, BMI design, and computational neuroscience. During my K99 years, I will advance my training in computational neuroscience, mentored by Drs. Sridevi Sarma and Robert Jacobs. With Dr. Sarma, I will focus on statistical modeling of neural activity using point process modeling. With Dr. Jacobs, I will focus on applying mixture models and gain-scheduling for BMIs. By the end of my K99 years, I thus will have expertise in three complementary disciplines?motor neurophysiology, BMI, and computational neuroscience?all contributing to the success of my transition to independence."
"9461975","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Ross, Judith, M.D.  Historically, there have been barriers to involvement of many children in the U.S. in state-of-the art pediatric clinical trials. The IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) represents a transformational opportunity to recruit more underserved children to participate in state-of-the-art clinical trials, facilitate implementation of well-designed pediatric clinical trials, and enhance pediatric clinical trial capacity within the IDeA state, Delaware (DE) at Nemours/Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children (AIDHC). The creation of the DE Nemours/AIDHC ISPCTN site will harness current key resources in the hospital and the community including DE pediatrics practice-based networks that cover over 65,000 children, access to historically underrepresented pediatric populations in DE, and robust community engagement programs such as the Nemours children's health website KidsHealth. We have the human talent with highly experienced clinical research teams (investigators, coordinators, study recruiters, data entry staff), and the clinical research infrastructure (Clinical research center, IRB processes, standard operating procedures). Nemours/AIDHC has >15 years' experience with system-wide use of electronic medical records (EPIC). The DE-Nemours/AIDHC ISPCTN site will synergize with ongoing DE IDeA state clinical research resources including the Delaware Clinical and Translational Research ACCEL Program (DE-CTR), the Delaware IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) program, and the Nemours Delaware IDeA Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) programs that are focused on pediatrics (Center for Pediatric Research). In this application, we demonstrate how our strengths in community engagement/patient recruitment, clinical research expertise, and infrastructure have allowed us to engage in clinical trials research in the four focus areas in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program including Upper and lower airway disorders, Obesity, Pre-/Peri-/Postnatal outcomes, and Neurodevelopment. The DE-Nemours/ AIDHC ISPCTN site will work closely with the ISPCTN Data Coordinating and Operations Center in terms of development and implement- ation of ISPCTN clinical trials, study design, recruitment and implementation, and data management. The Specific Aims are to: Aim 1: Increase participation of diverse/underserved pediatric populations in clinical trials within DE and across IDeA states, Aim 2: Provide the clinical research expertise (qualified investigators, coordinators, study recruiters, data entry staff) for the DE-Nemours/AIDHC ISPCTN site, and Aim 3: Promote the infrastructure hub for conducting pediatric clinical trials at the DE-Nemours/AIDHC site.  The DE-Nemours/AIDHC site participation in the ISPCTN will catalyze new ideas, promote new collabora- tions, and will engage clinicians, researchers, and the community in well-designed pediatric clinical trials.

Project Summary / Abstract This program will rely on an innovative and growing resource of transgenic tools for in vivo analysis of microRNA (miR) function and activity. We have produced a partial collection of transgenic miR-SPonge (miR- SP) strains that are designed expressly to address the challenge of defining the cellular and developmental specificity of miR function within complex neural circuits and tissues with many constituent cell types. Preliminary data show that these tools are effective, however, accumulated data also show that many new sponge strains are needed to make this resource more comprehensive. Recent availability of many miR deletion alleles and UAS-miR mimic strains provides an important complement to our miR-SP resource, however, many new and selective null mutations are needed for a thorough and specific analysis of miR functions identified in our unpublished screens. In addition, informatics and expression analysis identifies promising target gene candidates that may define underlying downstream mechanisms for miRs that we find required in multiple neural circuits, however, new sensor reagents will be required to validate these and study their regulation in vivo. Core B will make and quality control these three types of reagents before they are distributed to our collaborators and the community by Core A."
"9279981","! TR&D1: 3D Printed Bioreactors for Cell Culture Project Summary Traditional treatments for bone injuries have significant limitations. While over one million allogenic and autologous bone grafting procedures are performed each year, significant incidences of medical complications - often involving modest viability, poor integration, or an immune response - still occur. Therefore, the flexibility provided by an in vitro cultured, engineered tissue provides an excellent avenue to repair and replace damaged bone tissue. This approach involves seeding and growing a cell source on a scaffold and implanting the cell-laden construct into the injury site. However, the culture of large volume engineered tissues - and particularly cell viability, expansion, proliferation, and differentiation in these large tissues - is limited by current culture techniques. To address this concern, TR&D1 aims to develop a 3D printed (3DP) bioreactor as a dynamic culture system to control cellular microenvironment and therefore promote cell viability, expansion, proliferation, and differentiation within large engineered constructs. To this end, we have recently developed a tubular perfusion system (TPS) bioreactor that enables the expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells, the differentiation of these cells into osteoblasts, and the subsequent formation of boney tissue. Based on our earlier TPS bioreactor, we will use 3D printing to fabricate specialized bioreactor chambers with variable architecture, controlled flow environments, and spatially located cell populations; thus, we can ensure adequate availability of nutrients and oxygen for the expansion of stem cells within these large constructs. Furthermore, 3D printing control of the spatial location of cell populations will allow us to determine interactions between multiple cell populations, such as mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Finally, we will utilize the strategies developed in the in vitro 3D bioreactor chambers to fabricate removable, biodegradable scaffolds of engineered bone tissues that are suitable for in vivo application. The results of these studies will deliver a 3DP bioreactor system that can support the growth of large engineered tissues, while also providing a set of tools to develop other, similarly designed, tissue specific bioreactor systems. !"
"9312194","Millions of Americans and people worldwide suffer bone diseases due to injuries, bone defects, and spinal defects, and therefore are in great need of effective treatments to regenerate bone and promote bone growth. Among treatments being explored in modern medicine, administration of growth factors that prompt our own body to regrow bone represents an attractive direction due to its non-invasiveness and utilization of our own cells, including bone- forming stem cells. Such treatment with bone growth factors has been approved by the FDA and is successfully used in clinics, however a recognized drawback of this treatment is that the administration of extremely high doses of very pure growth factor inevitably causes severe side effects in some patients. Our team believes current high doses are not necessary, with better tactics to present growth factors to cells, e.g. 5 growth factors bound together as a well-defined cluster versus 1000 individual growth factor molecules swimming around the cells. With this research, we hope to develop more effective ways to present growth factors than the current approach of injecting high dosage. Our approach is inspired by the way nature itself ?administers? these growth factors, which is always in combination with other proteins that provide the necessary context and help fine-tune cellular responses. This proposal builds on our discovery that COMP, a protein originally isolated from cartilage, can bind to multiple bone growth factors all at once. We plan to study how the COMP binds to growth factors, how many growth factors each COMP can carry (1 to 10), and which of the situations work best towards bone regeneration. We believe our results shall demonstrate that this multi-valent binding provides a new platform to present the growth factors to stem cells, to which cells respond with dramatically enhanced activities including robust bone formation and growth. The results from this investigation shall greatly enhance our current understanding of how bone growth factors regulate bone formation at the cellular level, and bring us a giant step closer to non-invasive and stem cell based therapy for bone regeneration."
"9312511","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The recent large scale production of whole genome sequence and other multi-omics in TOPMed and other projects calls for parallel development of comprehensive, powerful and flexible toolset capable of large data management, analysis and integration. Mega/integrated analyses are essential to fully utilize these data to elucidate the complexity of the biological mechanisms and advance our understanding of complex trait biology to drive precision medicine. TOPMed estimates that the VCF for 60,000 subjects will contain 400M variants and require 100TB of space, and much of our current genetic analysis toolset does not scale up to these data sizes. For rare variant analysis, mixed model mega analysis is more powerful than meta-analysis as mega analysis can include additional random effects to account for genetic relatedness between all subjects and cross-study phenotypic, genetic and environmental heterogeneity. However cross-study mega analysis within the mixed model is still an uncharted territory. We believe mega analysis will spur more creative analysis approaches provided the needed toolsets are available. In cloud computing ?time is money?, and new approaches are required to solve structural differences in resource allocation and data access compared to local computing. MMAP (Mixed Models for Analysis of Pedigrees/Populations) is robust mixed model software that already published mixed model analysis on a sample size of 90,000 that included dominance variance and developed a cloud-efficient version of mixed model rare variant analysis. The goal of this proposal is to further expand and improve this toolset to deliver to the research community a flexible, versatile, and comprehensive cross-platform mixed model toolset scalable to efficient local and cloud analysis of large WGS and omics data. We plan to implement several new features in our toolset including: 1) Efficient binary genotype file format for optimal storage of terabyte VCF genotypes. 2) Large-scale modeling of non-additive variation such as dominance, X- lined, mitochondrial and epistasis. 3) Optimized rare variant analysis with flexible integration of annotation and variant weighting resources. 4) Optimized expression/epigenome-wide association (EWA) analysis. 5) Comprehensive multi-omics integration into the mixed model as fixed and random effects. 6) Development of a multi-omics simulation software to guide systems biology modeling. 7) Integrating mixed model equations for prediction from animal breeding. This proposal will deliver the research community an analysis toolset that will push research boundaries well beyond additive SNP association to a space filled with complex biological fixed and random effects models integrating the full spectrum of multi-omics data. We plan to develop a multi-omics simulation tool to better understand the complex evolutionary processes that shape the complex trait landscape. Our toolset will be extensively shaped by collaboration with TOPMed working groups to meet analysis priorities and develop analysis plans. Our toolset will surely evolve in novel and unexpected directions in response to new ideas and challenges as we dive deeper into this unique data set."
"9307364","Project Summary Reducing reimbursement levels within a fee-for-service environment is a promising approach for reducing ineffective and unproven care when revoking coverage entirely or shifting financial risk to providers are infeasible. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was rapidly adopted into practice as a treatment for breast and prostate cancer patients in the early to mid-2000s despite the absence of high quality evidence demonstrating its superiority to conventional radiotherapy. Based on the rising volume of claims for IMRT and a Wall St. Journal article calling attention to the perverse incentives inherent in physician self-referral for IMRT, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cut the payment rate for IMRT by 15% between 2012 and 2013. Using Medicare claims data, we propose to study the impact of the payment cut on the use of IMRT and medical costs. We will study trends in the use of IMRT across three patient groups that differ in their ability to benefit from IMRT: prostate cancer patients receiving initial treatment, prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy following prostatectomy, and breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery. We will use several strategies to accurately estimate the impact of the payment cut. The magnitude of the cut differed across CMS payment areas. We will determine if declines in the use of IMRT were larger in areas that experienced steeper cuts. Separately, we will compare trends in the use of IMRT in three practice settings that differ in terms of the impact of the cut on practice income: self-referring physician offices, non-self-referring physician offices, and hospital outpatient departments (which were unaffected by the cut)."
"9307257","Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions."
"9246989","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We had previously identified a new mammalian A-type cyclin, cyclin A1, in addition to the already known cyclin A2. We showed that cyclin A1 is testis-specific and by targeted mutagenesis, that it is essential for spermatogenesis--spermatocytes arrest at the diplotene to metaphase 1 transition. As knockouts of the more ubiquitously expressed cyclin A2 resulted in early embryonic lethality, we generated a conditional knockout model (A2CKO) and discovered unexpected and important functions of cyclin A2 in hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells. We have now also generated A2CKO models lacking cyclin A2 expression in undifferentiated type A spermatogonia, which results in a severe disruption of spermatogenesis and sterility. In Aim 1 of this renewal, we will determine the effects of loss of cyclin A2 function in different stages of spermatogonial development and in primordial germ cells (PGCs). We will determine which cell types require cyclin A2 for proliferation, where in the cell cycle the arrest occurs, and the fate of spermatogonia lacking cyclin A2 (Aim 1a). We will then extend these observation by ablating cyclin A2 in PGCs and in embryonic and post- natal gonocytes (Aim 1b) and in later stages of post-natal spermatogonial differentiation (Aim 1c), using our floxed Ccna2 mice and selected Cre deleter lines. We will begin to address the fundamental question of why higher organisms have evolved two A-type cyclins by asking if cyclin A1 and cyclin A2 are functionally redundant, using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We previously showed that loss of cyclin A1 results in a very specific and completely penetrant arrest of meiotic prophase spermatocytes just before the first meiotic division and have begun to identify key regulatory regions of the Ccna1 gene. We therefore propose to knock-in cyclin A2 coding sequences into the Ccna1 locus and examine the effects on meiotic progression, that is, can cyclin A2 function in place of cyclin A1 if expressed at the correct time? Finally, to further address the function of cyclin A1 in spermatocytes and to extend assessment of functional redundancy, in Aim 3 we will identify candidate testicular substrates of cyclin A1 and cyclin A2 complexed with their catalytic partners CDK1 and CDK2. This will be accomplished by fractionating lysates from spermatocytes and immature testes and subjecting them to phosphorylation by active cyclin A1- and A2-CDK complexes in which the ATP-binding pocket of the CDK is mutated so that it can readily accept modified ATP analogues, which endogenous kinases cannot (the Shokat strategy). These studies will provide novel insights into the function of the mammalian A-type cyclins, information that cannot be obtained from simpler model systems such as yeast, which lack this class of cyclins, or Drosophila, which contain only a single A-type cyclin. Our findings will enhance our understanding of the control of meiosis as it relates to male infertility, possibly suggest new targets for contraception, and provide critical insight into the unique properties of cell cycle regulation in stem cells, which i highly relevant in both normal development and in oncogenesis."
"9259810","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has become a global health problem and currently affects ~35% of the US population, with estimated medical costs ranging between $86 and $210 billion per year. Chronic inflammation associated with obesity often leads to insulin resistance and, eventually, type-2 diabetes. Abdominal fat in particular is closely associated with an increased cardiovascular risk of hypertension, atherosclerosis, stroke, and cancer. Surprisingly, very little is known about the initial mechanisms leading to abdominal adipose deposition. Interestingly, dietary lipids are absorbed primarily by lymphatic capillaries in the microvilli and transported to collecting lymphatic vessels in the mesentery, which are normally surrounded by adipose tissue. Despite long- standing associations between lymphatic vessel leakage and adipose tissue deposition, no studies have been performed to determine whether pathophysiological lymphatic leakage can lead to adipose deposition when lymphatic vessels are not genetically deformed or mispatterned (i.e. whether normally developed but leaky lymphatic vessels can cause adipose deposition). The dearth of studies in this area stems from the lack of a method to measure lymphatic permeability to solute. I recently developed a quantitative method that enables rapid, repeatable measurements of collecting lymphatic vessel permeability for the first time, and permits pharmacologic manipulation. Further, I have combined this method with genetic mouse models to identify mechanistic regulators of lymphatic permeability (e.g. nitric oxide, histamine) and to demonstrate that collecting lymphatics from obese, leptin receptor knockout mice have a markedly elevated permeability. The goal of the proposed research is to determine the role of lymphatic vascular permeability in mesenteric adipose deposition, including investigating crosstalk with adipose tissue and dendritic cells. In the mentored phase of this work (Aim 1), I will create a leaky lymphatic vasculature by using an inducible mouse model to delete a crucial regulator of endothelial barrier function, ?-catenin, specifically from lymphatic vessels and not blood vessels. This model will be used to test whether leakage from normally patterned lymphatic vessels is sufficient to lead to significant mesenteric adipose deposition. In the independent phase, I will then determine how inflammatory mesenteric adipose tissue increases collecting lymphatic vessel permeability and whether T-cells that infiltrate the adipose tissue are responsible (Aim 2). Additionally, I will determine whether dendritic cells residing in the lymphatic vessel wall protec against increases in lymphatic permeability, or instead elevate lymphatic permeability (Aim 3). The novel concept of elevated lymphatic permeability as a regulator of adipose deposition will improve the understanding of chronic inflammatory diseases that are associated with adipose tissue (e.g. Crohn's disease, lymphedema). Ultimately, therapeutic targets that tighten the lymphatic endothelial barrier may offer a new approach to prevent adipose deposition in obesity, thereby reducing the incidence of associated cardiovascular diseases."
"9264466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevention of cognitive decline and dementia is a major public health priority. The Memory and Aging Project (MAP) has made considerable progress elucidating the complex relationships between risk factors, common neuropathologies and resilience markers that increase or decrease the rate of cognitive decline, and risk of dementia. In nearly 200 peer-reviewed manuscripts, we reported genetic, medical, experiential, and psychological factors associated with increased or decreased rates of cognitive decline and dementia risk. We reported that Alzheimer's, vascular, and Lewy body pathologies (AD, CVD, LBD) explain about 40% of the variation of cognitive decline, and that resilience markers (e.g., cortical presynaptic proteins and locus coeruleus neurons) were associated with a slower rate of decline accounting for 8% of the variation, and that many risk factors with little direct relation o pathologies or resilience markers accounted for >10% of the variation of decline, controlling for pathologies. Additional factors related to cognitive decline await discovery. The overall goal of the planned continuation of MAP is to discover additional proteins associated with the slope of cognitive decline, after accounting for the effects of common pathologies. We use the term residual cognitive decline to describe this innovative primary study outcome. Methods to interrogate the genome, and therefore, the proteome, have improved markedly over the past decade, making the discovery of proteins that underlie cognitive decline both timely and feasible. We plan to continue collecting clinical and post-mortem data on MAP participants. Aim 1, Discovery and Verification Phase, will combine omics-wide association studies with innovative integrative pathway analyses on genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from human brain from 500 MAP participants to discover proteins associated with residual cognitive decline; it will select 200 proteins for quantitation in human brain to verify that protein level i associated with residual cognitive decline. Aim 2, Validation Phase, will quantify the 200 proteins selected and verified in Aim 1 with a new sample of 350 brains from MAP participants that will accrue by the end the funding period, followed by a joint statistical analysis to increas power (n=850). Aim 3 will link the validated proteins to the wealth of available risk factor data t discover novel biologic pathways linking risk factors to cognitive decline and dementia. Our plan is supported by extensive and compelling new preliminary data that demonstrate its high likelihood of success and demonstrate that the study is innovative, high yield and low risk. The continuation of MAP will discover additional proteins associated with cognitive decline and novel biologic pathways linking risk factors to cognitive decline. These proteins will represent either unknown pathologies that increase rates of cognitive decline or resilience markers that decrease rates of cognitive decline. Both sets of proteins will offer new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and dementia. Thus, the study has the potential to have a high and sustained impact on aging and dementia research."
"9249490","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic itch is a presenting sign in numerous diseases associated with the skin, the immune, and the nervous systems. Chronic itch is largely resistant to conventional antihistamines, and few effective therapies are available. We have previously uncovered a small subset of itch- specific neurons which express gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), an itch receptor, in the spinal cord. GRPR+ neurons are required for pruritoceptive but not for nociceptive transmission. We have also begun to elucidate the function of neuromedin B receptor (NMBR), another itch receptor in the spinal cord. Our goal is to investigate fundamental mechanisms of itch transmission. We will take advantage of several unique mouse lines to examine the dorsal horn itch circuitry at the single cell level. Aim 1 will determine neurochemical, anatomic and electrophysiological properties of GRPR neurons. We will examine the neurotransmitter phenotype of GRPR neurons and whether GRPR neurons are projection or interneurons by retrograde labeling. We will also examine electrophysiological properties of GRPR neurons using whole cell patch-clamp recording. Aim 2 will determine the synaptic mechanisms underlying GRP-mediated itch transmission. We will test the hypothesis that GRP-evoked excitation of GRPR neurons is mediated by modulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and GRP-dependent mechanism is differentially involved in pruritogens-induced pruriceptive transmission. We will also determine the role of glutamatergic input in this process and examine whether nonhistaminergic and histaminergic pruritogen act through GRP and iGluRs. Aim 3 will determine molecular properties and function of itch-sensing neurons in chronic itch condition. We will determine whether ectopic GRPR expression induced in chronic itch condition is dependent on primary GRPR neurons by cell ablation approach. Moreover, we will characterize the electric properties of GRPR neurons in chronic itch condition. Finally, we will examine the role of NMBR neurons in itch sensation using NMB-saporin approach."
"9244029","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research is to identify how visual impairment impacts the safety and performance of older drivers. Driving cessation in older adults is tied to many negative health indicators including increased risk for depression, reduced access to healthcare services, and increased likelihood of placement into long-term-care. The societal significance of research on older drivers is dramatically apparent when we recognize that vision impairment is common in the older adult population, and that older drivers have among the highest rates of motor vehicle collisions compared to other age groups. A critical scientific challenge is to identify what aspects of vision are required for safe driving by older adults. Previous research on older driver safety and performance has focused on the study of police accident reports, brief driving evaluations, or driving simulator studies. These techniques have serious scientific limitations; crash studies do not provide information about what lead up to the collision; in on-road studies research personnel are in the vehicle potentially biasing how the driver behaves; simulator studies present artificial, cartoon-like scenarios that over-simplify the roadway environment. All these issues undermine the ability to understand the actual visual factors underlying driver performance and safety. Naturalistic driving methods overcome these limitations by unobtrusively placing multiple sensors and video cameras in the vehicle that record vehicle kinematics, driver behaviors (e.g., gaze behavior), and roadway environment. They allow driving to be studied in an objective way over lengthy time periods (months) in the driver's own vehicle where the driver chooses the route during the course of everyday life. In this research we will use naturalistic driving techniques to examine the relationships between vision and older driver safety and performance. We focus on older drivers with normal vision and those with contrast sensitivity deficits and slowed visual processing speed, since these problems are the strongest and most consistently identified visual risk factors for driving problems in the older adult population. Analyses will focus on the relationship between vision and critical safety events (crashes, near-crashes), lane-keeping, turning at intersections, driving under secondary tasks demands, and when a co-pilot (passenger) is present. These relationships will be examined in light of other driver characteristics, environmental factors, and vehicle factors. Driving performance as measured by naturalistic driving methods will also be compared to driving ratings provided by a driving rehabilitation specialist on a standardized driving route, which is currently the clinical gold standard. This research will stimulate the development of interventions to enhance driving mobility in visually impaired older adults and thus improve quality of life."

"9258331","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):    This resubmission of a renewal application proposes studies to elucidate key mechanisms that regulate the function of the two ?3 integrins, ?IIb?3 and ?V?3, and should apply to integrins n general. Analyses will be performed to define the molecular mechanisms, which regulate the functions of these integrins and govern their contribution to the adhesive and migratory properties of cells. The target cells for analysis will be primarily endothelial cells and myeloid cells but will be relevant to all blood cells including platelets. These cells are all exposed to blood and the functions of their integrins must be tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled binding of their plentiful ligands. The integrin regulatory molecules of emphasis are kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 and talin. Kindlins and talin control the activation of the integrins. Understanding the structure and function relationships that determine the activities of these molecules, their mechanisms of action, and the signaling pathways which regulate their function are primary objectives of the program. The emphasis of these studies will not only be on their role in controlling inside-out signaling, i.e., integrin activation, but also on their role in outside-in signaling via their regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, the strategies proposed wil allow identification of entirely novel functions of the kindlins unrelated to integrins.  The Progrm consists of three projects, each directed by an independent and productive faculty member in The Department of Molecular Cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Edward F. Plow, Ph.D., will serve as Program Director and lead Project 1. This project deals with the mechanism by which kindlin-2 regulates inside-out and outside-in signaling across integrins and exerts its integrin-independent functions. In Project 2, Dr. Jun Qin will use high resolution structural approaches to determine how talin and kindlin-2 regulate integrin activation, exploring what seem to be paradigm shifting leads. The regulation of the integrin activating and actin binding functions of talin will also be dissected. Dr. Tatiana Byzova leads Project 3 and focuses how kindlin-3 regulates the integrins. The focus of her studies will be how integrin regulation by kindlin-3 in endothelial and myeloid cells contributes to angiogenesis. The Program is supported by two Scientific Cores, Imaging and In Vivo (SC1), and Protein Expression and Mutagenesis (SC2) as well as by an Administrative Core (AC1). A common objective of the Program is to continue and create new collaborations among the Projects to resolve the structural and biological mechanisms that regulate the functions of the ?3 integrins.  The information derived from these studies will provide insights into the complex and biologically important responses regulated by integrins and their activation that are relevant to thrombosis, angiogenesis and other cardiovascular diseases."
"9242572","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor gene, is frequently inactivated by mutation or deletion in a majority of human tumors. A tremendous effort has been made to restore p53 activity in cancer therapies. However, no effective p53-based therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment due to the complexity of p53 signaling. Therefore, identification of vulnerabilities conferred by TP53 deletion or mutation is a major challenge to target p53 aberrancy in human cancer. We demonstrate that genomic deletion of TP53 frequently encompasses neighboring essential genes, rendering cancer cells with hemizygous TP53 deletion vulnerable to further suppression of such genes. POLR2A is identified as such a gene that is always co-deleted with TP53 in human cancers. Hemizygous loss of TP53/POLR2A occurs in 53% of colorectal cancers (CRC), 62% of breast cancers, 75% of ovarian cancers, and 41% of pancreatic cancers. POLR2A encodes the largest and catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II complex. It is specifically inhibited by ?-Amanitin, a cyclic 8-aa peptide toxin found in the death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides). POLR2A expression levels are tightly correlated with its gene copy numbers in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Suppression of POLR2A selectively inhibits proliferation, survival and tumorigenic potential of CRC cells with hemizygous TP53 loss in a p53- independent manner. Previous clinical applications of ?-Amanitin have been limited due to its liver toxicity. Free ?-Amanitin causes apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes by interacting with the hepatocyte-specific transporting protein OATP1B3 (10). However, ?-Amanitin is no longer substrate for OATP1B3 when coupled to antibodies. Therefore, ?-Amanitin-based antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly effective therapeutic agents with significantly reduced toxicity. Our study has shown that low doses of ?-Amanitin-conjugated anti- EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) antibody lead to complete tumor regression in murine models of human CRC with hemizygous deletion of POLR2A. The preclinical studies in this application were recently published in Nature, which provide the foundation for future clinical trials. There is already discussion regarding the potential for initiation of a clinical trial based on our work. We propose that hemizygous deletion of TP53 in human cancers creates a therapeutic window between normal and cancer cells, and that PORL2A is a novel and druggable target in cancers with such genomic alterations."
"9286399","Overall summary Hookworms infect nearly one billion people worldwide, and are a leading cause of anemia and malnutrition in resource-limited countries. Current global strategies to control hookworm and other Soil Transmitted Helminths rely on repeated mass drug administration of albendazole. Recent evidence confirms that deworming drugs are losing effectiveness against hookworm in endemic areas, and the emergence of genetically mediated resistance would have potentially devastating public health implications. The studies in adults and school-age children conducted in the Kintampo North Municipality (KNM), Ghana confirm the overall poor efficacy of albendazole. We hypothesize that treatment responses and reinfections are associated with the nutritional and immune status of the individual, community practices, and parasites' genetics, implying that there is multifactorial mechanism of hookworm treatment failure. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose to conduct research in four specific domains; epidemiology, immunology, parasite population genetics and identification of molecular biomarkers of albendazole resistance for monitoring and surveillance. Over the course of the 5 year study period, this TMRC project will support collaborative research and training to build capacity in parasitic diseases research, building on the longstanding record of the Ghana-Yale Partnership for Global Health and recently, with UMASS."
"9234046","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene silencing is essential for normal development and protection of the genome from selfish genetic elements, such as retroposons. Perturbation of normal gene silencing results in genomic instability, impaired response to DNA damage, progression from normal to premalignant states, and eventually to cancer. While progress has been made in understanding silencing mechanisms in condensed heterochromatin, the silencing of genes in open euchromatin is less well understood. For example, recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to heterochromatic regions is essential for maintenance of the silent state. However, we have found that the mouse Mixed-Lineage Leukemia 5 (MLL5) protein and its Drosophila ortholog, UpSET, recruit HDACs to active genes to modulate open chromatin, fine-tune gene expression, and prevent inappropriate activation of silent neighboring genes. In addition, while histone turnover and the histone deposition machinery are essential for gene expression in differentiated cells, using novel methodology developed in our lab, we found that they are also key players in establishing gene silencing in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Our proposed experiments use genetic, developmental, cell biology, biochemical, and molecular approaches in complementary systems (mice and flies) to determine the mechanisms underlying these novel regulatory pathways and elucidate their roles in hematopoiesis and stem cell biology. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Define the mechanisms by which MLL5/UpSET containing complexes modulate transcription. Using our novel protein tethering method we will determine the transcriptional role of mammalian MLL5 containing complexes in hematopoiesis. Taking advantage of the functional and structural conservation of the Drosophila ortholog of MLL5, UpSET, we will define how recruitment of these proteins modulates transcribed chromatin architecture around promoter regions to precisely orchestrate gene expression. 2. Elucidate the functional role of MLL5 in DNA damage response and repair. Like other proteins involved in gene silencing, MLL5 also participates in DNA damage repair. We will elucidate the role of MLL5 complexes in the DNA damage response and determine how mutation of Mll5 alters this response. We will also determine if lack of MLL5 increases tumor incidence or latency in tumor-sensitive backgrounds. Such results would provide the molecular basis for the DNA damage sensitivity of Mll5 null mice and association of poor prognosis preleukemic syndromes with haploinsufficiency of chromosome band 7q22 where human MLL5 resides. 3. Discover the molecular mechanisms by which SRCAP mediates silencing in ESCs and how perturbation of this silencing impacts hematopoiesis. We will elucidate the molecular basis of a previously unknown ESC silencing mechanism we recently discovered involving the Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein (SRCAP) H2A.Z deposition complex and polycomb repressive complex (PRC)1. We will determine how H2A.Z deposition by SRCAP underlies PRC1-mediated silencing and shapes the ESC and hematopoietic transcriptional landscapes."
"9248859","CORE C: ABSTRACT This ADRC has comprehensive and demanding translational research objectives, for which the Data Management and Statistics (DMS) core must be able to efficiently collect, validate, integrate, and derive meaning from a complex array of data. Key questions about diagnosis, clinical features, natural history, interactions between genotype and phenotype, clinico-pathological relationships, and connections between structural and functional brain changes and neurobehavioral disturbances can only be addressed with sophisticated and comprehensive data structures, and with the support of a cohesive team of expert statistical personnel. Thus, the DMS Core for this ADRC has a particular mandate to support and facilitate our researchers' ability to link the complex, multilevel data we collect, and to approach that data with the sophisticated and appropriate recommendations for research design and analytic methods. In the next phase of this ADRC, we will incorporate new innovations to the DMS that will enable our researchers to better identify and integrate multilevel data collected through the ADRC, while enabling us to link ADRC data with other resources at UCSF. Historically, the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC) has shown national leadership in developing data management systems that integrate a wealth of information from a variety of sources in order to better understand the etiology and treatment of dementia syndromes and promote translational research. The core mandate of this DMS is to ensure that: (1) the measurement of behavioral, cognitive, neurological, imaging and genetic information is supported by scientifically sound techniques that result in a consistent classification of information (i.e., results are reliable and reproducible); (2) that the observed phenomena are accurately recorded and reflected in the database; (3) that the database is secure, preventing unauthorized changes; (4) that analytical data sets are easily accessible to collaborating investigators within and beyond the ADRC; and (5) that meaningful patterns in the data are identified using appropriate and efficient research design and statistical methods. We plan to augment these core functions by elaborating our representation of multiple levels of neurological information in order to improve our ability to model complex patterns and associations in our patients. We have also enhanced our plan for delivery of statistical consultation and have added biostatistical personnel. These improvements will build upon the solid foundation that we have established, and ensure that we will continue to provide the program structure required for the highest level of data collection, management, quality control, and timely NACC data submission."
"9251803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cathinone and methcathinone are the ß-ketone analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine, respectively, and like their amphetamine analogs, cathinone and methcathinone function as monoamine releasers that selectively promote the release of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) over serotonin (5-HT). Cathinone and methcathinone produce amphetamine-like, psychostimulant effects and are classified as Schedule I drugs of abuse by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Recently, synthetic cathinone analogs have emerged as designer drugs of abuse in Europe and the United States and have been marketed under deceptively benign names like bath salts in an attempt to evade legal restriction. These dangerous, recently emergent and novel drugs of abuse display varying selectivity to promote release of DA/NE vs. 5-HT, and selectivity for DA neurotransmission is believed to correlate with abuse liability. This F30 application proposes preclinical research to examine the structural determinants of abuse-related behavioral and neurochemical effects produced by synthetic cathinone bath salts. To evaluate structural determinants of the abuse-related stimulant effects of cathinone derivatives, this application will  focus on one feature of the methcathinone scaffold: the para substituent of the benzene ring. A series of six novel methcathinone derivatives will be examined in order to evaluate how physicochemical parameters (steric volume, lipophilicity and electron-donating/withdrawing capacity) of the para substituent of methcathinone derivatives influence in vitro monoamine transporter selectivity as well as in vivo neurochemical and behavioral effects. We hypothesize that electronic features of the para substituent will correlate with neurochemical selectivity to promote DA vs. 5-HT release as determined by in vivo microdialysis and behavioral selectivity to produce abuse-related effects as determined by intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Completion of this project will provide an improved understanding of the mechanism of synthetic cathinone analogs' abuse-related effects, allowing for development of novel strategies for treating bath salts intoxication and improvement of clinical outcomes associated with bath salts abuse."
"9265127","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrins ?IIb?3 and ?5?1 are cell adhesion receptors that bind extracellular ligands, transduce signals bidirectionally across plasma membranes, and play important roles in the vasculature. Ligand binding and integrin activation are coupled to two distinct, large conformational changes, extension at the integrin knees and opening of the ligand-binding headpiece. On cell surfaces, integrins dynamically equilibrate between two low affinity conformations, bent-closed and extended-closed, and a high affinity extended-open conformation. Investigating integrin conformational equilibria, which have never been measured for any integrin, is paramount for understanding how the conformational ensemble dictates the functional output of integrins. Furthermore, how ligands bind integrins and drive headpiece opening remain incompletely understood. Aim 1 continues work on integrin ?IIb?3, which recognizes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif. We characterize binding of an AGDV peptide from fibrinogen, which lacks the Arg of RGD, and demonstrate that its engagement of the MIDAS in the ?-subunit is sufficient to open the integrin headpiece. We also complete work on the structural basis for quinine-dependent antibody binding to platelet integrin ?IIb?3, which causes  drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP). Aim 2 focuses on another RGD-binding integrin, ?5?1, which binds its primary ligand fibronectin (Fn) and directs its assembly into the  extracellular matrix. Their interaction is important for angiogenesis, vascular development, and cancer progression. Intriguingly, ?5?1 also binds the non-RGD ligand Invasin (Inv) to mediate bacterial internalization of Yersenia spp. that cause plague and gastroenteritis. We characterize the conformational states of ?5?1 ectodomain by negative stain electron microscopy. We examine complexes of ?5?1 with function-perturbing Fabs and Inv to define their binding sites and the integrin conformations they stabilize. Aim 3 investigates crystal structures of the ?5?1 headpiece and its complexes with Fn and Inv fragments. Structures will illustrate how RGD in Fn3 module 10 and the synergy site in Fn3 module 9 bind ?5?1 and the extent to which the non-RGD ligand Inv mimics Fn binding, and provide insight into how binding of different ligands affect headpiece opening. Aim 4 measures conformational equilibria for ?5?1, and how conformational equilibria mix with the intrinsic affinity of a specific integrin conformation for ligand to yield the apparent affinity measured for an integrin ectodomain fragment or an intact integrin on the cell surface. For the first time, the conformational equilibria for integrin extenson and headpiece opening will be separately measured, and related to regulation of affinity for fibronectin. The effects of transmembrane domain association, glycosylation state, and oncogenic cell transformation on conformational equilibria of ?5?1 are also studied. Results from our work will guide the design of higher affinity and novel non-RGD based ?5?1-inhibitors as therapeutics for pathological angiogenesis and cancer."
"9272704","Project Summary/Abstract We request funds to purchase a ForteBio Octet Red384 instrument to measure protein-protein interactions. To maximize research productivity, the upgraded instrument will be placed in the Oregon Health & Science University Proteomics Shared Resource. The only instruments that measure rates and affinities of protein-protein interactions available at OHSU provide very low throughput, and new instrument is required to increase research productivity at our institution. The new instrument will be used to study the cause and treatment of several diseases including psychiatric disorders, HIV, hearing loss, and anemia, as well as to study methods for treating those diseases. Purified proteins will be analyzed by binding one partner to cheap and dispensable biosensor probes, then using biolayer interferometry to measure binding of a second protein with high sensitivity. The Octet Red384 can efficiently measure many complete sets of interactions per day, each involving 6-8 protein concentrations and producing both kon and koff as well as KD. The introduction of this instrument will fulfill the growing needs of the researchers at the OHSU to incorporate state-of-the-art tools in protein chemistry into their research.

"9265305","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over two-thirds of the US population is categorized as overweight or obese. This obesity epidemic is largely driven by the excessive intake of palatable and unhealthy foods. Both the size of an individual meal and the frequency of meal or snack initiation are heavily influenced by previous experience and by exposure to environmental food-associated stimuli (e.g. visual, olfactory) that can override homeostatic mechanisms of feeding. Therefore, the development of effective pharmacological treatments for obesity requires a deeper understanding of the neurobiological systems that integrate previous experience with external cues to control feeding behavior. Preliminary data in this proposal together with recent published work implicate the ventral subregion of the hippocampus (vHP) as a mediator of these higher-order aspects of feeding behavior. The vHP expresses receptors for the gut-derived hormone, ghrelin (GHSR1-As), that when pharmacologically activated, potently increases overall food intake, meal size and frequency, and food-motivated behavior. However, whether ghrelin signaling in the vHP is physiologically relevant for excessive food intake and obesity development is unknown. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the downstream neural substrates involved in vHP ghrelin signaling also requires deeper examination. The primary goals of this proposal are to test the novel hypotheses that chronic down-regulation of ghrelin signaling in the vHP will reduce meal size and frequency, attenuate learned associations between rewarding food and external stimuli, and increase resistance to obesity development (Aim I), as well as to determine the important neural targets and neural circuitry mediating vHP ghrelin signaling (Aim II). To address these hypotheses, experiments in Aim 1 will use localized virogenetic knockdown of GHSR1-As in the vHP in conjunction with novel behavioral paradigms that examine learned associations between the environment and palatable food. Aim II will utilize neuroanatomical, immunohistochemistry methods as well as virogenetic, neuropharmacological, and behavioral techniques to determine the downstream neural targets mediating these hyperphagic effects, focusing on the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Experiments in Aim II will also examine the interaction between vHP ghrelin signaling and reward-related neuropeptidergic systems present in the LHA (orexin) and the mPFC (dopaminergic type-1 receptor signaling)."

"9209557","The role of the cytokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs) function and bone homeostasis was the focus of our previous work in the original PO1 Project 3. The novel outcomes from those studies are driving the current goals in this competitive renewal. The mechanisms involved in aging-related osteoporosis remain poorly defined, however, recent studies from our group, and others, suggest that it is a stem cell disease. A critical problem is that aging triggers impaired localization, proliferation, survival, and differentiation of the osteogenic progenitor cell population in the bone marrow (BM), specifically BMSCs. A critical barrier to preventing these changes is identifying key regulatory pathways, and being able to alter or correct them. Our goal is to use information generated from our original PO1, where we have identified epigenetic changes in a subset of miRNAs in BMSCs, and to target these miRNAs to limit, or reverse, bone loss. Age-associated changes in SDF-1 systemically alter epigenetic regulatory systems, specifically miRNAs, in BMSCs, which in turn directly, and via nutrient signaling pathways, affect cell survival, osteogenesis and bone formation. SDF-1 is tightly regulated translationally, transcriptionally, and post- transcriptionally. We have identified age-associated changes in the SDF-1 axis. Here we show that SDF-1 is not only a target of novel age-associated miRNA epigenetic regulation, but itself alters expression of miRNAs that change with age in BMSCs and target the SDF-1 axis. Significantly, a key miRNA that we identified to increase with age in BMSCs (miR-29b-1-5p) belongs to the miR29 family of miRNAs that have been shown to be critical in extracellular matrix homeostasis and osteogenesis. What is novel, and a challenge to the existing paradigm, is that miR29b-1-5p is the ?passenger strand?, which is normally thought to be degraded leaving the complementary miR-29b-1-3p ?guide strand? as the functional miRNA. Understanding the mechanism that drives this previously unknown age-associated increase in the passenger strand is a critical goal because we have demonstrated that miR29b-1-5p regulates SDF-1 expression and suppresses BMSC osteogenesis and survival pathways. We propose to test the hypothesis that the elevated age-related levels of circulating SDF-1 and decreased bone marrow compartment levels and activity regulate the increased expression of miR-29b-1- 5p and downstream effects on bone homeostasis. Our objectives are to test new hypotheses derived from the findings of the original PO1 by manipulating the miRNAs we identified as changing with age in human/murine BMSCs to determine their effects on bone formation and turnover in vivo and at the molecular level on BMSC osteogenic function. We will test novel methods to reduce expression of these miRNAs, including altering nutritional pathways leading to bone loss by using specific forms of dietary amino acid and delivering synthetic anti-miRNAs to inhibit them. The impact of this project will be demonstrating the role of age-associated changes of BMSC miRNAs and identifying novel targets for reducing, or reversing, age related bone loss."

The proposed equipment is a Sofie Biosciences Elixys Flex/ Chem reaction module with an accompanying Capintec hotcell, both of which would be the first of their kind at Vanderbilt. The proposed equipment will greatly enhance and expand the existing NIH-supported clinical and preclinical research projects that utilize research positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals. We have specifically selected this instrumentation because it will meet the needs of our NIH-funded Core user base and will integrate seamlessly into our existing laboratory environment. Since the launch of the Radiochemistry Core Laboratory in 2010, the annual number of requests for research PET tracers at Vanderbilt has more than doubled. This growth is consistent with major increases in the volume of NIH-funded projects that either utilize or develop PET tracers in clinical and preclinical research and a major Institutional effort to encourage the development of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for PET tracers. Coupled with increased volume, the pace of NIH-funded PET imaging research at Vanderbilt has accelerated dramatically over the last two years, stemming from a recent doubling of clinical and preclinical PET scanning capability. Overall, these factors have led to a tremendous need for additional radiochemistry infrastructure to adequately support current and emerging PET imaging research programs at Vanderbilt. In this application, we highlight numerous NIH-supported projects that will directly benefit in multiple ways from the acquisition of this resource. This application includes a description of each NIH-funded project that would directly benefit from this resource, a description of the scientific and technical expertise of those individuals who will oversee and manage the resource, a plan for administration, and a strong commitment from Vanderbilt University to provide support for the resource."

"9279413","The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue three courses in Molecular Biology, Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, whose methodologies are important for modern cancer research, to be held in 2017 ? 2021. These short, intensive courses include Expression, Purification & Analysis of Proteins and Protein Complexes (two weeks), Mouse Development, Stem Cells & Cancer (three weeks) and Chromatin, Epigenetics and Gene Expression (three weeks). Each course prepares the student to enter directly into research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized techniques and concepts that can be applied to studies of growth and regulation of normal eukaryotic cells and their oncogenic counterparts. Each course has a different emphasis and serves a different need. The course in Expression, Purification & Analysis of Proteins and Protein Complexes seeks to train students in the theory and practice of methods of protein expression, purification and analysis. These methods can be used for the characterization and production of proteins and protein complexes implicated in cancer, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and signaling molecules and cascades. The course on Mouse Development, Stem Cells & Cancer trains scientists to study gene regulation and development in the context of the whole organism, as well as mouse models of human disease such as cancer. The course provides in intensive hands-on introduction to engineering of mouse models, stem cell technologies and tissue analyses. Lectures provide the conceptual basis for contemporary research in embryogenesis, organogenesis in development and disease, embryonic, adult and induced pluripotent stem cells and cancer biology. The course on Chromatin, Epigenetics and Gene Expression aims to expose students to a broad array of methodologies to study gene regulation, chromatin structure and dynamics, including both well-developed and cutting edge methods, such as RNAi, CRISPR and chromosome conformation capture. The faculty is chosen on the basis of their contributions to and knowledge of the field covered in each course. The faculty invite lecturers who give up-to-the-minute reports on current research. The lecturers have all made significant contributions to their fields. The trainees range from graduate students to senior investigators who are chosen by the course faculty from a large number of applicants. Because of the short duration of the courses, senior, as well as junior, individuals can attend and receive an intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their on their time and attention. The courses provide an unusual opportunity for scientists to retrain in another specialty or to apply the work of a new field to their own research."
"9252367","The staggering global toll taken by infectious diseases calls for vastly more effective monitoring, as well as new preventative and therapeutic measures. To address critical gaps in our knowledge about the basic biology of key pathogens and their interactions with their hosts and insect vectors, we will create a Genomic Center for Infectious Diseases (GCID). Our team combines an extensive track record of developing and applying groundbreaking laboratory and analytical methods with experience managing large and complex projects to produce resources for the infectious disease research community. We will use genomic methods to define the extent of variation among organisms, as well as among microbial communities. Our viral research will focus on the NIAID Category A priority pathogens Lassa and Dengue viruses, and the Category B priority pathogen West Nile virus, as well on surveillance for fever-causing viruses in tropical developing countries. Bacterial studies will focus on the Category C priority pathogens M. tuberculosis and Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, an emerging cause of nocosomial infections associated with high mortality, as well as the costly Uropathogenic E. coli. Fungal research will focus on major pathogens with significant clinical impact, C. neoformans and C. albicans, as well as strains causing recent fungal outbreaks, including C. gattii and Fusarium spp. We will also study both the malaria-causing parasite P. falciparum and its mosquito vector, A. gambiae. In studying these particular high-priority pathogens as model systems, we will produce, and train community members to use, new methods of wide utility. We will sequence natural isolates as well as laboratory-derived mutants, and associate sequence differences with phenotypes to help interpret the functional consequences of this variation with respect to virulence, transmission and drug sensitivity. Working at several levels, from populations to whole organisms, and animal models to single cells, we will reveal the long term (evolutionary) responses to pathogen and host interactions and exposure to drugs or insecticides as well as the immediate (transcriptional) responses of host and pathogens to infection. These responses define potential new opportunities for interventions to disrupt the cycle of infection and transmission. In bringing together outstanding investigators in infectious disease with cutting edge laboratory and analytical methods and experienced leaders in genomics, we will generate the information needed to create new tools to track, diagnose, treat and prevent infectious diseases."
"9360880","Abstract A significant number of HIV+ people are opiate users, and injection drug use and associated risky behaviors contribute to new cases of HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (cART) has changed the predominant phenotype of HIV neuropathogenesis from HIV dementia to milder forms of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Opiate abuse increases the severity of HIV brain disease in immunodeficient people and similar effects are expected, but have not been fully defined, for mild HIV brain disease under cART. Because mild HAND is a chronic, life-long dysfunction, therapies are needed both to mitigate mild HAND as well as to limit the potential exacerbating effects of opiates on the disease. We propose to conduct research in vitro and in a mouse model of HIV induced HAND to test our novel hypothesis that buprenorphine, an established opiate medication, may serve such a dual therapeutic purpose. Methadone and buprenorphine are used to treat opiate addiction, but buprenorphine is often preferred due to its safety profile. Buprenorphine also differs from methadone, a full µ opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, in that it is a partial agonist of MOR and a full antagonist of ? opioid receptors (KOR). Some opioid users treated with buprenorphine show improvement in cognition compared to those on methadone, but the mechanism of improvement is unknown. Studies established that circulating CD14+CD16+ monocytes are infected with HIV and suggested that chemokine mediated transmigration of these infected and uninfected cells across the blood brain barrier (BBB) contributes to HAND through seeding the brain with HIV and mediating chronic neuroinflammation. A recent clinical study showed that the HIV DNA burden in CD14+ monocytes in people on cART predicts severity of their cognitive impairment. Circulating leukocytes, including monocytes, express opioid receptors, and our preliminary data show that human CD14+CD16+ monocytes express MOR and KOR. Using the chemokine CCL2 as a model of inflammation, we also demonstrated that buprenorphine inhibits CCL2-induced adhesion of these cells to brain microvascular endothelium as well as their CCL2-induced chemotaxis. Thus, buprenorphine inhibits important components of CCL2 mediated CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration across the BBB. In preclinical studies we showed that buprenophrine inhibits monocyte migration into the brain of EcoHIV infected mice. We also demonstrated that EcoHIV induced cognitive impairment is improved by buprenorphine. A major goal of our proposal is to correlate these 2 findings. Our overall hypothesis is that buprenorphine is a therapeutic that will improve HAND by reducing/inhibiting CCL2 mediated CD14+CD16+ monocyte entry into the CNS, contributing to improved cognitive functions due to decreased neuroinflammation not only in HIV infected opioid abusers, but also in non drug abusing HIV infected people."
"9261543","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main emphasis of this grant is to understand how a protein nanomachine is assembled from its parts, how it functions once assembled, and how the mechanisms of assembly support the nanomachine's biological functions. To address these questions we will use the capsid of bacteriophage HK97 and the tail of bacteriophage??? Both of these offer experimental access to centrally important aspects of biological assembly: The Delta domain of the HK97 capsid protein is an assembly chaperone that mediates assembly of capsomers into capsid and also binds the protease and brings it into the inside of the capsid. It also has a role in getting the portal into position and probably has a crucial role in nucleating capsid assembly as a result. For the tails our recent discovery of the tail assembly chaperones and the way they interact with the tape measure protein and with the tail tube protein illuminates the main features of tail assembly in a way that was not previously clear. Both of our model systems also provide examples of how size can be determined in biological assembly. HK97 assembles T=7 capsids but D3, which has a very similar capsid protein sequence, assembles a T=9. The tail assembles to a length that we showed years ago is determined by the tape measure protein. Our recent result with the assembly chaperones clarifies how the length information in the tape measure protein is translated into tail length. Our proposed experiments with the HK97 heads will include generating mutants of the capsid protein chosen to alter the process of capsid maturation. These will be evaluated by their biochemical and structural phenotypes and interpreted in the context of the wealth of structural and structural/dynamic data available from earlier studies. We will pay particular attention to the Delta domain of the capsid protein, which has crucial roles in several aspects of capsid protein function. For tails we will concentrate initially on investigating the newly identified assembly intermediate, a complex of the tape measure protein and the two assembly chaperones, for which we will examine the structure and assembly activities. We will begin experiments to determine the structure and function of the tail tip, including the minor proteins and the newly discovered iron-sulfur cluster We propose to characterize two examples of non-canonical translation of a head protein (TerL), and to carry out a basic characterization of a newly discovered bacteriophage of a previously unknown type."

"9272892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Wearable electronics and computing technology are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life. The prospect of replacing cumbersome medical equipment requiring significant supporting infrastructure in hospitals and medical facilities, with unobtrusive body worn devices that can robustly and securely send and receive data for biomedical sensing and actuation for remote treatment, has the potential to be a disruptive innovation. Whereas the majority of electronic textiles in existence today make use of circuits adhesively integrated onto a host garment, knitting technology at Drexel University enables the realization of garments that have knit sensors and actuators seamlessly integrated within them. We propose to integrate smart fabric sensors and actuators into comfortable garment devices providing unobtrusive prevention options for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), that are not currently possible, particularly in high risk patients. Pregnancy and prolonged sedentary positions are risk factors for DVT. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DVT/PE impacts between 300,000 to 900,000 people per year in the United States. Consistent with the mission of NIBIB, this project will result in research and development of new biomedical smart textiles that will fundamentally improve the detection, treatment, and prevention of DVT/PE, while encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas (e.g., medicine, engineering, fashion design, sociology, nursing, and informatics). Specific aims of the project include: Sensing - Develop an unobtrusive leg mobility measurement system that is seamlessly knitted and requires no batteries or cumbersome electronics. Signal Processing - Develop a real-time, predictive data-driven control system that will allow for robustness to non-deterministic disturbances such as motion artifacts and change in sensor location. Actuation - Develop biomedical smart textiles to provide mechanical stimulation of tissues in the body for remotely actuated treatment."
"9312561","Project Summary There is increasing recognition that rare, non-coding, and structural genomic variations are all important contributors to disease risk. We propose to create a graphical map of all the variations found by the TOPMed consortium - ultimately incorporating information from 100,000 genomes - that will allow unbiased analysis of all forms of variation in concert. The proof of the utility of this map will be a partially phased diploid reconstruction of each of the TOPMed genomes, compactly represented as a pair of paths for each chromosome in a global genome graph reference. To demonstrate how such a genome graph can be transformative for integrative analysis, we will build the first population gene annotation - defined as the set of all the splice isoforms of genes being expressed, including their underlying haplotypes, within a comprehensive sampling of a population. A population gene annotation can be used to study the association between genetic variation and isoform expression in a statistically meaningful way. For example, given a population annotation, one could ask: ?How does a given genetic variant - which may be in a non-coding region - affect the expression of a given isoform??, or ?Which variants are associated with high expression of a given isoform in a particular disease state??. Typically such integrative analysis questions are hard-to-impossible to answer with current representations. Hemoglobin disorders caused by genetic variants affecting the production or structure of the alpha and beta globin proteins are the most common inherited blood disorders, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. To demonstrate the power of the graphical approach, we will create the most comprehensive map of genetic variants in the alpha and beta globin loci and associated regulatory genes to date. We will show how combining this map with the phenotype data available from projects such as the Jackson Heart and the Women's Health Initiative, and RNA-Seq data from TOPMed and other projects such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (gtexprotal.org) allows us to identify novel candidates for causal variants and provide evidence that other rare variants are benign. This demonstration project will drive the research and improve both speed and precision in the diagnosis of hemoglobin disorders. It will provide a convincing demonstration of the value of this type of integrated approach to the analysis of all forms of genetic variation. As these hemoglobin disorders disproportionately affect certain genetic subpopulations, this study will show how the use of a more comprehensive reference structure, tunable to specific ethnic subpopulations, can reduce the potential biases that occur when relying on a single reference genome. 1"

"9218810","Myocarditis may be caused by a viral infection of the heart which may lead to a more chronic heart disease often referred to as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Myocarditis may lead to heart failure or a weakened heart muscle requiring a heart transplant for survival. We have discovered a new myocarditis phenotype which correlates with disease progression, non-recovery, and heart failure in human myocarditis and we have linked it to innate and adaptive immune responses against cardiac myosin. Human cardiac myosin (HCM) we found to be a novel damage associated molecular pattern or DAMP which interacts with TLR2 and stimulates human CD14+ monocytes. The specific aims proposed will be a significant step forward in understanding human myocarditis and may identify genes and pathways involved in disease progression. We expect to identify predictors of myocarditis progression to heart failure and non-recovery and to identify potential therapeutic interventions which can be instituted before inflammation leads to disease progression. While most studies of myocarditis/DCM are in animal models, our project proposes innovative translational research in a longitudinal study of a human myocarditis cohort to: Aim 1) Determine blood and heart biopsy immunophenotypes of human myocarditis and identify novel upregulated genes and pathways which associate with heart failure in myocarditis phenotypes by identification of the pro-fibrotic transcriptome of CD4+ T cells in human myocarditis vs normal controls by RNAseq analysis; Aim 2) Identify T cell epitopes of HCM in human myocarditis using state of the art HLA-epitope discovery combined with traditional T cell epitope mapping of T cell clones using our human cardiac myosin peptide libraries; Aim 3) Identify the upregulated genes and transcriptome of pro-fibrotic CD14+ monocyte responses against HCM toll like receptor ligands that may lead to identification of pro-fibrotic and novel genes involved in progression of myocarditis. RNAseq analysis of purified cell types such as CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells will provide insight into novel genes and pathways involved in pathogenesis so that future experiments can investigate these new pathways. We expect that our studies using state of the art epitope discovery utilizing mass spec to identify eluted human HLA bound peptides of HCM combined with more traditional epitope mapping using T cell clones and ELISPOT will reveal epitopes and potential targets for immunotherapy. The RNAseq is expected to reveal genes and pathways showing the critical role of monocytes and human cardiac myosin in controlling myocarditis not previously recognized in humans. Most importantly, the phenotypes and upregulated gene pathways will be correlated with outcomes such as heart function and fibrosis in our myocarditis/DCM cohort. The proposed studies in humans will establish myocarditis immunophenotypes (T cell and monocyte) which control outcomes in myocarditis/DCM and correlate individual phenotype with potential therapeutic options to prevent risk of disease progression and heart failure."
"9285496","Hemostasis and immunity are highly interrelated systems. Dysregulation of hemostasis, thrombosis, and dis- seminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are serious complications observed in patients with trauma, sterile tissue injury, systemic inflammation, and sepsis. This research project focuses on a novel pathway by which the major intravascular activator of fibrinolysis, tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA), controls innate im- munity and inflammation. LDL Receptor-related Protein-1 (LRP1) is an endocytic and cell-signaling receptor for tPA. When LRP1 is deleted conditionally in myeloid cells in mice, the inflammatory response to lipopoly- saccharide/endotoxin (LPS) is greatly exacerbated. In LRP1-deficient macrophages, NF?B is activated and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is robustly increased. microRNA-155 expression also is increased, which may sustain inflammation, as is expression of the Serpin fibrinolysis inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and PAI-2, which contribute to a pro-thrombotic state. In macrophages that express LRP1, different ligands that bind to LRP1 have opposite effects on macrophage phenotype and gene expression, a phenomenon that we hypothesize reflects ligand-specific recruitment of macrophage co-receptors, including N- methyl-D-aspartate Receptor. tPA-binding to LRP1 is anti-inflammatory. Enzymatically-inactive tPA (EI-tPA) blocks the toxicity of LPS in wild-type mice. The anti-inflammatory activity of tPA represents a novel and unanticipated activity of an FDA-approved drug. The major objective of this grant application is to elucidate the activity of tPA in inflammation and a novel pathway by which tPA may counteract development of thrombosis in tissue injury and sepsis. Three specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we apply a systems biology approach to elucidate the anti-inflammatory signaling pathway activated by EI-tPA-binding to LRP1 in macro- phages. Specific attention will be dedicated to identifying co-receptors, systems of signaling proteins that func- tion concomitantly to regulate gene expression, and gene products such as SOCS1 and SOCS3, which may determine whether the effects of tPA on inflammation are sustained. In Specific Aim 2, we test the hypothesis that tPA suppresses inflammation in response to multiple stimuli by examining two alternative model systems in mice, lipoteichoic acid challenge and the passive K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis model, in which innate im- munity is activated by Fc receptors and complement factors. In Specific Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that EI- tPA may counteract development of pro-thrombotic states in conditions such as trauma and sepsis by controlling gene expression in macrophages. Proposed experiments in Specific Aim 3 focus on the balance between plasminogen activators and their inhibitors and on cell-surface receptors that promote plasminogen activation by tPA. Overall, this project offers an opportunity to further our understanding of crosstalk between fibrinolysis and cellular systems that control inflammation. The novel pathways under investigation may yield new targets for drug development in chronic inflammation and hemostasis."
"9258619","Project Abstract  The brain's circadian clock controls daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. Disruptions of circadian rhythms with shift work are associated with many human health problems. In addition, behavioral rhythms are often disrupted with aging and neurological disorders. Understanding the direct links between the circadian system and specific biological processes and behaviors will provide insights into disease susceptibility. In Drosophila melanogaster, we have a detailed understanding of the transcriptional oscillator mechanism and the specific neurons that are necessary for generating 24-hour behavioral rhythms. However, little is known about how circadian clocks communicate time-of-day information to output circuits controlling behaviors. Recent work showed that clock neurons project to neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI), a brain region containing neurosecretory cells implicated in regulating various behaviors. PI neurons expressing DH44 neuropeptide are necessary for circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. In this proposal, I will leverage our knowledge of this circadian output circuit to understand the mechanisms by which timing signals are translated into behavioral rhythms.  In Aim 1, I will identify a mechanistic basis for rhythmic output from Dh44 neurons. Since the Dh44 neurons and clock neurons have direct anatomical connections, I hypothesize that these connections provide a neural substrate that regulates the diurnal neural activity of Dh44 neurons and DH44 neuropeptide signaling. To address this, I will investigate how the circadian system regulates neural activity in and neuropeptide release from Dh44 neurons and the signaling ability of DH44 itself. By identifying a mechanism for rhythmic output at the level of DH44 signaling, we will gain insights into how this circuit encodes time-of-day information downstream of clock neurons.  In Aim 2, I will determine the site of DH44 neuropeptide action. DH44 neuropeptide signals through its receptors, DH44-R1 and DH44-R2. Preliminary data show that Dh44-R1 is the receptor required for normal rest:activity rhythms. In Aim 2, I will identify the neurons where DH44-R1 is required. I will also establish functional connectivity between Dh44 and downstream neurons with in vivo imaging techniques. Together, the proposed experiments will elucidate the mechanisms by which DH44 neuropeptide signaling regulate a circadian output circuit controlling rest:activity rhythms."
"9317951","Summary. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are autoimmune disease characterized by chronic muscle weakness and inflammation. Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), adult-onset dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM) are major subgroups of IIM. In pathognomonic muscle biopsies of JDM and DM, there are remarkable perivascular inflammation with complement- mediated destruction of perivascular endothelium, leading to perifascicular ischemia and degeneration of muscle fibers. However, the triggers for complement activation and whether complement is engaged in the breakdown of immune tolerance in IIM have not been defined. A great impeding factor for research progress of IIM is the low prevalence of the disease and therefore statistical power of analysis becomes an issue. The International Myositis Genetic Consortium (MYOGEN) was created to facilitate and advance collaborations on genetic studies of IIM. Through application of immunochip for genotyping of MYOGEN samples of IIM patients, it has been shown that HLA-DRB1*03:01 of the ancestral haplotype AH8.1 in Caucasians is the strongest risk factors for all forms of IIM. Among European subjects, the presence of HLA-DRB1*03:01 is strongly associated with complement C4A deficiency. There are multiple layers of genetic diversity for complement C4, including multi-allelic gene copy number variations (CNVs) and gene size dichotomy for its two isotypes, acidic C4A and basic C4B. Through a meticulous pilot study, we have shown that C4A deficiency is a very strong and independent genetic risk factor for JDM, including under the presence of DRB1*03:01 (DR3+). Therefore, it would be of great interest to decipher the roles of C4-CNVs and C4A deficiency in various forms of inflammatory myopathies from the MYOGEN. The specific aim is ?To investigate the MHC complement genetic variants in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.? We will evaluate complement C4-CNVs and associated polymorphisms for C4A and C4B, plus nonsense mutations of MHC-linked complement genes, in the context of their linkage disequilibrium (LD) with specific HLA-DRB1 genotypes, on various forms of IIM from the MYOGEN (N=2566).

"9230334","Abstract  Mammalian tissue culture models of gastrointestinal (GI) infection provide important tools for elucidating GI  mechanisms of pathogenesis; however, such models currently lack methods to interrogate the role of human  aging and biological rhythms in GI homeostatic responses to infection. In Project 3, we propose novel ?4-  dimensional? experimental platforms to advance the study of three major GI pathogens: Helicobacter pylori  (HP), Clostridium difficile (CD), and Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC). Using inducible pluripotent stem  cells (iPSC) isolated from human serum, we will generate two types of organoids: human gastric organoids  (HGOs) and human colonic organoids (HCOs). Using GI epithelial tissue from patient biopsies, we will  generate two types of enteroids: human ?gastroids? from stomach epithelium and human ?colonoids? from  colon epithelium. Organoids and enteroids will be engineered and transduced with fluorescent and  bioluminescent reporters of cell cycle and circadian rhythms. We will use these reporters for single-cell and  population-level real-time analyses of epithelial turnover and circadian rhythms in: a) HGOs and gastroids  infected with HP and b) HCOs and colonoids infected with CD toxins A and B and Shiga toxin.  GI organoid and enteroid platforms will be derived from groups of infants, adolescents, young adults, and older  adults. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine: a) which platform (organoid vs. enteroid) is the superior model for  each pathogen, and b) the extent to which the age of the source influences response to infection. We  hypothesize that HGOs and HCO's will be ?neonatal? like in their expression of cellular receptors to pathogens  and toxins, whereas gastroids and colonoids will reflect the tissue maturity of the donor. We further  hypothesize that enteroids derived from older adults will be highly susceptible to adverse outcomes from  infection due to age-related impairments in GI stem cell regeneration. In Aim 2, we will determine whether: a)  the time of day influences GI epithelial response to infection, b) GI pathogens disrupt epithelial timekeeping,  and c) age-related perturbations in circadian rhythms modulate outcomes to GI infection. Collectively, these  Specific Aims will bring together our NAMSED Projects and Cores for the common goal of developing robust  ex vivo models of GI infection that lead to breakthrough therapies for the right patient at the right time."
"9253021","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapidly growing world population and the high rate of unintended pregnancies make contraception a need and a priority for any public health program. While several contraceptive methods for women are currently available, a more comprehensive approach to birth control requires extending contraception to males. However, a safe, effective and reversible contraceptive for men is still unavailable. An attractive approach t develop male contraceptives consists in targeting proteins that are specifically expressed in sperm and are required for sperm fertility. Evidence from our laboratory has shown that Na,K-ATPase ?4, a sperm specific plasma membrane transporter, which exchanges cytoplasmic Na+ for extracellular K+ is one of these attractive targets for male contraception. Na,K-ATPase ?4 is only expressed in male germ cells of the testis after meiosis and abundant in the sperm flagellum. Importantly, ?4 has functional characteristics that are highly unique and critical for sperm function. Activity of ?4 is essential for maintaining sperm intracellular Na+ levels ([Na+]i) and several vital sperm parameters, including membrane potential (Vm), intracellular Ca+2 ([Ca2+]i) and pH. Importantly, ?4 is crucial for sperm motility and hyperactivation, a key event associated with sperm capacitation. Accordingly, knockout of ?4 in mice results in complete male infertility. From a biochemical standpoint, ?4 has a particularly high affinity for the cardenolide ouabain. We have developed a series of synthetic compounds with steroidal and non-steroidal backbone structure, which, by targeting the ouabain binding site of ?4, selectively inhibit ?4 and affect sperm motility. These results provide strong evidence for the suitability of ?4 as a pharmacological target for the control of male fertility. The key to targeting Na,K-ATPase ?4 is that inhibition of this protein will allow to specifically interfere with sperm function, without affecting spermatogenesis and providing temporary and reversible contraception. In addition, the lack of ?4 in somatic cells reduces the chances that its inactivation will produce side effects. However, before the ?4 inhibitors can be moved forward into their application as male contraceptives, it is necessary that their efficacy, drug-target interaction, biomarkers for their in vitro and vivo specificity, side effects and mechanisms of action are identified and optimized for future clinical use. We will test this here by determining the efficacy and selectivity of action of our inhibitors on Na,K-ATPase ?4 activity, on sperm motility and on sperm parameters that are controlled by Na,K-ATPase ?4 activity, including sperm [Na+]i, [Ca2+]i, pH, Vm, sperm hyperactivation, motility and fertility. Finally, we will determine the pharmacokinetic parameters, safety and contraceptive effectiveness of Na,K-ATPase ?4 inhibitors in mating trials in mice. The rationale for the research is that once the suitability of cardenolides as targets of Na,K-ATPase ?4 is validated, both in vitro and in vivo, they can be advanced as agents for the reversible control of male fertility."
"9328621","PROJECT SUMMARY Emotion-regulatory deficits are a hallmark of mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, the ability to regulate emotional responses according to one's goals and to effectively override automatic responses to emotional events is paramount to mental health and wellbeing. Function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) has been shown to play a pivotal role in supporting goal-oriented and flexible behavior. Moreover, extant data implicates LPFC dysfunction in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. However, studies establishing the specific and causal contributions of LPFC function to emotion regulation are sorely lacking. This proposal will illuminate the causal role of LPFC representations for goal-oriented behavioral regulation during affective processing and identify mediating neural mechanisms. The proposed studies will test the central hypothesis that task-relevant emotion-regulatory goals are dynamically represented in mid-LPFC, from which they are conveyed to topographically organized dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and integrated with affect signals from the amygdala. This hypothesis is based on recent insights into PFC organization and documented neuroanatomical projections. The experiments will employ a behavioral task that is sensitive to LPFC function and that indexes the degree of influence of prepotent emotional stimuli on behavior depending on the task goal. The LPFC- dmPFC-amygdala circuitry will be examined using a combination of advanced neuroimaging multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and behavioral studies of patients with focal PFC lesions. This combination of novel data acquisition methods and analytic approaches will reveal the functional causal contributions of specific PFC regions and provide a precise mechanistic account of how the LPFC contributes to adaptive emotional responding. The proposed studies will thus fill a substantial gap in emotion regulation research, and further the development of a model that can be applied to optimize and personalize treatment for individuals who suffer from mood and anxiety disorders associated with PFC dysfunction."

"9243973","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi Myopathy (MM) are caused by mutations in dysferlin, but the role of dysferlin in healthy muscle and the changes that occur when it is mutated are still poorly understood. Although earlier studies suggested that dysferlin acts at the sarcolemma, our recent studies have yielded unexpected results: we find that dysferlin is selectively enriched in the transverse tubules (t- tubules: TT) of skeletal muscle. Challenging dysferlin null muscle with lengthening contractions in vivo or osmotic shock in vitro disrupts TT and causes Ca2+ channels to open, leading to significant changes in Ca2+ handling. In a recent FRET study, we obtained results to suggest that dysferlin and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), the L-type Ca2+ channel that concentrates in TT at triad junctions (TJ), are located within 10 nm of one another in situ. Based on these preliminary results, we hypothesize that dysferlin protects muscle from injury-induced disruption of TT and dysregulation of Ca2+ by associating with DHPR and ryanodine receptors (RyR1) at TJ. We will test this hypothesis in experiments in healthy and dysferlin null muscles by studying the organization of TT, regulation of Ca2+ transients and baseline Ca2+ levels, and mechanochemical coupling between DHPR and RyR1. We will injure dysferlin-null and control muscles in vitro and ex vivo and muscle fibers in vitro and then apply ultrastructural approaches and state-of-the-art fluorescence-based imaging methods, including FRAP and FRET, to study the structural and functional changes in TT and TJ. We will test drugs that block L-type Ca2+ channels, stretch-activated channels, and ryanodine receptors, for their ability to protect dysferlin-null muscle from injury in vitro and in vivo. We will also prepare dysferlin variants, missing one or more of its structural domains or with point mutations linked to LGMD2B/MM, to identify the regions of dysferlin required to restore the structure and function of TT and TJ of dysf -/- muscle and to protect them from damage following stress. We have 3 specific aims: (1) to determine the role of dysferlin in regulating the function of TT and TJ; (2) to determine the role of dysferlin in regulating the structure and stability of TT and TJ; and (3) to identify the domains of dysferlin needed for it to concentrate in TT, interact with DHPR and RyR1 at TJ, and protect fibers from damage under stress. Our experiments will critically test our hypothesis that dysferlin protects TT structurally and functionally from damage by interacting with the two key components of TJ, DHPR and RyR1. They will elucidate the roles of dysferlin in skeletal muscle and how its absence leads to dysferlinopathy, and may suggest new avenues of treatment for LGMD2B/MM."

"9310098","Project Summary Maternally derived duplications or triplications of 15q11.2-q13 (Dup15q) are one of the most common genetic variations associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), detected in 1-3% of cases. Prominent features commonly found in Dup15q include intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, developmental delay, hypotonia, speech impairments, and minor dysmorphic features. The ubiquitin E3A ligase gene (UBE3A), which maps to the 15q11.2-q13 region, has been implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD, Angelman Syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and ID. Based on this information, we postulate that dysregulated UBE3A has deleterious outcomes. Because UBE3A is imprinted specifically in neurons, we will use novel mouse models to test the hypothesis that elevated UBE3A in neurons is the major contributor to phenotypes. It is well known that three differentially spliced isoforms of UBE3A exist, propelling us to pursue the secondary scientific question of which isoform plays the most critical role in Dup15q. No in vivo studies, to date, have evaluated the phenotypic contributions associated with each of the three Ube3a isoforms. Preliminary data illustrate our discovery that forebrain, neuronal selective overexpression of Ube3a isoform 2 is sufficient to cause behavioral and anatomical phenotypes. Here, we propose a multifaceted, collaborative project to identify behavior, neuroanatomical and epigenetic mechanisms of isoform-specific Ube3a overexpression. This proposal will directly address the most important questions regarding our main scientific premise that overexpression of UBE3A is the principal pathogenic mechanism causing Dup15q impairments. We will also address our secondary premise, that different Ube3a isoforms in neurons cause differential behavioral, pathological and epigenetic anomalies. We will delineate phenotypes and identify pathologies in each line of isoform-specific Ube3a- overexpressing mice. Significant correlations and corroborations between molecular, cellular, histopathological and behavioral phenotypes will reveal key information on neural substrates of Dup15q phenotypes. These studies will answer the most important questions regarding the pathogenic nature of mechanisms underlying UBE3A overexpression."

"9346983","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and hypertension are serious public health concerns. Population studies indicate that at least two- thirds of the prevalence of hypertension can be directly attributed to obesity. Obesity-induced hypertension is associated with sympathetic overactivity and evidence indicates that signaling through both leptin receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor is critical for this process. However, the underlying neural basis of this association remains incompletely understood. Our long-term goal is to delineate the neural circuits that mediate obesity- induced sympathetic overactivity and hypertension. The rationale for this proposed research is that understanding the specific brain leptin and melanocortin circuits that mediate sympathetic outflow and blood pressure will help to develop more selective pharmacologic strategies that will allow effective treatment of hypertension and obesity. We have recently identified a unique subpopulation of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area that co-express both leptin receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor. The central hypothesis is that, in the context of obesity and hyperleptinemia, both leptin receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor signaling in this subpopulation of lateral hypothalamic area neurons is augmented to cause sympathetic overactivity and hypertension. In order to directly test the components of this hypothesis, the following Specific Aims have been generated: 1) To determine if MC4R signaling in the LHA is necessary and sufficient to regulate renal SNA and mediates obesity-associated increases in blood pressure; and 2) To determine if LepR signaling in the LHA is necessary and sufficient to regulate renal SNA and mediates obesity-associated increases in blood pressure; and 3) To test if selective optogenetic modulation of activity of LHA LepR+ neurons regulates renal SNA and ameliorates obesity-associated increases in blood pressure. We will test if manipulating leptin and melanocortin signaling and neuronal activity in the LHA in the context of obesity affect sympathetic outflow and cardiovascular function. The proposed research is innovative because it will combine multiple state-of-the-art techniques, including Cre/loxP, optogenetics, direct multi-fiber recording of sympathetic nerve activity and radiotelemetry measurement of blood pressure, to test a novel brain circuit that contributes to obesity-induced sympathetic overdrive and hypertension in mice. The proposed research is significant because it will improve our understanding of the molecular and neural basis of obesity-induced hypertension and identifies novel therapeutic opportunities to effectively treat hypertension associated with the development of obesity. We believe that this work will contribute to a better understanding of how brain networks and signaling pathways lead to the development of neurogenic hypertension."
"9287723","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the role of emotion regulation (ER) in sleep bruxism (SB). SB is characterized by extreme levels of masticatory muscle activity (MMA) during sleep, expressed as teeth grinding or clenching. SB may proximally lead to tooth damage, orofacial pain, and impaired sleep; predispose to the development of joint degenerative disorders; and ultimately present a preclinical sign for a broader range of neurodegenerative disorders. However, there is as yet no curative treatment for SB, and the mechanisms underlying SB are not well understood. To fill this gap, we propose an integrative neurobiological framework that focuses on the involvement of impaired downregulation of wake-time emotion in SB. We will test basic tenets of this framework by addressing four major aims: Aim 1 tests differences in task-related neural activation during ER in individuals with SB (SB+) vs. matched controls (SB?). Aim 2 investigates direct and indirect pathways associating task- related prefrontal cortex activatin during ER with MMA during sleep among SB+ and SB?. Aim 3 examines whether neural activation during ER can be experimentally manipulated in SB+. Aim 4 addresses causal mechanisms by investigating whether more efficient task-related prefrontal cortex activation during ER decreases MMA during sleep in SB+ through decreased task-related emotional activation of the amygdala. 100 SB+ and 50 SB? will be defined based on polysomnographic research diagnostic criteria. Functional activations of brain regions of interest during an ER task will be assessed and ambulatory monitoring of MMA during sleep will be conducted. In SB+, ER will be experimentally manipulated and effects will be assessed on functional activations of brain regions of interest during the ER task as well as on MMA during sleep. The proposed work is part of a programatic translational research agenda to develop novel effective therapies that target ER processes to alleviate affective, sleep, and stress-induced neurodegenerative disorders."
"9441448","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human metagenomics - the study of our body's microbial and viral communities through next generation sequencing - is transforming current paradigms of both health and disease. Direct sequencing of microbiome populations has enormous potential for direct use in the diagnosis and epidemiology of infectious disease and for furthering our understanding of the causes, treatment, and prevention of chronic common diseases, from obesity to autoimmune disorders. For this reason, the NIH has invested heavily in research projects (such as the Human Microbiome project) to characterize the microbiome of healthy and diseased individuals across a spectrum of tissues. Translating this work into the clinic, however, requires overcoming a key hurdle: low levels of microbial sequence and high levels of human sequence present in many clinical samples reduce the sensitivity and dramatically increase the cost of metagenomics approaches. IdentifyGenomics has a novel and innovative method for the targeted depletion of human sequences from sequencing libraries. Our Phase 1 hypothesis is that a CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to systematically and robustly deplete human sequences from sequencing libraries to improve the sensitivity and cost-effectiveness of metagenomics analysis. Specific Aim 1 is to develop guide RNA panels targeted to mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal RNA and to use these to refine reaction conditions and guide RNA design principles. Specific Aim 2 is to develop a transcriptome-wide guide RNA panel to deplete RNAseq libraries and validate it against clinical samples. The expected outcome is a CRISPR-Cas9 method demonstrated to deplete 80% of targeted human sequences from a sequencing library, with less than 5% loss of non-human sequences in one hour. Phase II work will include improving depletion efficiencies towards 100% and extending the method to depletion of the whole human genome from DNA-derived sequencing libraries. Our technology integrates directly into existing workflows and our preliminary data shows we can deplete mtDNA from ATAC-seq libraries by 60% in under an hour. Extending this work to rRNA and then RNAseq will produce a suite of tools for the research and clinical community that will accelerate the adoption of metagenomics sequencing in sequencing-based clinical diagnostics. We have secured our intellectual property by filing patent applications on this technology and have identified leading academic partners to help us test and validate our methods on a range of samples. Finally, our executive leadership and board are well positioned in the community to help us commercialize this technology through existing kit manufacturers (including New England Biolabs) and leading sequencing providers (including Illumina)."
"9264041","Project 1 Project Leader: Van Vactor, David L. Abstract It has become increasingly clear that neuronal connectivity, function and plasticity all rely on the post- transcriptional regulation of gene networks. Among newly discovered classes of regulatory factor likely to be vital for regulating mRNA stability and translation in neurons, small non-coding microRNAs (miRs) have tremendous potential to shape the gene expression landscape. This large class of sequence-specific regulatory molecules is highly expressed in the nervous system. However, very few miR functions have been examined in vivo where the relationship between neural circuit architecture and behavioral outputs are maintained. To address this challenge, we have recently created tools to manipulate miR function with spatial and temporal specificity, in a model organism ideal for the study of neural circuits that control a wide variety of behaviors. Drosophila offers an increasingly sophisticated set of genetic approaches and reagents that are complementary and enabling to the new tools we have produced. As part of a carefully orchestrated set of collaborations using multiple robust and fundamental behaviors in this organism, we set out to map the miRs essential in the neural circuits controlling locomotion, sleep and associative memory. Using the larval NMJ as a model synapse for genetic validation ideal for miRs that may act in multiple neural circuits or multiple stages of postembryonic development, we have shown that null mutations recapitulate 85% of our miR-SP bouton phenotypes tested to date. Our functional screens reveal four conserved miRs likely to shape the development and plasticity of neural circuits: the miR-13 and miR-92 families, miR-190 and let-7. With an array of techniques, many of which we are developing with and/or learning from our collaborators, we will determine which of these miRs are essential for neurotransmission and activity-induced remodeling at the synapse. We will use new genetic tools to define the spatial and temporal logic for each miR function. We will then use a state-of-the-art combination of transcriptome sequencing and computational informatics, followed by use of in vivo activity sensors and functional validation, to discover the downstream mechanisms for each miR that intersects our coordinated screens. With an initial focus on the miR-92 family, we have obtained preliminary informatics and expression data identifying several highly conserved target gene candidates that have been implicated in developmental and activity-dependent synaptic signaling pathways. Once we dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms for each gene, we will then compare each miR-target relationship across our model circuits to determine which mechanisms are context-specific, and which are widely used across the brain. This combination of comprehensive discovery science and comparative molecular anatomy will address fundamental and timely questions in a way that is not yet possible to achieve in mammalian models, but is likely to identify regulatory strategies highly relevant to many neural circuits."
"9442316","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator, applying both experimental and computational approaches to age-dependent chromatin changes underlying metabolic dysfunction. I am working towards obtaining a tenure-track faculty position at a leading research institution, so that I can devote m time to basic research and training of students and fellows in my laboratory.  During the course of my doctoral work, I utilized functional genomic approaches to investigate transcriptional regulatory networks in the liver and discovered that winged-helix transcription factor Foxa2 plays an important role in bile acid metabolism. After completing my doctoral degree I decided to follow the science and, due to creative and financial freedom I enjoyed, was able to pursue projects that I developed in Dr. Kaestner's laboratory. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Kaestner lab, I discovered a novel age-onset obesity phenotype in a mouse model where genetic deletion occurs only in the liver, underscoring the importance of the role the liver plays in development of obesity. Loss of Foxa2 in the liver of older mice results in a premature aging phenotype, as Foxa2-deficient mice exhibit reduced food intake, decreased energy expenditure, and triglyceride accumulation. Foxa2 antagonizes mTOR signaling, leading to activation of LXR? and increased lipogenesis. This finding piqued my interest in age-dependent metabolic changes.  In order to become a productive multidisciplinary researcher, it is essential to know both how to perform experiments properly to generate the data and how to analyze the data appropriately. I came to Regev lab at the Broad Institute to complement my experimental background and build upon my computational skills with training in analysis of large data sets and modeling of genomic data. I am currently analyzing the data from MNase-seq and RNA-seq experiments I performed in livers isolated from mice of different ages (Aim 1). We are expecting to finish the analysis and submit the paper in the fall.  Dr. Regev has supported my decision to continue metabolic research in her laboratory. While my primary mentor Dr. Regev is a computational biologist with extensive experience in epigenetic regulation, genomics methods and computational analysis, I am co-advised by a multidisciplinary committee that includes Dr. Waxman, an expert in transcriptional and epigenetic networks that govern hepatic gene expression, Dr. Timchenko, an expert in the field of aging liver and age-associated chromatin changes, Dr. Moore, a leader in the field of nuclear receptors and lipid metabolism, and Dr. Rosen, a clinician with experience in epigenetics and human obesity. With their guidance, I will build a foundation necessary to pursue the relationship between age-dependent chromatin changes and metabolic dysfunction as an independent investigator.  Epigenetic changes act as crucial mediators of age-dependent impairments in the liver and other tissues, suggesting a common mechanism could be responsible. I hypothesize that nucleosome architecture changes with aging are a key part of this mechanism in the aging liver. To test this hypothesis, I will examine genome-wide nucleosome positioning and occupancy in livers isolated from mice of three different ages in Aim 1. Next, I will examine changes in histone modifications with age in Aim 2. Integrating nucleosome occupancy, chromatin state, and gene expression at different ages should converge on regulators and a molecular mechanism for age-associated dysfunction.  The unbiased search for regulators of age-dependent metabolic phenotypes will be complemented by a candidate approach. Current ChIP-Seq data for nuclear receptors have challenged the classical model of nuclear-receptor-dependent gene regulation. However, the genome-wide location analysis shows that LXR? binding in the liver is largely ligand-dependent and that the agonist enables LXR? to occupy less accessible sites. These observations led me to hypothesize that chromatin architecture plays a larger role in nuclear receptor binding and metabolic gene regulation than previously appreciated. Since uncontrolled hepatic lipogenesis, regulated by LXR?, can contribute to development of age-dependent obesity and DAF-12, LXR homolog in C.elegans, mediates responses to environmental conditions during aging, it is crucial to understand the complete mechanism of activation and the contribution of low and high affinity LXR? binding sites to gene regulation (Aim 3), which can be extrapolated to other nuclear receptors and their metabolic targets.  In this application, I hypothesize that chromatin architecture changes with aging and plays a larger role in nuclear receptor binding and metabolic gene regulation than previously appreciated and propose a series of experiments and analyses to test these ideas. The ultimate goal is to determine how epigenetic changes lead to changes in transcription factor binding modulating gene regulation responsible for age-dependent metabolic phenotypes. The object of this unbiased search, which is complemented by a candidate approach, is to find candidate regulators that can be manipulated to treat age-dependent metabolic dysfunction.

"9257477","Contact PD/PI: LARSON, RICHARD S Our vision for the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM) Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) is to be an essential part of tightly integrated networks. The resulting collective synergy will catalyze transit of therapeutic, diagnostic, and preventive interventions; disseminate innovative translational research methods and best practices; and lead informatics standards and policy development to promote shared resources and clinical and translational research (CTR). We will accomplish this by providing tailored resources to accelerate translation, which will be harmonized with other CTSA hubs, including for example: multi-site study support, regulatory support, research design, workforce training, and integrated informatics support. Our focus will be to advance the full spectrum of both clinical and translational research and science (CTR/S). So that our impact is clearly demonstrated, we also propose meaningful, measureable goals and outcomes. The UNM CTSC offers a unique setting to achieve this vision and to catalyze high quality CTR/S. One of four majority-minority states, New Mexico is ethnically diverse (Anglo, Hispanic, Native American), rural, and medically disenfranchised with health-disparate populations. Our state presents geographic, racial/ethnic, and rural obstacles to health care and outcomes and is among only five of 24 IDeA states with a CTSA hub. A key element of our CTSC is continuous improvement and learning in order to translate what we know into what we do. In order to achieve this, we will continue to build and enhance synergy among new technological capabilities, catalyze opportunities, and effect institutional policy change. Through the following five strategic aims, we are poised to play a leadership role in our state and region while being a significant asset to and partner in the CTSA consortium: 1) Align the governance, leadership, and strategic planning of the entire UNM health system, its partners, and its academic enterprise with the CTSC and CTR/S; 2) Engage in beneficial collaboration and partnerships; 3) Use our initial success in education and training to build the translational workforce of tomorrow; 4) Develop and disseminate innovative and streamlined research resources (including data and informatics), methods, and processes with a focus on quality and efficiency; 5) Integrate translational science across its multiple phases and disciplines within complex populations and across the lifespan. With our CTSC as the catalyst, our expected outcomes are to a) improve health through continuous input, innovation, and learning; b) speed development and use of new diagnostics, therapeutics, preventive interventions; and c) focus on complex and special populations in our state and region, including those that are rural, underserved, and diverse across the continuum of lifespan.

"9260284","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem in the US with an estimated prevalence of ~2.3 million; 116,000 patients enter hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis programs yearly. A serious complication in 18-75% of patients with CKD is cachexia or muscle wasting, which decreases quality of life and increases morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there are no agents available in the clinic to treat CKD-induced cachexia. We determined that expression of myostatin, a member of the TGF? peptide hormone family and the major negative regulator of muscle mass, is increased in the skeletal muscles of patients and mice with CKD. Blocking myostatin in CKD mice with a humanized, myostatin peptibody prevented CKD-induced cachexia raising the possibility of using it to treat cachexia in CKD patients. However, a similar myostatin targeting strategy was halted in Phase I due to unexplained nose and gum bleeding. We discovered that CKD in patients and mice activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) within skeletal muscles resulting in increased transcription and expression of C/EBP?, which, in turn, stimulates myostatin expression. These findings support the novel hypothesis that an agent that targets STAT3 could be used to treat CKD-induced cachexia. To test this hypothesis, we used computer-based docking and identified three small-molecule probes that targeted the phosphotyrosyl peptide-binding pocket within the Src homology (SH) 2 domain of STAT3. The most active probe was C188. Using C188 as a scaffold, we performed 2-D similarity screening, 3-D pharmacophore analysis and structure-activity relationship (SAR)-directed medicinal chemistry, which identified C188-9 as a very attractive lead compound. Administration of C188-9 (6.25 mg/Kg/d IP for 14 days) increased muscle weight and grip strength in CKD mice through targeting of STAT3 in muscles and decreasing levels of myostatin protein. More recently, we determined that C188-9 has favorable safety and oral pharmacokinetic properties in mice, rats and dogs. The hypotheses we are interrogating in this proposal are: 1) C188-9 is selective for STAT3 and will not adversely impact normal cell function, including T-cell immunity, and 2) a safe, orally formulated dose of C188-9 can be identified for Phase I studies in patients with CKD. We propose four tightly focused Specific Aims to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will determine the specificity of C188-9 for binding to STAT3 and its potential for adverse off-target effects. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of C188-9 treatment on T cell immunity in mice. In Aim 3, we will synthesize C188-9 under cGMP-like conditions, characterize it, and optimize its formulation. In Aim 4, we will perform 14-week GLP toxicology and PK studies to enable an IND application for CKD-induced cachexia. The excellent in vitro and in vivo potency of C188-9 coupled with its high maximum tolerated dose and excellent plasma exposures following oral administration provide strong support for the overarching hypothesis that C188-9 can be used safely and effectively to treat cachexia in CKD patients thereby reducing morbidity and mortality."
"9273263","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. More than 85% of lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is defined by pathological characteristics. Oncogenic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain are found in a significant portion of NSCLC. Such mutations, which present most commonly as small in-frame deletions in exon 19 or as point mutations in exon 21, confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have enabled molecularly targeted therapy in this malignancy. By analyzing the tumors of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, we have identified two novel EGFR genomic alterations that have not previously been reported in lung cancer: EGFR kinase domain duplication (EGFR- KDD) and EGFR-RAD51 fusion. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of these newly discovered EGFR alterations in lung cancer. The EGFR-KDD is an intragenic rearrangement resulting in the tandem duplication of exons 18-25, the exons that encode the entire EGFR kinase domain. EGFR-RAD51 is the result of a chromosomal translocation encompassing EGFR exons 1-24, which includes all functional domains of EGFR except the C-terminal regulatory region, and RAD51 exons 4-10, which includes the ATPase and oligomerization domains, but not the DNA binding N-terminus. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that EGFR rearrangements, specifically the EGFR-KDD and EGFR-RAD51, are recurrent, oncogenic, and therapeutically targetable alterations in lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out experiments to 1) identify the best strateg to therapeutically inhibit EGFR-KDD; to 2) determine whether EGFR-RAD51 is oncogenic and sensitive to EGFR-targeted agents; and to 3) determine the frequency of EGFR-KDD and EGFR-RAD51 in non-small cell lung cancer. Collectively, the proposed research uses in vitro and in vivo models as well as patient-derived data to address a previously unrecognized potential mechanism of oncogenesis in lung cancer: EGFR rearrangements. Importantly, understanding the consequences of these EGFR alterations may provide insights into EGFR biology and reveal new uses for FDA approved agents. As such, these studies are expected to have rapid translation into the clinic. Finally, as a physician-scientist-in-training who aims to have a career as a translational cancer researcher, the proposed studies provide an exciting and fertile training avenue."
"9442228","Plasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Plasmodium parasites  replicate within and cause the destruction of host red blood cells, which triggers inflammation and causes the  symptoms of malarial disease. Parasite-specific antibody responses that develop following infection are critical  for controlling parasite burden and limiting disease severity. CD4+ helper T cells are essential for coordinating  these protective antibody responses. However, sterilizing anti-Plasmodium immunity rarely develops, even  following repeated infection. We hypothesize this is due to deficient Plasmodium-specific effector and memory  CD4+ T cell formation. One of the most critical challenges to developing new immune-based therapies or  vaccines against Plasmodium is understanding how or whether long-lived Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+  T cells develop, function and persist following infection. In this project we have developed powerful new  cellular, genetic and biochemical approaches that enable direct, high-resolution analyses of bona fide  Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+ T cells. These new approaches facilitate our long-term goal to understand  the quantity and quality of Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+ T cell responses. Our goal is addressed by  three specific aims that test: 1) the phenotype, function and numerical stability of Plasmodium-specific effector  and memory CD4+ T cell populations and their impact on protective humoral immunity; 2) how parasite- and  host-specific factors regulate the formation of long-lived memory CD4+ T cell responses; and 3) the effector  mechanisms and pathways that memory CD4+ T cells use to orchestrate long-lived anti-Plasmodium immunity.  Our innovative approaches enable us to establish additional new paradigms for understanding and enhancing  CD4+ T cell-dependent anti-Plasmodium immunity. Understanding immune memory formation following  Plasmodium infection will enable us to identify and develop new immune-based strategies to limit Plasmodium  pathogenesis and disease burden.   "
"9303686","PROJECT SUMMARY Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy accounting for 13% of all hematological malignancies and 11,000 deaths annually in the US, with the majority succumbing to disease due to the development of resistance. Evasion of apoptosis is central to tumor development and resistance. A key component to the development of resistance across most cancers lies in the ineffective engagement of the BCL-2 family of apoptosis regulators. Induction of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is dictated by the release of pro-apoptotic BH3-only activator proteins (BIM, PUMA, BID) from anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, BCL-w and A1) that in turn activate BAX and BAK leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of cytochrome C. BH3 activator proteins are released either by reduction in expression of an anti- apoptotic BCL-2 protein to which they are bound or if a sensitizer (such as NOXA, BAD or a BH3 mimetic) releases the BH3 activator protein from binding the anti-apoptotic. When a cell has its anti-apoptotics largely bound by pro-apoptotics (bringing it closer to the apoptotic threshold) it is ?primed for death?. Resistant MM, acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemia and various solid tumors are found to be less primed for death that contributes to resistance. Thus finding alternative strategies to effectively re-engage BCL-2 proteins to increase the primed state can potentially circumvent resistance. Glucose and glutamine are key nutrients promoting proliferation and importantly, evasion of apoptosis through discrete regulation of BCL-2 proteins such as PUMA, BIM, NOXA, BAX, BAD and MCL-1. We have determined that nutrient deprivation leads to BCL-2 family alterations that effectively lower the apoptotic threshold i.e. increase the ?primed state?. Comparative metabolomics enabled identification of a subset of metabolites with potential roles in regulating BCL-2 protein expression and interactions. Inhibition of this subset of metabolic pathways sensitized a genetically diverse panel of MM cell lines and relapse/refractory patient samples to the BH3 mimetic class of small molecules. Furthermore, examination of gene expression profiles of MM patient's revealed upregulation of the enzymes involved in generation of these specific metabolites and segregated out patients with lower overall survival. One of the central questions we will investigate is how elevated expression of these enzymes correlates with actual metabolic flux to inform us of actionable targets. These observations form the basis of our rationale that delineating non-redundant rate-limiting metabolic enzymes regulating BCL-2 dependence will reveal strategies of potent metabolically-driven synthetic lethality with selectivity for tumor cells given the lower BCL-2 dependence of normal cells. Therefore, our long-term goals are to 1) understand how specific metabolic enzymes regulate the BCL-2 family of proteins and 2) demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic promise of targeting metabolic pathways in MM to circumvent resistance."

Their familiarity with disease classifications and pathogenesis, physical manifestations of tumors in tissue and clinical challenges in cancer care mean that these investigators can provide important perspectives in developing experimental models that recapitulate key aspects of human disease. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has a history of excellence in academic pathology, and today has state-of-the-art hospital and research environments attracting many talented and hard-working clinical trainees. Many have gone on to become nationally and internationally prominent researchers and pathologists. We have high confidence in our ability to continue to recruit some of the nation's brightest, most dedicated future physician-scientists to our department. The proposed training program, Opportunities for Pathology Trainees In Cancer research (OPTIC), will hugely augment our ability to develop these fellows, providing support for entirely `protected' research time during formative years as they initiate research projects and set directions for work that will define the outset of their independent careers. We expect to recruit 2 postdoctoral fellows annually, each entering the program at PGY2 or PGY4 for a total of up to 4 fellows by Year 2. Each trainee will select a research mentor from participating faculty - a stellar group recruited from the full spectrum of cancer research fields at the institution. All are accomplished investigators with an expertise in experimental cancer research and strong track records of laboratory based mentorship. In addition to research, trainees will participate in newly established, dedicated didactics and workshops to develop skills for their independent careers, and will enroll in other course work tailored to their individual interests and chosen to complement their previous experiences. Each trainee will convene meetings of an Individual Progress Committee, members of which will provide feedback on their progress, recommend specific near-term research goals and training activities, and generally be available as career mentors and advocates. We expect that fellows will leave the program poised for transitions to mentored and independent faculty positions in academic pathology departments and fully prepared to conduct high impact cancer research."
"9247023","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since enzymes are involved in most life processes, it is crucial to gain a detailed understanding of their action. The importance of such an understanding is highlighted by the fact that many diseases can be controlled by developing drugs that block the action of enzymes in crucial biological pathways of pathogens that cause these diseases. Quantifying the analysis of enzyme catalysis can be greatly advanced by computer simulation approaches that correlate enzyme structures with their activity. Here the progress should involve both advances in quantifying the fundamental basis of enzyme catalysis and in developing practical predictive power in studies of diverse classes of enzymes. Thus we propose to continue in advancing the frontiers of this field, while shifting a significant part of ur focus to the the emerging field of enzyme design. The advances on this front should provide a deeper understanding of catalysis, help in controlling what a given enzyme is doing as well as the use of specialized enzymes. We note, however, that the progress in enzyme design has not yet led to designer enzymes that rival native enzymes. Thus, it is clear that the potential of this field can be greatly enhanced by computational approaches that evaluate the activation barriers of the reactions that are being catalyzed. In order to progress in both quantifying enzyme design and in enhancing the general understanding of enzyme catalysis, we propose parallel advances in the following directions: (i) We will validate the reliability of our EVB-based computer-aided enzyme design by reproducing the observed catalytic effects of key designer enzymes. (ii) We will continue to develop more quantitative design concepts as well as fast screening methods. After exploring the predictive power of these approaches, we will use them in collaboration with research groups that are involved in actual enzyme design experiments. (iii) We will continue to advance quantitative computational methods including the paradynamics QM(ai)/MM-FEP approach that should help us to obtain activation free energies of enzymatic reactions by ab initio methods. (iv) We will quantify the relationship between folding and stability and explore th relationship between thermostability and catalysis. (v) We will explore the catalytic effect of directed evolution, trying to elucidate its relationship to natural evolution. (vi) We will conduct studies of several important classes of enzymatic reactions. (vii) We will continue with the systematic examination of different nonelectrostatic catalytic proposals."
"9256399","Core B: Tissue, Peptide and Genetics Resource Core  This program project is broadly focused on understanding the mechanisms by which inflammation modulates  AD pathogenesis. An additional theme of this project is focused on how proteins recently identified by  Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in Alzheimer disease (AD) modulate the infiammatory cascade,  contribute to endocytic dysfunction, and impair protein trafficking/clearance, and thereby increase AD risk.  An overarching goal of the program project is to utilize molecular, cellular and animal model systems to  identify and characterize mechanisms and pathways associated AD neuropathology (e.g. Aß, tau,  inflammation, and synaptic and neuronal loss) and neuroinflammation. The outcome of these studies can be  translated and verifled in human autopsy brain specimens. The Tissue, Peptide, and Genetics Core plays a  key role in support of the program project research goals. To achieve these goals, the Tissue, Peptide and  Genetics Core has four aims. (1) Produce and provide well-characterized, high quality peptides, antibodies,  and Aß assays to individual investigators. All program investigators require either Aß peptides, preparations  of different types of Aß assembly states, or both soluble and insoluble Aß measurements. (2) Carry out high-  throughput analysis for newly identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles for late-onset AD  to support investigator research. Individual investigators will require SNP data from living subjects, from  induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts, as well as from brain autopsy specimens. (3) The  Tissue, Peptide, and Genetics Core will support program project research by providing dedicated high quality  clinically and neuropathologically characterized human autopsy and biological specimens (blood, fibroblasts)  for use by program project investigators (including SNP data from GWAS-identified AD-risk genes). (4)  Coordinate and maintain a database of quantitative variables and of resource use to be shared among  program investigators. The Core collates and integrates quantitative neurobiological and clinical data, which  will be provided to investigators to allow the seamless integration of data from individual research projects"
"9346975","Project Summary  The long term goal of this project is to develop, validate and commercialize a PCR-based molecular test for routine Alzheimer?s disease (AD) testing that will provide more comprehensive risk estimates for disease and offer a superior option for clinical trial assays that can help accelerate drug development. This test anticipates the utility of a powerful risk marker in the TOMM40 gene (rs10524523 or ?523) that is difficult to genotype accurately due to a variable length poly-T repeat. The novel, single-tube workflow will combine the determination of repeat polymorphisms at this locus with the detection of well-established Apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk alleles to improve AD risk estimates. The proposal is innovative in that it addresses the analytical challenges associated with the analysis of the high homology poly-T polymorphism in TOMM40 to achieve reliable single-base resolution and define reliable thresholds for risk assessment, and combines this method with genotyping of the three common APOE risk alleles ?2, ?3 and ?4. Taken together, this test will produce risk estimates for the vast majority of the population rather than just those with ?4. This work addresses unmet needs for more informative tools to help predict the onset of AD and inform the management of at-risk individuals and/or those with mild cognitive impairment that may progress to AD. Once available, the test is expected to improve clinical outcomes by enabling benefits from early treatment. The test will also be useful as a clinical research tool to glean the full impact of TOMM40 and APOE on AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, and to help support emerging targeted therapeutics and clinical trials.  Aim 1: Combine the detection of both APOE and TOMM40 into a rapid and simple single test assay using  Asuragen?s novel AmplideX® technology in conjunction with toehold hairpin primers.  Aim 2: Verify the combined APOE and TOMM40 assay using well-characterized cell-line DNA, defined  synthetic templates, and 50 matched and blinded blood and buccal samples.  Future work will further the development these assays by incorporating controls, interpretative software, and integration consistent with a diagnostic system for risk assessment with a path to an IVD or companion diagnostic for an AD therapeutics. The outcome of the assay development will be new tools that can also incorporate patient-specific information to improve risk assessments and inform links between genotype and neurodegenerative phenotype."

Our microbial genomics group has developed research programs in numerous viruses  and has already sequenced over 6,500 viral strains from around the world.  By leveraging the capacity and resources we have built in viral sequencing, as well as our field efforts and  collaborations over the last decade, we will investigate three of the world's most important emerging infectious  pathogens: Lassa Virus (LASV) and Dengue Virus (DENV), both Category A agents, and West Nile Virus (WNV), a  Category B agent. These pathogens are notable for the high mortality, widespread disease and public health  importance (in the US and elsewhere) they represent. Understanding how these small RNA viruses rapidly adapt to and  escape from host selection pressures, including adaptive immune responses, is key to the design of viral diagnostics,  vaccines and therapeutic drugs.  Through our own efforts and through collaborations with clinicians and researchers, we have access to many important  clinical and field samples that enable us to study not only viral evolution and spread within different geographic  locations (Africa, South America and North America), but also viral adaptation within infected individuals. Rich  collections of sample-associated metadata allow us to correlate viral genotype with disease severity and clinical  outcome. Use of robust animal models of infection that recapitulate human disease progression will generate important  insights into the pathology of LASV, DENV and WNV. Given the enzootic life cycle of these viruses, we are also  investigating viral evolution and transmission within their natural hosts, which Include rodents, birds and mosquitos.  Finally, we will take advantage of our existing global sample collection sites to investigate samples from patients who  present symptoms similar to those caused by our diseases of study, but whose diagnoses remain unknown (FUOs,  Fevers of Unknown Origin).  Through these efforts we expect to better understand viral emergence and adaptation on a geographic scale as well as  through the viral life cycle, from natural reservoirs to human infections. Detailed examination of viral diversity from field  and clinical samples will provide remarkable insight into the dynamics of evolution and adaptation that are required for  these viruses to emerge from isolated outbreaks to endemic disease with increasing health burdens worldwide."

"9287850","DATA MANAGEMENT AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE: SUMMARY In the management of biomedical data, features such as controlled access and audit trail are important in ensuring data quality, but establishing such a system requires capacity not just in proximate technical terms ? hardware, software and personnel ? but also in terms of organization and infrastructure. Although mobile applications can facilitate rapid and more community-based data collection, their use of cloud storage and other features can add complexity. Sequencing and ?omics? technologies generate large amounts of complex data which pose new challenges including ensuring traceability, and standardizing metadata and data flow across protocols. New quantitative methods have been required for reliable analysis of such data including standardized quality control protocols, new concepts such as the false discovery rate, and identification of signaling and metabolic pathways. Geostatistical and niche models have the potential to predict areas of high risk of infectious diseases but they require the collection, pre-processing and superposition of detailed data from multiple sources, such as satellites, digital elevation models and disease surveillance, as well as advanced statistical methods such as maximum entropy analysis and modeling of spatial autocorrelation. The goal of this Data Management and Biostatistics Core is to ensure that data from the research projects are accurate, secure, and comply with applicable standards, and to support their quantitative analysis, including bioinformatics and statistics. To achieve this, we will develop the following specific aims. 1) Write, in collaboration with project investigators, detailed statistical analysis plans (SAPs) and Data Management Plans (DMPs) in accordance with their aims and with international standards. 2) Ensure each project?s data are analyzed quantitatively in accordance with its SAP. 3) Enhance CIDEIM data management capacity to more closely comply with ECRIN requirements, and ensure each project follows its DMP. 4) Enhance existing mHealth applications for presumptive diagnosis (clinical prediction rule) and treatment follow-up to include estimation of adverse drug reactions and final cure status.

"9249050","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) infection is often asymptomatic or may produce recurrent lesions in and around the mouth, commonly called cold sores. HSV can also infect the tissues of the eye. Ocular herpetic disease, typically caused by HSV-1 either through primary infection or reactivation from the trigeminal ganglia (TG), can have serious sequelae, including permanent corneal scarring and blindness. Herpes stromal keratitis (HSK) is the most common cause of infectious blindness in the developed world, and worldwide produces over 40,000 new cases of severe vision impairment or blindness each year. Interestingly, the majority of HSK tissue damage is thought to be immune-mediated rather than resulting from direct lytic effects of the virus. Even after the virus has successfully been cleared, high levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, immune cell infiltrates, and lymphangiogenesis persist. How HSV-1 infection of the eye leads to this chronic inflammatory syndrome is not well understood. By studying cellular factors that influence the host immune response, we will delineate the cascade of events that begin with viral infection and end with chronic inflammation and vision loss. This proposal represents a continuation of our studies of HSK that were originally funded as an R21. We have previously shown that for HSV-1 ocular infection, HVEM expression is important for eye infection and related disease. HVEM is a type I transmembrane protein of the TNF-receptor superfamily. HVEM is expressed on most cell types, including T cells, B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, epithelial cells, and dendritic cells. HVEM plays an important role in activation and inhibition of lymphocytes in a variety of immune responses. Although HVEM was first identified as a viral entry receptor, our preliminary data indicate this protein is not important for entry during ocular HSV-1 infection but rather has other important non-entry effects on the host immune response. The studies proposed here will address the immunomodulatory functions of HVEM during ocular HSV-1 infections, determine the cell type in which HVEM is expressed and is functionally active, and explore the role of the HVEM ligands BTLA, LIGHT, and CD160 in HSV-mediated ocular pathogenesis. By investigating how HVEM and its ligands contribute to HSK, we will better understand the viral-host interactions leading to an inflammatory syndrome that persists in the absence of replicating virus, providing a basis for therapeutic interventions for HSK directed at the aberrant immune response that targets the cornea that leads to HSK."
"9273791","Abstract This request is for a BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer which will function as a multiuser instrument in a core facility at the Center for Inflammation, Infectious Diseases and Immunity in the Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University. The system will significantly enhance the research of five major users who are conducting NIH funded research and multiple minor users. While this cytometer will primarily be used for NIH funded research, instrument time will also be provided to new investigators and investigators seeking to obtain preliminary data for submission of an NIH grant. The Quillen College of Medicine currently has a FacsCalibur flow cytometer that was purchased in 2000; while the cytometer continues to be used extensively by the investigators participating in this application, it has limited color options and no sorting capacity. All of the College of Medicine investigators are dependent on this flow cytometer. Cytometric technology has advanced dramatically in the last several years and the research questions that we are currently asking require that we employ state-of-the-art cytometric techniques that are not available on our current instrument. We are clearly at the point where our current cytometer does not meet the needs of NIH funded investigators, many of whom require not only sorting capabilities but also an integrated biosafety cabinet to meet the requirements of bioprotection inherent in their translational studies. Furthermore, there are no flow cytometers comparable to the BD FACSAria Fusion, requested in this application, within a 200 mile radius of East Tennessee State University. Therefore, this application addresses a significant research need. The East Tennessee State University and the Quillen College of Medicine have a strong institutional commitment to the acquisition and maintenance of the flow cytometer. A 100 sq. ft. room, that is appropriately outfitted to house the instrument, has been allocated. Provisions have been made to underwrite the service contract once the initial warranty period has expired. An advisory committee has been established. A doctoral level scientist, with experience in flow cytometry, will supervise the facility with the assistance of an experienced research technician."
"9251812","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Müller glial cells (MGs) are the primary support cells in the vertebrate retina. In cold-blooded vertebrates such as zebrafish, MGs are a source of stem cells for they can readily re-enter the cell cycle and replenish lost neurons, establishing a powerful self-repair mechanism. In mammals, however, MGs are naturally quiescent and lack regenerative capability. Photoreceptors are the most abundant cells in the mammalian retina and they mediate the first step in vision. The death of photoreceptors is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in major retinal degenerative diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Extensive research efforts aimed at restoring the regenerative capability of MGs in mammals have met with little success. Current strategies for MG-derived photoreceptor regeneration rely on retinal injury and treatment of the whole retina with various factors. Retinal injury kills retinal neurons in the first place. Global treatment of the entire retina may lead to undesirable side effects in untargeted cells. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular and cellular pathways underlying MG-derived photoreceptor regeneration, and to develop strategies to activate the regenerative capability of mammalian MGs for retinal self-repair. We propose to reprogram adult mouse MGs, in vivo, for regeneration of rod photoreceptors without retinal injury, through the following Aims: Aim 1) Investigate whether Wnt signaling is an injury-induced signaling pathway to activate MG proliferation. We will examine whether neurotoxic injury activates Wnt signaling and further test whether inhibition of Wnt signaling suppressed injury-induced MG proliferation. To target MGs cell-type-specifically, we will develop a gene transfer method targeting MGs cell-type-specifically. Aim 2) Restore the retinal progenitor/stem cell status of MGs through activation of Wnt signaling, without introduction of retinal injury. We will investigate whether gene transfer of ?-catenin activates Wnt signaling and MG proliferation without retinal injury. GSk3? regulates Wnt signaling by phosphorylation of ?-catenin leading to its degradation. We will examine whether deletion of GSK3? activates Wnt signaling and MG proliferation without retinal injury. Aim 3) Guide the differentiation of MG-derived retinal progenitor/stem cells to rod photoreceptors. We will guide the differentiation of MG-derived retinal progenitor/stem cells by gene transfer of transcription factors that are essential for rod photoreceptor cell fate determination and differentiation during retinal development, and test whether MG-derived new rods develop molecular, structural, and functional properties of native rods. Our proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms and functional implications of MG-derived rod photoreceptor regeneration in adult mammalian retina, and will set the stage for retinal self-repair in a major group of retinal degenerative diseases typically characterized by photoreceptor degeneration."
"9084485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A truly preventive or targeted therapy against colon cancer does not yet exist. However, hormone replacement therapy in women unexpectedly resulted in reduced risk of colorectal cancer, use of oral contraceptives is associated with a lower incidence of this disease, and estradiol has been shown to reduce the formation of preneoplastic lesions in the colon. Estrogen receptor beta (ERß) is the predominant estrogen receptor in the human colonic epithelium; polymorphisms in this gene are related to colon cancer incidence and its loss in tumors is related to advanced Dukes staging and poorer survival. In vivo mouse studies have demonstrated that ERß agonist treatment prevents intestinal tumor development and that deletion of ERß leads to an increase in colon adenomas. Collectively, these observations clearly point to a protective role for ERß in colorectal cancer. Estrogen receptors have significant consequences in health and diseases. They can be activated or inactivated by ligands, and are ideal candidates for therapeutic targeting. Compounds exist that selectively activate ERß, circumventing the adverse effects that estrogen induces in men and women through ER? activation. As ERß hold significant potential as a target for colon cancer therapy, it is essential to understand the basic mechanistic background of its action and to identify biomarkers of its activity. The PI's preliminary data supports the existence of three critical mechanisms whereby ERß exerts these effects in the colon. These three mechanisms are 1) a predicted ERß and PROX1 interaction, 2) an anti-inflammatory response via repression of NFkB/IL-6 signaling and 3) anti-oncogenic effects through the regulation of miRNA mediated pathways, including the miR17-92 and miR-200a/b clusters. This project takes advantage of the skills of the Center for Nuclear Receptors and Cell Signaling to provide a detailed understanding of ERß's role and potential in colon cancer prevention and treatment. The overall objective of this project is to provide the mechanistic basis for novel colo cancer prevention and therapy utilizing ERß."
"9244764","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award. The long-term objective of this application is to understand how neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contribute to decision-making behavior. This is a fundamental objective in the study of drug abuse, a condition in which individuals consistently make self-harming decisions, and in which OFC function is known to be altered.  The experiments will focus on a common feature of everyday decision-making: when offered a choice between several items (such as products on a supermarket shelf), humans briefly shift the focus of their gaze onto each of the items prior to rendering their decision. Recent studies have shown - somewhat against intuition - that these visual fixations can actively influence whether an item is chosen: specifically, longer fixation on a given item makes it more likely to be chosen than the alternatives. This bias takes hold naturally during free viewing, and when longer fixation is forced experimentally. Given that humans constantly move their eyes, this gaze-based choice bias could weigh into many of the decisions we make on a daily basis.  To investigate the neural basis of this gaze-based choice bias, three experiments will be performed. In the first, an animal model of this behavior will be established. The subjects will be presented with two visual targets associated with different reward magnitudes (values), and will fix their gaze on these targets for variable lengths of time prior to choosing one. The key question will be the degree to which longer fixation on a given target increases that target's likelihood of being chosen, as it does in humans. In the second experiment, the subjects will perform the above task while the activity of OFC neurons is monitored. Here, the key question will be the degree to which OFC neural activity signals the value of the currently fixated target, even when other targets of differing value are shown simultaneously. This kind of value signal is thought to be a key signal that drives the gaze-based choice bias in humans. Finally, the subjects will perform the task while the neural activity of the OFC is disrupted. The key question will be whether the tendency to choose longer-fixated targets is attenuated by this disruption, indicating that the neurons of the OFC play a direct causal role in the behavior. Taken together these experiments will provide insight into neural mechanisms that are critical for everyday decisions, and that may be compromised in individuals with addiction-related deficits in OFC function.  During the award period, the candidate will undergo rigorous training in the neurophysiological techniques used in the experiments, and in the study of decision-making behavior. In addition to these scientific domains, training efforts will also focus on publishing productivity, and on other professional skills such as grantsmanship. The training will consist of hands-on experience, tutorials from several mentors, and coursework. Completing the proposed research project and associated training will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the neurobiology of decision-making."
