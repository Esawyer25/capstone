"9387501","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of opioid tolerance and dependence continues to be a widespread public health concern. Opioids generate addictive effects by activating G protein coupled receptors in the striatum, which leads to adaptive changes in signaling pathways. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular regulation of striatal G protein activity due to its importance for managing drug addiction. Recent work has revealed that G protein signaling is deactivated within the cell by a family of proteins termed Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS). This provides the cell an intrinsic mechanism to modulate signaling during receptor stimulation by drugs of abuse, however little is known about the roles of RGS in addiction. This proposal is focused on the molecular regulation of signaling reactions by essential striatal RGS proteins during the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. Recent work has shown that RGS7 and RGS9-2 bind the same adapter proteins to form macromolecular complexes in the striatum. The abundance of these RGS subunits is sensitive to morphine exposure and mouse models have revealed the differential involvement of the RGS complex subunits in shaping behavioral responses to opioids. Collectively with our preliminary data, we hypothesize the RGS complex plays an essential role in regulating MOR signaling that gates sensitivity to the central downstream effector adenylate cyclase and the generation of the second messenger cAMP. This hypothesis will be tested in two complementary aims: 1) To understand adaptations in adenylate cyclase-cAMP axis in response to opioid receptor activation and the role of RGS complex in this process, 2) To characterize the mechanistic role of individual subunits in the RGS complex in controlling opioid signaling. Our approach will utilize optical assessment of live brain slice preparations from a multitude of genetic mouse models in addition to advanced cell-based assays. The conclusion of these studies will greatly expand our knowledge of opioid signaling plasticity, roles of RGS proteins in addiction, and evaluation of a novel mouse model."
"9414804","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses infecting either plants or animals use ribosome recoding and other forms of non-canonical translation to produce important viral proteins such as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In addition to viruses, evidence is emerging that ribosome recoding may be more widespread in eukaryotic genomes than initially thought and could have important implications for human diseases. Recoding events occur at a specific frequency and are critical for maintaining efficient replication. Previous animal virus recoding research has focused only on a small region of RNA surrounding the recoding site, assuming that all critical RNA structures are located in that small stretch of RNA. However, work using model plant viruses, including Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), has shown that RNA elements far outside of the recoding region play a critical role in recoding efficiency. Here, the importance of alternative RNA structures and long-range RNA:RNA interactions involving recoding sequences will be determined for Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). EMCV is in the cardiovirus genus of Picornaviridae which includes the recently discovered human pathogen, Saffold virus. TCV will also be used to find novel internal ribosome entry sites, or IRES, which likely promote expression of the coat protein and novel isoforms of the RdRp. These studies will increase our understanding of ribosome recoding and IRES function in small RNA viruses. I will address the following questions in the proposed studies:  1) Are long-range RNA:RNA interactions required for efficient recoding in EMCV? Using full-length genome constructs, an in vitro and in vivo translation reporter assay will be developed to determine the effects of disrupting predicted long-range interactions on frameshifting. Reverse genetics will be used to determine if disrupting long-range RNA:RNA interactions is detrimental for virus accumulation.  2) Do alternative RNA structures in the EMCV recoding region exist? Critical alternative recoding structures exist for TCV and similar structures are predicted by folding algorithms to exist for EMCV. SHAPE RNA structure probing will be used to determine the structure of the EMCV recoding region both in vitro and in vivo. The importance of alternative structures in recoding will be determined using both in vitro and in vivo translation assays.  3) Locate novel IRES in TCV. The coat protein and novel RdRp isoforms are expressed from internal initiation in in vitro translation assays. The IRES sequences responsible for either coat protein or RdRp isoform expression will be determined experimentally using SHAPE, mutagenesis, and in vitro translation assays. The importance of RdRp isoforms for TCV accumulation will also be determined.  The proposed studies will greatly benefit the ribosome recoding and IRES-related fields by taking an innovative approach that will bridge animal and plant virus studies."
"9412099","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Symbiotic organisms must use a variety of mechanisms to maintain their relationship. Often, they produce signals that their partner specifically responds to, inducing physiological changes that facilitate development or maintenance of the symbiosis.  The relationship between the gamma proteobacteria Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes is a well-studied mutualism. V. fischeri is the only bacterium capable of colonizing the squid's light organ immediately after hatching, and continues to reside within the crypts of the light organ throughout the life of the host. In exchange for various nutrients and a stable environment, V. fischeri produces light at high densities, which is thought to mask the squid's shadow while it is nocturnally active.  V. fischeri produces many molecular signals that induce physical changes in the squid light organ, such as lipopolysaccharide and tracheal cytotoxin (TCT). Recently, we found that, like all other gram-negative bacteria and many gram- positive bacteria, V. fischeri produces outer membrane vesicles (OMV). OMV often carry specific molecular cargo between bacteria and other organisms, mediating their interactions. Interestingly, these OMV were able to provoke a basic response from the squid that mimicked that of the entire bacterium. Also, this response was orthogonal to that induced by other known stimulants, indicating that OMV represented a novel means of communication between host and bacterium.  This project aims to discern the composition of V. fischeri OMV, and to measure how these components affect the squid-Vibrio symbiosis. We will also assess the importance of OMV as a delivery mechanism, and predict the importance that these objects have on other mutualistic relationships."
"9220396","PROJECT SUMMARY Anal and vulvar high-grade intraepithelial lesions (AIN3/VIN3) often recur after primary treatment, with 30% local recurrence or progression in the 5-years following treatment. Surgeries for recurrence can be debilitating and associated with compromised quality of life. Most AIN3/VIN3 (>90%) are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), and emerging data suggest a therapeutic use of the licensed prophylactic HPV vaccine may reduce risk of recurrence. The licensure trials showed that the HPV vaccine prevents AIN3/VIN3 among women who were HPV negative (uninfected) at vaccination. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial to test whether the 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) will reduce recurrence in previously unvaccinated persons treated for AIN3/VIN3. A non-randomized study suggested that recurrence following surgical treatment for AIN2/3 was reduced by 50% by HPV vaccination. In addition, our pilot study showed that recurrence after VIN3 was less likely among HPV16 antibody positive women compared to those without an HPV16 antibody response (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9) among unvaccinated women. Based on prior studies and our pilot data, we hypothesize that the high burden of recurrence of AIN3/VIN3 could be reduced 50% by vaccination. Following primary surgical treatment, we will randomize 345 patients with AIN3/VIN3 to receive 9-valent Gardasil or placebo. The primary endpoint is the efficacy of the vaccine against biopsy-documented recurrence. The study, called the HPV Vaccine to Interrupt Progression of Vulvar and Anal Lesions Trial (the VIVA Trial), will also evaluate the safety of the vaccine in the study population. The VIVA trial includes centralized pathology review of initial and recurrent lesions and active surveillance for recurrence during study visits over 3 years. Secondary endpoints will explore etiologic questions to assess whether persistence of HPV infection and HPV antibodies are associated with recurrence; these data could eventually add importantly to selection of individual patients for closer monitoring or more aggressive treatment. Our scientific team has extensive expertise in conducting vaccine trials, conducting HPV surveillance and histopathology, and performing HPV laboratory assays. The designated study pathologist will evaluate all study biopsies to assess recurrence status. This will be the first US-based trial of the concept and, if it is successful, could lead to changes in practice, as administration of the licensed HPV vaccine would be a low-cost additional treatment for AIN3/VIN3."
"9237193","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal describes the development of a regenerative treatment for acute kidney injury based on recent advances in reprogramming to change cell fate. Specifically, nuclear reprogramming technology will be employed to create a population of induced nephron progenitor cells. The nephron progenitor cells of the kidney are the only cell type known to be capable of differentiation into all parts of the nephron. Unfortunately, these cells are only found in the cap mesenchyme and are not normally present in the adult kidney. Our collaborators little and colleagues have identified six factors that can convert tubule cells into induced nephron progenitor cells. To capitalize on recent advances in nuclear reprogramming technology for the treatment of acute kidney injury, we will create an artificial population of induced nephron progenitors. This population will be created in situ, or in place, following the delivery of the reprogramming genes to kidney cells of mice in vivo. Others have used in situ reprogramming to successfully treat mouse models of diabetes and cardiac ischemia, suggesting that in situ reprogramming technology may also be useful for protection from ischemia reperfusion injury in the kidney. The reprogramming genes will be carried into the existing kidney cells using a newly developed gene transfer technique. An inducible piggyBac transposon will be used to integrate the genes into the genomes of renal cells and reprogramming will be initiated upon doxycycline induction. Markers of nephron progenitor cells that are not found normally in adult kidneys (Six2, Cited1) will be examined to determine the number and location of induced nephron progenitors in the treated kidneys. Following acute kidney injury, measures of kidney function such as serum creatinine and long-term fibrosis will be assayed to determine the effect of the induced nephron progenitor population on the severity and recovery from injury. Finally, we will determine how the induced nephron progenitor cells protect from acute kidney injury by performing fate- mapping studies in a double transgenic mouse model. These double transgenic mice express a tamoxifen- inducible Cre recombinase from the Cited1 promoter and contain a LacZ transgene that will express LacZ only after Cre recombination. Therefore, only cells that are progeny of the Cited1+ induced nephron progenitor cells will express LacZ. This will allow tracking of the nephron progenitor cell fate by visualization of all LacZ+ cells following acute kidney injury. We hypothesize that the induced nephron progenitors may function to ameliorate acute kidney injury by migrating to sites of damage and replacing the damaged cells, thereby restoring injured nephrons. This would represent a novel mechanism of recovery from acute kidney injury. In conclusion, in situ reprogramming to create induced nephron progenitors represents a potentially powerful treatment for acute kidney injury."
"9408119","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project examines the role of protein acetylation in mediating nutrient-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Lysine acetylation (AcK) has emerged as an important reversible post-translational modification. The biochemical environment of the mitochondrial compartment is particularly favorable for acetylation and recent studies have identified multiple AcK sites on a large number of mitochondrial proteins, including several metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Increased mitochondrial AcK levels correlate with metabolic dysfunction in the context of aging and obesity. A growing body of evidence suggests that acetylation of specific lysine residues on mitochondrial proteins impairs metabolic regulation leading to glucose intolerance, and compromises skeletal muscle performance during exercise. The protein responsible for deacetylation within the mitochondria, sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), has been identified. However the molecular events that promote mitochondrial AcK remain poorly understood. Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), a metabolic intermediate of glucose and fat catabolism, is the proposed substrate required for reversible acetylation. In vitro studies  suggest mitochondrial AcK can occur non-enzymatically as a result of elevated mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production and/or accumulation. In addition, recent studies of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) underscore an important link between elevated acetyl-CoA levels, mitochondrial AcK and metabolic regulation. CrAT converts acetyl-CoA to its membrane permeate carnitine conjugate, acetylcarnitine. The CrAT reaction permits the mitochondrial efflux of excess acetyl groups and thereby has the potential to influence AcK events that are driven by mass action. This prediction is supported by preliminary studies from the laboratory showing that CrAT deficiency in mice exacerbates mitochondrial AcK in response to nutrient excess. Furthermore, CrAT ablation in the skeletal muscle results in metabolic dysfunction and exercise intolerance. The objective of this proposal is to determine if lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins contributes to the metabolic consequences of CrAT deficiency. The proposed studies will focus upon the molecular and physiological characterization of CrAT deficient cells and mice. First, we will test the hypothesis that stimuli that decrease mitochondrial acetylation can restore metabolic function in CrAT deficient myocytes. Second, we will use mice with a muscle-specific deletion of CrAT to determine whether normalization of mitochondrial AcK status restores glucose and/or exercise tolerance in the absence muscle CrAT. The results from these studies will expand our understanding of the functional relevance of mitochondrial AcK and could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for treating age- and obesity- related skeletal muscle metabolic dysfunction and exercise intolerance."
"9346456","SUMMARY Once considered a death sentence, infection with HIV is now a manageable, chronic disease. To keep the viral load low and to prevent progression to AIDS, patients are required to adhere to a regime of multiple antivirals for life. Long-term treatment does not eliminate the virus and can lead to serious toxicities. Therapies that either cure infection or that offer improvements in convenience or tolerability are needed. Current anti-HIV therapeutics target fewer than half a dozen protein active sites. Significant recent advances in the structural biology of HIV offer an opportunity to develop therapeutics that target tertiary structures within the HIV RNA genome that are essential to the viral replication cycle. RNA is a compelling target for small-molecule drug discovery, and the genomes of RNA viruses, such as HIV, contain highly conserved targetable structures. Multiple natural products target ribosomal RNA, establishing proof of concept for RNA as a drug target; however, RNA-targeted drug discovery remains a nascent field. Specific tertiary structures in the HIV RNA genome are essential for viral replication, and we are ideally positioned to develop a screening system for small molecules that bind to these tertiary structure elements. The well-characterized Rev response element (RRE) forms a complex with Rev protein that is essential for export of HIV RNAs from the nucleus, a process necessary for productive infection. We will employ the Ribometrix lead discovery platform to identify small molecules with favorable medicinal chemistry properties that bind to the RRE to block binding of Rev or to disrupt the tertiary structure recognized by Rev. These leads will serve as a foundation for development of novel anti-HIV therapeutics. At Ribometrix, our lead discovery platform combines SHAPE-MaP, a high-quality, rigorous biophysical technology for RNA structure analysis, and fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), a well-validated strategy for lead compound identification that allows efficient sampling of chemical space. The strategy we propose to develop here can be used in efforts to identify small molecules that bind to and disrupt structures of diverse therapeutically important RNAs. Thus, we are poised to fully test and establish proof-of-principle for an efficient and generic approach for RNA-targeted ligand discovery, focused on a critical step of the HIV replication cycle."
"9413085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The small intestine contains a significant number of intraepithelial T cells (IELs) that express CD8?? homodimer and ??TCRs. Currenlty these cells function and antigenic specificities remain enigmatic. Our long term goal is to understand how these cells contribute to homeostatic balance in the intestine, and how their TCR repertoires respond to microbial flora. Our central hypothesis is that clonal expansions and selective trophism of these IELs depends on microbial antigens that these cells recognize in vivo. These interactions may also contribute to sustain intestinal equilibrium. To test our hypothesis we propose two specific aims. First we will show how these IELs ??TCR repertoire changes in response to particular microbial species. We will examine this issue in a mouse model mice where T cells express semi diverse repertoire of TCRs and in vivo activated IELs are labeled with fluorescent protein (GFP). Limited diversity of TCRs allows to track individual IEL clones in response to different microbial species and organs using TCR CDR3 regions as clone-specific tags, whereas GFP allows to isolate IELs activated in their native environment. We expect to show that prime repertoire of IELs is broad, but become more oligoclonal following contacts with specific commensal antigens. In our Specific Aim 2 we propose to refine our new method to retrieve original pairs of ??TCRs sequences expressed by individual IELs for high-throughput sequencing (HTS), and use this approach to determine natural diversity of ??TCRs on IELs from wild type mice. This protocol is universal and in the future can be used to analyze native ??TCRs from humans."
"9415800","PROJECT SUMMARY Obesity is a pandemic, gateway disease that significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). This application focuses on delineating the function of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) as an enhancer of the insulinotropic and anorectic effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (Glp1RA). Glp1RA represent a new class of T2D drugs that improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that modulate specific Glp1RA signaling events may provide a novel approach for treating T2D and obesity. OEA is an endocannabinoid-like lipid that was recently shown to bind to Glp1 and augment Glp1- mediated cAMP production. We compared the effects of OEA on signaling mechanisms associated with insulin secretion and suppression of food intake (cAMP production, ?-arrestin recruitment, cellular glucose metabolism) in the presence of three Glp1RA (Glp1, Exendin-4 [Ex4], and Liralgutide [Lira]). We discovered that OEA modulates Glp1RA signaling events in a Glp1RA-specific manner. First, OEA enhances Glp1- mediated cAMP production and ?-arrestin recruitment. Second, OEA enhances Glp1- and Ex4-mediated glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, we demonstrate that peripheral administration of pre- mixed Ex4-OEA is more potently anorectic compared to either Ex4 or OEA alone. Based on these findings, we will use in vitro and in vivo approaches to define the impact of Glp1RA-OEA interactions on signaling events associated with enhanced insulin secretion and suppression of food intake and on these physiological endpoints themselves. We hypothesize that OEA binds to Glp1RA and modulates Glp1R signaling events that enhance cellular glucose metabolism, resulting in increased insulin secretion and more potent reductions in food intake compared to Glp1RA or OEA alone. Aim 1 will focus on determining the interaction dynamics between Glp1RA and OEA. Aim 2 will identify molecular signatures associated with Glp1RA-OEA combinations with a particular emphasis on mechanisms associated with insulin secretion and satiety (e.g., cellular glucose metabolism). Aim 3 will elucidate the impact of Glp1RA-OEA administration on insulin secretion and food intake. In the long-term, we seek to leverage this information towards the identification of more effective diabetes and weight loss therapies."
"9212182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The OVERALL OBJECTIVE of this application is to develop a novel quantitative computed tomography (CT)-based method for precise identification of coronary artery lesions that cause ischemia. At present, no non-invasive test exists that determines both coronary artery disease (CAD) stenosis severity and whether a stenosis causes ischemia, or reduced myocardial perfusion. Physiologic stress testing by myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the traditional method for evaluating CAD, and identifies ischemia but not stenoses. In contrast, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) enables direct anatomic visualization of CAD, but cannot discriminate whether a stenosis causes ischemia.  By invasive methods, a combined anatomic-physiologic approach to CAD evaluation by invasive coronary angiography and fractional flow reserve (FFR), respectively, improves diagnosis of patients with stenoses that cause ischemia, reduces unnecessary revascularization, and improves clinical outcomes. Recently, a combined anatomic-physiologic approach by non-invasive methods has become possible by the addition of CT perfusion (CTP) to CCTA. Similar to MPI, CTP permits physiologic assessment of stenoses through measures of regional myocardial signal attenuation. Early studies of CTP have been constrained by several limitations, including: 1) shading artifacts; 2) motion artifacts; 3) lack of a quantitative method for assessing perfusion; 4 excess radiation; and 5) an inability to pinpoint specific lesions that cause ischemia.  Projection based dual-energy CT (DECT) is a novel CT technology that directly addresses many of these limitations, providing the potential for dramatic reduction in artifacts and quantitative measurement of myocardial perfusion. Coupled with improvements in temporal resolution that reduce motion artifacts, DECT holds the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of CTP, with an undoubtedly positive and significant impact on the current diagnostic approach to patients with suspected CAD. The OVERALL HYPOTHESIS of this proposal is that a novel quantitative projection-based DECT-based method will enable discrimination of individuals who suffer from myocardial ischemia as well as the identification of the specific coronary artery lesions that are the cause. For this study, there are 3 specific aims: 1) Develop a novel DECT method that accurately quantifies material density; 2) Determine the in vitro diagnostic accuracy of novel DECT method to characterize myocardial perfusion; 3) Evaluate the in vivo diagnostic accuracy of CTP by the novel DECT method to determine coronary lesion-specific ischemia, as compared to an invasive FFR gold standard."
"9242018","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angiotensin II (AngII) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of human hypertension. Increasing evidence suggests that AngII induces hypertension primarily by triggering the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), particularly the renin response in the collecting duct (CD) that results in generation of endogenous AngII. Along this line, (pro)renin receptor (PRR), a newly discovered component of tissue RAS and activator of renin and prorenin, is colocalized with renin in the CD and its expression is similarl stimulated by AngII. Preliminary studies demonstrated that AngII-induced hypertension along with the elevated PRR and renin expression was all blunted by COX-2 inhibition or EP4 antagonism. On the other hand, overexpression of PRR in IMCD cells is shown to increase COX-2 expression. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that COX-2/EP4 and PRR/renin positively regulate each other's expression/activity in the CD forming a vicious cycle which amplifies the local renin response for maximal AngII generation and then ENaC activation during AngII-induced hypertension. Three specific aims have been designed to test the general hypothesis. Aim 1 uses CD-specific EP4 knockout model to test the hypothesis that the activation of CD EP4 receptor results in sequential activation of PRR, renin, and ENaC, ultimately leading to elevation of BP in response to AngII infusion. Aim 2 uses mice with CD-specific overexpression or deletion of renin to test the hypothesis that the activity of local RAS n the distal nephron positively affects renal prostaglandin synthesis. The alteration of renal COX-2 transcriptional activity is monitored by in vivo imaging of luciferase knock-in reporter mice following AngII infusion. Aim 3 employs a novel PRR decoy peptide coupled with the intramedullary infusion technique to test the hypothesis that inhibition of renal medullary PRR attenuates local renin response and BP during AngII infusion. New information resulted from this proposal is expected to offer new insight into the renal mechanism of AngII-induced hypertension and also help define the therapeutic potential of the newly developed PRR decoy peptide for treatment of hypertension and kidney disease."
"9404200","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes a focused 3-year training plan that will enable me, a psychologist with background in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of cocaine addiction, to initiate clinical neuroscience research employing tools from neuroeconomics, an emerging field that combines neuroscience and economics to understand how people or the brain make decisions. Supervised by neuroeconomics (Dr. Glimcher) and addiction (Dr. Ross) experts, the current proposal aims to test how craving might bias addicted individuals' decisions toward drug use and away from other courses of action. Craving is the intense desire for a specific drug and is thought to increase behavioral indices of its subjective value (SV). The underlying mechanism of this influence, however, has not been determined. The overlap in the neural circuits that represent craving and those involved in the computation and comparison of SVs when making a choice, such as the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, raises the possibility that craving might bias decisions towards the drug by increasing neural activity in this circuit specifically associated with the drug's SV. n alternative view stemming from research on incidental emotions suggests that craving could also influence decisions by nonspecific effects in this circuit, such that mood states that accompany craving or perhaps craving itself, might modify category- independent SVs (those related as well as unrelated to the drug of choice). To test which of these mechanisms is at play and its underlying neurobiological basis, opioid users undergoing a detoxification program, in whom craving and mood states are expected to be particularly variable, will first complete repeated testing sessions where they will rate their level of craving and mood, provide physiological measures of arousal, and make hypothetical decisions on tasks designed to establish the SV of drug-related (e.g., different amounts of the drug, drug paraphernalia) and drug-unrelated items (e.g., consumer goods such as event tickets, DVDs, accessories, etc. and food). This design will allow for testing the specificity of craving's influence on SVs [as compare with other mood states and as a function of the types of items being evaluated (drug-related, drug-unrelated)]. Detoxified subjects will then complete fMRI following experimentally induced craving or a neutral condition in a randomized, crossover design. During fMRI, subjects will perform a novel hybrid decision making task that intersperses craving (symptom-capture) and similar decision (cognitive-task-based) trials. Given that craving will be manipulated directly, ths latter component will allow for testing, in a causal manner, how real-time craving influences neural signals that track the two types of SVs. If successful, results of this proposal may help advance our understanding of drug addiction by linking a specific neural computation to the occurrence of a specific symptom. Results may also help identify new therapeutic targets (drug-related SVs and their neural correlates) amenable to pharmacological and behavioral interventions and inform treatment development aimed at reversing the specific decision biases caused by fluctuations in craving."
"9421591","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During mitosis, chromosomes are accurately segregated to daughter cells by a microtubule-based structure called the mitotic spindle. It has long been recognized that undetected microtubule damage causes mitotic defects and genetic instability which renders cells susceptible to tumorigenesis. A well-established pathway, the spindle assembly checkpoint pathway, ensures equal separation of sister chromatids and is conserved in all eukaryotes. We recently uncovered evidence for a new pathway, unique to vertebrates, which can also sense microtubule stress. Combined genetic, cellular and biochemical analyses have led to the finding that CUL7 and CUL9, two cytoplasmically localized E3 ubiquitin ligases which can bind to p53, control mitosis and cytokinesis by sensing microtubule stress. Deletion of Cul9 in mice resulted in wide spread polyploidy, spontaneous tumor development, and rendered mice susceptible to carcinogenesis indicating that Cul9 is a tumor suppressor. Conversely, gain of function in CUL9 promoted a p53-dependent apoptosis. We further found that depletion of CUL7 or its binding partner OBSL1 caused severe microtubule damage, abnormal chromatid alignment, and defects in cytokinesis and widespread mitotic cell death, all of which can be rescued by simultaneous depletion of CUL9. These extensive preliminary results led us to propose that there exists in vertebrates an OBSL1-CUL7-CUL9-p53 pathway that senses microtubule stress during mitosis and is functionally separate from the well-established spindle-assembly checkpoint. We propose here a series of rigorous genetic and biochemical experiments to examine the role of this novel OBSL1-CUL7-CUL9-p53 pathway in maintaining genome integrity. In the first Aim, we will generate Cul7-Cul9 and Obsl1-Cul9 double knockout mice to genetically test the functional relationship of CUL7 and CUL9 and between OBSL1 and CUL9 in vivo. In the second Aim, we will genetically test the contribution of p53 to pathway by generating two separate knock-in mice, each with a point mutation in the p53 binding domain of CUL7 and CUL9. Finally, we will biochemically test how ubiquitylation contributes to the mechanism of the OBSL1-CUL7-CUL9-p53 pathway."

"9385807","Project Summary | Function and activity dynamics of lateral hypothalamic glutamatergic neurons in obesity The underlying physiological mechanisms contributing to the obese state are largely unknown. Appetitive and consummatory behaviors, which are thought to be dysregulated in obesity, are governed by descending signals from the brain, but how specific neural circuits regulate such behaviors is unclear. One brain area that is hypothesized to be a critical component in the circuitry that orchestrates feeding behavior is the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), a molecularly and functionally heterogeneous hypothalamic region that is interconnected with limbic and hindbrain structures. Recently developed circuit dissection tools have made it possible to study the function of molecularly defined neuron populations. One population of particular importance to feeding behavior is the putative glutamatergic, Vglut2-expressing neurons of the LHA (LHA-Vglut2), which are known to be involved in controlling food intake and reward seeking. Yet, how these neurons orchestrate feeding behavior and how they might contribute to obesity is unknown. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to use contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry that allows the LHA to control food intake. Here I propose to identify the natural activity dynamics and the function of LHA-Vglut2 neurons in regulating voluntary, consummatory behavior. The natural activity dynamics of LHA-Vglut2 neurons will be measured using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging during consummatory behaviors, and the sufficiency of these neurons to inhibit consumption will be tested using cell-type specific optogenetic stimulation (Aim 1). Furthermore, the activity dynamics of LHA-Vglut2 neurons will be monitored during the gradual transition to obesity induced by chronic consumption of calorie dense food. Following diet-induced obesity, LHA-Vglut2 neurons will be selectively activated with chemogenetic tools to suppress food consumption and mitigate obesity (Aim 2). Based on my preliminary data and published work by my sponsor and others, I hypothesize that LHA-Vglut2 activity represents a negative feeding signal, which serves to suppress food intake. When mice are fasted, basal dynamics are suppressed and consumption-evoked responses are reduced. I predict that activation of these neurons will rapidly abolish consummatory behavior. During high fat diet-induced obesity, the LHA- Vglut2 response will be downregulated. I hypothesize that this downregulation can be reversed by chemogenetic activation of LHA-Vglut2 neurons, thereby restoring normal behavior. Regardless of the results, these experiments will identify, for the first time, natural activity dynamics of LHA-Vglut2 neurons and how they are altered by obesity."
"9236697","e-Cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are a rapidly growing nicotine delivery product with millions of users in the United States and worldwide. All e-cigarettes have common features: a battery; a tank containing propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin, flavoring agents, and nicotine; a microprocessor; an activating button; and, in some, a variable voltage heating element. The heating element vaporizes the solution producing liquid aerosol droplets containing nicotine. The amount of nicotine inhaled is controlled by the user by varying the voltage. There is little doubt that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes because they lack tobacco and combustion. However, the safety of e-cigarettes per se requires evaluation, particularly in view of recent reports that they may generate unacceptable levels of the human carcinogen formaldehyde, and our preliminary data indicating that levels of urinary biomarkers of oxidative damage and inflammation ? the F2-isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2? and the prostaglandin E2 metabolite PGEM - are the same in e- cigarette users as in cigarette smokers. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that e-cigarette use leads to formaldehyde-DNA adducts and elevated exposure to other carbonyls, and to similar levels of oxidative damage and inflammation as in smokers, and will assess toxicant and carcinogen exposure in e-cigarette users, smokers, and non-smokers. Our specific aims are: 1. Quantify exogenous [13CD2]formaldehyde-DNA adducts and unlabeled endogenous  formaldehyde-DNA adducts in tissues of rats exposed to vapor generated from e-liquids  containing [1-13CD2]propylene glycol. 2. Using samples from a prior study in which smokers stopped smoking for 12 weeks, determine the  time course of decreases in formaldehyde-DNA adducts in leukocytes, and 8-iso-PGF-2? and  PGEM in urine.3. Recruit 134 e-cigarette tank system users, 134 smokers, and 134 non-users of any e-cigarette or  tobacco product and compare levels of formaldehyde, diacetyl, and other carbonyl compounds in  saliva (before and after puffing in the e-cigarette users and smokers), formaldehyde-DNA  adducts in oral cells and leukocytes, 8-iso-PGF-2? and PGEM in urine, the serum biomarker of  inflammation C-reactive protein, as well as a panel of urinary toxicant and carcinogen biomarkers,  sampled monthly for 6 months. Only e-cigarette users who have not smoked a tobacco  cigarette for the amount of time determined to be necessary for clearance of biomarkers to non-smoker levels in Specific Aim 2 will be enrolled, and this group will include e-cigarette users who operate their devices at predominantly high and low voltages (above and below 4V) as well as some individuals who will vary the voltage of their e-cigarette system.Collectively, the results of this study will critically test our hypothesis and provide important data on the potential risks of e-cigarette use with respect to the human carcinogen formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds, oxidative damage and inflammation, and exposure to a panel of toxicants and carcinogens."
"9403067","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application for a postdoctoral T32 training grant in laboratory-based transplantation biology. Solid organ transplantation is the ideal therapy for end stage failure due to kidney, heart, liver, and lung, disease, among other organs. Despite significant improvements in the care of all solid organ transplant recipients long term allograft survival remains suboptimal. Analogously, bone marrow transplantation is an effective therapy for hematologic malignancies, but acute (and chronic) graft versus host disease occurs commonly and causes significant morbidity. Moreover, while scientific progress has increased knowledge, the causes of graft loss (and GVHD) are only partially understood, reliable tolerance induction protocols remain elusive, and the ability to translate what information is available into useful diagnostic, preventive and treatment modalities in patients has been limited. To continue to improve transplant outcomes in humans and as a consequence, improve the long term health of all transplant recipients, research in transplantation must remain cutting edge, and the next generation of physicians/scientists must have the appropriate knowledge base and skills to continue to drive the field forward. Because transplantation is a cross disciplinary field involving multiple medical, surgical, and basic pathology/immunology themes, we believe an effective training environment must be cross-disciplinary. Thus, the objective of this training program is to use an interactive, collaborative, cross-disciplinary approach to train talented young physician-scientists (MD and MD PhD) or PhD-scientists for a successful career in laboratory based, investigative, transplantation immunobiology research. In support of the renewal application, the initial funding period of this training program has been successful in accomplishing the key aim of fostering the careers of trainees in transplantation, in particular, underrepresented minorities. Our rationales for submitting this competitive renewal grant application include: 1) the continued need for improving outcomes following solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, 2) our strong desire to continue to have an impact on the education of future investigators in the field of transplantation, and 3) our belief that the proposed group of trainers will offer diverse basic and translational scientific opportunities within the field of transplantation supported by an established infrastructure designed for training and nurturing young transplant researchers toward independence. We have a diverse and well funded faculty with an interest in transplantation and a strong pool of trainees that includes significant numbers of underrepresented minorities. The program is overseen by P Heeger, who is well recognized and accomplished clinical and basic physician scientist with significant postdoctoral training, and educational, experience. The program is designed to support laboratory based training by individual mentors performing research in transplantation medicine/biology. The cross disciplinary program is supplemented with significant didactic training in transplantation science, grant writing, manuscript preparation and career development so as to optimize the development of independent academic researchers in the transplant field."
"9187033","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intraocular pressure (IOP) and age were found to be the most consistent independent risk factors for development and progression of glaucoma in all of the major prospective clinical trials, even though IOP has not been shown to increase with age in most populations. Glaucoma is also much more prevalent in persons of African ancestry. Lowering IOP is the only clinical treatment that has been shown to retard the onset and progression of glaucoma, but once damaged, the optic nerve head (ONH) is thought to be more susceptible to further glaucomatous progression even after clinical intervention has lowered mean IOP to `normal' levels. We have previously interpreted these findings to mean that the ONH is increasingly vulnerable to glaucomatous injury with advancing age, African ancestry, and prior damage. There is a plausible alternative explanation, however. Our telemetric IOP data show that the eye is subjected to about 7,000 IOP spikes >5 mmHg per hour during waking hours. Also, IOP spikes >1 mmHg above baseline are responsible for up to 15% of the total IOP insult the eye must absorb during waking hours on average. This is an extraordinary finding, in that IOP spikes represent a previously unknown and potentially highly injurious component of the IOP total insult that has yet to be characterized or considered in previous animal or clinical studies.  We hypothesize that greater IOP and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) fluctuation independently contribute to the onset and progression of glaucoma in addition to mean IOP. We will test this organizing hypothesis by elucidating the age- and disease-related changes in IOP, OPP, and their fluctuations as they relate to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon loss and elevated IOP-induced ocular coat stiffening.  Support for the fluctuation hypothesis would lead to an entirely new understanding of the importance of IOP and OPP fluctuation in the increased age- and disease-related susceptibility to glaucoma and provide strong rationale for totally new clinical diagnosis and treatment modalities that employ IOP and OPP fluctuation reduction through modification of ocular coats stiffness or intraocular damping of IOP fluctuations. If our results do not support the fluctuation hypothesis, the knowledge we gain about the natural fluctuations of these variables will redefine the appropriate IOP measurement frequency in patients and inform patient care."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a Continuation (Renewal) of our RO1-44-PRJ68DN1 (4D DSA and 4D Fluoroscopy: Validation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Capabilities). The proposed research is focused on developing and testing new methods that add further utility to 4D DSA and 4D fluoroscopy. To accomplish these innovations we have defined 3 tasks: 1)test and implement ways in which the temporal information contained in a 4D DSA can be validated and utilized to quantify blood flow, 2)optimize and test methods that would allow a reduction in the x-ray exposure required for a 4D DSA acquisition and, 3)test, optimize and implement on a commercial angiographic system a 4D fluoroscopy application which will allow accurate, real time reconstruction of devices, embed them in a 3D volume and then create virtual fluoroscopic views at any desired viewing angle with no need for gantry movement. Complementing the virtual fluoroscopic views will be endoscopic views showing the intraluminal position of the device in question. To accomplish these tasks three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: further improvement, validation and optimization of the 4D DSA reconstruction algorithm to improve quantitation. Specific Aim 2: development, testing, testing and validation of the use of a very low dose mask for a 4D DSA acquisition. Specific Aim 3: further development of the 4D Fluoroscopy technique. As detailed in the Research Strategy section of the application each of these Specific Aims will include phantom, animal and human subject studies."
"9424454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because airway smooth muscle (ASM) plays a crucial role in driving the excessive airway obstruction and inflammation seen in severe asthma, failure of ASM to properly respond to drug therapy entails serious consequences for asthmatic patients. While much research aimed at understanding the basis of insensitivity to glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in severe asthmatics focused on the role of immune cells, little has been done to clarify the role of ASM cells. The long-term goal of this research is to define the molecular mechanisms mediating inflammation-associated GC insensitivity in clinically relevant non-immune lung cells, with the hope of identifying novel targets to restore steroid responsiveness in severe asthmatics. The current proposal aims to systematically investigate the mechanisms by which inflammatory cytokines control ASM sensitivity to GCs. The proposal relies on exciting preliminary data supporting the central hypothesis that abnormal phosphorylation of the GC receptor (GR) at specific residues provides a mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines impair ASM sensitivity to GCs. Our preliminary data further suggest that the phosphorylation state of the GR at specific residues is regulated by cytokine-mediated activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) concomitant with select serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs) present in ASM cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the interplay between GR signaling and inflammatory kinases and/or protein phosphatases may uncover critical information for the development of novel therapeutics to overcome GC insensitivity in severe asthma. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: to identify the relative contribution of GR phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms in the differential responsiveness of steroid-target genes to GCs in control and GC-insensitive cells and tissues (Aim 1), to clarify the role of MAPKs (Aim 2) and the contribution of PPs (Aim 3) in cytokine-induced abnormal site- specific phosphorylation of the GR. In the first aim, mutated constructs will be used to modulate site-specific phosphorylation of the GR, after which the transcriptional regulation of 10 different steroid-target genes will be analyzed. In the second and third aims, siRNA, mutated constructs, and expression vectors will be used to modulate the expression of MAPKs and PPs, after which site-specific GR phosphorylation, GR-mediated transactivation activities, GR sub-cellular localization, steroid co-factor recruitment to steroid-target gene promoters, and quantitative expression of steroid-target genes will be analyzed using state-of-the-art molecular and biochemistry approaches already established in our laboratories. We will also evaluate the clinical significance of our in vitro observations by examining whether the aforementioned pathways are activated in tissue biopsies from normal subjects and asthmatic patients and correlate the research findings with asthma severity. This integrated translational approach is expected to advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of steroid insensitivity in severe asthmatic patients."
"9241247","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquired and inherited skin blistering diseases are debilitating, life-altering illnesses. Many of these diseases are caused by a loss of desmosome function. Our ability to understand and design treatments for these diseases is hindered by our relatively poor understanding of basic desmosome biology. Very little is currently known about the regulation of desmosome assembly, or the means by which assembly becomes misregulated in various skin diseases. Data from our lab and others suggest desmosomes are assembled in microdomains of the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts. In order to understand the role that lipid rafts play in desmosome biology, we are examining the consequences of lipid raft association on the desmosomal cadherins known as desmogleins. We hypothesize that the desmoglein transmembrane domain targets this protein to lipid rafts, and that lipid raft association is necessary for incorporation into desmosomes and adhesive function. In our first aim, we will determine the role of lipid raft association in desmoglein function. In our second aim, we will determine how a mutation in the transmembrane domain of a desmoglein causes a human skin disease. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms involved in regulating desmosomes and to identify new targets for potential intervention in pathogenesis. Resolving the mechanisms governing desmosome assembly would constitute an important advance in our understanding of cell-cell adhesion. This advance will also pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for treating an array of human skin diseases stemming from desmosomal misregulation."
"9392629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to study pediatric myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which are blood cancers characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. MDS has a much higher incidence in adults, but there is an urgent need for a pediatric approach to diagnosis and treatment: the presentation and clinical course is much more heterogeneous and the disease etiology has not been well studied. Prognosis is poor as progression to advanced disease and leukemia can occur rapidly. Transplantation is the only cure, although treatment failure due to procedure-related mortality and disease recurrence can occur. Alternative therapies are available for adult patients ineligible for transplant, but little study has been don in children. Development of new effective therapies for pediatric MDS requires a better understanding of unique and common hematologic features, which could provide important insights into mechanisms that underlie disease and drive progression. We have obtained 129 pediatric and 100 adult patient samples, along with demographic and MDS pathology details, from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Further, we have obtained age-matched PBMC controls from 20 adult normal donors and are currently obtaining PBMC from 20 pediatric normal donors. We will: 1) evaluate cells using FACS analysis and established characterization panels including T cell, B cell, natural killer t (NKT) cell and natural killer (NK) cell populatios, monocyte subsets, circulating CD34+ cells, and immune-regulatory populations (e.g., T regulatory cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells); 2) examine lymphocyte and immune-regulatory function in subsets including proliferation, cytokine and chemokine production, degranulation and cytotoxicity. For immune-regulatory populations, measure ability to suppress function performing co-culture assays; and 3) Evaluate clinical correlations (e.g., age, disease status, karyotype, transplant outcome and cytomegalovirus sero-status) with pediatric MDS PBMC phenotypic and functional characteristics and compare to adult MDS patients. Our goal is to comprehensively evaluate and compare pediatric and adult MDS with regard to cell type, function, etc. This work is an important step toward better understanding pediatric MDS biology and developing new treatment strategies."

Despite impressive advances at the basic science level, major unanswered questions regarding the pathogenesis of these disorders continue to limit our capacity to treat them. Effective training fo scientists in diabetes and obesity are therefore fundamental priorities."
"9370061","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1907 the crowd at a county fair accurately estimated the weight of an ox. The median estimate of the crowd was more accurate than estimates from farmers and other experts. This startling observation demonstrates the wisdom of the crowds or communities in specific contexts. Crowdsourcing is the process of taking a task performed by an individual and outsourcing it to a large group in the form of a contest or open call. For example, Wikipedia solicits content and editing for its online encyclopedia. Applied to HIV testing and linkage campaigns, crowdsourcing offers an opportunity to better understand the needs and preferences of hidden key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM), including those who have high risk behaviors but do not utilize existing health services. Online contests can generate novel content, visual images, and distribution networks for HIV testing and linkage campaigns. Another HIV tool originating from the private sector, social marketing can also enhance HIV campaigns. Social marketing is the systematic application of commercial marketing concepts to the analysis, planning, execution, and evaluation of programs. Social marketing brings together professional marketing and public health expertise in order to more effectively package and deliver HIV testing and linkage services. The major distinction between crowdsourcing and social marketing approaches in designing HIV campaigns is that crowdsourcing is largely driven by community engagement and developed bottom-up whereas social marketing is driven by public health specialists and developed top-down. Our research will focus on young (18-29yo) Chinese MSM who are highly active participants in online forums, but whose power has not been tapped for promoting HIV testing and linkage to care. This subset of men has a high HIV incidence, yet remains largely untested and unengaged. We hypothesize that a crowdsourced campaign will have a higher impact on HIV testing and linkage to care because of greater campaign engagement. Our multi-disciplinary research team brings together crowdsourcing and social marketing experience, a long term history of working with and on behalf of MSM in China, and a rich local infrastructure for HIV research, to investigate the following aims: (1) Develop a crowdsourced intervention and a social marketing intervention to enhance HIV testing and linkage among young adult MSM; (2) Compare the effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention and a social marketing intervention on HIV testing and linkage using a multisite, quasi-experimental trial; and (3) Estimate the impact of crowdsourced and social marketing interventions among young MSM on HIV transmission in four cities using modeling. Implementing partners at Social Entrepreneurship for Sexual Health (SESH) Global, a non-governmental organization, have developed and piloted crowdsourcing methods to promote HIV testing in China. Long standing in-country research projects and infrastructure at UNC Project-China increase the likelihood of success. This research will contribute to enhanced HIV campaigns and ultimately lead to decreased HIV acquisition and transmission."
"9414240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The secretion of saliva is vitally important for oral health. The fluid provides hydration and lubrication to the oral cavity while the protein content contributes enzymes, which begin to digest food, and additional proteins which protect the oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal tract from bacterial and fungal infections. Given these important physiological functions, hypo-function of the salivary glands which is associated with the auto- immune disease, Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and as a result of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers results in a marked deterioration in quality of life; including difficulty swallowing and chewing food and a marked increase in dental carries and susceptibility to oral candidiasis. To develop therapy for dry-mouth it is fundamentally important to understand the processes that lead to saliva secretion physiologically and how these mechanisms are altered in pathological states. The overarching principle driving this proposal, is that a synergistic combination of experimental investigation and quantitative theoretical modelling can be used to further our understanding of both salivary gland physiology and pathology in a manner that neither single approach can accomplish. In the current proposal, a multi-scale model of fluid secretion will be developed from experimental data, which captures the essential spatial and temporal mechanistic features required for fluid flow at the molecular, cellular and glandular levels. The approach will use a process of iterative testing between model predictions and experimentally determined parameters and outcomes. The power of the approach is that the model can be used to quantitatively explain and interpret the experimentally derived data but also to suggest further experiments and subsequently to predict their outcomes. We will then adapt the model using data from SS patients and mouse models of disease to first, investigate the molecular mechanisms which underlies salivary hypo-function in SS and then use the model to predict and experimentally test, how salivary flow can be increased. Finally, we will adapt the model, again based faithfully on experimental data, to describe the reduction in salivary gland function that occurs following g-irradiation of salivary glands prior to loss of acinar tissue. It s envisioned that the model may ultimately suggest novel therapies to restore salivary gland function, which would not be readily evident from a traditional purely experimental methodologies."

"9424809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antecedents of high blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidemia likely originate in childhood. Furthermore, dietary habits developed during adolescence are carried into adulthood. In order to provide evidence in support of dietary guidelines in children and retard the epidemic of BP and dyslipidemia-related morbidity in later years, we propose a carefully controlled, randomized trial to test, among adolescents, two dietary interventions: (1) the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, similar to the USDA food patterns for adolescents recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and (2) sodium reduction. To this end, we combined the leadership experience of two research groups, Larry Appel and his team who conducted the DASH studies in adults and Connie Weaver and her team from Purdue who have led multiple controlled feeding studies in adolescents. The proposed study is a randomized, 2x2 factorial isocaloric feeding study with a cross-over design that tests the effects on BP and blood lipids of (1) diet (DASH vs Usual) and (2) sodium intake (High vs Low) in a diverse sample of adolescents. Study participants (n=522: ~50% Female; ~25% White, ~25% Black, ~25% Asian, and ~25% Hispanic) will be 11 to 15 years of age with systolic BP in the upper third of the BP distribution for their sex, age and height. Each participant will receive two of the four interventions, each for 25 days, in random order as part of a summer research camp. BP and lipids will be measured at the end of each feeding period. Results of this trial will provide direct evidence of the impact of the two interventions on both blood pressure and blood lipid levels among adolescents. This information will inform dietary guidance and influence future policy development on strategies to lower blood pressure and improve lipid patterns among adolescents. Most importantly, given that the antecedents to CVD risk factors begin in adolescence and track into adulthood, intervening in adolescence has tremendous potential as a means to prevent CVD in adults."
"9212208","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Developing gene therapies for specific neurological diseases, elucidating the etiology of these diseases, and genetic analyses of neuronal circuits, behaviors, and learning will all benefit from targeted gene transfer that can deliver different genes into presynaptic neurons and a selected subset of their postsynaptic neurons, based on both projection area and synapse type. Diseases that exhibit deficits in specific circuits include the major neurodegenerative diseases, and other major neurological disorders. Moreover, synaptic plasticity and neural network theories hypothesize that specific behaviors are encoded in specific circuits. Thus, targeted gene transfer across specific synapses will have broad applications to understanding and treating neurological diseases, and to basic neuroscience.  To target gene transfer to specific neuron types, we modified a protein on the surface of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) vector particles; we replaced a panspecific cell binding domain with a neuron type-specific binding domain. In the initial study, we added specific neurotrophic factors to the surface of HSV-1 particles, targeting gene transfer to neurons that contain the cognate receptors. Next, we developed a general method to target gene transfer to specific neuron types, antibody-mediated targeting. We added the Staphylococcus A protein antibody binding domain to a vector particle protein. Complexes of these vector particles and specific antibodies supported targeted gene transfer.  We developed targeted gene transfer to deliver different genes into presynaptic neurons and a selected subset of their postsynaptic neurons, based on both projection area and synapse type. The initial study targeted gene transfer across glutamatergic synapses. The first gene transfer, into the presynaptic neurons, uses standard procedures. The vector expresses an artificial peptide neurotransmitter that contains a dense core vesicle sorting domain, a neurotransmitter receptor binding domain (for NMDA NR1 subunits), and the His tag. Upon release, this peptide neurotransmitter binds to the cognate receptors on the postsynaptic neurons. Antibody-mediated targeting to these postsynaptic neurons uses a His tag antibody, as the peptide neurotransmitter contains the His tag. This targeting supported an ~10-fold increase in specificity.  The long-term goal of this project is to develop targeted gene transfer across specific synapse types, for elucidating disease etiologies, developing gene therapies, and basic neuroscience. The proposed experiments will optimize targeted gene transfer across synapses, develop targeting across specific synapse types critical in neurology and neuroscience, and apply these advances to a problem in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, thereby developing a novel gene therapy.  Of note, these targeting strategies and reagents can be used in any gene transfer system."
"9391905","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is an F32 postdoctoral fellowship designed to enhance the candidate's training in the application of stable isotope tracer techniques to measure metabolic flux. Hepatic insulin resistance results in inappropriately elevated gluconeogenesis in the liver and activation of certain pathways of the hepatic TCA cycle. These effects contribute to diabetes by increasing blood glucose and also perhaps interact with liver disease by impinging on oxidative metabolism. The TCA cycle is a central pathway of both gluconeogenesis and hepatic energy metabolism. It is located in mitochondria and provides energy through its oxidative function and intermediates required for gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid production through its anaplerotic function. Impaired mitochondrial function has been linked to hepatic insulin resistance. Recent results from our laboratory have shown that hepatic insulin resistance stimulates both anaplerosis and oxidative metabolism in the TCA cycle. Whether increased TCA cycle flux is a cause or an effect of increased gluconeogenesis remains unknown. To address this question, we will specifically disrupt the oxidative function and anaplerotic function of the TCA cycle using conditional mouse genetics. The role of these two pathways will be examined using a combination of stable isotope tracer-based nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry techniques to measure metabolic flux. The necessity of these pathways for hepatic insulin resistance will be tested in normal and high fat diets. We hypothesize that disrupting the anaplerotic or oxidative function of the TCA cycle will reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and therefore reduce the severity of hepatic insulin resistance. These studies will serve as a scaffold for the candidate to train in the application of metabolic flux approaches."
"9391939","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Abstract Health literacy, broadly defined as the wide range of skills and competencies that people use to manage their health (Zarcadoolas, et al. 2005, 196-197), is an important aspect of chronic disease self- management (Mancuso and Rincon 2006), though it has been inconsistently associated with medication adherence in multiple studies. While researchers continue to investigate the relationships among health literacy, medication adherence and health outcomes, few have successfully integrated individual-level factors such as health literacy with structural and social factors. In the proposed research, we rely on ethnographic and qualitative data, in combination with quantitative methods, to explore how medication adherence, a widespread problem in chronic disease management, is shaped by structural factors such as insurance copays, as well as by cultural health beliefs. Building on our previous research (Shaw, et al. 2012a, Shaw, et al. 2009b), the proposed study examines health literacy, health beliefs and barriers to medication adherence among patients from five ethnic groups (African-American, Hispanic, white, Vietnamese and Russian immigrant). We base this study in Massachusetts, which has recently expanded the number of people insured under publicly-funded programs while implementing cost-control measures that may limit access to prescription medications, especially for the poor. Drawing on self-report surveys, pill counts, chart review, in-depth interviews and other qualitative methods, this study will meet the following specific aims: 1. Using two different quantitative methods, to assess medication adherence among patients from 5  ethnic groups: (African-American, Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese and Russian immigrants) with  chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia); 2. Use qualitative and ethnographic methods to explore the chronic disease health beliefs that may combine with health literacy to shape medication adherence; 3. To identify factors associated with medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, including:  a. beliefs about medicines; b. food insecurity; c. socioeconomic factors (e.g., type of health insurance coverage; formulary changes); and d. social support. 4. To develop recommendations for primary care providers and policymakers to improve medication adherence and mitigate formulary changes among low-income patients with chronic illness. The unique constellation of conditions in Massachusetts-of near-universal insurance coverage coupled with stringent cost control measures as the state struggles to balance its budget-offers an unmatched research opportunity and serves as a critical bellwether for coming changes facing other states with the advent of the Affordable Care Act. The diverse population of patients served by Caring Health Center, the proposed research site, provides a natural laboratory in which to explore the effects of these policy changes as they intersect with culturally variable health beliefs to shape medication adherence among urban, minority and low-income patients. Improved understanding of these complex dynamics will better prepare primary health care providers to improve adherence and help reduce stroke risk among patients with hypertension and other chronic conditions."
"9411949","Abstract G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the actions of a wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters to control functions in all mammalian cells. As such, GPCRs are major targets of therapeutics. Individual GPCRs directly couple to distinct complements of heterotrimeric G protein ? and ?? subunits that drive downstream signaling pathways to shape the cellular responses that determine GPCR efficacy. Both G? and G?? subunits interact directly with effectors to produce cellular responses. Our laboratory has focused largely on G?? subunit signaling and has identified a series of small molecules that bind to G?? to ?bias? signaling pathways downstream of GPCRs. These inhibitors have been applied extensively to dissect G?? functions in biology, and to validate G?? as a viable therapeutic target. Most recently we have identified a small molecule that activates G?? subunit signaling without activating G protein ? subunits. We have applied this tool to study signaling in immune cells to reveal exciting and previously unappreciated roles for G?i in chemokine- chemoattractant receptor signaling. In this proposal we will examine in detail how G?? activating molecules function at a molecular level, and explore the mechanistic role for G?i in chemoattractant receptor signaling in the following specific aims. Aim 1. Determination of the mechanisms of action of 12155 and M119/gallein on G protein subunit interactions and GPCR coupling. Aim 2. Determining the mechanism(s) for G?iGTP- dependent regulation of cell migration and adhesion. Aim 3. Analysis of spatiotemporal regulation of G?i activation in chemoattractant-dependent directional cell migration. We believe that these studies will reveal a new molecular target and cellular function for G?i in regulation of integrin function that will have wide implications for chemoattractant/chemokine receptor and integrin regulation."

Furthermore, death rates from all causes are ~1.5 times greater for individuals with versus without diagnosed diabetes and the economic cost of diabetes in the US was $245 billion in 2012. Thus, diabetes and associated metabolic diseases represent major public health and economic burdens. Short nightly sleep duration and untreated sleep disorders are now recognized as risk factors for metabolic diseases with more than 50% of Americans sleeping less than the recommended 7 hours/night, and sleep and wakefulness disorders impacting 50 to 70 million Americans. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which sleep loss contributes to metabolic disease are largely unknown, impeding the development of novel and effective countermeasures that target the negative metabolic consequences of sleep loss. Furthermore, it is unknown if the common and self-selected countermeasure of weekend recovery sleep attenuates the negative metabolic consequences of sleep loss. As such, I propose to identify the influence of insufficient sleep on mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and determine the impact of ?weekend recovery? sleep on these mechanisms. The proposed project will utilize metabolomics to analyze plasma samples from an ongoing in-laboratory study investigating insulin sensitivity and energy balance during insufficient sleep followed by weekend recovery sleep. Guided by my preliminary research efforts, I will use targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways impacted by insufficient sleep and weekend recovery sleep. Additionally, the untargeted discovery approach may identify potential ?biomarkers? that change with sleep loss and ?weekend recovery? sleep. My proposed findings will help inform future validation and sleep countermeasure investigations including testing at risk populations (i.e. obesity, pre-diabetes, shift-workers). This proposed F32-award is responsive to a key goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan to ?enable sleep and circadian research training to inform science in cross-cutting domains, accelerate the pace of discovery, and the translation of enhanced therapies from bench to bedside to community?, and is designed to advance my training in sleep and circadian physiology and metabolomics to strengthen my potential for a successful NIH Career Development K-award."
"9404275","PROJECT SUMMARY Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are an invaluable tool for human disease modeling and the field of regenerative medicine. Human ESCs behave like stem cells in culture, having the capacity to divide in culture (self-renew) and the ability to produce different cell types (differentiation). However, there is still much to learn about the mechanisms and genetic regulators that control hESC growth and differentiation. An understanding of these biological processes will significantly impact their application in drug discovery for the treatment of human diseases. Many biological processes in mammalian cells are regulated through modification of target proteins by a small, highly conserved protein called ubiquitin. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins leads to their degradation, a mechanism used for regulating cell function. This process, known as ubiquitination, is also essential for controlling cell differentiation. Our laboratory recently identified a novel key regulator that is required for the generation of neural crest cells when hESC are induced to differentiate in vitro. This process requires the ubiquitination of critical cellular components. Since neural crest cells are a transient and migratory cell population essential for craniofacial development, this finding helped identify a key step in the determination of neural crest cell fate. The goal of this work is to further understand the role and the mechanisms by which the ubiquitin system influences neural crest cell specification in hESCs. To do this, I will use an unbiased approach to abrogate or activate ubiquitination enzymes in cells and determine how such perturbations affect neural crest cell differentiation. We hope that dissection of these complex biochemical pathways will provide a means to manipulate neural crest cells in the laboratory, a critical step in using this culture system as a disease model. More importantly, this study will help identify ubiquitination components that are essential for maintaining the neural crest state. By manipulating the activity of key proteins via ubiquitination, it may be possible to understand the mechanisms and/or pathways that dictate neural crest cell growth and differentiation. With this information, synthetic compounds that target ubiquitin enzymes and/or their substrates may selectively prevent neural crest cell growth and serve as therapeutic agents to treat neural crest-derived tumors."
"9371995","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is a global epidemic with costly comorbidities. In the US, the rate of obesity has tripled over the past 40 years. Diet, physical activity, and genetics do not explain all of the variability in weight, and moreover can be difficut to modify. Identifying environmental triggers and feasible public health interventions is therefore a policy imperative. Prior data from this team has suggested an association of prenatal exposure to air pollution with maternal hyperglycemia and reduced fetal growth. Paradoxically we have also demonstrated an association between greater prenatal traffic-related pollution and excess infant weight gain after birth, leading to higher risk for obesity in infancy. With the guidance of my mentoring team, during this 5 year K23 career development award, the Candidate will leverage data from two prospective longitudinal cohorts of mothers and children (Project Viva, n=2,128 and the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS), n=1,500) to extend this prior work through three inter-related projects. The Principal Investigator will: (1) examine prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution as a risk factor for rapid weight trajectories throughout childhood and central fat accrual in mid-childhood. (2) consider the relationship of prenatal air pollution exposure with obesity-associated hormonal biomarkers, including leptin, adiponectin, and insulin resistance in childhood. (3) characterize exposures and habits related to indoor sources of air pollution in rural New England and estimate the extent to which indoor wood burning during pregnancy is associated with maternal hyperglycemia, fetal growth, and offspring weight gain in early childhood. The training plan proposed will build upon my clinical training in pediatric endocrinology and basic knowledge of biostatistics and epidemiology to provide formal training in (1) environmental exposure assessment, (2) statistical techniques necessary to analyze complex exposure-response relationships, and (3) the practical skills necessary to lead a research team. The Candidate will leverage the wealth of resources available at Boston Children's Hospital, the Department of Population Medicine (Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care), the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Dartmouth Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center to conduct the proposed analyses. These studies and training will lay the necessary scientific framework to launch her career as an independent physician researcher studying the impact of environmental toxicants on children's health, with a focus on obesity and insulin resistance."
"9402969","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque is a key promoter of acute vascular syndromes (i.e., thrombosis). Panoply of cytokines, growth factors, and immune cellular infiltrates converges to dramatically enhance the local thrombogenic potential of unstable plaques by creating a hypercoagulant, tissue factor-rich milieu that is exposed by either plaque rupture or erosion, which results in vessel occlusion and hypoxic tissue death. The overarching theme of our continuing multidisciplinary translational effort is the development and clinical testing of nanoparticle based approaches for the diagnosis and therapy of thrombotic cardiovascular diseases to detect, treat, and monitor unstable atheroma. The initial phase of the program was devoted to novel molecular imaging strategies that have culminated in FDA approved clinical trials of integrin-targeted nanoparticles for plaque angiogenesis detection. In the next phase of the work, we seek to develop and quantify the efficacy of new nanotherapeutic agents to attenuate plaque inflammation with the clinical goal of reducing the propensity toward thrombosis in acute vascular syndromes. We will evaluate the following overarching hypothesis: anti- inflammatory therapeutic nanoparticles can modulate the hyperthrombotic state in acute vascular syndromes and restore stability in atherosclerotic lesions with benefits over and above conventional therapy. The specific aims are to:  I. Design, formulate, and evaluate targeted anti-inflammatory nanotherapies in vitro II. Test therapeutic formulations in vivo in a standardized ApoE -/-mouse thrombosis model III. Test nanoparticle combinations and multiplexed nanoparticles in vivo for synergistic efficacy"
"9395211","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human kidney performs vital functions for the body including filtration of the blood and the concentration of urine. Damage to the functional units of the kidney, referred to as nephrons, are ultimately irreversible and are caused by a variety of kidney diseases. This fact coupled with the estimation that kidney disease affects one in 10 people and is projected to increase highlights the necessity for curative treatments. Currently the only cure for renal disease is transplantation of donor-recipient matched kidney, however the demand for matched donors has and will continue to chronically outstrip supply. Thus there is an urgent need for the generation of patient-matched transplantable kidneys. Advancements in developmental and stem cell biology enable the scientific community to test approaches that will instruct pluripotent stem cells to kidney formation, however there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how to instruct the full complement of specific kidney cell fates in an organized three-dimensional structure. Thus a top priority of the field is to investigate novel biological mechanisms required for kidney formation, recapitulate these processes in vitro, and test the sufficiency of these processes to enhance state-of-the-art kidney organoid engineering methods. The initial goal of this application is to create a highly detailed map of human kidney development by identifying the transcriptional signatures of nephron progenitor populations in human fetal kidneys. These approaches will be optimized in and compared to mouse datasets to enable meaningful comparisons between species. These data will inform hypothesis-driven experimentation into elucidating required genetic regulatory elements necessary for in vitro nephrogenesis. In parallel, this project will test biophysical parameters for sufficiency to continuously expand in vitro nephrogenesis that will enable organ engineering approaches."
"9308631","TITLE: Probing the mechanistic basis for T cell fate decisions. CD4+ T cells use highly sensitive and specific modular biosensors to survey the body for microbial pathogens or tumors. The TCR is the chief mediator of this behavior. It surveys the contents of MHC on antigen presenting cells for peptides (pMHC) derived from microbial pathogens or tumors, and relays pMHC-specific information across the cell membrane to the ten immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the associated CD3?? , CD3??, and CD3?? signaling modules. CD4 recruits Lck to the TCR-CD3 complex upon concurrent binding of MHC. The quantity and quality of ITAM phosphorylation by Lck provides the base set of instructions that inform CD4+ T cell fate decision. Yet, how the individual subunits of the TCR-CD3-pMHC-CD4 macro-complex fit and work together to drive CD4+ T cell fate decisions remains to be fully defined. Our working hypothesis is that these molecules operate on a similar mechanistic principle to less complex receptor systems, such as cytokine receptors, whereby receptor-associated intracellular signaling enzymes and their substrates are held in a spatial relationship that represents ?off?; pMHC-engagement and reciprocal extracellular interactions between the TCR-CD3 complex and CD4 then positions the intracellular signaling domains in the appropriate spatial relationship for a sufficient duration to initiate and potentiate signaling. Our overarching goal is understand the inner workings of this complex molecular machinery so that we can modify or imitate its form and function to design novel modular biosensors with unique therapeutic functions. During the previous funding period we built multiple experimental platforms to study the spatial relationship between the juxtamembrane (JM) regions of the TCR-CD3 subunits. These allowed us to report the identification of a mechanical switch that relays pMHC-specific information from the TCR-pMHC interface across the T cell membrane to the cytosolic juxtamembrane regions of the CD3?? signaling module. In addition, we performed the first experimental analysis of the architecture of the TCR-CD3-pMHC-CD4 macrocomplex and found that the CD4 JM region is proximal to the CD3 heterodimers, while CD3?? resides on the opposite side of the TCR. We also identified highly conserved residues in the TMD and extracellular domains of CD4 that are important for CD4's Lck-independent and Lck-dependent functions. Finally, we obtained functional evidence for TCR- intrinsic specificity for MHC that we interpret as evidence for MHC scanning. The goals for this renewal application are to deconstruct the molecular mechanisms by which the TCR-CD3-pMHC-CD4 macrocomplex operates and characterize the consequences of these mechanisms in vivo. Our work will yield fundamental insights into the key determinants of CD4+ T cell fate decisions and provide a blueprint for the development of novel modular biosensors with translational potential."
"9433338","Project Summary HIV/AIDS is the world's leading infectious killer. Despite substantial research, the worldwide burden of HIV remains high. In 2013, over 2 million persons were newly infected and more than 35 million people were living with HIV. New global HIV prevention efforts that are readily available and affordable are needed. A growing literature suggests that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may increase risk of HIV. The seven longitudinal studies conducted among women and men consistently demonstrate increased risk of HIV with prior anogenital HPV infection. However, unlike other STIs, HPV can be effectively prevented with vaccination. Few low-middle income countries (LMIC), where the HIV burden is highest, are vaccinating girls, and none include males in national programs. Only three countries currently recommend gender neutral HPV vaccination. We need more studies evaluating the association between HPV and HIV and whether HPV infection at multiple anatomic sites (genitals, anal canal, and oral cavity) and associated anogenital lesions increase HIV risk. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to assess whether HPV infection is associated with HIV seroconversion among men in The HPV infection in Men (HIM) Study, a multinational, prospective male HPV natural history study. We aim to (1) Complete HPV genotyping of genital, anal, oral specimens among 1473 men who contributed study visits beyond year 4 of follow-up (up to 7 years of follow-up); (2) Evaluate the association between HPV infection at three anatomic sites and risk of HIV; and (3) Examine whether the association between HPV infection and HIV seroconversion is modified by infection with other STIs. The proposed research is innovative; as it is the first to assess HIV risk following HPV infection at three anatomic sites. The research aims are feasible given the existing HPV and HIV data. Results from this study may help inform future HIV prevention research and policies."
"9317271","ABSTRACT Schistosomiasis, caused by a parasitic flatworm, is a disease of poverty infecting over 200 million people with 800 million at risk. Treatment and control of this disease relies on just one drug, praziquantel (PZQ) ? a precarious situation should drug resistance emerge. Also, the therapeutic profile of PZQ is not ideal. Accordingly, the World Health Organization has declared schistosomiasis a disease for which new therapies are urgently needed.  Currently, drug discovery for helminths like schistosomes relies on phenotypic (whole-organism) screens of cultured parasites. However, these screens in isolation are not fully comprehensive and do not indicate why and how worms die, i.e., either the molecular targets engaged during response to a drug, or the mechanisms of drug action (MoA) - information that is important for advancing new drugs to the clinic.  The availability of high quality genomic resources for the schistosome parasite is opening up new opportunities for drug and drug target research and development. Leveraging, therefore, the well-annotated gene models of the reference Schistosoma mansoni genome, our first Aim is to employ gene expression profiling (GEP) via RNA-sequencing (RNA- Seq) to understand how the parasite responds to drug insult at the whole transcriptome (mRNA) level. Because of ongoing drug discovery efforts by the PI, we have a number of high-value chemistries supplied by pharmaceutical industry to test. These include chemically very similar compounds that induce different phenotypic responses in the parasite suggesting that different targets and/or MoAs are engaged. RNA-Seq and advanced bioinformatics support will help resolve the shared and compound-specific gene expression changes associated with dying worms at a system-wide level.  For our second Aim, we will use the signature expression patterns observed in the RNA-Seq data, to identify schistosome biomarker genes that, when incorporated into a molecular (qPCR) screen, will predict drug lethality, provide insight on MoA for the chosen drug sets and aid drug development activities to maintain focus on the desired chemical structures.  Our Aims are supported by a substantial drug development program for schistosomiasis by the PI that includes access to privileged small molecule chemistries and a unique high-content phenotypic screen platform to measure the drug- induced responses of the parasite. The goals of the project, expertise of the PI in drug discovery and skills of the co- Investigator in genomics and next-generation sequencing provide a unifying systems biology perspective into how this parasite responds to drug insult. The strategies and tools developed will provide a template for exploration of drug- induced gene perturbations in other medically important parasites."
"9376558","Project Summary The interplay between cellular adhesion and cellular signaling is essential for the development of all organs such as the brain, and for the functioning of systems such as the immune and nervous systems. Adhesion G- Protein Coupled Receptors (aGPCRs) are an understudied GPCR family that is thought to mediate intercellular communication. They have emerging roles in multiple cellular functions and numerous human diseases including neurological disorders and cancers. Unlike other GPCRs, aGPCRs have large extracellular regions (ECR) that are autoproteolytically cleaved from their seven-pass transmembrane regions (TM) within a conserved GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain. The two fragments stay associated even after cleavage. It is believed that ligand binding to the ECR causes shedding of the ECR, and exposure of a short peptide that was previously hidden within the GAIN domain. This short peptide, called stachel, acts as a tethered agonist and activates the transmembrane domain. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying aGPCR activation remains poorly understood. The ultimate goal of the research proposed in this application is to understand the stepwise mechanical details of aGPCR activation that start with adhesion of the ligand to the ECR, continue with transduction of the adhesion signal from the ECR to the TM domain via the GAIN domain, and end with the activation of the TM domain by the stachel peptide. We propose three Specific Aims that are based on the major unknowns in these fundamentals steps for aGPCR activation: First, we aim to reveal if and how extracellular adhesion starts signaling. Second, we aim to understand the role of the GAIN domain in transducing the adhesion signal to the TM domain. Third, we aim to reveal the molecular details of aGPCR TM domain activation by the stachel peptide. This research has a multi-disciplinary approach where the structural and functional data performed in the PI's lab are complemented with electron microscopy, agonist/antagonist generation via protein engineering, neuronal assays and G-protein expertise provided or performed by the laboratories of close collaborators. The proposed experiments will build on exciting results obtained since we started our lab, including the establishment of a robust in vitro signaling assay, the crystal structure of a ligand- aGPCR complex, the engineering of a synthetic protein that inhibits an aGPCR function, and key advances in the purification protocols of aGPCRs. We expect that this research will provide critical insights into the mechanistic details of the aGPCR activation, helping to establish fundamental principles on intercellular communication that are vital for numerous cellular functions."
"9393083","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity/overweight is rampant in the U.S. and has been acknowledged as the second leading cause of death. Obesity has been linked to diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Efforts to understand and manage this complex disease have met with modest success such that obesity continues to grow in prevalence at an alarming rate in both adults and children. It is likely that research which transcends traditional boundaries of research and focuses on cross-disciplinary approaches to research questions may provide the answers needed to conquer this grave threat to the health. This application is a request for renewal funding for the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (Louisiana State University System) training program Obesity: From Genes to Man. This program was funded originally in 2003, and renewed successfully in 2007. One of the aims of this grant is to train postdoctoral fellows in the complex interactions between genetic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral aspects of obesity. The objective of this program is to train Ph.D. and M.D. postdoctoral fellows to become productive research scientists capable of establishing scientific careers in academia, academic medicine, governmental agencies, and in the private sector. These junior scientists will further the efforts of the NIH to understand the complex interactions between genetic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral aspects of obesity. Many molecular biologists/geneticists are interested in obesity-related research, but lack the physiological/metabolic/behavioral expertise to maximize their research discoveries. Conversely, physiological /metabolic/behavioral studies need molecular and genetic approaches for a fuller understanding. We aim to bridge the divide between the molecular/genetic approaches and the physiological/behavioral studies of the functions of specific genes by providing training in these areas. Each postdoctoral fellow will be encouraged to develop these transdisciplinary research efforts to understand multiple aspects of obesity and obesity-related disease. The program will take advantage of the cutting-edge technologies and the wide range of research efforts related to obesity available at Pennington Biomedical. This broad-based, training program will enable trainees to acquire transdisciplinary research skills and write competitive grant proposals addressing important questions which will move our science forward. The faculty of Pennington Biomedical are committed to postdoctoral research training and see this as inseparable from their goal of excellence in research. This application is requesting five additional years of funding for six (6) trainee positions per year. We will recruit M.D.s and Ph.D.s from the basic, clinical, and population science disciplines including biology, physiology, kinesiology, neuroscience, public health, and psychology. The majority of trainees will enter into the program with no prior postdoctoral training. However, for the first year of funding, we have requested three slots for individuals with prior training in order to accommodate those fellows currently in the program who remain eligible to continue. Trainees will be supported for two to three years."
"9412563","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cephalotaxus alkaloids have been extensively studied as synthetic targets, due to the antileukemic activity of certain ester derivatives and the  synthetically challenging core structure. Homoharringtonine, also known as omacetaxin mepesuccinate, has recently been approved as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. However, despite these studies, only minimal modifications of the active natural product have been studied for activity, and synthetic variation has only been performed on the ester side chain.       This proposal describes a detailed strategy for the synthesis of the core cephalotaxine scaffold in 7-9 steps, a sizable reduction over known syntheses. Through the modification of one step in the synthesis, the route can be made enantioselective to synthesize the natural product. The use of flow chemistry allows for the rapid synthesis of the core scaffold, and enables the safe use of reactive and toxic reagents. In-line preparation of reactive intermediates allows for the rapid introduction of complexity that would be infeasible on large scale. The strategy is designed to enable a modular approach to the synthesis of structural analogs for the purposes of structure-activity relationship studies and the development of improved therapeutics."
"9386275","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the speed of delivery of drugs of abuse to the brain are thought to underlie their addictive potential, no research has focused on individual differences in speed of psychostimulant-induced high and liking and whether such differences are reflected at the level of the brain, personality, or genetics. Yet, preliminary data from our research group indicates there are dramatic differences in the temporal profile of subjective responses to oral d-amphetamine. The research proposed in this fellowship will use Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to assess multiple aspects of dopamine system function (striatal and extrastriatal D2-like binding potential, dopamine transporter levels, and d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release) and relate these PET measures to differences in positive subjective responses (drug high and liking) to d-amphetamine, with a particular emphasis on the timing of peak positive subjective drug effects. Furthermore, the proposed research will assess how individual differences in dopamine system function and the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine vary with personality traits and genetic polymorphisms in healthy adults. Specifically, we will investigate the role of commonly studied polymorphisms in dopamine-related genes as well as a signal nucleotide polymorphism in the cadherin 13 gene previously found to be associated with the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine in a genome wide association study. The goal of this research plan is to better understand individual differences that confer potential risk for psychostimulant addiction including a fast rise in dopamine and increased subjective high/liking after drug intake. The applicant's long-term goals are to identify  how differences in dopamine system function relate to addiction risk at the level of behavioral endophenotypes including subjective drug high/liking time to peak, novelty seeking, and impulsivity (including steep temporal discounting). This fellowship will help the applicant develop  expertise in measuring variation in the dopamine system (through PET and genetic approaches) and prepare him for a productive career as an independent investigator of dopamine's role in addiction risk, externalizing behaviors, and other traits often associated with drug addiction."

The mission of this program is to develop the next generation of biomedical researchers in Endocrinology and Metabolism. The trainees will be either board- eligible or certified physicians who have trained in Internal Medicine or Pediatrics, or non- physician science graduates who wish to pursue careers in endocrine/metabolic research. The Endocrinology T32 has a long history of training successful investigators in diabetes, metabolic bone disease, and other areas of endocrine/metabolic research. A substantial majority (83% over the past 10 years who are not still in training) are in academic positions at major medical centers across the US and abroad. Most are in positions with substantial research components, supported by federal, foundation, or industry grants, and the remainder have significant teaching responsibilities. They have almost 300 publications since they began their Endocrinology research training. The program includes training opportunities in clinical, translational, and basic research. Seven different research training modules have been designed to allow the trainee exposure to some of the most important areas of endocrine/metabolic research today, and afford the opportunity for training with outstanding scientists and mentors. These modules range from those solely devoted to basic science (Nuclear Receptor Signaling and Pharmacology; G Protein-Coupled Receptors) to those with basic and clinical/translational arms (Diabetes, Obesity and Nutrient Metabolism; Metabolic Components of Cardiovascular Disease; Bone and Mineral Metabolism; Pediatric Endocrinology; Women's Health). Trainees are jointly mentored by basic and clinical research scientists to promote broader understanding of research concepts, and also attend didactic teaching programs designed to provide the tools necessary for success in a research career. Training is aimed at promoting the understanding, design and use of biochemical, physiological and molecular biological approaches to endocrine and metabolic problems, as well as proficiency in laboratory and clinical investigation techniques. Individuals who complete the program will be capable of independent investigation and able to translate research accomplishments into significant advances with clinical relevance."
"9208645","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress plays a critical role in emotional memory formation. The emotional content of an experience often dictates which elements of the experience are remembered, and an important site in the brain for the formation of these emotional memories is the amygdala, particularly the basal lateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). The formation of emotional memories is caused by changes in the neural signaling in the BLA, and fear memory formation is characterized by the potentiation of excitatory synaptic circuits impacting the principal output neurons of the BLA. One means by which excitatory synaptic circuits in the BLA can be potentiated is by depressing inhibitory synaptic circuits, which leads to an increase in the excitability of the BLA neurons and a lower threshold for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of BLA excitatory circuits. Thus, the long-term depression of synaptic inhibition (LTDi) in the BLA promotes the LTP of excitatory circuits, which should increase anxiogenic output from the BLA to downstream target structures, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine stress axis. Stress and the stress-induced increase in circulating glucocorticoids facilitate the anxiogenic output from the BLA, and this is mediated by intra-BLA endocannabinoid- and norepinephrine- dependent mechanisms. We have compelling preliminary evidence from patch-clamp recordings in brain slices for the induction by acute restraint stress of a form of LTDi that is mediated by rapid glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid depression of inhibitory transmission in the BLA. This represents, therefore, a form of stress and glucocorticoid-induced LTDi in the BLA. In this proposed project, we will distinguish the glucocorticoid and endocannabinoid mechanisms responsible for this stress-induced LTDi using pharmacological and genetic approaches, and we will determine whether stress-induced LTDi elicits anxiogenic behavior and facilitates fear memory formation by promoting LTP at excitatory synaptic circuits in the BLA. We will determine the noradrenergic mechanisms involved in the stress and glucocorticoid facilitation of anxiogenesis and fear memory formation. These studies will culminate in a fundamental understanding at the cellular level of how stress facilitates anxiogenesis and fear memory formation by inducing synaptic plasticity of inhibitory circuits in the BLA, and will provide possible cellular and molecular targts for future therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of anxiety disorders. A potentially invaluable finding that may emerge from these studies is the identification of cannabinoid and/or noradrenergic pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of fear memory formation following exposure to trauma, when therapeutic intervention is feasible."
"9404865","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The core function of signal transduction networks, the reliable transmission of information from cellular receptors to downstream effectors, can be adversely affected by biological noise. We propose addressing reliable signal transduction through the decomposition of noise into sources that are either intrinsic (reaction noise) or extrinsic (cell to cell variability) noise to the time scale of the signaling process. By dissectin noise mitigation mechanisms in signaling networks through a lens of `types of noise', we anticipate to gain deeper understanding into how mammalian signaling networks function under a regime of substantial noise. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that certain cellula mechanisms are more suitable in mitigating intrinsic noise while others serve to overcome extrinsic noise. This hypothesis will be tested through a systematic investigation of three noise mitigation mechanisms: network motifs, dynamic signals, and collective responses to determine their specific suitability to mitigate intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources. We propose the following aims: 1) To identify network-level feedbacks that prevent signal degradation due to intrinsic noise in a Mast cell model. We recently discovered a new pathway downstream of the FceRI receptor. Our preliminary data indicates that three previously unstudied network motifs that are important to the transmission of an oscillatory signal through the pathway. Using the oscillatory nature of this pathway, we will determine the ability of the three network motifs to specifically mitigate intrinsic noise. 2) We have developed a new statistical method to analyze the information transmission capacity of dynamic signals. Using this method we showed that the ability of the Erk signaling network to transmit dynamic signals substantially increases its information transmission capacity. We propose to determine the cause for increased information transmission capacity through dynamic signaling networks by analyzing the effect of different noise sources have on information transmission capacity. 3) To demonstrate the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic noise on the dose response curve of a noisy population. Due to nonlinearities in signaling networks the average response of a population of noisy cells could differ from the idealized noiseless single cell response. We will combine computational modeling, single cell dynamic measurement of Ca2+ and Erk response to ATP and EGF, respectively, to determine the effect noise has on the population level dose response curve. The proposed research will deliver key insights into the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources on signal transduction and how cells minimize the adverse effects of noise. Understanding how cells can function in regime with high noise will have important biomedical implications. Pharmacological manipulation of signaling networks is a common therapeutic strategy. Single cells studies show that biological noise causes high variability in cellular response that can be detrimental to the efficacy of the treatment. Insights into noise mitigation mechanisms will likely lead to new strategies that can increase the efficacy of many existing therapies that suffer from cellular response variability."
"9204737","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emerging challenge for tuberculosis (TB) control is the steadily rising number of individuals with type 2 diabetes (DM2), particularly in developing countries where TB is endemic. DM2 increases the risk of TB by three fold and there are now more people affected by TB-DM co-morbidity than TB-HIV infection. A better understanding of the link between TB and DM2 is essential to identify individuals at increased risk for TB progression. In DM2 patients, the interplay of hormones under neuroendocrine regulation, adipokines and insulin, and chronic low grade inflammation are likely to contribute to compromised immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We propose studies in house hold contacts of TB cases (HHCs) in two populations with different background ethnicities: Coloureds in South Africa and Hispanics in Texas. We hypothesize that HHCs with latent Mtb infection and DM2 are characterised by a systemic dysregulation of immune-endocrine networks that lead to compromised immunity to Mtb. We will determine if there are unique signatures in serum cytokines and hormones as well as whole blood gene transcripts by DM2 status. This will allow us to identify relationships between immune and endocrine alterations in the blood of HHCs with DM2 (vs. no DM2) in two different ethnicities (Aim 1). To further ascertain whether these immune-endocrine relationships are associated with diminished cell activation and Mtb growth inhibitory capacity we will evaluate the impact of serum cytokines and hormones on the response of peripheral monocytes and T cells to Mtb in HHCs with and without DM2. We will evaluate monocyte and T cell activation as well as Mtb phagocytosis and growth by conducting parallel incubation of cells with autologous and heterologous sera (i.e., normal sera with DM2 cells and DM2 sera with no DM2 cells) (Aim 2). Finally, we hypothesize that human alveolar macrophages (HAMs) from HHCs with DM2 have altered cell activation and reduced capacity to contain Mtb growth. We will collect bronchoalveolar lavage from a subset of study participants and evaluate HAM phenotype, Mtb growth and cytokine production. In parallel, monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) will be generated and evaluated to identify relationships between local and systemic immune-endocrine alterations in responses to Mtb by HAMs and MDMs. These findings will demonstrate whether information gained from the periphery correlates with immune responses at the site of infection. At study completion, we will have gained critical and fundamental new insights into the interplay between the immune and endocrine systems, both in the periphery and lung; thereby helping to identify underlying risk factors in DM2 patients for progression to active TB."

Based on the presence of a strong group of R-01 funded clinical researchers, we offer training in translational research including: studies of vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, hypertension, aneurysms, and stroke. The School's commitment to graduate training is evidenced by full institutional support of trainee stipends in the first yer: In that year, our pre- doctoral trainees must complete core graduate courses that provide an intense exposure to state-of-the-art biomedical knowledge, and engage in research rotations in 3 laboratories. At the end of the first year, students choose a faculty mentor, and a degree-granting department, and those passing a rigorous selection procedure, are chosen by the Executive Committee for support on the CVTG. Graduate students complete most course work during their 2nd year and are expected to obtain a degree in 4-6 years. Post-doctoral trainees are recommended directly to the TG by one of the mentors and are subjected to equally rigorous selection and typically spend 3-5 years in training. In addition to laboratory bench research, the training program provides a wide array of innovative educational activities including: superb seminars, Research in Progress presentations in a variety of novel forms, specialized lectures in selected CV topics and methods, and numerous workshops including grant writing and publication. Training is tracked by required annual reports, and all trainees are required to submit an application for independent funding in their first year on the training grant Publication of research work in top-flight journals is expected of all trainees."
"9210547","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          My long-term research goal is to leverage translational research methodologies to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies and improve outcomes in patients with ischemic heart disease. The primary focus of this proposal is to characterize pathophysiological mechanisms linking neutrophil activation and adverse outcomes after acute coronary syndrome and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Much of our current knowledge about the potential role of neutrophils is based on observations from experimental models in mice, or microvascular models of inflammation. I propose to bridge the current gap in knowledge through detailed study of neutrophil biology and the association between neutrophil phenotype and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients who undergo clinically indicated PCI, a model of acute vascular injury. I further propose to use colchicine, an agent with direct neutrophil suppressive action, as a tool to elucidate the role of neutrophil activation during acute vascular injury. Colchicine may be particularly useful in the PCI setting due to its rapid onset of action and excellent side-effect profile at low doses, as well as its known mechanisms of action on neutrophil adhesion molecules. Patients referred for possible PCI will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to placebo or colchicine (1.8mg PO over 1 hour prior to PCI). In this two by two study design (post- versus pre-PCI and colchicine versus placebo), the effect of PCI and study drug will be examined on neutrophil-specific biomarkers and neutrophil-endothelial cell and neutrophil-platelet interactions. I will also explore the association between neutrophil phenotype and adverse cardiovascular outcomes after PCI and the effects of colchicine on these outcomes. In-depth characterization of neutrophil biology in acute vascular injury will allow  for exploration of new avenues in prevention and treatment, with a goal to identify novel selective targets that induce anti-inflammatory effects with minimal systemic immunosuppression. Characterization of post-cellular mediators via neutrophil extracellular trap and neutrophil-derived microparticle pathways may provide additional novel therapeutic targets. In addition, increased understanding of neutrophil biology gained in this proposal may provide novel insight into pathology of type 2 MI populations (e.g. demand ischemia in post-operative settings) and other atherosclerosis populations (e.g. peripheral artery disease). I completed a 5- year program at New York University (NYU) resulting in certification in general and Interventional Cardiology, as well as a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation. A VA Career Development Award will provide me with the stepping stone on which to advance to investigative independence, by supporting me through a series of courses and providing protected time for structured tutorials on the effective utilization of translational approaches an topics in inflammation. The strong environment and resources of the Manhattan VA and its academic affiliates, the Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU, will allow me to successfully execute the career development plan outlined in this proposal. This proposal features a multi-disciplinary approach, with support from experts in cardiology and rheumatology in both basic and clinical science, to reduce adverse outcomes after PCI. Such cross-disciplinary collaboration is necessary to effectively conduct translational research and will help prepare me for my career as a successful independent investigator."

"9421288","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment tailored to specific patient characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine) will have a significant positive impact on the delivery of healthcare. Personalized medicine for musculoskeletal pain conditions is a high priority because these conditions are a heavy burden to society due their economic impact and suffering they cause. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop personalized interventions for musculoskeletal pain that ameliorate musculoskeletal pain and lessen their burden on society. We study shoulder pain because it is a common musculoskeletal pain condition and in the initial funding period we identified combinations of genetic and psychological risk factors indicative of chronic shoulder pain. In particular, a combination of COMT genetic variants and pain catastrophizing formed a high risk subgroup predictive of heightened shoulder pain responses in a pre-clinical exercise-induced injury cohort and poor 12 month outcomes in a clinical post-operative shoulder pain cohort. This promising and robust finding provided the impetus to transition this line of research to an intervention phase. The renewal application will provide resources for this multidisciplinary research team to determine mechanisms and efficacy of personalized pharmaceutical and psychological pain interventions designed to target genetic and psychological factors that comprise the high risk subgroup. The pharmaceutical intervention will be propranolol as it counters the effects of decreased COMT enzyme. The psychological intervention will be cognitive restructuring that lessen the impact of pain catastrophizing. Our primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving the combined personalized pharmaceutical and personalized psychological intervention will have decreased shoulder pain duration, peak pain intensity, and peak upper-extremity disability following exercise-induced shoulder injury, when compared to the combined placebo condition. In addition, we will investigate psychological, molecular, and pain sensitivity regulation as mechanisms of pain relief. Successful completion of the proposed study will have a strong impact on the field as it has the potential to alter standard of care by discovering effective personalized pain treatments for individuals that, without the treatments, would go on to develop chronic shoulder pain. Completion of this study will also provide critical foundational data for designing a subsequent clinical trial in a post-operative shoulder pain cohort."
"9388636","PHS Fellowship Supplemental Form 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is growing recognition that cell non-autonomous signals play a major role in both normative aging and in Alzheimer?s Disease (AD); however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) represent a major system for the transduction of cell non-autonomous signals as well as a pathological macromolecule integral to Alzheimer?s disease, including misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins and peptides. However, there is is no simple genetic model by which the physiology of these processes can be studied. I propose to develop the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a powerful model for the study of ECV signaling in normative aging and Alzheimer?s disease. In this proposal I will (1) determine the physiological relevance of nematode ECV signaling in cell non-autonomous mechanisms of longevity determination (2) uncover the role of ECV-signaling in spreading A 1-42 from cell to cell (3) and compare the effects of normative aging and AD on the abundance and compositions of ECVs from C. elegans ECVs and human patient cerebrospinal fluid samples. These studies will leverage the resources of both the UW Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging as well as the UW Alzheimer?s Disease Research Center to provide key insights into the composition of ECVs from both C. elegans and AD patients, and will set the stage for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the effect of aging on ECV function and the role of ECVs in aging and Alzheimer?s disease."
"9109373","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is test the feasibility of a brief computer-based personalized feedback intervention to reduce heavy alcohol use among HIV+ individuals. Rates of hazardous alcohol use among HIV+ individuals are approximately two times that found in the general population. Hazardous alcohol use contributes to problems with HIV medication adherence, risky sexual behavior, and psychological problems, as well as physical complications (rapid disease progression, medication toxicities, organ failure, and poor viremic control), which may lead to increased risk of transmission and premature death. Yet, HIV+ hazardous alcohol users remain a hard-to-reach and underserved group. There is therefore a critical need to test alternative approaches to the implementation of effective interventions to reduce HIV disease transmission and progression in HIV+ hazardous alcohol users. One novel and promising intervention approach is the use of personalized feedback, which has consistently been found to be efficacious for reducing hazardous alcohol use across a number of populations. Personalized feedback highlights discrepancies between one's own drinking and typical drinking; reframes use in terms of personal, social, financial, health, and other consequences; and offers strategies for reducing use and alcohol-related negative consequences. The proposed research will develop and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a novel evidence- and computer-based Personalized Feedback Intervention (PFI) among HIV+ hazardous alcohol users in a high volume Houston HIV clinic. The research will include two primary aims. The first aim focuses on development and refinement of an intervention adapted from investigators' previous work to incorporate feedback for HIV+ individuals. Feasibility and acceptability will be established through iterative incorporation of focus group feedback regarding recruitment, assessment, and intervention procedures. The second aim will pilot the intervention to evaluate feasibility and potential efficacy. Outcomes include drinking change processes and behavior, alcohol-related risky sexual behavior, and HIV-related outcomes. The pilot will recruit 150 HIV+ hazardous alcohol users from clinic waiting areas. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the PFI or to receive feedback unrelated to alcohol use. An underlying premise which will be evaluated through the aims is that the difficulty in reaching hazardous alcohol users who are HIV+ can be addressed with an approach that will not be burdensome to the individuals or to clinic staff. All assessments and procedures will take place in the clinic on tablets or laptop computers. Follow-up assessments will occur at 3 months post-baseline. This research builds on the collaborative work of an experienced team of investigators with complementary expertise supporting all aspects of the proposed research."
"9379365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term goal of this project is to gain insight into the nature and role of human B1 cells in health and disease. The specific aims of the present project are to test the hypothesis that B1 cells are the source of pathogenic autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE, lupus), and to identify the progenitor for B1 cells in order to provide a foundation for potential novel therapies against lupus and related autoimmune dyscrasias. Lupus is a devastating and sometimes fatal multi-system affliction in which normal tissues are attacked by a dysfunctioning immune system. Autoreactive antibodies are an indelible feature of lupus and are thought to play a pathogenic role. The source of these autoreactive antibodies remains uncertain. Current paradigms have not included a role for B1 cells because: 1) the definition of human B1 cells has been unclear; and, 2) clinically significant autoantibodies are typically IgG and somatically mutated (whereas well characterized mouse B1 cells generate mostly IgM with little mutation that fulfills a homeostatic role by speeding elimination of apoptotic cell debris). However, two new findings bring B1 cells into the picture. Firstly, we identified the phenotype (CD20+CD27+CD43+) for human B1-like cells that share characteristics with murine B1 cells. Secondly, we determined that antibody produced by human B1- like cells is often IgG and typically somatically mutated. These new results suggest the hypothesis that abnormally functioning B1 cells are the source of pathological autoantibodies in lupus and that the ratio of IgG to IgM may determine relative destructiveness and consequent loss of tolerance. As a key corollary, in order to modulate B1 cell activity, it is necessary to identify the progenitor for these cells and to understand the means to influence their development. To address these issues we propose that: 1. We will identify the progenitor for human B1 cells. 1A. We will identify the human B1 cell progenitor by adoptively transferring candidate populations to immunodeficient NSG mice and monitoring B1 cell development. 1B. We will test enhancements to B1 cell development by evaluating cytokine ligands during in vitro culture. 2. We will examine the role of B1 cells in generating autoantibodies. 2A.We will determine the autoreactivity of antibodies derived from B1 cells and other B cell populations by testing expression-cloned VH4-34 antibodies. 2B. We will evaluate the secretion of autoantibodies by B1 and other B cells by determining the frequency/amount of IgG/IgM after stimulation, comparing lupus and control B cells, to test our hypothesis that lupus B1 cells specifically generate overwhelming amounts of IgG autoantibody. Much is known about mouse B1 cells whereas little is known about human B1-like cells. The results of these studies will greatly increase knowledge regarding the nature and development of human B1 cells; will test a novel hypothesis linking B1 cells and pathological autoantibodies; and, will provide a foundation for future efforts to therapeutically modify B1 cell activity."
"9385103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests continued support for a Postdoctoral Training Program, now in its 34th year, designed to produce independent researchers in the area of research on the genetics of drug and alcohol abuse. Funds are requested to support 7 fellows per year (level 0-7), with the average duration of support being three years. This multidisciplinary program has three broad areas of training: pharmacology, genetics, and behavior. These areas are covered by 23 well-funded primary and secondary training faculty mentors, who focus both on basic and clinical alcohol/drug abuse research and related areas such as bioinformatics and epigenetics. The majority of the faculty currently on the grant will continue to participate. A number of units within the Denver and Boulder campuses of the University of Colorado are involved: the Departments of Pharmacology, Psychiatry, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Psychology, Integrative Physiology (Institute for Behavioral Genetics); Statistics and Bioinformatics (Colorado School of Public Health); the Colorado component of the NIAAA-funded Integrated Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA); and the NIDA-funded Center on Antisocial Drug Dependence. Trainees with doctoral degrees are recruited from a broad range of disciplines. Concerted efforts have been made to recruit trainees from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and to contribute to longer-term programs to fill the pipeline. Trainees work primarily in one lab, but collaborative interactions with other mentors and trainees are strongly encouraged. All of the mentors use state-of-the-art pharmacological, molecular structural, genetic, genomic, statistical and/or behavioral approaches. Training in quantitative and molecular genetics, combined with a broad range of pharmacological approaches, allows the fellows to dissect the molecular, cellular, and genetic bases for behavioral reactions to drugs and the environment and susceptibility to alcohol and drug addiction. Another important characteristic of this Training Program is the opportunity for trainees to participate in interactions between basic science and clinical practice Contact with other faculty and trainees through a focused seminar series, a journal club, and various courses, including Ethics in Research, complete the training environment. Trainees are also encouraged to write individual NRSAs and present their work in local seminars, as well as at national and international meetings. Past trainees from this program have been very successful, and a number are continuing to make significant contributions in the alcohol and drug abuse fields."
"9391268","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a leading public health concern in the United States. Excessive alcohol consumption is related to nearly $225 billion in economic costs and over 80,000 fatalities annually. Sexual minority youth (SMY; lesbian/gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning [LGBTQ+]) are at heightened risk for mental health symptoms and alcohol use due to their unique experiences as sexual and gender minorities (e.g., discrimination, victimization). Their propensity for excessive alcohol use puts them at greater risk for adverse consequences, including the development of an AUD and alcohol related morbidity and mortality. Both the National Institute of Health and the Institute of Medicine have expressed the need for researchers to address health disparities among sexual minorities. Despite identifying the elevated risk for excessive alcohol use among SMY and young adults, researchers have yet to build a comprehensive picture of how modifiable interpersonal (relationships with peers and parents) and contextual (school climate) factors influence their alcohol use. Consequently, there are large gaps in the available research regarding how indicators of risk and protective factors differ between heterosexual and SMY and among subpopulations of SMY (differentiated by gender, sexual minority status, and race/ethnicity). As such, there are no empirically validated prevention or intervention programs addressing SMY and young adult alcohol use. This National Research Service Award (F32) will provide the applicant with the training and resources necessary to address SMY health disparities, setting the stage for continued work in this area as an emerging scholar. To accomplish career and research goals, the applicant requires training in (1) investigating health disparities among sexual minority populations, (2) etiology and epidemiology of alcohol use within a developmental context, and (3) complex quantitative methodologies testing developmental processes and contextual influences. The training program combines mentored research projects with coursework, workshops, and conferences to enable the applicant to build a strong and influential program of research addressing the modifiable interpersonal and contextual factors that contribute to SMY alcohol use. Three research aims are addressed in the current application: (1) Identify modifiable interpersonal and contextual risk and protective factors that contribute to SMY and young adult alcohol use; (2) test the influence of modifiable interpersonal and contextual risk and protective factors unique to  SMY (e.g., SMY-specific family support, victimization, school climate) that contribute to SMY and young adult alcohol use; and (3) construct a developmental theoretical model of sexual minority alcohol use that will act as the foundation for writing a K01 award that tests these theoretical associations and propositions at later stages of the applicants career."
"9242929","Project Summary/Abstract Research: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a high relapse rate and is very difficult to cure, in large part due to the persistence of quiescent, chemotherapy-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Successful eradication of LSCs would greatly improve AML cure rates, but specific targeting of LSCs has been difficult to achieve because LSCs are rare and difficult to study. This proposal builds on my novel preliminary data indicating that the Rac-GAP Arhgap25 is required for leukemic transformation of HSCs. To understand more fully the requirement for and mechanisms underpinning the role of Arhgap25 AML leukemogenesis, I propose three distinct and complementary lines of investigation in this application, all of which target LSC survival and maintenance. First, I will fully characterize the cell-of-origin-specific nature of the requirement for Arhgap25 in leukemogenesis in multiple models of AML. Second, I will identify the phosphorylation events that permit or prohibit the ability of Arhgap25 to contribute to leukemogenesis. Finally, I will dissect the biochemical mechanisms responsible for Arhgap25 requirement in the maintenance and survival of AML LSCs. These studies will lay the groundwork for developing clinically useful combination therapies for AML and, ultimately, improving AML cure rates. Environment: The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Boston Children?s Hospital (BCH), and the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard University are internationally recognized research programs with a number of world-renowned researchers in the areas of stem cell biology, hematopoiesis, and cancer biology.

I have assembled an excellent mentoring and advisory committee, consisting of Dr. Amy Wagers, Dr. David Williams, Dr. Leonard Zon, Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier, and Dr. Yi Zheng, who will guide me through my research and training experiences. Dr. Zheng, who has joined my advisory committee for this resubmission, is one of the world?s experts in small GTPase biochemistry, and will aid significantly in providing essential additional training in Rac biochemical techniques and strategies. Candidate Career Goals: My long-term career objective is to compete successfully for R01 funding as a tenure-track, independent physician-scientist in a pediatric hematology/oncology/stem cell transplantation department. A K08 award will provide the senior mentorship and expertise needed to advance my training, develop my proficiency in new techniques, and develop my mastery of new concepts.

"9232062","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid organ transplantation is currently the treatment of choice for children with a variety of end-stage organ diseases. The success of clinical transplantation is dependent on the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the allograft. However, chronic immunosuppression is linked to a number of serious side effects in children including an increased risk of infection and de novo malignancies. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is the most common malignancy in this population, occurring in 10% of pediatric heart, 1-3% of kidney, 1-3% of liver, and 10-30% of small bowel transplant recipients. PTLD describes a spectrum of abnormal B cell lymphoproliferations associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, the most serious of which manifest as frank lymphoma. As the risk of developing PTLD is greater in patients who are EBV seronegative at the time of transplant, infants and children are at particular risk. Currently, there is no EBV vaccine available; reduction in immunosuppression and antiviral therapy are used as the first line of treatment. However, there are major gaps in our understanding of the immune response to EBV infection in the immunosuppressed patient and no clear evidence that current therapies are effective. Advances in this field are limited by the absence of proven biomarkers to reliably diagnose EBV-associated cancers and to follow those who are at highest risk. We hypothesize that unique molecular and functional changes in the EBV genome, the infected B cells, and the responsive T cells occur in transplant recipient children with EBV disease and that these changes can be utilized as novel biomarkers associated with detection and prognosis of EBV-positive PTLD. We have developed compelling preliminary data suggesting that the attainment of such biomarkers may be within reach. In this observational study, coupled with a strong mechanistic component, we bring together 5 leading pediatric programs in heart, liver and small intestinal transplantation to identify biomarkers of EBV disease and its progression to PTLD. To test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Assess gain of function mutations in the EBV protein LMP1 as a biomarker for PTLD risk. Aim 2: Assess the emergence of pathogenic B cell clonotypes using high-throughput V(D)J sequencing as a biomarker for emergence of pre-clinical PTLD. Our goal is the development of a biomarker that would identify patients at risk for PTLD or those in the very early stages of the disease, which will represent a major advance in pediatric solid organ transplantation."

"9341709","PROJECT SUMMARY Pneumococcal pneumonia remains the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia in both children under 5 years of age and adults over 65 years of age. The standard, preventative therapy is the conjugate vaccine, Prevnar-13, which consists of an immunogenic carrier protein covalently attached to one of thirteen pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides. Although Prevnar-13 has significantly reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease, it only protects against 13 of the 90 plus pneumococcal serotypes; furthermore, current methods employed to expand the serotype coverage are notoriously slow requiring complex synthetic chemistries to link a new pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide to the immunogenic carrier protein. Over the last decade, we have been pioneering an innovative approach to conjugate vaccine development that drastically simplifies the production of glycoconjugates. This glycoengineering strategy, consisting of the exploitation of bacterial glycosylation machineries to generate ?bioconjugates?, eliminates the need of intricate chemical conjugation methods by employing conjugating enzymes to attach polysaccharides to acceptor proteins in Escherichia coli. Two conjugating enzymes, PglB and PglL, have been commercially utilized to generate bioconjugates as they are able to transfer a wide variety of polysaccharides to proteins; however, neither are able to transfer polysaccharides containing glucose at the reducing end (the first sugar of a growing polysaccharide chain). This seemingly simple observation has enormous implications as approximately 80% of pneumococcal capsules contain glucose at the reducing end. Recently, we have identified and patented the first conjugating enzyme that is able to efficiently transfer pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides containing glucose at the reducing end to an acceptor protein. Based on this observation, we will couple our novel conjugating enzyme technology with carrier proteins previously utilized in conjugate vaccine formulations, streamlining the generation of a superior pneumococcal vaccine with broader serotype coverage. Importantly, our glycoengineering strategy does not require pathogenic organisms as a source of polysaccharide nor chemical reactions to link polysaccharides to proteins.  The proposed research in this phase I application will focus on (Aim 1) glycoengineering three commercial carrier proteins (exotoxin A, tetanus toxin fragment C, and CRM197) to contain a modular glycotag with pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides generating a new bioconjugate vaccine for pneumococcal serotypes 8, 9V, 14, and 15b. Subsequently (Aim 2) we will demonstrate the immunogenicity and efficacy of our pneumococcal specific bioconjugate vaccine compared to the standard preventative therapy Prevnar-13. Our next step for phase II funding is to expand the serotype coverage included in our bioconjugate vaccine, develop a large-scale purification scheme for obtaining our bioconjugate vaccine, as well as pre-clinical studies to further demonstrate the safety, potency, and efficacy of our next generation glycoengineered pneumococcal bioconjugate vaccine."
"9240032","Lipids within cells are stored in an organelle termed lipid droplets (LDs) that consist of neutral lipids core of diacylglycerides, triglycerides, and cholesterol ester covered by a single layer of phospholipids. Recent evidence indicates a pivotal role of LD in the spatial and temporal regulation of intracellular lipid metabolism. Our project aims to understand the regulation of intracellular lipid metabolism through the study of LD in beta cells considering the critical role of lipids in beta cell. Metabolites produced by lipolysis augment insulin secretion, while unregulated accumulation of lipids impair beta cell health and leads to diabetes. The perilipin (PLIN1-5) family of proteins resides on the surface of LD and plays a key role in the formation and mobilization of LD. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which PLIN affects insulin secretion and to clarify the role of PLIN in the pathogenesis of abnormal lipid metabolism in beta cells under type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have demonstrated that both PLIN2 and PLIN5 are expressed in human and mouse islets, but their expression is differentially regulated. We have shown that PLIN5 plays a significant role in increasing insulin secretion likely through the regulation of lipid metabolism acutely, especially lipolysis in beta cells. PLIN2 may aid adaptation of beta cells to nutritional stress. Thus, we hypothesize that PLIN2 and 5, each with unique molecular characteristics coordinately achieve the efficient regulation of insulin secretion and protect beta cells under nutritional stress. The hypothesis will be tested by 2 aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which PLIN5 augments GSIS and lipolysis. PLIN5 augments GSIS both in vitro and in vivo, which we hypothesize is mediated by lipolysis. Here, we will delineate the pathway connecting PLIN5 and GSIS. The impact of PLIN5 deficiency in beta cells on glucose homeostasis will be tested in beta cell specific PLIN5 knockout mice. The contribution of PLIN5 phosphorylation in lipid metabolism and GSIS will be tested using phosphorylation resistant mutant PLIN5 expressed in cultured cell and in beta cells of mice. Lastly, the molecular target that mediates the augmentation of PLIN5 will be determined by increase lipolysis through mutant PLIN5 and pharmacological modulation of lipolysis. Specific Aim 2: Determine how perilipins protect beta cells under nutritional stress. Studies in yeast, drosophila, and mouse liver implicate that LDs protect cells under nutritional stress. In beta cells, PLIN2 is highly expressed and increased by fatty acids. We have obtained preliminary data that the loss of PLIN2 in beta cells impair GSIS and islet adaptation to high fat feeding. We will determine the mechanism by which PLIN2 protect beta cells under nutritional stress. Also, we will analyze how islet PLINs and lipidome are altered in human islets affected by T2D. Our study holds promise to identify a new target that supports GSIS and protects beta cells under nutritional stress associated with T2D."
"9001252","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of isolated congenital heart block (CHB) in a fetus predicts with near certainty that the mother, who may have a rheumatic disease or be asymptomatic, will have autoantibodies (Ab) to SSA/Ro ribonucleoproteins. CHB, a pathologic readout of passively acquired autoimmunity, provides an exceptional opportunity to examine the effector arm of immunity and define the mechanism whereby an Ab mediates fibrosis, which is particularly aberrant in fetal wounding. The study of CHB exemplifies not only translational research, which draws upon clinical clues and explores them in the laboratory, but integrational research which attempts to fit key clinical and basic observations together. In the previous funding periods we leveraged several rare fetal/neonatal autopsy specimens to interrogate clues to pathogenesis. Exaggerated apoptosis, macrophage/myfibroblast crosstalk, TGF expression, and extensive fibrosis in the conduction system (and, in some, the surrounding myocardium) of CHB-hearts, provided in vivo support for parallel in vitro investigation. Positing apoptosis as the initial link between Ab and tissue injury led to the first-time observation that healthy cardiocytes are capable of phagocytosing apoptotic cardiocytes, and that anti-Ro/La Abs inhibit this function. That this perturbation of physiologic efferocytosis diverts uptake to professional Fc?R-bearing phagocytes fits well with ongoing experiments demonstrating macrophage secretion of pro-inflammatory and fibrosing cytokines when coincubated with apoptotic cardiocytes bound by anti-Ro/La Ab. The macrophage engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLR) via binding to the RNA moiety of the target autoantigen was suggested by recent experiments. The potential for relative oxygen insult during pregnancy, and the need to explain CHB- discordance in monozygotic twins, directed attention to hypoxia as an amplification factor on the distal fibrosing component. Footprints of hypoxic injury comprised expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-?1 in affected hearts and increased erythropoietin levels in several CHB-cord bloods. In Aim 1, the specificity and mechanism of anti-Ro/La Ab in inhibiting efferocytosis by autologous human fetal cardiocytes will be evaluated. It is hypothesized that binding of anti-Ro/La Ab to apoptotic cardiocytes not only inhibits clearance but, by opsonizing these cells, provides the immune complex for subsequent uptake by professional phagocytes. In Aim 2, the nexus of Fc? receptor (Fc?R) and TLR signaling following macrophage uptake of opsonized apoptotic cardiocytes will be addressed with regard to release of mediators that promote inflammation and fibrosis. The hypothesis driving this aim is that opsonization of apoptotic cardiocytes induces macrophage uptake by an Fc?R-dependent pathway and activation via TLR ligation, which set in motion the final step to irreversible scar. The experiments of Aim 3 address the mechanism by which the inflammatory cascade initiated by anti-Ro/La Abs induces a persistent fibrosing phenotype in the cardiac fibroblast. The hypothesis is that macrophage products prime the fibroblast toward scar, which is further abetted by an in utero stress such as hypoxia. Fetuses of mothers who are otherwise healthy or who suffer from a rheumatic disease but have autoantibodies to SSA/Ro are at risk for having permanent heart damage, which requires permanent pacing at some point in life or can be fatal. Understanding the mechanism by which these autoantibodies cause cardiac scarring is critical to the development of strategies for treatment or prevention of this condition, known as congenital heart block."
"9252112","Project Summary: Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults and children. Though there are a variety of other multi-systemic effects, DM1 is mainly characterized by myotonia and progressive muscle wasting. Muscle weakness, wasting, and fatigue have also been reported as the most impactful adverse outcomes by patients. RNA splicing defects have been identified as key effects of the toxic RNA produced in DM1 patients, and using myoblast cells from mice and DM1 patients, we and others have previously demonstrated the deleterious effects of the toxic RNA on myogenic differentiation. But little is known about the regenerative process in DM1 or the effects of RNA toxicity on this. Addressing this key issue is hampered without a model in which we can develop a thorough understanding of the effects of RNA toxicity on muscle regeneration and one in which to test therapies targeting this process. Satellite cells are key cellular mediators of muscle regeneration in response to damage. Here, we have developed the first RNA toxicity mouse model with demonstrated expression of the toxic RNA in satellite cells. We will use this model to characterize the effects of RNA toxicity on satellite cells and muscle regeneration. We will also study the expression of various key proteins implicated in DM1 such as MBNL1 and CUGBP1 in satellite cells, especially in response to damage. We will also use this model to study the effects of therapeutics on satellite cell function in RNA toxicity. Our goal is to understand the role of RNA toxicity in the process of muscle regeneration in order to provide a platform for developing therapies to treat muscular dystrophy in DM1. ."
"9355290","Project Summary The timely delivery of membrane-bound vesicles and tubules bearing transmembrane protein and lipid cargo to discrete cellular locations via specific trafficking pathways is fundamental to cell biology and human health. Many proteins associated with trafficking pathways are linked to serious and crippling human diseases, including neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and the hereditary spastic paraplegias. Although certain trafficking proteins and pathways are well characterized, we lack direct evidence or have only partial evidence for other pathways that we infer must exist between membranes. This constitutes an enormous gap in our current understanding of fundamental cell biology. Our goal is to elucidate the molecular structures and functions of important coat protein complexes that initiate trafficking pathways by forming coats around vesicles or tubules at specific membranes. Coat proteins recognize and package relevant cargoes, and they promote efficient assembly of additional required protein components, like SNAREs. While clathrin coats have been extensively studied, functions of certain non-clathrin coats remain virtually unknown. Increasing evidence indicates non-clathrin coats assemble using distinct mechanisms, suggesting clathrin cannot be considered a paradigm for coat assembly. We investigate non- clathrin coat complexes, including adaptor protein 4 (AP4), coat protein complex I (COPI), and retromer, by using a variety of tools to ascertain molecular mechanisms of coat assembly and regulation. Biochemical and proteomic approaches allow us to identify new components of coated structures, especially cargo molecules, accessory, and regulatory proteins. Structural methods like X-ray crystallography, NMR, and electron microscopy reveal at the molecular level how coats interact with key protein partners and allow us to map specific binding interfaces. Biophysical techniques enable us to quantify binding affinities and to probe interfaces identified in structural models. With collaborators, we use molecular data to design experiments in cultured cell lines and in model organisms to explore how a variety of protein-protein interactions drive phenotypes at the cellular and organismal levels. Ultimately, we hope to gain a molecular understanding of how non-clathrin coats assemble at distinct membranes to drive different trafficking pathways. We anticipate this work will reveal new mechanisms of cargo recognition, coat assembly, and regulation. We further aim to uncover the molecular basis of specific diseases associated with these coat proteins."
"9322134","Project Summary/Abstract: The nervous system must constantly compare different streams of information, make decisions, and execute appropriate behaviors. However, the neural mechanisms of decision-making are not yet fully understood. This project uses Drosophila as a model to investigate sensorimotor integration and decision-making, and in particular the origins of variability in decision outcomes. Fruit flies are a useful model for studying these issues because there are excellent genetic tools in Drosophila that provide access to many individual cell types, and it is straightforward to monitor neural activity in an awake behaving organism. The number of neurons in each brain region is relatively small (on the order of 100 ? 1000), and the wiring of the brain is relatively stereotyped. Finally, almost the entire brain can be imaged in a single experiment, due to the relatively small size of the brain. This project will focus on a well-characterized behavior called osmotropotaxis, where a fly compares odor concentrations at the left and right antenna. On average, a fly will turn in the direction of the more strongly stimulated antenna. On a given trial, however, the fly may turn in the opposite direction or simply walk straight ahead, even when olfactory signals are unambiguous at the level of the antennae, indicating that behavioral variability arises internally, and is not the result of sensory noise. This project has two Specific Aims: (1) to determine how the fly compares the level of activity on the right and left sides of its olfactory system, and (2) to determine how the outcome of this computation interacts with internal dynamics in the brain to control behavioral decisions. These aims will be accomplished using volumetric two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in tethered flies executing osmotropotaxis behavior on a spherical treadmill. Neural activity will be monitored in several specific brain regions near the interface of the olfactory system and motor control systems. The feasibility of this approach has already been demonstrated in pilot experiments. The first part of the project aims to identify and characterize neurons that explicitly encode a comparison between the right and left antenna ? in other words, neurons that respond preferentially to laterally asymmetric odor stimuli. The second part of the project aims to identify and characterize neurons whose activity can predict trials where the fly fails to turn in the cued direction. Our overall goal is to understand how the brain explicitly ?decides? whether the odor is on the right or left side, and how a clearly asymmetric stimulus is translated into an unreliable turning behavior. We expect this project to provide insights into the fundamental features of sensorimotor integration, decision-making, and behavioral variability."
"9245320","PROJECT SUMMARY Adolescents account for 42% of new HIV infections worldwide, and almost 90% of these infections are acquired across the anogenital mucosa1,2. Beyond behavioral risk factors, the influences of the dramatic, dynamic shifts in hormones during adolescent reproductive development on the anal and vaginal mucosa may drive mucosal vulnerability to HIV infection. Extreme hormonal shifts in transgender adolescents undergoing cross-sex hormone therapy may contribute to the alarmingly high 25% transmission rates seen in this group1,3- 6. This proposal directly addresses adolescent biologic risk factors for HIV susceptibility in gender conforming (cis) and transgender (trans) adolescents, taking advantage of the unique hormonal manipulation in trans individuals to define the influence of testosterone and estrogen on mucosal integrity and inflammation within the anal and vaginal mucosa. Comparisons to conventional puberty in cis adolescents provide the opportunity to refine our understanding the mucosal effects of sex-steroids. We will define normative indices of anogenital microbial communities using 16s rRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics of vaginal proteins. These normative values will be evaluated in the context of blood hormone levels, Tanner sexual maturity, and mucosal trauma from self-reported sexual activity (ACASI) throughout the individual's progression either through: (1) conventional sexual maturation in cis adolescents, or (2) during pubertal hormonal blockade with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and subsequent sexual maturation with cross-sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone) in trans adolescents. We will obtain rectal biopsies from cis and trans gender youth, and use an ex vivo rectal tissue model to evaluate the impact of sex steroid hormones, sexual trauma and microbial communities on HIV infection. Furthermore, we will identify proteomic signatures of vaginal inflammation, mucosal barrier disruption, and differences in anogenital microbial communities that may be related to HIV susceptibility. This study will ultimately characterize the effects of sex steroid hormones and sexual trauma on commensal anogenital microbial communities and vaginal mucosal proteins that confer increase risk to mucosal HIV transmission in adolescents. This study provides desperately-needed public health data to clarify biologic risk factors that contribute to HIV acquisition and pathogenesis in these at-risk adolescent populations, in particular the effects of reproductive maturation and injury upon anogenital mucosal environments. The information gained will provide a significant platform for future hypothesis-generating studies that address modulation of HIV susceptibility and efficacious biomedical HIV prevention strategies in this highly vulnerable population."
"9228693","PROJECT SUMMARY  9 The long-term objective of this R61/R33 is to employ ? -tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) a type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) agonist, as a ?cognitive enhancer? to increase recall of extinction learning in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). First-line psychotherapy for PTSD is Prolonged Exposure (PE), which involves repeated exposure to fear-linked cues to produce ?extinction? of fear. PE is generally effective, but many patients have incomplete extinction or fail to sustain extinction learning-related improvement over time. Recall of extinction learning depends upon limbic-frontal brain networks (hippocampus [HPC], ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC]) and PTSD patients show decreased activity in these regions and poor extinction recall. Adjunct interventions that address vmPFC-HPC dysfunction and rescue extinction recall deficits could enhance the efficacy of PE for PTSD. Compelling evidence suggests that an acute oral dose of THC, prior to experimental fear extinction procedures in healthy volunteers, facilitates recall of extinction learning via increased activation and functional connectivity of the vmPFC and HPC. As extinction recall deficits and vmPFC-HPC dysfunction have been observed in PTSD, findings indicate the cannabinoid system is a promising target to improve the efficacy and durability of learning during PE in treating PTSD. Accordingly, we will test the hypotheses that THC will significantly enhance the recall of extinction learning in patients with PTSD and reduce symptom severity and that these effects will be mediated via increased activation of the vmPFC and/or HPC. In the R61 phase, PTSD patients will be randomized to one of three conditions (low 5mg THC; high 10mg THC; placebo [PBO]). We will couple a standard Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm with functional MRI (fMRI) and skin conductance recordings (SCR) to compare the effects of THC vs PBO administered prior to extinction learning, testing recall of extinction learning 24 hr and 1 week after extinction learning. If THC (vs. PBO) significantly increases extinction recall and increases vmPFC and/or HPC activation in PTSD, the R33 phase will test the efficacy of THC to reduce PTSD symptom severity, and increase maintenance of treatment following PE. In the R33 phase, PTSD patients will be randomly assigned to a THC (dose identified from R61 phase) or PBO condition. THC or PBO will be administered 2 hr prior to each exposure session in a standard manualized PE treatment protocol. We will assess treatment success (reduced PTSD symptom severity) at each PE visit following THC and again at 3 months after treatment to explore long-term PE effects coupled with THC. Like the R61 phase, we will use a Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm to measure brain activation in fear extinction circuitry during an extinction recall test pre- and post-treatment to determine whether THC increases activation in this circuitry. Together, the R61 and R33 phases will provide the most directly translational and critical test of THC effects in PTSD. Findings from this investigation could stimulate development of novel pharmacological modulators of the cannabinoid system to maximize the efficacy of exposure therapy for PTSD."
"9392613","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Devices capable of probing the elaborate interactions between electrical and chemical (ie. dopamine) neural signals that embody the basal ganglia brain circuits will improve treatment approach of subcortically based disorders and ability to elucidate their pathophysiological mechanisms. The neuroactive chemical, dopamine, along with its major role in controlling basal ganglia operations, are implicated in many debilitating disorders- movement disorders including Parkinson's disease, psychiatric and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, etc. Current treatment have limited efficacy while the ability to develop better restorative strategies is aggravated by our limited understanding of these complex brain circuits including the role of dopamine signaling known to innervate all basal ganglia structures along with their projection targets across the brain. Furthermore, the targeted basal ganglia areas are situated deep in the brain volume, which limits the methods that can be employed to monitor its activity in situ. The first aim is to employ microfabrication techniques to  manufacture high aspect ratio electrodes with multiple (4) different functions to probe the multifaceted nature of the basal ganglia-local and multi-site recording and modulation of electrical and chemical activity. These injectrodes will be able to record both electrical neural  activity and dopamine fluctuations from a dense micro- array of electrode sites at the site of drug infusion or electrical stimulation. This multimodal probe will allow unparalleled analysis (with superior temporal and spatial resolution) of cell-type specific neural activity in the form o their electrical and chemical signaling domains-essential to understand etiological mechanisms and identify drug targets for brain disorders. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry performed at multi-electrode carbon arrays integrated at the injectrode tip allows for chemical recording of dopamine fluctuations at millisecond timescales at several sites proximal to the site of stimulation or infusion. The injectrode may also afford improved remediation of pathological brain states by adaptively disturbing the aberrant activity based on detected electrical and chemical discharge patterns for closed-loop treatment. The second aim is to validate the injectrode device. Local field potentials and spike activity along with dopamine fluctuations will be monitored in response to locally delivered stimuli in nonhuman primates. These studies will be combined with behavioral studies related to trained saccadic eye movement tasks. Therapeutic efficacy will be determined by measuring both behavioral and physiological neural activity along with physiological response during the long term use of the closed-loop injectrode systems as chronically implanted in rodent models of Parkinson's disease. The proposed studies will generate advanced tools to probe the brain from multiple functional domains and ameliorate aberrant brain circuits in a localized and efficacious manner and may reveal important neurochemical mechanisms critical to basal ganglia functionality. Furthermore, the generated devices may be applied towards in situ high throughput screening of neuropharmacological agents for drug discovery."
"9242939","Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) cause serious problems in society and few effective treatments are available. Basic research with invertebrates has provided ground-breaking discoveries in uncovering mechanisms that underlie behaviors as complex as learning and memory. Recent work indicates that the same basic types of behavior that define drug reward in mammals are also evident in invertebrates (crayfish, flies, C. elegans). C. elegans is an excellent model to study the neurobiological basis of human behavior with: a surprisingly conserved, fully tractable genome; and a short generation time with low maintenance costs for fast generation of data at a fraction of the cost of other organisms. We have shown that C. elegans display a conditioned preference for cues previously paired with cocaine or methamphetamine, analogous to findings in mammalian models of drug reward. We have also found that C. elegans demonstrate movement toward, and concentration-dependent self-exposure to various psychoactive drugs (i.e. cocaine, caffeine, and ethanol (EtOH)), which is deemed a ?preference response?. The recent discovery of opioid receptors in C. elegans provided the impetus to test the hypothesis that C. elegans may be used as a medications screen to identify new treatments for AUDs. We tested the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist and effective treatment for AUDs and other addictions, on EtOH preference in C. elegans. Naltrexone treatment blocked acute EtOH and cocaine preference, but had no effect on motor activity or attraction to food or benzaldehyde (a volatile attractant). Chronic EtOH exposure enhanced EtOH preference, induced treatment resistance and compulsive- like behavior as evidenced by sustained self-exposure to EtOH in the presence of an aversive stimulus (nonanone). Together these data indicate that C. elegans have potential to serve as a model system to identify compounds to treat AUDs and other addictive disorders. However, clear evidence is needed to fully characterize the model and confirm that the phenomena observed thus far are consistent with efficacy of treatments for AUDs. Thus, the objective of this application is to test compounds, previously shown to reduce EtOH drinking and/or seeking in vertebrate models, in the C. elegans EtOH preference test in acute and chronic models, and to characterize the selectivity of the response. The results are expected to show that drugs that inhibit EtOH consumption and relapse in humans will produce similar effects in C. elegans where the pharmacology and molecular systems mediating the response are similar between the two species. Follow- up studies will test mutant C. elegans to identify mechanisms involved for candidate compounds with positive treatment results. To enhance the validity and translation of the model, future projects will include creating transgenic C. elegans expressing human receptors and pharmacology. The establishment of an effective high throughput behavioral model using C. elegans to screen candidate agents to treat AUDs would be a transformational advancement in the field, and is the long-term goal of this project."
"9241877","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomaterial-associated infections account for over one million nosocomial infections per year, and their prevention is a critical component to successful regenerative medicine strategies. Bacterial infection of biomaterial implants frequently results in complete removal of the implant despite aggressive antibiotic therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most clinically relevant gram positive and gram negative pathogens associated with medical device failure. Bacteriophages are bacteria-specific viruses that have the ability to infect and lyse host bacteria. We have recently engineered a poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel system for controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins that facilitates bone repair in a murine radial segmental defect model. Contamination of these hydrogels with bacteria leads to complete inhibition of bone healing, persistence of bacteria, and bone resorption. The objective of this project is to engineer  PEG- based hydrogels that are infection resistant. The central hypothesis is that delivery of bacteriophage using a PEG-hydrogel will reduce infection in a mouse model for bone repair. Aim 1: Engineer hydrogels for controlled delivery of active bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria. Aim 2: Examine the ability of phage presenting hydrogels to reduce infection and improve bone repair. Aim 3: Characterize the in vivo inflammatory response to bacteriophage containing hydrogels. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on developing biomaterials that resistant infection without the use of antibiotics, thereby reducing the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria while minimizing implanted device failure. As outcomes of this research, we will establish the feasibility of controlled bacteriophage release hydrogels to reduce infection and promote bone repair. This research will establish a strategy for infection-resistant biomaterials that is applicable to various biomedical devices."
"9393077","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are novel battery powered nicotine delivery devices. Although the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing, there remains a lack of research regarding their safety and addiction potential. A growing body of research suggests that like tobacco cigarettes, e-cigarettes also share a high rate of co-use with alcohol. Previous research has found that smoking tobacco cigarettes while drinking alcohol may produce greater rewarding effects. However, there are over 5,000 different compounds found in tobacco smoke in addition to nicotine, some of which are also psychoactive. A challenge to dissociating the effects of nicotine from tobacco has been administering nicotine in a way that is comparable to smoking a cigarette, since the route of administration influences the subjective effects of nicotine. E-cigarettes can deliver amounts of nicotine similar to tobacco cigarettes and allow for a matched placebo control (same flavor, device, and sensory experience) between the nicotine and the nicotine-free e-cigarette condition. The proposed research will take advantage of this novel route of administration to examine the hypothesis that alcohol and nicotine delivered through an e-cigarette have combined pharmacological effects that could support their co- use. This hypothesis will be addressed with the following two Specific Aims: (1) To determine if nicotine e- cigarettes have greater subjective rewarding effects when used in combination with alcohol, and (2) To determine if ad libitum nicotine e-cigarette use increases after drinking alcohol. The proposed research will use a three-day within-subject human laboratory study. On each test day participants will drink an alcohol or placebo-alcohol beverage. Participants will then use their own e-cigarette (with or without nicotine) in a standardized e-cigarette puffing protocol, followed by a 2-hour ad libitum e-cigarette use session. Each participant will complete three experimental conditions on three separate days: (1) nicotine e-cigarette + alcohol, (2) nicotine e-cigarette + placebo alcohol, and (3) nicotine-free e-cigarette + alcohol. Data from the standardized e-cigarette session will be used to assess the subjective and cardiovascular effects of e- cigarettes when used alone or in combination with alcohol. The ad libitum session will provide information on the use behavior and plasma nicotine levels reached when e-cigarettes are used alone versus after drinking alcohol. This work will provide important training in human pharmacology research as I transition from work in mice to humans. This research and training will create a solid foundation for me to become an independent investigator. Knowledge produced by the proposed study will have important implications for informing future regulatory actions regarding e-cigarettes and other alternative nicotine delivery devices and improve our understanding of the role of nicotine in the co-morbid use of alcohol and tobacco."
"9349103","Project summary 21st International Workshop on HIV and Hepatitis Observational Databases (IWHOD) will take place from March 30th ? April 1st, 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal. The International Workshop on HIV and Hepatitis Observational Databases (IWHOD) has been on-going annually since the mid-1990s. The objective is to bring together researchers from low, middle and high-income countries working on cohorts of patients with HIV to present, in an informal meeting format, new research, and allow open discussions on common issues of cohort methodology, techniques and analyses. One of the particularities of the Workshop is that the data presented, and scientific program, are not made public, papers presented will not yet have been presented at national or international conferences. This and its size (180-190 delegates) have led to an atmosphere of very open debate and discussion, which is particularly helpful to junior, as well as senior researchers. Attendance at the Workshop is open to all, but is contingent on submission and acceptance of abstracts. To allow for the exchange of ideas between young and more senior investigators, senior cohort representative places are also available, which are conditional on abstract submission by colleagues from the respective cohort, thus allowing the work to be presented by young researchers. These places are limited in number, and at a higher delegate fee. The program of the Workshop is based on abstract selection by an international Scientific Committee, chaired by Dr Ole Kirk. The program comprises of six 90-minute sessions, made up of 5-6 papers each, and allowing time for discussion and debate, or a plenary presentation by an expert in the relevant field. Sessions are dedicated to specialist areas including patient management, data to inform public health decisions, and methodology. The 21st IWHOD will feature two plenary talks on current research in hepatitis, and an overview on the field of health economics drawing on examples from HIV research. There will also be a plenary debate on the topic of ageing in HIV research. Poster viewing sessions are an integral part of the meeting. In addition, a number of important side meetings are encouraged, and facilitated, outside of the main program. The Workshop includes researchers from cohort studies from all regions of the globe. Travel scholarships for delegates with accepted abstracts from low and middle-income countries are offered and so are two Young Investigator Awards for early career researchers for best oral and best poster."

"9405056","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 90% of cancer related deaths occur as a result of metastasis12,17. The metastatic cascade is a complex series of events initiated by changes of the cancer cell phenotype, giving rise to invasive properties through a process known as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MET)7, 14, 15. Once metastatic cells are in the circulatory system, the cells must extavasate into distant tissues, resulting in the formation of secondary tumors. When cancer cells arrive in the new tissues, their behavior is driven in part by the non-soluble signaling of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins within the microenvironment10. Currently, no system exists that can recreate this sequence of soluble and non-soluble signaling events, slowing the development of effective therapies. Therefore, in collaboration with Dr. Joerg Lahann, I propose to develop an engineered cancer microenvironment that can be used to evaluate the effects of specific microenvironmental cues on cancer cell behavior. A 3D polymer fiber writing system has recently been developed within the Lahann lab that allows fabrication of hyper-porous polymer scaffolds with patterned fiber architectures. This system enables precise control over a range of characteristics including the scaffold physical/mechanical properties, and facilitates coating with networks of various ECM proteins (in their 3D biologically active conformations). These modular scaffolds can be seeded with a variety of cell types, enabling investigation of cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. As such, this tailorable platform technology could be designed to mimic key elements of the native cancer microenvironment. During the mentored K99 phase of this proposal, the mechanical properties and ECM composition will be tuned to mimic elements of primary and metastatic tumors. The effect that changes in the cancer microenvironment has on cancer cell proliferation, cancer stem cell distribution, and phenotype will be evaluated. Furthermore, these environments will also be used to culture primary cancer cells obtained from pleural effusions. The effect of the ECM composition on cancer stem cell distribution and senescence of primary patient samples will be evaluated. The cellular components of the cancer microenvironment and the pre-metastatic niche will also be investigated. Transitioning into independence in the R00 phase, I will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the engineered cancer microenvironments to promote secondary tumor formation. This K99/R00 award would enable the creation of a system that could recapitulate metastatic cancer cell invasion in vivo, providing a means by which the molecular and cellular basis of cancer can be better understood. If successful, this system will provide a platform technology for combinatorial drug screening and may lead to the development of personalized cancer therapies. At the University of Michigan, I have access to world-class facilities as well as an unparalleled collection of leaders in the field of cancer research. I have assembled an distinguished advisory committee to guide my research and facilitate my transition to independence.

"9205181","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in industrialized nations and its prevalence is rising rapidly in developing nations. In particular, heart failure (HF) has been singled out as an epidemic and is a staggering clinical and public health problem associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare  expenditures. Current therapies only delay morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic systolic heart failure, as disease progression typically continues unabated resulting in death. Novel therapies for heart failure are desperately needed, which will require a greater understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that underlie this disease. A universal characteristic of the failing heart is impaired Ca2+ cycling through the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the major internal store of Ca2+ in cardiomyocytes. Indeed, cardiomyocytes from failing hearts consistently show defective excitation contraction-coupling characterized by diminished SR Ca2+ sequestration and decreased intracellular Ca2+ transients, events that contribute to impaired contractility and relaxation that culminate in depressed pumping action of the heart. Ca2+ re- sequestration into the SR is mediated by a Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), whose activity is known to be reversibly regulated by the small integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Enhancing SERCA activity and function has been suggested as an important clinical approach for treating HF by loading the SR with greater Ca2+ levels to augment Ca2+ release resulting in greater myocyte contractility during systole. Apart from gene therapy to actually replace SERCA protein (which is currently in human clinical trails with an AAV vector), we currently lack a facile therapeutic approach aimed at correcting alterations in Ca2+ and SERCA function in the heart. However, modulation of SERCA activity through manipulation of PLN or small peptides like it represents a novel and straightforward therapeutic approach. Our lab has identified a novel micropeptide encoded by a muscle-specific RNA currently annotated as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which we have named DWORF (DWarf Open Reading Frame). DWORF shares strong sequence homology and predicted domain structure with the well-described SERCA inhibitors PLN and SLN and our preliminary results show it localizes to the SR and can bind directly to SERCA. We hypothesize that DWORF is functionally homologous to PLN and SLN and that it regulates SERCA activity and myocyte contractility. We will utilize biochemical, cell-based, and genetic approaches, along with in vivo physiological studies to define the function and regulation of DWORF in the heart and to examine how it might impact cardiac disease susceptibility. Collectively, our studies will provide new insights into Ca2+ cycling and regulation in the heart and potentially provide the basis for development of a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease."

The TPDEM has been continuously funded since 1982 and currently supports 6 trainees per year. The TPDEM is the only endocrine research training program in between the west-coast states of California, Oregon and Washington and the mid-western states of Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri and Texas, an area covering one third of the US land mass. The UCD has invested over 1.4 billion dollars into a new state of the art campus at Fitzsimons with an adjacent Biotechnology Research Park that will foster translation of basic research advances into clinical practice. The 41 members of the Training Faculty include senior, mid-career and junior investigators many of whom are nationally recognized leaders in their fields of study. In the last 15 years this training grant has supported 55 trainees. From this grou 32 are in academic medicine, 7 remain in training, 14 have gone into private practice, 1 went to law school, and 1 went into biotechnology. From this group, a total of 25 have received extramural support including NIH, NCI, VA, ACS, and ADA grants. Excluding current trainees, 67% have remained in academics and 29% have gone into private practice of medicine. Thus, the overall goal of this training program to prepare trainees for careers in academic medicine is being achieved. The goal of recruiting, fostering and developing academic endocrinologists through this program is completely dependent on this NIH T32 training grant. We hope that the reviewers agree that the TPDEM offers an outstanding training environment with ongoing access to outstanding trainee candidates, a diverse and experienced group of mentors doing exciting research in a broad range of disciplines within endocrinology and an excellent track record in trainees entering academic medicine. We therefore request continued support of the TPDEM at UCDSOM."
"9413636","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for human organs far outstrips the supply. One potential transformative solution is to humanize the immune repertoire of pig organs in order to limit patient rejection of xenotransplanted organs. Whole genes and pathways can in principle be put into pig cells using a large artificial chromosome, which the Boeke lab refers to as synthetic Pig Artificial Chromosomes (sPACs). Current versions of these mammalian artificial chromosomes have limitations. The lab will address these issues by completely redesigning the sPACs from the `bottom up' in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These yeast-based sPACs could be readily reprogrammed with patient data and quickly uploaded into pig cells. In order to achieve this `plug and play' capability, the primary goal of this postdoctoral proposal is to humanize the chromatin of S. cerevisiae, thus ensuring the generation of mammalian-like chromosome structure. The proposal will focus on three specific aims: 1) humanize the histones of yeast; 2) build in H3K27 methylation; and 3) build in H3K9 methylation. In addition, the proposal will permit the study of the de novo establishment of mammalian chromatin in a cell. This will lead to fundamental insight into methylation establishment, maintenance, and mechanisms of perturbation, information relevant to human gene expression. This proposal will achieve two innovative and complementary goals by building human chromatin into yeast: study the mechanisms of chromatin establishment in a cellular 'blank slate', and generate a cell capable of making pig artificial chromosomes designed to facilitate organ xenotransplantation. The long-term goal is to provide an unlimited method of generating humanized pig organs for organ transplantation, thus advancing the treatment of human disease."
"9422655","PROJECT SUMMARY Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the most prevalent myopathy afflicting males and females, children and adults. In the majority of clinical FSHD cases, muscle weakness is not noticeable until the second or third decade of life followed by a progressive pathology impacting many facets of everyday life, ranging from being unable to comb ones own hair or walk the dog to including having to change or abandon careers, loss of independence and, in ~20% of FSHD patients, becoming wheelchair bound an/or require aid in breathing. Currently there are no treatments to slow down, stop, or reverse disease progression. A major impediment to developing ameliorative treatments is the lack of a reliable phenotypic FSHD-like animal model based on expression of the DUX4 gene, widely considered the key mediator of FSHD pathophysiology. This project directly addresses this void. In FSHD, increased expression of DUX4-fl, which can function as a DNA-binding transcription factor, alters the gene expression profiles of muscles and initiates a cascade of events ultimately leading to FSHD pathophysiology. Thus, the DUX4-fl mRNA, DUX4- FL protein and downstream targets are all excellent targets for therapeutic development. For this project, we have successfully engineered a line of transgenic mice that contains the human DUX4- fl gene maintaining its native gene structure. These mice are validated to express correctly spliced DUX4-fl mRNA upon Cre-mediated recombination and develop an aberrant muscle phenotype when DUX4-fl is expressed in developing muscle. This data strongly supports the ultimate generation of an FSHD-like model mouse; however, the precise expression conditions that will result in a useful FSHD-like phenotype are still not known. Here, we will use a commercially available line of mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre in skeletal muscles to determine the conditions required to generate reproducible FSHD-like phenotypes over a range of severities. A successful FSHD-like mouse will appear initially healthy, then develop a progressive myopathic phenotype based on quantifiable metrics of muscle strength and function including grip strength, rotarod, and the maximum distance each is capable of running before becoming exhausted. The phenotypes will be confirmed by FSHD-like gene expression analysis and histopathology. Completion of this project will provide the FSHD field with valuable tools for better understanding FSHD pathogenic progression and mechanisms. In addition, these models will serve as a resource for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic strategies targeting the DUX4-fl mRNA and protein as ameliorative treatments for FSHD."

"9255777","Project Summary Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness among elderly people in the United States. Standard methods of diagnosis and progression tracking are fundus camera imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Using these modalities, the anatomical changes of the retina during the onset of AMD have been widely studied. However, during the early stages of the disease, it is difficult to detect subtle anatomical differences with high accuracy, leading to prolonged diagnosis and disease management. It has been recently understood that there is a correlation between the mechanical properties of the retinal tissues and the early on-set of AMD, which can aid in the diagnosis of early stage diseases. However, the retina, which is a thin membrane at the very back of the eye, is often inaccessible to mechanical testing methods and most functional imaging methods do not meet the requirements for high resolution. Therefore, there is a strong need for a minimally invasive, high resolution, and safe imaging technology that is able to diagnose and track the disease during its first stages so that early management is possible. Acoustic radiation force optical coherence elastography (ARF-OCE) is an ideal candidate for retinal imaging because of its high-resolution, high speed, and high sensitivity to both axial and lateral mechanical contrast. It uses an ultrasound transducer to generate acoustic force on the sample, which causes vibrations that are detected by OCT. This technique has been shown to work well in ex- vivo cornea and retina studies. However, in order to translate this idea to in-vivo animal studies, and eventually to clinical trials, it is necessary to address a few limitations of the current system: low sub- millimeter imaging region, instability of moving parts causing slow imaging speed, and complexity of image reconstruction. To overcome these limitations, the primary goal of this proposal is to develop an ocular elastography system using 2 unfocused moduluated ultrasound transducers. The proposed set-up will be able to obtain 3-D elastograms of a 1 cm2 region of the retina in less than 5 seconds, and requires no moving stages and image fusion. The transducer force region will be characterized using a hydrophone and through phantom studies. The elasticity of the retinal layers will be quantified by correlating the results from a frequency sweep to the resonance frequency of the sample, which has been proven to be related to the Young?s modulus. Finally, rabbit AMD models will be used to perform in-vivo experiments and track the onset of AMD over a 12-week period. The imaging results will be compared to histology. The proposed system will have high-resolution, fast imaging speeds, and fast image analysis, and offer physicians more information about the onset and progression of AMD in order to obtain a more accurate understanding of the disease. This new technology is expected to have a significant impact to early diagnosis and management of AMD."
"9331994","Natural killer (NK) cells are essential immune effector cells due to their intrinsic capacity to detect and destroy virus-infected and malignant target cells. In control of this essential function is an array of highly polymorphic cell surface receptors that regulate NK cell effector functionality. Human genetics studies have shown that certain combined gene sets for killer immunoglobulin-related receptor (KIR) NK-cell receptors and their HLA class I ligands affect clinical outcomes in autoimmunity, infection, transplantation and pregnancy syndromes. However, the molecular and cellular bases of these effects are not understood. Our prior mouse genetics studies have also found that significant genetic interaction between gene sets for NK receptors and MHC class I ligands controls NK cell features, and possibly their capacity to mediate critical antiviral functions and protection from immune- or virus-mediated tissue damage and disease. A MHC-linked quantitative trait locus (QTL), Cmv5, that specifically regulates NK cells, secondary lymphoid organ (SLO) structures, and tissue necrosis in spleen after viral infection was also recently discovered. However, it is not known how Cmv5 traits are regulated, how distinct alleles affect histopathological outcomes, or if genetic control manifests through hematopoietic cells, non-hematopoietic cells, or both. We hypothesize that Cmv5 regulation of NK cells and lymphoid architecture during acute virus infection can profoundly impact the tempo/extent of viral clearance and tissue inflammation. Likewise, Cmv5 may affect priming of adaptive immunity, memory formation and ultimate disease outcomes. The broad long-term objectives of this research proposal, therefore, center on identifying and fully characterizing MHC I Dk, NKC and Cmv5 genetic modifiers to elucidate how genetic variation controls NK cells, SLO structures and tissue necrosis in infected tissues following acute viral infection. To achieve the objectives, Aim 1 investigates molecular and cellular bases of Cmv5s suppression of NK expansion and SLO structure protection during inflammation and pathogen infection. Classical genetics and genetic screens will be applied to precisely map a Cmv5 critical interval. Exome sequence variant analyses, and chromosome editing strategies will be applied to further minimize the interval by constructing Cmv5 interval/candidate sequence deletions and testing for loss of suppression mutations in experimental cross mice. Aim 2 explores the NKC effect on Cmv5 regulation of NK expansion and SLO protection in MCMV- infected spleen. We hypothesize that strain-specific regulation of Cmv5 effects is controlled at the level of NK cell effector functionality, and reactivity to viral infection. NKC variation, resulting in NK receptor diversity, will be carefully assessed for its effect on Cmv5 regulation of NK cells, SLO structural integrity and tissue necrosis during viral infection in congenic, transplanted and NK receptor gene-edited mouse strains. Our studies should ascertain how NKC and MHC genetic interaction specifically shapes NK cells, additional critical immune cells, and inflammatory responses, which may help to model combined KIR/HLA associations with clinical response. ! ! !"
"9229577","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The grant, Genetic Analysis of the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder, is continuation of a long-standing collaborative effort funded in response to an RFA for sample collections in bipolar disorder. We are thus submitting the current new application from the original group of investigators to continue the collaboration and proceed to its next logical step  analyses of data being generated. We developed the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder in response to a NIMH FOA MH08-130. Under the auspices of R01MH085542 (Smoller/Sklar, PIs) and philanthropic funding we implemented a phenotypically robust, rapid, and cost effective method for sample collection. During the five years of the grant we have banked DNA from ~18,000 cases and 16,000 controls never previously used for genomic study of bipolar disorder (BD). We propose here enhanced aims in a unique sample to increase our knowledge of BD and to keep this highly productive team intact. The samples studied here will more than double the available samples for GWAS, and will be among the first to analyze rare variants using exome chip and exome sequencing. These analyses will provide substantially enhanced power for detection of networks and loci that confer BD risk. In Aim 1 we will perform a genomic characterization of an independent cohort of 15,800 cases and 18,598 controls to identify high confidence genetic loci for risk of BD through association study of common single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variants, and rare single nucleotide variants. We will further use the data to explore genetic prediction models for BD for two specific clinical scenarios. In Aim 2 we will apply these data to characterize the spectrum of genotype-phenotype relationships by examining phenotypic subgroups, cross- disorder relationships, quantitative personality dimensions, and neurocognition. Our goal is to learn more about the genetics of BD and how genes might act to alter disease risk. We propose to do this using the largest and most comprehensively studied sample collection in the field that includes both genetic and phenotypic risk factors."
"9420917","Project Summary Continued training in The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Infectious Diseases (MCBID) is proposed for 8 PhD students and 3 postdoctoral fellows selected from large pools of highly qualified applicants. The training program is uniquely situated in the Molecular Microbiology and Immunology (MMI) Department within the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The 29 training faculty have a wide range of experience and expertise in viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites causing human disease and in the vectors associated with emergence and transmission of these pathogens. The training program has been funded since 1994 and has produced scientists working in many areas of academia, industry and government on problems related to infectious diseases, vaccine development and the public's health. The goal of the MCBID training program is to provide students with both a firm foundation in the basic disciplines necessary for the study of infectious diseases and a perspective that will enable them to apply their knowledge creatively to public health problems. Each student is expected to complete 1) a series of required courses in the basic disciplines of cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, and immunology, 2) courses in virology, bacteriology, parasitology and vector biology, 3) courses in research ethics, epidemiology and public health perspectives, and 4) elective courses relevant to thesis topic and long-term career goals. Elective courses are chosen from among courses available in MMI, other departments in the School of Public Health and other Divisions of the University. Students will also complete 3 laboratory rotations during the first year with an option for a fourth rotation. Student progress is monitored by the Graduate Program Committee and the Thesis Advisory Committee with attention to an individual development plan. The goals of the postdoctoral training program are: 1) to provide focused training in those areas of the molecular and cellular basis of infectious diseases in which program faculty have special expertise; 2) to provide an opportunity for doctoral degree holders trained in more traditional environments to broaden their exposure to problems of public health importance and to evaluate their career goals in terms of public health issues; and 3) to prepare the postdoctoral fellow for an independent career in the biological sciences."
"9096029","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Met and Ron are two related receptor-tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. Although the function of Met in cancer has been studied for more than twenty years, culminating in development of targeted therapies now in clinical trials, Ron has more recently emerged as a major player in cancer, where its expression usually correlates with more aggressive disease and poor outcomes. Our work has revealed that an alternatively transcribed, N-terminally truncated form of Ron, called 'short-form' or sfRon, is the major active Ron isoform in breast tumors from patients, and that it plays a significant role in the aggressiveness of tumors. sfRon expression is sufficient to convert slow growing, non-metastatic tumors into fast growing tumors that spontaneously metastasized from the mammary gland to liver and bones. Mechanistic studies revealed an interaction between sfRon and PI3K that was required for sfRon function. Blocking the ability of sfRon to interact with PI3K thoroughly abrogated the ability of sfRon to confer aggressive tumor behavior and completely blocked metastasis. In contrast, full length Ron appears to promote metastasis through activation of multiple signaling pathways. We hypothesize that deregulated production of sfRon protein in breast tumors promotes metastasis through selective activation of PI3K signaling, a function that is distinct from Ron activity. Furthermore, we hypothesize that inhibition of Ron and sfRon kinase activity will be a valid approach to reduce or block tumor progression and/or metastasis. We have devised three specific aims to test our hypothesis. First, we will determine if sfRon mRNA or protein is selectively stabilized in tumors by elucidating how sfRon is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, and whether ubiquitylation of sfRon plays a role in its function. Second, we will determine if Ron and sfRon promote metastasis through different pathways, by examining the signaling partners of each protein in breast cancer cells and whether Ron and sfRon interfere with the others' signaling. Third, we will determine whether Ron and/or PI3K inhibitors prevent tumor growth/metastasis by testing new compounds in both cell line xenograft models and in our new patient-derived tumorgraft models."
"9141182","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory illness with a high fatality rate among reported cases. MERS was first reported in 2012, but the virus has been circulating in camels, which are thought to be an animal reservoir, for at least 20 years. To date over 1000 MERS cases have been reported to the World Health Organization, including over 400 deaths. While most cases have been in Saudi Arabia and contact with camels or camel products has been implicated in some cases, human-to-human transmission has been documented as well and the virus is thought to have epidemic potential. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics for MERS.  The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein mediates viral entry into host cells expressing the viral receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Within the S1 subunit, a Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of about 200 amino acids has been identified. Immunization of mice with a recombinant fusion protein containing S377-588 fused to human IgG1 Fc (S377-588-Fc) induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals. Unfortunately, expression of S377-588-Fc (or RBD-Fc) in mammalian cell culture is low, which may be an impediment for further development of this promising candidate vaccine.  We will circumvent the production problem by producing MERS-CoV RBD-Fc, and modifications thereof, using a well-established plant-expression system. Our scalable transient plant-expression system allows rapid production of recombinant protein (within a week); with protein production costs less than 10% that of mammalian cell systems. We will produce variants of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc with enhanced binding to the mouse neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), in order to test the hypothesis that improved antigen presentation via FcRn will result in an enhanced immune response.  We will evaluate the immunogenicity of mucosally-administered MERS-CoV RBD-Fc in mice, by analyzing both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We will evaluate titers of RBD-specific antibodies, analyze T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis, and will measure the ability of sera from immunized mice to neutralize live MERS-CoV in vitro."

"9261113","7. Project Summary This is a proposal for a fourth renewal of travel grant R13AA017107. For the last nine years, this grant has provided funding to support scientific dissemination and early career investigator (ECI) career development at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association (APA). Psychologists make up a major constituency in the scientific community of alcohol researchers and on topics related to alcohol. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists and their trainees in the US, and its annual convention attracts thousands of attendees. In particular, APA Division 50 (Society for Addiction Psychology) and Division 28 (Psychopharmacology and Substance Abuse) are heavily populated with alcohol researchers, with further alcohol researchers in Divisions 38 (Health Psychology) and 5 (Quantitative and Qualitative Methods), many of whom are recipients of NIAAA funding. This R13 grant represents a collaboration between Division 50 (primary) and Divisions 28, 38, and 5 (partnering divisions) to achieve two goals: (1) to disseminate the state- of-the-art alcohol research to the psychological community; (2) to foster the development of the next generation of alcohol researchers from the psychological community. The first goal will be achieved by supporting state-of-the-art alcohol research within the Division 50, 28, 38 and 5 conference programs. This will take the form of travel support for speakers in two symposia that showcase advances and innovations in alcohol research. In addition, these symposia and other alcohol research will be communicated to conference attendees via an Alcohol Research Highlights brochure. The second goal will be achieved by providing 20 travel awards to ECIs (i.e., graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) and hosting an ECI poster session/social hour. In addition, the R13 will support a career development symposium each year. For both, the dissemination goal and the career development goal, the R13 will reach out to women and underrepresented minorities to maximize inclusion. To date, this R13 grant has been highly successful in disseminating advances in alcohol research and nurturing the careers of early career alcohol researchers. The goal for the next segment is to sustain these contributions to the field."

These include: (1) HIV prevention and eradication; (2) drug abuse, neurocognitive dysfunction and aging; (3) vaccines and (4) HIV-TB co-infection. Over the next 5 years, we will (i) Recruit highly qualified pre- and post-doctoral trainees into the program (where the pre-doctoral trainees will include both PhD and MD/PhD trainees and the post-doctoral trainees will include both PhD and MD trainees); (ii) Provide opportunities for training by outstanding basic and translational HIV/AIDS researchers at Einstein using modern, cutting edge research facilities; (iii) Provide monitoring and advice by internal and external senior HIV/AIDS scientists; (iv) Provide a platform of regular work-in-progress meetings attended by a community of translational HIV/AIDS mentors, all current and previous T32-supported trainees and other trainees of the participating trainers on a regular basis and (v) provide opportunities for career guidance for both traditional research careers (including grantsmanship mentoring) and non-traditional careers. The 15 faculty trainers on this training grant each work on national priority areas of HIV/AIDS research, engage in highly collaborative interdisciplinary research, are all funded (bringing in >18 million dollars of federal funds to Einstein) and participate in a unique training program that collaborates with the Einstein-Montefiore Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), the Bronx chapter of Women's Inter-agency HIV Study (WIHS) and the Einstein Global Health Center (GHC) to maximize opportunities for our trainees. The presence of such large centers and programs, existence of several program projects focused on the development of microbicides or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) products for HIV as well as on developing vaccines for HIV, HSV and TB and the superb research facilities, together create an exciting environment for research training in HIV/AIDS at Einstein. This training program, as detailed in this application, plays a catalytic role to seamlessly bring together multiple opportunities for trainees in the context of our training program. This training program thus provides a comprehensive and coordinated platform for training of pre- and post-doctoral trainees in translational AIDS research at Einstein."
"9234913","Treatment for advanced prostate cancer involves the reduction of the patients' levels of testosterone (androgen) by surgical and pharmacological castration. Unfortunately, this form of therapy is not curative and eventually the disease will return in a castration resistant form. Once the disease is castration resistant, the survival time is approximately two years before the patient will succumb to his disease. To develop new therapies, a target must be known. Our laboratory identified the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor as a novel therapeutic target for drug development. This target is supported by data showing that targeting this domain of the receptor blocks tumor growth and progression in vivo. We have identified EPI and sintokamide as first in class of antagonists to androgen receptor N-terminal domain. These compounds were both specific and bind to the N-terminal domain of androgen receptor. However, they appear to have different mechanisms of action. Now we draw on this progress and in Aim 1 we propose to characterize the mechanism of sintokamide that causes inhibition of androgen receptor activity. Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanisms of androgen-repressed genes to yield clues about potential acquired resistance, possible combination therapies, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Aim 3 will elucidate binding characteristics. Aim 4 will test combinations of compounds versus monotherapies in vivo using human prostate cancer xenografts. These novel inhibitors to the androgen receptor N-terminal domain are the only ones available for an N- terminal domain of any steroid hormone receptor and represent a new class of androgen receptor antagonists. All data generated will be novel and provide new insight into potential mechanisms of resistance, drug development, and reveal possible pharmacodynamic markers."
"9434178","PROJECT SUMMARY The ability of cells to self-assemble into organs is extraordinary and requires tight coordination between the cell machinery modulating adhesion and the cytoskeleton. Defects in this coordination contribute to diseases ranging from developmental defects to cancer; thus it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which coordination of cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton is achieved. One regulator of this process is Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl), which links receptors, small adaptor proteins, and cytoskeletal regulators. Abl kinases are key oncogenes and developmental regulators. Three models for Abl function currently exist: 1) Abl phosphorylates protein targets, thus altering their function and influencing cell behavior, 2) Abl directly modulates cytoskeletal dynamics through its conserved C-terminal actin binding domain (FABD), and 3) Abl acts as a scaffold to assemble multi-protein signaling complexes. However, the importance of each role during morphogenesis remains untested. To distinguish between these models, we tested mutant Abl proteins lacking kinase activity, F-actin binding, or motifs involved in protein interactions. Our preliminary data reveal that different mutants differentially affect distinct morphogenetic events from dorsal closure to apical constriction to CNS axon outgrowth. Strikingly, while kinase activity is required for full Abl activity, mutants lacking kinase activity or the FABD retain significant function during morphogenesis. Instead, a conserved PXXP motif within the linker region is more essential for Abl function during some aspects of morphogenesis than both kinase activity and the FABD. We also have identified candidate partners for the PXXP motif and found they affect processes similar to those affected by Abl. Thus, we hypothesize Abl functions as a robust regulatory machine during morphogenesis, with different aspects of its mechanisms of action (e.g., kinase activity, FABD domain, PXXP binding partners, etc.) being differentially important for certain biological processes. We will test this via the following specific aims: (1) Determine how specific functional domains of Abl differentially contribute to its function during morphogenesis using Drosophila dorsal closure (DC) as a model; (2) Determine how PXXP- binding partners work with Abl to regulate dynamic cell behaviors during DC. Specifically, we will use a combination of biochemical, genetic, and quantitative cell biological approaches to define how Abl's different mechanisms of action contribute to its ability to shape cell dynamics, organize functional linkages between the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesions, and to shape regulatory interactions between multiple downstream actin regulators, including Ena, Dia, and Abi. In parallel, we will determine how Abl and its PXXP-binding partners (Abi or Crk) regulate dynamic cell behaviors during embryonic morphogenesis. This study will reveal how Abl and its interacting partners regulate cell adhesion and actin dynamics in a developmental context, providing new clues as to how Abl works to regulate dynamic cell behaviors during human development and disease."
"9386309","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity has increased in the United States and internationally, which sets up young people for a lifetime of devastating and costly health problems. The neural networks that regulate metabolic homeostasis must develop appropriately in order to function properly in adulthood. Neural circuits that develop under abnormal environmental conditions can become disrupted and no longer function normally, which can lead to obesity and associated negative health consequences. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the hindbrain receives and integrates visceral nutritional status, and primarily sends this information to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalmus (PVH), which coordinates energy balance and neuroendocrine responses. Leptin receptors (LepRb) in NTS neurons have been shown to impact food intake and metabolic rate. In addition to leptin's role in satiety signaling, it also functions as a neurotrophic factor in development. Leptin is required for normal  axon outgrowth from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to the PVH. Because leptin receptors are expressed by neurons in the NTS during development (including a large proportion of GLP-1 neurons), leptin may direct formation of this pathway. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 1 will test whether leptin is required for normal development of neural projections from GLP-1 neurons in the NTS to the PVH. Genetically targeted axonal labels and immunohistochemistry will be used to visualize and quantify GLP-1 neurons in the NTS and their projections in leptin-deficient Lepob/ob mice in development and adulthood. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 2 will utilize a molecular genetic approach to establish the site of action for leptin's neurotrophic action on NTS GLP-1 neurons and characterize the physiological role of this pathway. Together these studies promise to establish the GLP-1 projection pathway from the NTS to the PVH as a developmentally programmable substrate that determines significant aspects of metabolic physiology."
"9243735","ABSTRACT  The goals of this Coordinating Center include facilitating information exchange among investigators in the NCI Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Consortium, supporting data integration and data analysis, and serving as a central resource for characterization and distribution of model systems. The leadership of this Center consists of a trio of investigators with deep and long-standing research programs focused on SCLC, with complementary strengths and experience. Charles Rudin, an experienced laboratory and clinical researcher focused on SCLC, who has directed two of the largest lung cancer research programs in the country over the past 13 years, serves as the overall PI of the Center, providing administrative leadership and coordination. John Minna and Tyler Jacks serve as co-leaders of the Center. Dr. Minna has consistently and repeatedly led discovery efforts defining SCLC biology over several decades, and together with his collaborators established nearly all of the SCLC cell lines that have served as the basis for SCLC preclinical research. Dr. Jacks has extensive experience in the development and characterization of innovative genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC and over the past decades has served as the primary mentor of many of the active investigators around the world working on mouse models of SCLC. We bring together additional key investigators and unqiue resources that we believe substantially add to the strengths of the Center. Yu Shir at Vanderbilt has established and directs HIPAA-compliant databases used by several multi- investigator consortia. Nikolaus Schultz?s team developed the cBioPortal and continues to expand and improve this leading platform for analysis and integration of complex ?omic level data, supporting many multi- investigator consortia worldwide. Adi Gazdar oversees the cell line resource at UT Southwestern, and will support distribution of these lines to U01 SCLC investigators. Anna Farago and Jeff Engelman at MGH, together with John Poirier and Dr. Rudin at MSK, have established substantial resources of SCLC patient- derived xenografts (PDX) and circulating tumor cell-derived xenografts (CDX) models, which are available for distribution among consortium members. Scott Lowe and Andrea Ventura offer highly innovative genetically engineered mouse modeling by CRISPR/Cas9 modulation of embryonic stem cells to rapidly assess genetic contributors to SCLC biology. Afshin Dowlati at Case Western will contribute a large collection of clinically annotated SCLC tissue microarrays representing chemosensitive as well as primary and secondary chemoresistant disease. Together we represent an exceptional team, led by three of the most widely recognized and established investigators in SCLC discovery research, with complementary strengths in therapeutic translation, basic biology, and animal modeling. By providing the resources above, and by coordinating frequent data-sharing opportunities and leading annual face-to-face meetings among SCLC investigators, we believe this Center can substantially accellerate progress against this deadly disease."
"9259035","ABSTRACT The American Cancer Society reports that this year more Americans will die of lung cancer than from any other type of cancer. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) makes up 85% of lung cancer cases, consisting of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD), squamous cell, and large cell carcinomas. LUAD is the most common subtype of NSCLC. The five-year survival rate for NSCLC is less than fifteen percent. Late-stage diagnosis and high frequency of cancer metastasis are directly linked to the poor clinical prognosis for NSCLC. Thus, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the cellular processes that govern NSCLC development and metastasis to improve therapeutic intervention. Although LUAD are typically polygenic, it is recognized that the TP53 tumor suppressor and KRAS proto-oncogene are among the most frequently mutated genes. Despite this understanding, the critical gene targets that become misregulated following alterations in p53 and KRAS remain poorly understood. In this proposal we provide evidence that the KLF6 transcription factor is elevated in LUAD tumors caring mutations in gene encoding p53 (TP53) and KRAS. Elevated KLF6 correlates with poor clinical 5-year survival rates in LUAD. Importantly, our preliminary studies indicate that KLF6 is required to promote cell proliferation in LUAD cells lacking functional p53. Based on our results, we hypothesize that elevated levels of KLF6 are critical to promote cell-cycle progression in LUAD. Experiments in Aim 1 will determine whether human LUAD tumors carrying driver-mutations in TRP53 and KRAS concomitantly overexpress KLF6, and will identify KLF-regulated genes responsible for inappropriate cell proliferation. Aim 2 will determine whether KLF6 is required for tumorigenic properties of LUAD and will utilizes KRASLSL-G12D x TP53 conditional mice to examine whether KLF6 expression is critical for lung cancer development. Experiments outlined in this proposal will determine whether KLF6 functions as a growth-promoting oncoprotein by directly testing the hypothesis that KLF6-dependent gene products are required for inappropriate proliferation in the development and progression of lung cancer."
"9259561","Project summary Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane which provides nutrients and added protection for the cell. Additionally, the outer membrane contains proteins that enable pathogenic bacteria to evade host immune responses and cause a number of serious infectious diseases. Despite the importance of these outer membrane proteins (OMPs) for cell survival and virulence, little is known about how these proteins are folded and inserted into the outer membrane. In E. coli, a 200 kDa five component complex called the BAM complex mediates the biogenesis of these membrane proteins and it is my goal is to use functional assays and structural biology techniques (X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy) to characterize the role that each component of the BAM complex serves and how substrate OMPs are recognized. These studies will assist in revealing the mechanism for the biogenesis of OMPs in Gram-negative bacteria and will offer clues to the biogenesis of OMPs in eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts."
"9240925","Project Summary/Abstract In the initial 5 years of INIA-Neuroimmune funding, we developed a novel assay for binge-like drinking, where mice are offered limited access to 20% ethanol (EtOH) in water early during their circadian dark period. The Drinking in the Dark (DID) assay has been widely adopted and used to probe mechanisms of binge-like drinking. During the ensuing 10 years, we selectively bred two lines of mice for High Drinking in the Dark (HDID-1 and HDID-2), by mating individuals reaching the highest blood alcohol levels (BALs) after a second daily DID session. HDID mice achieve BALs between 170 and 150 mg% after 32 (HDID-1) and 25 (HDID-2) selected generations, respectively. Binge-like drinking is a strong predictor of alcohol use disorder diagnosis and has deleterious health consequences. These models represent genetic risk for high binge drinking. Binge- like drinking has to date been used only infrequently to screen candidate drugs. Recent studies suggest that HDID mice respond to treatment with some, but not all drugs known to reduce drinking (e.g., acamprosate but not naltrexone). Because HDID mice appear to represent a selective model for screening, we propose to use them to nominate and then test INIA-N targets. In Specific Aim 1, we will collaborate with INIA-N PIs Drs. Mayfield, Ponomarev, and Farris to test novel neuroimmune-related targets suggested by their bioinformatics analyses and rigorously test their efficacy in HDID mice. The Mayfield group will compare expression profiles between HDID mice and their non-selected HS/Npt control line with data from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), which comprises gene expression response profiles to >1000 perturbagens in multiple cell lines, including responses to many FDA-approved compounds. We hypothesize that comparing the HDID vs HS gene expression differences with perturbagen-generated difference in LINCS and seeking novel drugs that normalize HDID expression differences from HS will successfully predict drug efficacy to reduce binge-like drinking. Preliminary testing has been carried out successfully for two targets (phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor). For drugs passing these screens, our Specific Aim 2 will extend our efficacy tests of successful drugs to reduction of stress-induced escalations of post-dependence drinking. Through this collaborative Specific Aim with INIA-Stress PIs Drs. Becker and Lopez, we will test the reproducibility and generalization of drug effects in another drinking model, genotype and laboratory. In Specific Aim 3, we will identify the brain localization of novel drug effects and determine their cell type specificity using viral mediated RNAi in collaboration with INIA-N PI Dr. Lasek. We predict that some neuroimmune targets will show neuronal specificity while others will selectively target glial cells. Aim 3 will also measure the drug's physiological effects through collaborations with INIA-PIs Drs. Roberto and Morrisett, who will test specific hypotheses about neuronal excitability. We will continue to provide data to Dr. Mayfield's group, and animals to INIA-N PIs Drs. Hitzemann/Iancu, and other laboratories for functional studies."
"9407914","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progression to fibrosis after acute kidney injury (AKI) may result from maladaptive repair processes and can potentiate kidney dysfunction. The endothelium is the keystone of vascular homeostasis, and vascular insufficiency after AKI may result in a vicious cycle of tissue ischemia, tubulointerstitial damage and activation, and progressive fibrosis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1), a G-protein coupled receptor, maintains endothelial barrier integrity and function. The purpose of this project is to determine i S1P1 is necessary for endothelial function and recovery from AKI in prevention of fibrosis. In Specific Aim 1, our preliminary work using a Cre-loxP system to induce deletion of S1P1 in endothelial cells after AKI demonstrates that S1P1 is necessary for recovery of kidney function and prevents early onset fibrosis. We propose to clearly define the contribution of S1P1 in endothelial cells to recovery of vascular function after AKI. In Specific Aim 2, we propose that S1P1 protects kidney endothelial function and prevents a pro-fibrotic response by pericytes. We will manipulate S1P1 expression in endothelial cells in vitro to determine cellular mechanisms underlying its protective role in endothelial cells and their interaction with pericytes. The significance of this research is that it will provide the basis for using pharmacological activatio of endothelial S1P1 as a novel therapeutic strategy for preserving endothelial function during a critical period of recovery after AKI to prevent fibrosis."
"9403710","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of novel routes to stereochemically and structurally complex targets of biological interest remains of paramount importance. New strategies, bond disconnections, and catalysts that exploit standard functional groups in innovative ways each contribute to the overall goal of increased scope and efficiency, and decreased time and cost. Catalysis, the use of substoichiometric amounts of reagent, without the need for covalent attachment or pretreatment, carries with it the promise of greener, more efficient, more selective methods for synthesis. This proposal seeks to develop novel methods to use traditional functional groups in non-traditional ways, accessing hitherto unavailable bond disconnection strategies in an effort to greatly expand our toolkit. In the context of this researc, we will apply these strategies to the formation of lactams, common structural features across many families of biologically active molecules. The specific goals of this research are as follows: 1) Develop general catalysts for the asymmetric intermolecular Stetter reaction; 2) Explore couplings of imminiums and enals via the homoenolate reactivity pathway; 3) Investigate oxidative pathways of enal activation; 4) Control oxidatively initiated [3+2]-type annulation of enals leading to cyclopentanone products. The long-term impact of this science is to enable chemists to rapidly assemble complex structures with high efficiency."

"9206064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The causes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are unknown, however, the pathogenesis is attributed, at least in part, to T-cell dysfunction. Preliminary studies reveal activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in lupus T cells which precedes disease flares and causes pro-inflammatory lineage specification in SLE patients. Upstream of mTORC1, depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), enhanced production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), and defective mitophagy are newly identified. Outcomes of a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial show that therapeutic reversal of GSH depletion by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocks mTORC1 in vivo. Therefore, the proposed studies will address a critical knowledge gap by determining how metabolic pathways that control oxidative stress and normal T-cell development contribute to lupus pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that primarily GSH depletion drives the pathogenesis of SLE through mTORC1-dependent expansion of pro-inflammatory T cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that, after elucidating the genetically controlled metabolic pathways that promote GSH depletion and mTORC1 activation and thus trigger lupus pathogenesis, new and potentially synergistic approaches can be used for prevention and treatment of SLE. Guided by compelling preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1) to delineate the metabolic program that causes the accumulation of oxidative stress-generating mitochondria in lupus T cells; 2) to identify the role of GSH depletion in mTORC1-dependent T-cell lineage specification in longitudinal studies of SLE patients; and 3) to determine the role of GSH depletion in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice. Under Aim 1, S-nitrosylation of ND3 subunit in complex I of the electron transport chain and lupus-linked mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms in ND2 and ATP6 will be assessed as causes of increased ROI production. Under Aim 2, GSH depletion and mTORC1 activation will be genetically targeted in vitro for reversing pro-inflammatory T-cell development focusing on CREM-a/IL-4-mediated trans-differentiation of CD8 T cells to DN T cells and HIF1a/IL-17-mediated depletion of Tregs in SLE patients. Under Aim 3, GSH depletion will be modeled by the inactivation of transaldolase and evaluated as a cause of disease pathogenesis in lupus-prone mice. The proposed research is significant because it will advance our understanding of T-cell lineage development in normal and autoimmune conditions with relevance for identifying new treatment targets in SLE. The approach is innovative as it departs from the status quo by utilizing metabolic pathway genes to regulate T-cell development. The results will open new horizons in our understanding of the metabolic pathways that control oxidative stress and its role in disease pathogenesis while providing new mechanistic targets for treatment of SLE."

"9386279","Project Summary (30 lines) Diabetes mellitus is characterized by glucose imbalance due to a loss and/or dysfunction of pancreatic islet cells. With the goal of retaining or restoring islet cell function, many groups have determined the roles of transcription factors in ? and ? cell development and activity. The Stein lab and others identified and characterized the transcription factors MafA and MafB, which recognize and bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers. In rodents, MafB is expressed in immature ? and ? cells but only in mature ? cells, and functions in islets primarily during development, while MafA expression is exclusive to insulin+ cells and is required for adult ? cell activity. In humans, MAFB is also expressed prior to MAFA; however, its expression is maintained in ? and ? cells, an important distinction from mouse. Furthermore, both MAFA and MAFB expression are lost in diabetic islets; however, little is known about the regulation of ? and ? cell gene expression by MAFB2 and MAFA/B in humans. In addition, few trans-acting coregulators, which positively or negatively impact the transcriptional state of DNA, have been identified for islet cell transcription factors. The human ? cell line, EndoC?H2, emulates human ? cell development by expressing MAFB prior to Cre recombinase mediated excision of the immortalization factors hTERT and SV40 Tag. Following Cre mediated excision, MAFA levels are elevated parallel to the induction of mature ? cell-like properties such as increased Insulin expression and secretion. Of note, the significant increase in transcription factor expression is specific to MAFA indicating that MAFA may drive ? cell maturation. In Aim 1 I will use siRNA knockdown of MAFA or MAFB and RNA-Seq to define the regulatory roles of MAFB2 in immature ? cells and the heterodimeric MAFA/MAFB activator in adult. Lentivirus will also be used to deliver siRNA against MAFB or MAFA in human islets followed by qRT-PCR to confirm gene expression changes determined in EndoC?H2 or EndoC?H2-Cre cells by RNA-Seq. In addition, ChIP-Seq will determine direct targets of MAFB2 and MAFA/MAFB in proliferating and non-proliferating EndoC?H2 cells. Because transcription factors do not regulate gene expression alone, I will identify coregulators of MAFB2 and MAFA/B using a combined immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry technique. Coregulator interactions will be confirmed in EndoC?H2 cells with multiple approaches, and assayed in healthy and diabetic islets using a single cell based method. I hypothesize that differences in gene regulation and glucose responsiveness due to a unique set of coregulators recruited in the context of immature (MAFB2-containing) versus mature (MAFA/MAFB-containing) ? cells will exist. Taken together, this proposal will define the molecular mechanism by which juvenile and adult ? cells are regulated by MAFB2 and MAFA/B and determine transcription factor:coregulator interactions in physiological and pathophysiological conditions in human islet cells."
"9257688","Project Summary/Abstract  There is an unmet demand for functional characterization of variants observed in clinical DNA sequencing. This is evidenced by sequencing tests frequently reporting `variants of uncertain significance', information that cannot be acted on clinically. Of the approaches to characterize mutations in the absence of genetic evidence, all current methods have limitations ? namely, they aren't scalable to the large number of variants being sequenced, or they have inherent limits to their accuracy, a key one of which is that variants are removed from their genomic contexts to be assayed. This project aims to significantly improve experimental variant testing by using a novel genome editing method. This technique, called saturation editing, enables functional testing of large numbers of variants in multiplex, each in their endogenous genomic location. Through application to two genes in which mutations cause either chemotherapy resistance or oncogenesis, the method will yield powerful and accurate data for thousands of variants potentially playing key roles in disease.  The first goal will be to generate functional scores for every variant across the coding sequence of the HPRT1 gene for causing resistance to the leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine. This work will provide a richly informative database of variant effects as measured in the genome that can be compared to data from HPRT1- deficient patients to evaluate accuracy. Next, by extending this assay to study over 1,000 mutations in non- coding regions of the same gene, the potential for loss-of-function mutations in non-coding sequences of the genome will be systematically interrogated for the first time. This will provide insights into why clinical sequencing sometimes fails to find coding mutations despite knowledge of which gene is mutated. Finally, saturation editing will be implemented to assay BRCA1 variants for their affects on the homology-directed repair pathway. Experiments will be targeted to the RING domain of BRCA1, where there is a high occurrence of pathogenic missense mutations, most of which have been incompletely characterized. The ability of BRCA1 variants to promote homology-directed repair accurately predicts whether a BRCA1 variant maintains tumor- suppressor function or not. Through this study, more interpretable functional scores for hundreds of BRCA1 variants will be generated, potentially informing clinical decision-making. Collectively, these experiments will generate valuable data for the cancer community, while also establishing a new approach for scalable and accurate functional testing of variants in genes relevant to cancer."
"9398038","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, are serious mental illnesses that occur twice as frequently in women compared to men. Despite this disparity, we do not understand the biological basis of these sex differences. Human studies have revealed differences in the levels of the neuropeptides orexins in anxious and depressed patients compared to controls. Additionally, animal studies have revealed that orexins contribute to the stress response and to anxiety-like behavior. We have obtained preliminary data indicating orexins are differentially expressed in the brains of male and female rats. Consistent with previous research, we found that female rats exhibit a higher hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis response to repeated stress compared with males. Furthermore, females exhibited a stress-related impairment in cognitive flexibility but males did not. Therefore, we hypothesize that this sex difference in orexin expression contributes to the exacerbated stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility in female rats. The proposed research aims to elucidate how orexins contribute to sex differences in the stress response at both a single cell and behavioral level. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposal will use in vitro electrophysiology to determine if sex differences are observed i the membrane and firing properties of orexin neurons before and after stress. Morphology of orexin neurons in males and females will also be examined using Neurolucida neuron tracing software. Aim 2 will directly test the hypothesis that increased orexin expression mediates the higher stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility. We will use DREADDS (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technology to manipulate orexin action during stress. We expect that inhibition of orexin neurons in females will decrease the stress response and improve subsequent cognitive function. These experiments provide the first evidence linking orexins to sex differences in stress and cognition, but these results will also have immediate implications for treatment. Orexin antagonists are currently used to treat insomnia, so it is crucial we understand how these neuropeptides differ between males and females, as there may be a future need to develop sex-specific guidelines in dosing. Moreover, orexins may regulate stress responses, food intake, autonomic responses, and emotional memory and thereby contribute to a variety of psychiatric symptoms. In this way, targeting orexins may treat a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex specific manner."
"9412328","?    DESCRIPTION:  Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are capable of unlimited proliferation and may give rise to any tissue type in the human body. There are two types of hPSCs - embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These cells may be used as in vitro models of development and hold enormous potential for regenerative medicine applications. However, there are considerable roadblocks to widespread use of hPSCs, chief among which are complexity and cost. Complexity arises from the difficulty in maintaining pluripotency and directing differentiation into desirable lineages with high efficiency. The cost i due to reliance on expensive recombinant growth factors (GFs) and other reagents used in copious amounts over multiple weeks. We have recently made a fascinating observation that stem cells as well as adult cells cultured inside microfluidic devices without perfusion retained phenotype and function significantly better than cells in standard cultureware. Further investigation revealed that cells inside small volumes of microfluidic chambers were upregulating endogenous GFs. Building on these observations, we propose to develop novel cell culture microsystems that will harness cell-secreted signals for maintenance and differentiation of stem cells. Overall impact: This project aims to shift the paradigm of cell cultre away from reliance on exogenous growth factors and towards harnessing cells' own endogenous signals. This will b"
"9438126","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease is devastating for both individuals and society. Impaired spatial navigation and memory is one of its major symptoms. Similarly, rodent models of Alzheimer's disease also exhibit impairments in spatial navigation. Emerging evidence suggests abnormal communication between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus in humans with Alzheimer's. The objective of the proposed research is to explore the functionality of the hippocampal-PPC network in an animal model of amyloidosis, in order to develop a model for assessing potential contributions of altered cortico-hippocampal function to Alzheimer's disease. To do this, I will utilize a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's where three major genes associated with familial Alzheimer's disease are expressed. This mouse model mimics both plaque and tangle pathological hallmarks of the disease with a distribution pattern similar to human patients, including synaptic changes in the limbic system. Specifically, in three different experiments I will: a) assess hippocampal population activity and behavior to measure the ability of triple transgenic mice to utilize an external (room based) reference frame when their internal position reference frame is disrupted; b) assess both rest related memory replay and functional synaptic connectivity within and across the hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex in the triple transgenic mouse; c) utilize a novel pharmacogenetic approach to test the theory that temporary and specific hippocampal inactivation will produce impairments in memory replay that mimic those seen in animal models. Finally, findings in the triple transgenic model will be confirmed in a newer model of Alzheimer's that is more similar to sporadic Alzheimer's in humans. Therefore, this project will provide insight into the normal function of a circuit that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease and allo me to probe this circuit in a mouse model of Alzheimer's, so that we can begin to understand changes in this network that may underlie impairments observed in individuals with Alzheimer's disease."
"9419467","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):   Insulin stimulates the mobilization of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicles from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, resulting in an influx of glucose into target tissues such as muscle and fat. This system is disturbed in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Insulin-stimulated insertion of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane is the end product of a series of protein-protein interactions and dynamic cytoskeletal events that are still under investigation. In the first submission, we showed that CLIP-associating protein 2 (CLASP2), a protein previously unassociated with insulin action, is responsive to insulin. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach combined with phosphoserine antibody immunoprecipitation from L6 myotubes, we detected a 4.8-fold increase of CLASP2 in the insulin stimulated anti-phosphoserine immunoprecipitates as compared to basal. Western blotting of CLASP2 immunoprecipitates with the phospho- antibody confirmed that CLASP2 undergoes insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. Confocal imaging of L6 myotubes revealed that CLASP2 is positioned at the plasma membrane within areas of insulin-mediated cortical actin remodeling. Since insulin-induced cortical actin reorganization is a target for GLUT4 translocation, we tested for detection of both CLASP2 and GLUT4 within the plasma membrane ruffle generated by insulin- stimulated dynamic actin remodeling. Confocal imaging revealed that CLASP2 colocalizes with GLUT4 at insulin-stimulated plasma membrane ridges. CLASP2 is known to direct the distal end of microtubules to the cell cortex, and it has been shown that GLUT4 travels along microtubule tracks. In support of the prospect that CLASP2 directs microtubule-based delivery of GLUT4 to cell cortex landing zones important for insulin action, siRNA mediated knockdown of CLASP2 in L6 myotubes inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, siRNA mediated knockdown of CLASP2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibits insulin- stimulated glucose transport. The revised proposal presents new preliminary data from the previously proposed endogenous CLASP2 interactome studies from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, in which several known CLASP2 interacting proteins were identified, validating the approach. Mouse tissue was analyzed and an isoform- specific CLASP2 protein expression pattern in insulin-sensitive tissues such as muscle and fat was discovered. New preliminary data has identified insulin-regulated endogenous CLASP2 phosphorylation within L6 myotubes, including phosphorylation that is sensitive to inhibition of either glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) or PI 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Within systems such as cell migration, CLASP2 is known to be negatively regulated by GSK3. We therefore propose to test the overall hypothesis that CLASP2 is negatively regulated by GSK3- mediated phosphorylation in the basal state. Inactivation of GSK3 by insulin through PI 3-K relieves CLASP2, allowing for the distal end of microtubules to situate at the specific CLASP2-targeted landing zones on the cell cortex, whereby situating GLUT4 containing vesicles proximal to the plasma membrane."
"9433931","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need persists for better early detection of ovarian cancer. Currently, detection of ovarian cancer relies in part on the recognition of the tumor marker protein CA125 by antibody molecules. CA125 is the most widely assayed and best validated biomarker of ovarian cancer, but because available assays lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity, CA125 is not currently recommended for screening in the general population. More informative assays will result from the simultaneous detection of multiple cancer biomarkers, including those whose biological abundance complements CA125. Mesothelin and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) are two relatively new biomarkers that may complement CA125 in serum tests. Currently, most assays for ovarian cancer markers rely on antibody molecules for selective recognition. Antibodies are limited in terms of their stability, reusability, and ability to be modified with imaging labels or immobilization tags. Assays incorporating aptamers (functional nucleic acid ligands) are an attractive alternative to antibody-based techniques. Aptamers are robust, easily labeled, and prepared entirely in vitro. In previous studies, some aptamers have been shown surpass antibodies in affinity for their target, which may translate into improved detection methods for cancer markers in serum tests. An additional application in which aptamers may replace antibodies is in targeting metal nanoparticle imaging agents or therapeutic payloads directly to surfaces of ovarian cancer cells. Such cell targeting may be useful for imaging the distribution of biomarkers on ovarian tumors and may enable localized cell killing by hyperthermia, reducing the need for systemic chemotherapy. The research plan proposed here aims to develop aptamers for three important ovarian cancer biomarkers. Assays that use these aptamers in conjunction with sensitive instrumental methods will then be developed. We will also perform proof-of-principle experiments in which aptamer-functionalized nanoparticles mediate high-resolution imaging and targeted hyperthermia. Public health will be positively impacted by the development of new CA125 assays to improve cancer screening and by innovative approaches to tumor cell eradication. The PI will conduct the metal nanoparticle assays during a one-year research sabbatical hosted at the University of Wisconsin Medical School (Year 1). Two additional years of support are requested during which the PI, back at her home institution of Oberlin College, will train two undergraduate students per year and mentor them in aptamer selection and assay development. A recently graduated Oberlin undergraduate will be employed as a full-time research technician in Year 3."
"9392405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the success of HIV prevention and treatment efforts in the United States (US), disparities in HIV incidence and prevalence have grown. HIV is now considered an epidemic of the socially marginalized and disenfranchised, with cases concentrated in racial and sexual minorities in impoverished neighborhoods, particularly African Americans and men who have sex with men (MSM). The rates of substance use, like stimulant use, are high within these groups and further increase engagement in risky sexual behaviors. Neurobehavioral researchers are elucidating brain regions involved in risky decision making, and factors like drug use, socioeconomic disadvantage, and social marginalization have been linked to alterations in these regions. Understanding how substance use and social inequalities influence decision making facilitates our ability to tailor HIV prevention interventions to high-rik groups; however socially disadvantaged substance users are rarely included in neuroimaging research, partly due to a deficiency in recruitment strategies. The proposed project integrates training and research designed to develop the applicant's expertise in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design and analysis with disadvantaged stimulant users. The proposed project will build on the applicant's strong foundation in clinical psychology, by providing mentored training in (1) neurobehavioral aspects of substance use and HIV/AIDS, (2) fMRI design, analysis, and interpretation, (3) respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and other strategies for recruiting disadvantaged substance users for neuroimaging research. The training plan includes coursework, participation in seminars, directed readings, mentored research, attendance at national conferences, and mentored grant writing. The proposed research will examine the main and interaction effects of socioeconomic status and cocaine use on risky decision making and associated neural activation using data collected from NIDA-funded fMRI research overseen by the applicant's mentor. It is hypothesized that cocaine use and low SES will be associated with riskier decision making and decreased neural activation during an experimental loss aversion task. Additionally, RDS will be used to recruit 100 MSM cocaine users to determine its feasibility and to identify factors associated with willingness to participae in fMRI research. This research will inform patient-oriented research aimed at reducing HIV disparities among disadvantaged substance users. At the culmination of this fellowship, the applicant will have specialized expertise in an area of critical need and will be prepared to begin a program of patient- oriented research in the fields of neuroAIDS and drug abuse."
"9207459","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary ocular infections are not regularly notifiable to the US Center for Disease Control. Infectious ocular disease epidemics are not regularly reported, tracked, or predicted in the US, despite the fact that tracking would be of clear benefit to the eye health community. We hypothesize that several novel digital surveillance approaches can improve monitoring and detection of ocular disease epidemics, starting with one or the more common model eye infection: conjunctivitis. Severe outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis or EKC) or bacteria occur without warning and sporadically in location and time. Epidemics are highly contagious with a significant burden of cost in the US, although long-term vision impairment is unusual. Risk factors for these and other ocular disease epidemics may be on the rise, and budgetary cuts may further reduce funding for traditional surveillance reporting and prevention. Thus new solutions are needed for monitoring ocular disease epidemics. Recently web searches, social media, and other sourced digital big data has been used to track infectious diseases. Here, we propose (Aim1) to identify candidate ocular disease epidemics using big data through a number of statistical approaches, as well as to (Aim2) use medical records and also develop a digital sentinel network of specialists for participatory surveillance, in order to validate any candidate epidemics, and (Aim3) Since even the health records and other clinical reports in Aim2 are not a perfect gold standard, we will also use a hidden state model to estimate, for each methodology, the sensitivity and specificity (and other appropriate descriptors) of detection of a true conjunctivitis epidemic."

"9332757","Hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses pose significant threats to public health and biodefense. Intervention strategies that target the arenavirus envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) hold promise for combating these lethal infections. In contrast to other class I fusion proteins, GPC contains three subunits: GP1, GP2 and a unique stable signal peptide (SSP) that acts in conjunction with GP2 to sense acidic pH in the endosome and trigger the structural transitions leading to virus-cell membrane fusion. Small-molecule inhibitors target this interaction to block arenavirus entry. A detailed understanding of GPC membrane fusion and its inhibition has been hampered by the lack of structural knowledge of the membrane-anchored GPC trimer. Crystallographic structures of soluble ectodomain fragments of GPC lack SSP and the transmembrane domain of GP2. We have determined a low-resolution structure of the Lassa virus (LASV) GPC on virion particles using cryo- electron microscopy (cryoEM) tomography, but were unable to resolve these missing elements. Remarkable technical advances in single-particle cryoEM now allow the capture of significantly more information than cryotomography and should enable us to generate high-resolution structures. In preliminary studies, we have produced LASV GPC in insect cells and used cryoEM to visualize the trimeric complex, in solution and embedded in lipid nanodiscs (NDs). This proposal entails a collaboration between two experienced research groups with complementary strengths in the biochemical analysis of arenavirus membrane fusion and single- particle cryoEM structure determination, with the goal of obtaining near-atomic resolution structural knowledge of the native LASV GPC complex in a membrane environment. We will pursue the following specific aims: (1) Determine the cryoEM structure of the precursor form of LASV GPC stabilized in lipid nanodiscs. NDs offer an ordered lipid environment to stabilize the structure of membrane proteins beyond the limits of nonionic detergents. We have incorporated cleavage-defective (cd) LASV GPC into NDs and will determine the cryoEM structure of the trimeric precursor. (2) Determine the structure of the mature prefusion form of LASV GPC. Purified wild-type LASV GPC contains a mixture of cleaved and uncleaved molecules. We will take advantage of our recent finding that only the mature complex is susceptible to photoaffinity labeling by fusion inhibitors to selectively enrich for cleaved GPC NDs. (3) Determine the low-pH structures of LASV GPC bound to its LAMP1 co-receptor and in its postfusion state. LASV GP1 undergoes a conformational switch at moderate endosomal pH to bind LAMP1. We have produced soluble LAMP1 and will determine the cryoEM structure of LAMP1-bound GPC NDs. Further acidification will trigger the fusogenic reorganization of the complex. Collectively, the structures will provide an unprecedented view of GPC and the conformational transitions that promote arenavirus membrane fusion and its inhibition. This knowledge will guide the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics against arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers."
"9389088","Project Summary/Abstract  Sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, and mostly heterosexual) young people in the U.S. have elevated risk of substance use and adverse mental health outcomes compared to their heterosexual peers. These health inequities may be the result of social stressors such as stigma and discrimination that can influence health at multiple levels, including individual (e.g., interpersonal discrimination) and structural levels (e.g., discriminatory state policies). Yet little is known about how these individual- and structural-level social stressors or resilience factors (e.g., social support) contribute to health inequities in substance use and how they affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). There is a pressing need to understand (i) how changes over time in structural discrimination (e.g., law and policy) may relate to substance use and HRQOL across sexual orientation groups and (ii) heterogeneity within sexual minorities, such as patterning of multi-level stressors across race/ethnicity, gender (including gender nonconformity, which can be a target for discrimination), and age cohort. To address these research imperatives, this project will focus on the following aims:  (1) Examine the interplay between structural-level stressors and sexual orientation in the development of substance use and HRQOL. Using longitudinal cohort data and a state-level database of changes in laws and policies relevant to sexual minority civil rights, analyses will examine effect modification of the association between sexual orientation and substance use and HRQOL by state-level structural discrimination over the course of adolescent development.  (2) Elucidate the relationships between structural- and individual-level stressors and substance use and HRQOL among diverse sexual minorities, using data from two complementary national cohorts of sexual minorities. Analyses will compare associations between state-level structural discrimination, self- reported experiences of discrimination, resilience factors, and risk of substance use and poor HRQOL and will examine differential patterning of social stressors by race/ethnicity, gender nonconformity, and age cohort.  To achieve these aims the research will utilize data from (i) the Growing Up Today Study, a longitudinal cohort of 27,000 youth who were recruited when they were ages 9-14 and are now in their 20s-to-30s, and (ii) the Generations Study, a national probability sample of 676 U.S. Black, Latino and White sexual minorities in three age cohorts, representing generations that came of age in disparate social and policy environments with regards to sexual orientation. Longitudinal statistical methods and structural equation modeling will be used to examine the above aims. The proposed research will be among the first to examine multilevel U.S. social and policy contexts in relation to sexual orientation inequities in substance use and HRQOL. Findings will enhance understanding of key mechanisms in the development of sexual orientation-related health inequities and will inform interventions to mitigate stressors and strengthen protective factors for sexual minority youth."
"9420712","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How the brain maintains energy homeostasis is not well understood making it a critical area of research. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons located in the arcuate nuclei (ARC) of the hypothalamus are essential for the regulation of energy balance. Specific activation of these neurons through pharmacogenetic stimulation produces intense hunger as well as a rapid decrease in energy expenditure. Remarkably, little attention has been paid to the mechanisms producing suppression of energy expenditure by AgRP neurons, leaving the downstream circuitry mediating this effect unknown. This is due, in part, to the complex circuitry that exists within the ARC, where AgRP neurons exist among other neurons of opposite or unrelated function that also share partial overlap in circuitry. To unravel the process by which AgRP neurons function to decrease metabolism, there must first be an understanding of the circuitry mediating the physiological response to AgRP neuron activation. Traditional tract tracing methods are incapable of cell-specific targeting and assessment of functional connectivity, however, recent development of innovative optogenetic and pharmacogenetic technologies now permit the study of complex circuits controlling feeding behavior and metabolism. By utilizing Cre-dependent gene-targeting approaches in transgenic mice, this application proposes to map sites downstream to AgRP neurons and identify the specific neuronal population responsible for AgRP- mediated suppression of energy expenditure. Subsequently, a combination of pharmacogenetic and optogenetic tools will allow for isolated manipulation of specific AgRP synapses to reveal the necessary and/or sufficient efferent targets that mediate suppression of energy expenditure. The findings generated from these studies will provide a wiring diagram for AgRP-mediated suppression of energy expenditure, which could provide insight into potential contributions to a wide range of metabolic diseases, ranging from eating disorders to obesity."
"9259211","Project Summary Malaria is a devastating disease that affects nearly half the world's population and results in more than 440,000 deaths per year. Due to increased drug resistance reported throughout Southeast Asia, it is widely accepted that new drugs with novel mechanisms are required to combat this epidemic. Plasmodium falciparum, the malarial parasite that causes the most deaths, utilizes a complex lifecycle initially infecting hepatocytes, followed by the reproductive cycle in mature erythrocytes and finally gametocyte differentiation for transmission to the mosquito host. As malarial symptoms are caused by the repeated invasion and lysis of erythrocytes, the majority of drug treatments target the blood-stage parasite. Plasmodium de novo lipid biosynthesis has been suggested to be critical for blood-, liver-, and gametocyte development stages; therefore, drugs that affect phospholipid metabolism may be useful not only for blood stage treatment but may also provide the added benefit of prophylactic and transmission-blocking activities. Plasmodium de novo PC biosynthesis is accomplished through the cytidine diphosphate-choline pathway beginning with the ATP- dependent phosphorylation of choline by choline kinase (CK). Based on essentiality, a broad expression profile across all key infection stages, opportunity for selectivity over the human CK protein, and ability to be inhibited by small molecules, I hypothesize that P. falciparum CK will be an excellent target for the design of novel antimalarial drugs. Choline mimetic P. falciparum CK inhibitors have been reported to have antimalarial activity; however, these inhibitors have poor drug-like properties, exhibit off-target effects, and are mildly toxic to human cells. Specific Aim 1 combines computational and chemical high throughput screening (HTS) approaches to identify CK inhibitors that will target the adenine, rather than choline, substrate binding site as adenine pockets are well-documented druggable motifs for other kinases. Identified inhibitors will be evaluated for their ability to overcome the limitations of currently characterized CK inhibitors including reducing off-target effects and improving parasite homolog specificity. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the efficacy of the identified inhibitors as antimalarials in cell-based assays where hit series showing good drug-like properties and strong activity against both P. falciparum CK and the parasite will be prioritized for future development. Specific Aim 3 will elucidate the molecular interactions between P. falciparum CK and inhibitors by x-ray crystallography. These interactions will be optimized to improve inhibitor potency and selectivity by generating structure-activity relationships. The outcome of these studies will be to 1) establish a new enzymatic target for antimalarial drug discovery and 2) deliver a well-characterized hit series targeting P. falciparum CK for a future lead optimization program directed at developing a novel antimalarial agent."
"9312693","The fungus Candida albicans is a commensal species of the human microbiota. It is also a frequently isolated opportunistic pathogen, responsible for a variety of mucosal and life-threatening systemic infections. The majority of these infections are a result of the ability of C. albicans cells to exist in biofilms ? resilient, surface-associated, communities of cells with unique properties. Many serious infections are highly correlated with implanted medical devices, which provide efficient substrates for biofilm formation.  Recent studies have revealed that pheromone signaling is a novel mechanism promoting the formation of C. albicans biofilms. Pheromone signaling is well established to choreograph mating between C. albicans cells. Surprisingly, however, this program can also induce responding cells to become adherent and undergo biofilm development. Pheromones can drive biofilm formation in co-cultures of cells of opposite mating types. In addition, auto-activation of this pathway can even occur in single sex cultures, which similarly results in enhanced adherence of C. albicans cells and biofilm development. It is therefore clear that pheromones can play a pleiotropic role in driving biofilm formation by multiple C. albicans cell types, both by conventional and non-conventional pheromone signaling pathways. In this proposal, we seek to investigate the mechanism of pheromone-induced biofilm formation, and to address the potential for them to form in vivo using two mammalian models of biofilm infection. The two Aims of the proposal are: Aim 1. To define the mechanism of pheromone-induced biofilm formation. We will determine the mechanism by which pheromone signaling induces biofilm formation in C. albicans. Transcriptional profiling will be performed on a diverse set of clinical isolates during pheromone-induced biofilm formation, and target genes implicated in biofilm formation will be deleted by CRISPR and evaluated for their roles in this process. Aim 2. To determine the role of pheromone signaling on biofilm formation in vivo. We will determine if pheromone-signaling pathways lead to enhanced biofilm formation using two distinct mammalian models of biofilm formation, a rat catheter model and a denture stomatitis model.  Together, completion of these experiments will reveal how pheromone-signaling pathways impact biofilm formation in C. albicans both in vitro and in vivo. Our approach is based on intriguing preliminary data that indicates that introduction of a mixture of two mating types results in enhanced biofilms in an animal model. If successful, this proposal has the potential to transform our understanding of C. albicans biofilm formation, and has direct clinical ramifications for treatment of fungal infections in patients. Overall, the combination of state- of-the-art genomic approaches, molecular genetics, high-resolution microscopy, microfluidic models, and two validated animal models designed to mimic human biofilm infections, provides a powerful combinatorial approach to studying this important clinical problem."
"9232144","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 60% of SLE patients develop clinical evidence of kidney injury, termed lupus nephritis (LN). LN is thought to be caused by glomerular immune complex deposition activating an inflammatory cascade that injures glomerular cells, leading to proteinuria and loss of filtration capacity. LN is classified based on renal histopathology into si classes, of which proliferative LN (ISN/RPS class III or IV) is most likely to cause renal failure. Most studies examining the causes of proliferative LN have focused on the nephritogenic potential of anti-nuclear antibodies, diverting attention from a potential role for tissue/cell-specific autoantibodies. There is increasing evidence that autoantibodies to tissue specific target antigens contribute to the pathogenesis of many glomerular diseases, including LN. Our preliminary data show that sera from patients with proliferative LN contain autoantibodies to human glomerular proteins, including annexin A2 and moesin. These findings support our central hypothesis that autoantibodies targeting glomerular proteins, including annexin A2 and moesin, result in immune complex deposition that causes proliferative LN. This mentored career development proposal will focus on further characterization of autoantibodies to annexin A2 and moesin in proliferative LN, validation of those autoantibodies as biomarkers for disease, examination of the functional changes in podocytes and mesangial cells exposed to those autoantibodies, and evaluation of the nephritogenic potential of those antibodies in animal models. As evidenced by the advances in understanding primary membranous nephropathy after the identification of target antigens, this will lead to improved understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of disease, and provide new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This mentored career development award also will provide protected time for the applicant to develop the skills required to become an independent physician-scientist, investigating clinical and basic aspects of lupus nephritis, through an individualized career development plan which has been developed by the mentorship team."
"9391233","Project Summary: HIV and substance abuse represent two epidemics that disproportionately affect young men who have sex with men (YMSM). The majority of HIV transmissions among YMSM occur in the context of serious relationships, largely due to higher rates of condomless anal sex (CAS) with serious compared to casual partners and lack of PrEP uptake in relationships. Unfortunately, research on risk factors for HIV and substance abuse has largely focused on individuals with limited attention to dyads. In addition to stress experienced by all couples, coupled YMSM experience unique stress related to their sexual minority status (e.g., discrimination, stigma). This added stress may lead to problems in relationship functioning (e.g., dissatisfaction, conflict, intimate partner violence), which may then contribute to engagement in health risk behaviors, such as CAS and substance use. Delineating these processes is critically important to inform dyadic prevention strategies to optimize relationship functioning and reduce health disparities among YMSM. The proposed study will utilize data from a subsample of a large, racially/ethnically diverse cohort of YMSM who are currently being recruited for a NIDA-funded U01. The cohort is being built by having YMSM recruit their serious relationship partners into the study, providing the unique opportunity to examine dyadic influences on HIV risk behavior and substance use among YMSM and their partners. This proposal will also provide the applicant with postdoctoral training in HIV and substance use research, statistical methods for analyzing dyadic data, and grantsmanship, all of which are necessary to launch his career as an independent scientist. The applicant will learn how to implement the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, which statistically accounts for the nonindependence of data in dyads by simultaneously estimating actor effects (a person?s influence on his own behavior) and partner effects (how much a person is influenced by his partner). This model will allow the applicant to examine the influences of individual- and partner-level stressors on risk behaviors. Further, dyadic data provide the opportunity to examine the extent to which concordance/discordance of stress between partners contributes to each partner?s HIV risk behavior and substance use above and beyond the individual actor and partner effects. In sum, the goals of the proposed study are to examine: (1) actor and partner effects of stress on HIV risk behavior and substance use; (2) the associations between concordance/discordance of stress between partners and HIV risk behavior and substance use; and (3) problems in relationship functioning as mediators of these associations. This proposal represents formative research on dyadic influences on health risk behavior among YMSM, which is a necessary first step in order to develop evidence-based prevention and intervention programs that target the context in which HIV risk transmission is highest (romantic dyads). Findings from this study will inform our understanding of health disparities by disentangling individual- and partner-level influences on HIV risk behavior and substance use in a high-risk population (diverse YMSM)."
"9243092","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset disorder causing weakness of eyelid and pharyngeal, and proximal limb muscles. A major symptom of OPMD is swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) due to weakened pharyngeal muscles. Patients often experience choking or aspiration pneumonia, and may require a feeding tube in later stages of disease. At present, the exact molecular mechanisms of pathology are unknown. The only available options to treat dysphagia in OPMD patients are temporary, usually surgical procedures to decrease resistance in the throat to improve swallowing. Autosomal dominant OPMD patients harbor a mutation in the gene for the nuclear mRNA processing protein PABPN1, which causes the N-terminal polyalanine stretch of PABPN1 to expand from 10 to 11-18 residues. PABPN1 plays key roles in mRNA processing including polyadenylation of nuclear transcripts and the alternative polyadenylation and cleavage pathway. PABPN1 is expressed in all tissues, but mutation causes late-onset pathology only in a specific subset of skeletal muscles. How mutation of this ubiquitously expressed protein leads to late-onset pathology in specific tissues remains an open question. Skeletal muscle tissue is capable of regeneration. Closely associated with multinucleated, post-mitotic myofibers in adult muscles is a pool of stem cells known as satellite cells. Upon muscle damage, satellite cells become activated to proliferate, differentiate, and fuse with each other and existing myofibers. This process, known as myogenesis, restores muscle architecture and function. Interestingly, some of the muscles most severely affected by OPMD, including pharyngeal muscles, are more highly regenerative than other skeletal muscles. The hypothesis driving the work proposed here is that mutant PABPN1 disrupts mRNA biogenesis and decreases the myogenic capacity of pharyngeal satellite cells, leading to pathology due to the unusually high demand for myogenesis in pharyngeal muscles. We will take an integrative in vitro and in vivo approach using a novel mouse model that is the first to accurately copy the genotype of OPMD patients. This mouse model expresses mutant PABPN1 in all tissues. Because PABPN1 is known to impact mRNA metabolism, satellite cells from pharyngeal muscles will be isolated and assayed for RNA phenotypes (Aim 1). The myogenic program can be recapitulated in vitro and used to quantify specific stages of myogenesis. Therefore, primary activated satellite cells, known as myoblasts, from pharyngeal muscles will be isolated and used to quantify the effects of mutant PABPN1 on the specific stages of myogenesis in vitro (Aim 2). This model will then be used to assay the effect of mutant PABPN1 on myogenesis in pharyngeal muscle in vivo (Aim 3). The long-term objective of this work is to understand how mutant PABPN1 affects pharyngeal satellite cell biology and potentially identify targets for new pharmacologic OPMD treatments."
"9393584","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration, rats exhibit a progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced cocaine  craving that is associated with synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) including alterations in in AMPA receptor subunit composition and group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) plasticity. Recent work from our lab suggests these adaptations are maintained by dysregulated local protein translation. Aberrant translation has a profound impact on cellular function and is a key feature in Fragile X syndrome and some other disorders of the nervous system. Treatments to normalize protein synthesis have proven successful in reversing certain behavioral and cellular abnormalities in a mouse model of Fragile X. Currently, little is known about mechanisms regulating translation in the NAc. Furthermore, the possibility of long-term alterations in translation following cocaine exposure has been largely uninvestigated and provides an intriguing novel target for therapeutic intervention. The objective of this proposal is  to identify mechanisms through which excitatory synaptic transmission regulates translation under control conditions and after incubation of cocaine craving, focusing on two receptors implicated in regulation of translation in other brain regions: NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and group I mGluRs. The central hypothesis is that incubation of cocaine craving is associated with dysregulation of protein translation in NAc dendrites. Aim 1 will characterize protein translation in the NAc during the incubation of cocaine craving. 35S-Met/Cys incorporation will be used to measure protein translation in NAc tissue at two different time-points after discontinuing cocaine self-administration: withdrawal day 1 (WD1), before synaptic adaptations have occurred, and WD40, when craving has incubated and NAc synaptic transmission is altered. Basal translation, as well as regulation of translation by NMDARs and group I mGluRs will be compared between cocaine rats and saline controls. Then, translation of GluA1 and GluA2 will be specifically assessed after immunoprecipitation. Aim 2 will determine if NMDARs and group I mGluRs regulate translation in NAc dendrites. Experiments in Aim 1 are not able to distinguish between translation occurring in the soma versus the dendrites, which also contain the machinery for protein translation. To isolate dendritic translation, neurons from postnatal rat NAc  (co- cultured with cortical neurons to restore glutamate synapses) will be grown in microfluidic chambers that isolate soma from dendrites, allowing media in each compartment to be selectively manipulated. Drugs affecting NMDARs and group I mGluRs will be added to the dendritic chamber to determine if they specifically regulate dendritic translation. These studies are the first to characterize how excitatory transmission regulates protein translation in the NAc under basal conditions and whether drugs of abuse cause persistent alterations in the regulation of translation. While this work is underway, I will participate in a multi-faceted Training Plan designed to develop the non-bench skills needed to reach my goal of becoming a PI in an academic setting."
"9270075","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a multisystem disorder caused by defective telomere maintenance. Bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, solid tumors, and liver disease are life-threatening manifestations of DC. The goal of our research is to understand the molecular genetics of DC, thereby opening avenues for targeted interventions that may be relevant not only to DC but also to other conditions associated with telomere shortening. Mutations in TINF2, which encodes the telomeric shelterin complex component, TIN2, are causes of DC. An outstanding question is why heterozygous and de novo mutations in TINF2 result in extreme telomere shortening and severe, early-onset disease whereas heterozygous mutations in telomerase component genes lead to more severe manifestations of disease and progressively earlier onset disease over generations in kindred's. All DC-associated TINF2 mutations reported to date, whether missense or truncating, cluster in a 34-amino acid segment located centrally within both the short (TIN2S1-354) and long (TIN2L1-451) TIN2 isoforms. Our research focuses on the unstudied TIN2L isoform, which either harbors missense mutations within the DC cluster or is not expressed when truncating mutations are present. Our preliminary data indicate that TIN2L and TIN2S are not equivalent components of shelterin and that the most common DC-associated missense mutation has deleterious effects on TIN2L but not TIN2S. Additionally, we found that TIN2L contains a conserved phosphorylation site that, when mutated, has the same functional effect on TIN2L as mutations within the DC cluster. Lastly, we found that the enhanced interaction between TIN2L and TRF2 requires TRF2-F120, a key residue within the TRF homology (TRFH) domain that serves as a docking site for various DNA-processing and DNA damage response factors. We hypothesize that TIN2L regulates the ability of TRFH domain-interacting proteins to access TRF2 and that altered TIN2L activity and enhanced recruitment of TIN2L to telomeres drives telomere shortening in patients. In Specific Aim (SA) 1 of this proposal, we will determine the relative impacts of TIN2S and TIN2L on telomere structure and function by generating an allelic series of mutant cell lines and performing complementation tests with patient-derived TINF2 mutant cell lines. We will also determine if TIN2L, compared to TIN2S, differentially interacts with other proteins in addition to TRF2 using a novel immunoprecipitation protocol followed by mass spectrometry sequencing methods. Finally, we will screen genetically uncharacterized patients with very short telomeres for specific mutations in TIN2L. In SA2, we will elucidate the function of TIN2L phosphorylation by identifying its impact on TRF2 binding and clarifying its relationship with the DC cluster through an array of in vitro and in vivo analyses. In SA3, we will determine the functional interplay between TIN2L and TRF2 TRFH domain- interacting proteins and identify how they are altered in TINF2 mutant cell lines. This work is expected to not only shed light on DC pathogenesis but also generate new paradigm shifts in telomere biology."
"9428748","PROJECT SUMMARY  In the United States and throughout the world, alcohol use is a near universal societal and cultural norm. Fortunately, the majority of people who consume alcohol do not develop an alcohol use disorder. This suggests the existence of a homeostatic pathway(s) that protects individuals from developing and suffering from alcohol addiction. Data from my laboratory group and others suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor involved in structural and functional neuronal plasticity, gates the transition from moderate alcohol drinking to excessive uncontrolled consumption. The goal of this proposal is to identify the cell type and circuit that BDNF signals through to gate excessive drinking. Moderate consumption of alcohol increases BDNF mRNA levels in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of mice, which `brakes' further alcohol intake, whereas excessive and repeated alcohol drinking disrupts the homeostatic increase of BDNF in the DLS, transitioning the animal towards excessive drinking. BDNF in the DLS acts to suppress alcohol intake by activating the effector genes, preprodynorphin and dopamine D3 receptor. The majority of DLS neurons are medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which express either dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) or dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). The neuronal subtype(s) that BDNF signals through to prevent excessive alcohol intake is unknown. Aim 1 will determine if BDNF is acting upon D1R and/or D2R MSNs in the DLS to keep alcohol intake in moderation. Because dynorphin and D3 are constrained to D1R MSNs, I hypothesize that BDNF is acting via the D1R pathway to gate excessive alcohol consumption. To test this hypothesis I will use transgenic mice strains that express Cre-recombinase in specific MSN subtypes and a viral vector strategy to delete the BDNF receptor, TrkB, in DLS D1R or D2R MSNs, in combination with voluntary drinking paradigms.  The major source of BDNF in the striatum is the cortex. I recently found that excessive alcohol drinking reduces BDNF expression in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), an area of the brain implicated in associative learning and regulating reward value. I further found that overexpression of BDNF in the OFC prevents the development of excessive alcohol consumption, and that BDNF released from the OFC activates the BDNF/TrkB pathway in the DLS. Therefore, I hypothesize that BDNF in the OFC ? DLS circuit is preventing excessive alcohol drinking, and that breakdown of BDNF in this pathway drives excessive alcohol consumption. Aim 2 will test the role of BDNF specifically in the OFC ? DLS pathway in regulating alcohol drinking behaviors. To test this hypothesis I will use a combination of viral vectors (Cre-DIO expression system) to knockdown or overexpress BDNF in the OFC ? DLS circuit and assess alcohol drinking behaviors. Collectively, this research will shed light on BDNF signaling and alcohol's actions in the CNS, and innovate on current research by investigating the actions of growth factors in specific neuronal circuits that gate drinking."
"9250282","Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities, and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females.  The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e., individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress. Obesity- related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and cardio-metabolic biomarkers.  Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth."

I am a clinically trained nephrologist whose long-term goal is to understanding the basic mechanisms of hypertension. This proposal will fulfill the educational objective of the development award by facilitating the expansion of my knowledge base into novel lines of inquiry requiring mentorship in these new areas. The expertise of the mentors assisting in this grant proposal will be essential to the successful completion of both the educational mission of the award as well as the performance of the proposed research plan that spans these areas. Thomas Coffman, MD, my primary mentor, has extensive expertise in hypertension research and the renin-angiotensin system; Steven Crowley, MD, will provide expertise in kidney cross transplantation and early career guidance; Susan Gurley, MD, PhD will provide guidance on conditional gene targeting in mice and assessment of sodium transporters in renal epithelia; Christopher Kontos, MD, will provide expertise in endothelial activity and will provide critical mentorship on balancing careers in clinical medicine and research. Additionally, I will participate in a rigorous career development plan as outlined in this application that will be instrumental in ensuring the successful transition to being an independent researcher. PROJECT SUMMARY: Hypertension is a common chronic medical condition significantly impacting cardiovascular health. Medications used to antagonize the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers effectively reduce blood pressure and uniquely ameliorate cardiovascular complications. The actions of the renin-angiotensin system to control blood pressure are primarily mediated by the type I (AT1) angiotensin receptor. However, AT1 receptors are expressed in multiple cell types in organ systems involved in blood pressure regulation (for example; the brain, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, and blood vessels) and it is not known which cells lineages and tissue compartments mediate their effects. Our preliminary studies in mice lacking AT1 receptors specifically in smooth muscle cells of the vasculature resulted in reduced basal blood pressure and protection from Ang II- induced hypertension. Unexpectedly, our findings suggest that Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction in the systemic circulation through a combination of direct actions on smooth muscle cells and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. However, in the renal circulation Angiotensin II acts almost exclusively through AT1 receptors on smooth muscle cells of the vasculature. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that vascular AT1 receptors contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension primarily by their actions in resistance vessels within the kidney to reduce peritubular blood flow and decrease urinary excretion of sodium, thereby promoting increased blood pressure. This proposed work is innovative, in that it combines physiological measurements in mice with molecular biology approaches. My approach uses a combination novel transgenic mouse models with kidney cross transplantation to answer fundamental questions about blood pressure homeostasis."
"9290617","Abstract A major goal of this proposal is to define the role of the airway epithelial cells in the immune response to respiratory viral infection and to extend this information to better control acute viral illness and prevent post- viral airway disease. Based on new insights into the issue of how airway epithelial cells mediate host defense against respiratory viruses, we will develop the hypothesis that the proper quality and quantity of interferon (IFN) signaling in airway epithelial cells is critical for controlling acute viral illness and post-viral airway disease. Studies of transgenic mice and transduced human cell lines further revealed that IFN signaling is limited by a PARP9-DTX3L complex with distinct domains for interaction with STAT1 and for activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acted on host histone H2BJ to promote IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and on viral 3C protease to degrade these proteases via the immunoproteasome. Thus, PARP9-DTX3L acts on host and pathogen to achieve a double layer of immunity within a safe reserve in the IFN signaling pathway and specially controls viruses like human rhinovirus (HRV) that require viral 3C protease for replication. We therefore hypothesize that airway epithelial cell PARP9-DTX3L specially regulates the severity of infection due to HRV and other picornaviruses like human enterovirus-D68 (HEV-D68) that might be more severe in patients with airway disease and/or linked to exacerbation or progression of airway disease. We also propose that the novel dual-mechanism for PARP9-DTX3L to safely harness IFN signaling reserve provides a roadmap to protect against respiratory viral infection and post-viral airway disease. Indeed, we used our findings to develop small-molecule IFN-signal enhancer (SMISE) compounds to enable the antiviral benefit of PARP9-DTX3L expression. To further develop these insights and translate them to practice, we have the following Specific Aims: 1. In human cell and molecular models, determine the role of PARP9-DTX3L in IFN signaling and control of respiratory picornaviruses in primary-culture human airway epithelial cells and recombinant human proteins. This Aim will also pursue the mechanism for PARP9-DTX3L activities and a structural biology approach to enhancing these actions. 2. In mouse cell and in vivo models, define the role of PARP9-DTX3L in IFN signaling and control of respiratory picornaviruses and post-viral airway disease using cell-specific transgenic, knock-out, and knock-in mice and airway epithelial cells from these mice. This Aim will develop new models of picornavirus infection and pursue the mechanism for PARP9-DTX3L activities in IFN signaling and SMISE effect. Together, the results will provide the first proof-of-concept for the role of PARP9-DTX3L in controlling respiratory picornavirus infection in vitro and in vivo and will advance the basis for developing an effective antiviral compound for this type of infection."
"9223747","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to better understand the role of microglia in regulating the structure and function of the brain under physiological and pathological conditions. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system and display highly motile processes occupying a non- overlapping territory. Under physiological conditions, microglia may participate in the development and plasticity of neural circuits and monitor the brain's microenvironment for damage signals. Under pathological conditions, microglia may contain tissue damage, phagocytose cellular debris, and promote neuronal plasticity. Although microglia have been implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, their functions in the central nervous system remains elusive. Hampering efforts to delineate the precise role of microglia is the lack of tools to specifically perturb microglial function in vivo. We have recently generated mice with a targeted gene insertion allowing for the expression of tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in CX3CR1 expressing microglial cells and peripheral myeloid cells. By taking advantage of different turnover rates of microglia and peripheral myeloid cells, we propose to establish an approach that will allow us, for the first time, to specifically perturb microglial functions in the living mice. By specifically ablating microglia or removing brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from microglia in the living mice, we will elucidate the functions of microglia and microglial BDNF in synapse development and learning-dependent synaptic plasticity. In addition, we will reveal the role of microglial activation in controlling neuronal damage, glial scar formation and synaptic remodeling after traumatic brain injury. As activated microglia are involved in almost every pathological condition in the brain, the proposed studies of identifying precise functions of microglia will provide important insights for the understanding and treatment of many neurological diseases."
"9233420","Project Summary B- and T-cell Non Hodgkin lymphomas Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma representing ~30% of all B cell Non Hodgkin lymphomas. DLBCL is classified into distinct molecular subtypes, including germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL, activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma. ABC-DLBCL is the most chemo-resistant DLBCL subtype with a 5-year overall survival as low as 30% versus 59 and 64%, for GCB- DLBCL and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, respectively. Therefore, new treatments are needed to improve clinical outcome of the patients with DLBCL. The reasons for resistance in lymphomas are not well understood and could be attributed to, but not limited to, clonal heterogeneity, microenvironmental signaling, and are genetically complex lymphoproliferative diseases. massive activation of canonical and/or non-canonical pathways such as B cell receptor (BCR). Such complexity of drug response underscores the need for better understanding the role of complementary pathways, such as microenvironment signaling, in lymphomas. However, c urrent pre-clinical research in lymphoma has relied on testing compounds with suspension cultures of lymphoma cell lines in tissue culture plates, without taking into account the lymphoid microenvironment, where these cancers arise and reside. The overall goal of this IMAT R33 proposal is advanced development and validation of organoids platform technology for lymphoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts, and answer unsolved questions related to DLBCL resistance and heterogeneity. This propose research will develop and validate an experimental therapeutics platform, named LETSSGo (Lymphoma-on-chip Engineered Technology for Single-Organoid Sequencing and Genomics). LETSSGO is an technology to culture lymphoma cell lines and patient derived xenografts in a microscale lymphoid-like microenvironment and integrate with single organoids genomic analysis by means of DNA barcoding. Following 3 aims will be pursued: Aim 1: Engineer and validate a lymphoma-specific mico-organoids platform for single and multi-cell encapsulation of ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL cell lines; Aim 2: Integrate drug treated micro- organoids with DNA barcoding for single-organoid genomics to determine tumor resistance as a function of tumor size and cell number; Aim 3: Engineer lymphoma patient derived xenograft micro-organoids of DLBCL and determine growth rate and heterogeneity in gene expression and DNA methylation as compared to mouse PDXs If successful, our technology will change the way scientists understood initiation and progression of lymphomas, enable mechanistic understanding of the role of tumor microenvironment and clonal heterogeneity, provide prognostic values and increase ?predictive power? of pre-clinical studies for drugs in development, and importantly, will allow a faster and more rational screening and translation of therapeutic regimens."
"9213305","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Despite the hope that pharmacogenomics (PGx) will improve the risk-benefit ratio of certain medications, there is little empiric evidence about how PGx might impact patient outcomes such as drug safety and effectiveness. The research activities in this career development award will use simvastatin PGx as a model of the impact of genomic medicine on patient outcomes. Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that have dramatically reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death in millions of Americans. Statins can also cause muscle injury (myopathy) ranging from mild muscle aches to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified a locus in the SLCO1B1 gene that is associated with the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Up to twenty percent of Americans carry at least one copy of the C allele at SLCO1B1 rs4149056, which increases the risk of myopathy greater than four-fold. PGx testing for the SLCO1B1 locus might improve the safety of statin use in patient care. However, at the same time, SLCO1B1 testing may result in insufficient statin dosing for a given patient's level of CVD risk. To examine the impact of statin PGx on patient outcomes, this project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of SLCO1B1 testing in a Veteran patient population. First, metrics will be developed for statin-related patient outcomes in  the VA health system. VA provider notes will be used to develop and validate a natural language processing algorithm to identify statin myopathy from text from the electronic health record. VA clinical and administrative data will be used to develop informatics-based approaches to categorize Veterans into American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) CVD risk categorizes and determine whether their statin doses are appropriate for their level of CVD risk. These metrics will then be used as outcomes for a randomized controlled trial determining the impact of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 testing on statin safety and appropriate statin dosing among 408 VA primary care patients. Veterans at higher CVD risk will be randomized to undergo SLCO1B1 testing versus no testing in the course of usual primary care. After one year, the two groups will be compared regarding the occurrence of statin myopathy, cholesterol levels, and concordance with ACC/AHA guidelines for CVD prevention and PGx guidelines for simvastatin safety. In addition to gathering empiric evidence about the impact of statin PGx on Veteran health outcomes, this career development award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in translational genomics, PGx, and innovative randomized controlled trial design. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for his long-term goal of a research career in translational genomics that informs how genomic medicine might be used to improve Veteran health."
"9203610","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With 160 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous African nation, and home to the second largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world (3.5 million). In Nigeria and other resource-limited countries (RLS), loss to follow-u (LTFU) poses a major challenge to the successful provision of chronic HIV care. One in four patients are lost-to-follow-up one year after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), resulting in loss of over half of the life expectancy gains provided by ART. While some patients are completely lost from HIV care, a lesser-studied group, approximately one in three, briefly interrupt but return to care. Our previous work in South Africa suggests that unplanned care interruptions portend poor patient outcomes. Many studies have characterized patient-level predictors of LTFU, but this knowledge has not enabled service providers to adequately improve patient retention. In addition, few studies have systematically assessed whether health system-level characteristics, which vary widely across treatment programs, predict LTFU and unplanned care interruption. Missing from the assessment of both patient and health system-level predictors of LTFU is an assessment of how these factors inform patient decisions to remain in HIV care, a concept known as decisional conflict. My goal in this proposed K23 award is to utilize a novel framework incorporating health system and patient-level predictors of LTFU and unplanned care interruption, with determinants of patient decisional conflict. This will inform development of a pilot intervention to improve patient retention in HIV care in Nigeria. To accomplish this goal, I will study the AIDS Prevention Initiative Nigeria's (APIN) network in 32 comprehensive HIV treatment centers in 9 of Nigeria's 36 states. I will first investigate health system factors predictive of LTFU and unplanned care interruption by surveying clinic directors on a range of health system services available to their patients, and assessing outcomes of 1,500 patients over one year. I will then establish a cohort of 752 ART-eligible adults to determine the relationship of patient risk factors related to decisional conflict (disease severity stigma, resource deprivation and competing needs) about adhering to chronic HIV care, and the association between decisional conflict and both LTFU and unplanned care interruption one year after ART initiation. Finally, I will build on these findings to develop a pilot intervention n HIV-infected, ART-eligible patients based on a home-based HIV care construct to ameliorate decisional conflict by addressing both health system processes and patient obstacles to HIV care. The research proposed in this K23 award will build on my previous training in epidemiology and biostatistics, allow me to receive further training in quality improvement theory and methodology as well as technical expertise in large program evaluation and intervention design, and will ideally position me to launch my career as an investigator in HIV outcomes and implementation science in RLS."
"9315425","Sickle-trait hemoglobin protects African children from severe-life threatening falciparum malaria, but the mechanisms of this protection are incompletely understood. Several lines of evidence support the notion that hemoglobin mutations disrupt the expression of parasite-derived proteins on the surface of the infected red blood cell (iRBC). These proteins on the iRBC surface mediate the pathogenicity of the parasite, and therefore identifying mechanisms by which their expression can be disrupted will offer new strategies to neutralize the parasite. In our preliminary experiments, sickle-trait dramatically alters the strong, periodic transcriptional program of P. falciparum as it matures within the RBC. More specifically, during early parasite maturation we observe consistent reductions in the expression of transcripts encoding parasite proteins that are essential for the organization and loading of Maurer?s clefts, including MAHRP1 and 2, REX 1 and 2, and SBP1; these proteins are necessary for normal trafficking of other parasite proteins to the iRBC surface. Notably, sickle-trait did not reduce the expression of transcripts encoding either surface proteins ? including PfEMP1, KAHRP and other variant surface antigens ? or components of the parasite translocation machinery, suggesting that sickle-trait specifically attenuates the efficient loading of protein transport machinery. In this project, we propose to systematically compare transcriptomes of Plasmodium falciparum parasites growing in normal and sickle-trait RBCs in order to identify parasite gene expression networks that are disrupted by sickle-trait. We hypothesize that sickle-trait will produce early, pervasive aberrations in the expression of parasite transcripts encoding proteins necessary for the assembly of protein export machinery. To test this, we will first cultivate field and reference parasites in normal and sickle-trait RBCs, densely sample parasite transcriptomes during the asexual blood stage, and serially compute gene expression networks. Additionally, we will assay parasite transcriptomes collected from malarious Malian children and compare parasite gene expression in those with normal and sickle-trait RBCs. Through this project, we will directly identify upstream components of the parasite?s protein export network that are inhibited by sickle-trait hemoglobin. Because sickle-trait serves as a model of attenuated parasite pathogenesis, these transcriptional profiles will be associated with clinical protection from malaria. The identification of transcripts and proteins that are impacted by sickle-trait will offer fresh targets for future interventions to neutralize the parasite."
"9237202","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Approximately 9% of the United States population have chronic kidney disease, although, this prevalence is even higher in Veterans given the high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (underlying causes of CKD) in this patient population. Out of this staggering number, approximately 450,000 patients have end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring maintenance dialysis. The number of patients with ESRD is expected to increase to 700,000 by 2020. Five year survival for patients on dialysis is about 35%, a rate worse than many cancers. Half of these deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, investigations aimed at discovering novel pathways/molecules that can identify patients at high risk for CVD are of vital importance. Furthermore, these pathways can be explored to identify potential targets for therapy. Given the critical role HDL plays in prevention and reversal of CVD, studies aimed at evaluating and improving HDL function in ESRD patients are of considerable clinical and therapeutic value."

"9196366","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are essential biological adaptor molecules connecting mRNA to protein synthesis. Given their important biological role, correct maturation and modification of tRNAs is strictly required for cell health and viability. Ths is particularly salient in mitochondria, where mitochondrial tRNA gene mutations are the prevalent cause of mitochondrial disease. In organellar genomes, tRNAs punctuate rRNA and protein coding genes, making 5' end processing of tRNA transcripts essential not only for tRNA maturation, but also for the 3' end processing of the preceding sequences. Across all domains of life, tRNA 5' end maturation is catalyzed by the essential enzyme ribonuclease P (RNase P). Until recently all known RNase P enzymes were thought to include a catalytic RNA component. However, the discovery of Protein Only RNase P (PRORP) in human mitochondria and A. thaliana chloroplasts, mitochondria, and nuclei has shifted this paradigm. Correct tRNA maturation by PRORP is essential for human health; mutations in PRORP and its substrates that disrupt tRNA 5' end processing are linked to diseases including maternally inherited essential hypertension, mitochondrial myopathy, MELAS, and HSD10- disease. Our work will use biophysical, biochemical and cell- biological techniques to determine the structure and mechanism of PRORPs, as well as develop an in vivo model system for assessing the physiological role of PRORPs. These studies will establish a framework for understanding the molecular basis of, and ultimately treating, a range of mitochondrial diseases. Together, our highly interdisciplinary work will provide the first structural and mechanistic information on mitochondrial tRNA 5' end processing in higher eukaryotes."
"9212009","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term research goal is to improve innate skeletal muscle growth and body composition in the fetus, neonate, and adult affected by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Impaired muscle growth as a result of IUGR is a major contributor to lifelong reductions in muscle mass (sarcopenia) and metabolic disease risk, making restoration of muscle mass during the perinatal period a high priority. Our overarching aim is to determine the mechanisms that link low fetal amino acid (AA) supply and decreased fetal insulin concentrations from placental insufficiency to decreased muscle growth, and to test whether supplemental AA and/or insulin could restore muscle growth in the IUGR fetus. Our published and preliminary data have identified three key pathways that contribute to reduced numbers of myofibers and decreased myofiber hypertrophy in the IUGR fetus: suppressed myoblast proliferation, reduced muscle amino acid (AA) uptake, and increased protein breakdown. We hypothesize that the restoration of insulin concentrations and AA supply during critical developmental windows of myogenesis will restore proliferative and hypertrophic responses in IUGR fetal muscle. We will use a sheep model of placental insufficiency-induced IUGR that mimics human IUGR to measure muscle-specific growth both in vivo and in vitro. In Aim 1, we will determine the proliferative activity of fetal myoblasts and their response to restoring insulin concentrations. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which myofiber hypertrophy fails and whether increasing AA supply improves myofiber growth. Finally, in a proof-of-concept Aim 3, we will correct both insulin and AA during appropriate developmental windows to test whether their combination is required to restore skeletal muscle mass in the IUGR fetus. Permanently compromised muscle growth resulting from IUGR is an important contributor to diabetes, obesity, and other serious chronic health issues that are epidemic in the United States. Currently, no therapies are available to treat IUGR prior to the onset of deficits that permanently limit muscle growth. Comprehensive investigation into the key factors that regulate fetal muscle growth at a physiological, cellular, and molecular level is a prerequisite fo designing novel approaches to restore muscle growth, setting the stage for future efforts to preempt the complications of IUGR related to low muscle mass."

It has been shown that MSC's have great potential for treatment of bone disorders such as osteoporosis and bone fracture. Success of MSC therapy largely depends on the number of MSC on the bone surface. Our collaborator from UC Davis has developed a novel method to considerably increase the homing and osteogenic differentiation of MSC's on the surface of bone. However, further progress in this promising area of research is required on in vivo technique to observe the grafted cells overtime. Researchers from University of Minnesota (our second collaborator in this project) developed a new MRI pulse sequence, which is able to image ultra-fast relaxing spines. In this project we will implement this new imaging technique to detect therapeutic MSCs in bone tissue. We will develop MSCs labeling procedure and SWIFT acquisition protocol for in vivo detection of grafted MSCs in bone tissue. With help of SWIFT pulse sequence it would be possible to generate a positive MR signal from iron labeled cells, which was not conceivable with traditional MR imaging. The proposed method will be very useful in all areas of stem cell therapy and have a profound impact on stem cell treatment of bone degenerative diseases and fracture repair."

The research laboratories are well equipped with the latest instrumentation for neurochemical and behavioral testing."
"9215647","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low back pain is a multi-factorial disease with high socioeconomic cost. Conditions including degeneration of intervertebral discs (IVD), pathology of vertebral body, and fracture of vertebral endplate all are closely associated with low back pain. Disco-vertebral junction is the interface between the IVD and vertebral body, and plays important roles in nutrition of the IVD via vascular canals in the adjacent vertebral body, as well as in biomechanical support during loading. Abnormal changes in structure, composition and function of the DVJ may occur in diseases and aging, which may hinder nutrient transport and lead to IVD degeneration, as well as degeneration of the vertebral body. The long-term goal of this study is to establish a non-invasive imaging technique for a comprehensive evaluation of the whole lumbar spine. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used routinely, conventional MR techniques such as spin echo sequence are unable to detect sufficient MR signal from the DVJ, and little is known about MR characteristics of the region. We have recently shown in that Ultrashort Time-to-Echo (UTE) MRI, but not conventional MRI, is able to evaluate the DVJ directly in human lumbar spines. As the next step, we seek to determine if UTE MRI can detect abnormal and pathologic changes in structure, composition, transport-function the DVJ, which may be related to degeneration of the IVD and vertebral body. Finally, we seek to translate the techniques to evaluate the DVJ, IVD, and vertebral body in normal and low back pain human subjects. This study will establish the foundation and rationale for UTE MR evaluation of the DVJ, and help to better understand pathoetiology of disc degeneration."
"9407814","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Even as population health improves and longevity increases around the globe, there will always be more biomedical problems than solutions. Strategically prioritizing and allocating the limited societal resources to discover and develop cost-effective pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other diagnostics for diseases and medical conditions with the highest return on investment motivates many governmental and private funding agencies, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, clinicians and scientists. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the biomedical research ecosystem and the scarcity of relevant data, no systematic studies have been done to comprehensively survey the past allocation of resources (i.e., funding, attention from the scientific community, clinical development) or guide the future redistribution of resources for maximal societal benefit.  The goal of this project is to create a health research opportunity index (health ROI), an innovative quantitative measure to gauge the imbalance between the disease burden associated with a particular disease or medical condition as a whole and the resources allocated to it over time. The project has the following specific aims: 1) collect data on key measurable factors related to biomedical research resource allocation; 2) develop and evaluate quantitative models; and 3) build a visualization tool to represent and interpret high- dimensional data. More specifically, sophisticated text mining and terminology-mapping methods will be developed to identify and quantify seven key factors in biomedical research ecosystem (i.e., burden of disease, focus of the scientific community, clinical development popularity, current availability of diagnostics and medicine, funding, attention from public media and intellectual property protection). By integrating this data, the health ROI will be calculated for about 1,400 medical conditions over a 10-year period, and ignored niches will be identified for future research. The high-dimensional data and results will be represented and delivered to various stakeholders along the healthcare value chain using an interactive visualization tool to facilitate their decision making. In additio to advancing the field of health policy and management and position, this career development award will position the principal investigator as an independent researcher at the intersection of informatics and public health."
"9390732","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation have led to volumes of information about the hematopoietic stem cell. Despite this extensive knowledge, the identity of cells and cell products that provide the extrinsic control of HSC fate remain largely unknown, but are attributed to cells and cell products of the bone marrow microenvironment (ME). A Novel 3D culture system incorporating cells suspended in a matrix together with endothelial lined vessels provides a new way to interrogate cell interactions within the complex ME. Utilizing well characterized stromal cell lines that are functionally distinct, we will build a 3D ME to mimic the signaling thought to occur via cell to cell interactions in vivo. W will then introduce gene modified CD34+ cells transduced with a mCherry gene under the control of the megakaryocyte lineage specific promoter PF-4 to detect lineage commitment in these cells. Once the commitment assay is standardized, we will test the hypothesis that monocytes in contact with stromal cells play a critical role in defining the functionality of the M, particularly as it relates to sustaining the uncommitted state. We anticipate that monocytes together with specific stromal cells will provide signals that function to prevent commitment. To test the function of the non GFP+ and presumably uncommitted cells, we will remove the cells from the cultures and test their ability to produce multi-lineage progeny in expansion cultures and NOD/SCID assays. If we can demonstrate the maintenance of multi-potentiality, with or without cell division, future studies can use knockdown techniques to identify the pathways involved."
"9247195","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The studies proposed in this application will expand our understanding of lens biology through functional analysis of causal mutations liable for cataractogenesis. This proposal employs two specific aims to accomplish the proposed goals. In the first aim, we will identify genes that harbor cataract causing mutations using a combination of traditional genetics tools and a more recent exon capture technique coupled with next generation sequencing. Our methodology represents a powerful paradigm to unveil mutations that trigger cataractogenesis. In the second aim, we will expand on our recent discovery, that loss of function mutations in the novel autophagy component FYCO1 cause cataract, by elucidating its physiological significance in lens development and maintenance of lens transparency and examining the possible role of autophagy in cataractogenesis. Establishment of autophagy as an essential pathway for the maintenance of lens transparency will not only advance our knowledge of lens function, it will truly reveal a new paradigm in the field of lens biology that will provide a basis for multiple new and important lens studies."
"9206975","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A missense single-nucleotide polymorphism in the PTPN22 gene causing an R620W substitution in the PTPN22 protein is one of the strongest genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis. No consensus model has yet emerged on how PTPN22 increases risk of rheumatoid arthritis. As PTPN22 is a negative regulator of signaling through the T cell receptor, most studies to date have focused on the effect of the polymorphism on adaptive immune cell signaling. Here we wish to explore the concept that PTPN22-W620 impinges on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis through an action on myeloid cell signaling as well. Recent studies from our laboratory revealed a novel function of PTPN22 as a promoter of type 1 interferon release after engagement of myeloid cell toll-like receptors. Within this pathway, rheumatoid arthritis- predisposing PTPN22-W620 behaves as a loss-of-function variant, and macrophages and dendritic cells expressing PTPN22-W620 display a defect in toll-like receptor-induced type 1 interferon production. Type 1 interferon production by myeloid cells triggers several immunosuppressive mechanisms that protect from rheumatoid arthritis in mouse models. These include IL-27-mediated inhibition of arthritogenic Th17 cell differentiation and IL-1Ra-mediated suppression of inflammation in the rheumatoid joint. Here we hypothesize that loss of function of PTPN22 in dendritic cells and macrophages predisposes to rheumatoid arthritis by reducing type 1 interferon-dependent immunosuppressive mechanism. We will test our hypothesis by exploring whether loss of function of PTPN22 promotes myeloid cell-dependent differentiation of arthritogenic Th17 cells (Aim 1) and IL-1 mediated joint inflammation (Aim 2). In Aim 3 we will assess whether loss-of-function of PTPN22 or carriage of PTPN22-W620 impairs the immunoregulatory ability of human myeloid cells. By defining immunological mechanisms that are defective in carriers of the PTPN22-W620 variant, our study will suggest new strategies for personalized therapy of rheumatoid arthritis in genetically predisposed individuals."
"9253730","Aberrant signal transduction resulting from dysregulated phosphorylation is a hallmark of human cancer. Targeted cancer therapies are predominantly inhibitors of oncogenic kinases. While these drugs have had some clinical success, an alternative approach ? inactivation of kinase signaling by stimulating endogenous phosphatases ? has received minimal attention. Recently, our group has developed a novel series of small molecule activators of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a negative regulator of multiple oncogenic signaling proteins, as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers. PP2A is a heterotrimeric complex whose substrate specificity is dependent on one of 23 different regulatory subunits that can bind to form over 60 distinct holoenzyme complexes. Broad inhibition of holoenzyme formation using specific PP2A inhibitors, specifically the overexpression of the small T antigen of the SV40 tumor virus, renders cells resistant to SMAP therapy. This suggests that the formation of PP2A trimeric complexes is necessary for SMAP activity. However, from these studies the specific role of individual regulatory subunits in regulating the biological effects of SMAP activation of PP2A remains unclear. Preliminary data generated by targeted knockdown of a series of PP2A regulatory subunits demonstrated that specific subunit knockdown of PR72 attenuated SMAP activity in both cellular and in vivo models systems. Specifically, targeted reduction of PR72 but not B55 and B56 regulatory subunit family members resulted in blunted induction of PARP cleavage in SMAP treated cells. Additionally, stable PR72 knockdown resulted in abrogation of SMAP activity in a H358 xenograft model. Collectively, this data suggests that the PR72 regulatory subunit plays a critical role in small molecule mediated activation of PP2A's tumor suppressive activity. Here we propose to test the role of a single PP2A regulatory subunit, PR72, in mediating PP2A-dependent apoptosis using gain and loss of function experiments. The three interconnected specific aims are specifically directed at (1) determining the dependence on PR72 for PP2A-mediated cell death, (2) determining the signaling events regulated by the PR72 holoenzymes, and (3) defining the effect of SMAP binding to PP2A on PR72 holoenzyme stability."

"9259032","Project Summary Background: The gate theory of pain predicts that inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn act as ?gate control? elements to mediate interaction between innocuous and noxious stimuli. It has been postulated that release of this inhibitory gate allows innocuous mechanical stimuli to access the nociceptive pathway resulting in tactile allodynia following nerve injury. Increasing evidence demonstrates an excitatory pathway involving PKC?-expressing interneurons that is held silent under nonpathological conditions via a strong feedforward inhibitory gate by local interneurons. Failure of the inhibitory control on PKC?-expressing interneurons is believed to underly tactile alloynia. In the neuropathic pain state failure of the inhibitory gate is due to a BDNF- dependent reduction in inhibitory tone mediated by a change in chloride homeostasis resulting from altered expression of chloride cotransporters. Current data demonstrates that the precursor protein VGF (non- acronymic) is upregulated in the spinal cord following nerve injury, and preliminary data suggest that the VGF- derived neuropeptide TLQP-62 induces BDNF signaling in the spinal cord. Objective: We hypothesize that TLQP-62 contributes to tactile allodynia following nerve injury by mediating a BDNF-dependent central sensitization reliant on a reduction in inhibitory tone. The proposed studies will characterize this newly identified mediator of neuroplasticity and its contribution to the development of neuropathic pain. The mechanistic understanding acquired will advance our search for new therapeutic interventions and biomarkers for neuropathic pain. Specific aims: 1) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in inducing BDNF-dependent changes in chloride cotransporter expression after nerve injury, using biochemical approaches. 2) Determine the function of TLQP- 62 in the development of reduced inhibitory tone following nerve injury, patch-clamp recording and calcium imaging in spinal cord slices. 3) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in opening of the feedforward inhibitory gate, using in vivo electrophysiology."
"9212767","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have developed an innovative dosage form for vaginal drug delivery using polymeric fibers fabricated by electrospinning. Drug-eluting fibers exhibit unique materials and processing features that distinguish them from existing microbicide products. Our work to date has shown the versatility of polymer fibers for rapid and sustained delivery of diverse ARV drugs alone and in combination, to fabricate composite materials of varying microstructure, and to be produced using a manufacturing-scale electrospinning process. However, the further advancement and development of any single microbicide drug delivery system must prioritize that the product embody physical attributes that impact user perceptions without compromising the design for biological efficacy. While our previous results advance the concept of using drug-eluting fibers as a new dosage form for topical delivery of combination ARV drugs for HIV prevention, the feasibility of this new platform technology to be designed for chemoprophylactic protective efficacy against vaginal HIV challenge while exhibiting bulk material properties with adequate user perceptibility (geometry, texture, dissolution time and viscosity) has not been demonstrated. We propose here a project framework to inform the design of a first-generation fiber-based topical microbicide that is constrained for functions prioritized from user perception and NHP safety/PK studies. This proposal integrates three primary research areas: (i) Fiber DDS prototype design and formulation; (ii) User-guided product design and evaluation, and (iii) NHP safety/PK and efficacy testing. Our framework is an iterative process to design, test, and select lead candidate fiber DDS prototypes that are optimized for user perceptions (Aim 1) and biological safety/PK (Aim 2), before advancing to a vaginal challenge efficacy study in NHPs (Aim 3). We selected a novel triple ARV drug combination to demonstrate the strength of the fiber DDS to deliver agents that are physico-chemically diverse, have differing mechanisms of action against HIV, and show instantaneous inhibitory potential in combination to halt virus replication. We also propose to design fiber fabrics that modulate drug release for both pericoital and sustained protection. Finally, we incorporate incisive product acceptability studies early in the preclinical development of a new microbicide product to help guide the design of the formulation's biophysical and other attributes to have the greatest impact on user adherence. These studies will be the first to confirm that fiber-base microbicides can be designed to prioritize physical properties that are critical to the user experience, while at the same time prioritizing functional properties that prevent vaginal HIV infection. The broader impact of these innovations will support the rapid advancement of a fiber microbicide to first-in-human clinical trials."
"9428756","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever, the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral illness in humans (NIAID Category A pathogen). Globally, the four serotypes of DENV cause an estimated 100 million new cases of dengue fever and 250,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) per year. Currently, no specific therapy is available, and vaccines are still in early stages of development. Given that the most advanced tetravalent live attenuated DENV vaccine candidate showed a poor 30% overall efficacy rate in a recently published phase 2b clinical trial, there remains a pressing need for new approaches for safe, effective vaccines. In the first cycle of this R01 we developed a large panel of ~500 novel monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against all four DENV serotypes and analyzed the structural, biophysical, and cellular mechanisms of Ab-mediated neutralization of several of them. These studies defined novel epitopes on DENV E proteins recognized by inhibitory antibodies (Abs), many of which are not solvent-accessible according to existing atomic models of the virus particle. Our studies revealed that the structure of DENV was more complex than anticipated and is likely a heterogeneous and structurally dynamic ensemble of different states, each of which may interact differentially with Ab. In this renewal application, we propose to define the spectrum of structural states sampled by the DENV virion, determine the structural basis of differential neutralization of individual DENV serotype by cross-reactive, fusion-loop specific Abs, and assess the role of anti-prM Abs in recognition and neutralization of DENV. This information will be translated into developing a novel inactivated vaccine strategy that traps DENV particles in structural states that preferentially elicit highly neutralizing Abs."
"9238465","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a large endocytic receptor that recognizes numerous, unrelated ligands; however, LRP1 also functions in signal transduction pathways and can interact with other cellular receptors. Highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), recent studies reveal an important role for LRP1 in embryonic vascular development. LRP1 maintains vascular wall integrity and conveys atheroprotective effects, and deletion of LRP1 in VSMC results in disruption of elastic layers, tortuous aorta, aneurysm formation, increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis, and increased neointima formation upon vascular injury. Currently, the mechanism by which LRP1 modulates these processes is unknown. Using the well characterized carotid artery ligation model to investigate vascular remodeling and employing mice in which LRP1 is selectively deleted from VSMC (smLRP1-/-), preliminary studies reveal a major role for LRP1 in attenuating injury-induced neointima formation. To define a potential mechanism by which LRP1 regulates vascular remodeling, studies have been focused on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and vascular remodeling. Excessive intimal hyperplasia is observed upon vascular injury in smLRP1-/- mice and is correlated with elevated levels of transforming growth factor ? (TGF-?) signaling; furthermore, neointima formation is completely ablated with losartan treatment, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist. The central hypothesis of this application is that LRP1 regulates vascular remodeling by modulating angiotensin II-mediated signaling. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: (1) Determine if smooth muscle LRP1 protects against injury-induced intimal hyperplasia in an angiotensin II-dependent mechanism and (2) Define the mechanisms by which LRP1 attenuates the angiotensin II-mediated signaling pathway. Studies will be performed on LRP1+/+ and smLRP1-/- mice subjected to vascular injury and treated with various anti-hypertensive drugs or a TGF-? neutralizing antibody. Blood pressure will be monitored throughout treatment and carotid arteries will be subsequently analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR. Migration and proliferation studies utilizing pathway-specific inhibitors will also be performed on VSMC isolated from LRP1+/+ and smLRP1-/- mice. The overall objective of this application is to determine the specific mechanism by which LRP1 regulates vascular remodeling. Defining the role of LRP1 in vascular remodeling may reveal novel strategies to prevent or retard the development of stenosis, reduce the incidence of restenosis in patients, and improve overall cardiovascular health."
"9233753","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic and life-threatening illness, afflicting over 10% of the adult population in the United States. However nearly 40% of MDD patients are treatment resistant. The lack of universally effective antidepressant treatments may be due to our incomplete understanding of the brain regions responsible for mediating depression. Studies with preclinical animal models of depression and brain imaging of human patients have implicated the mesocorticolimbic ventral tegmental area (VTA) reward circuitry, which has been understudied in depression. Recent studies have implicated VTA hyperactivity in mediating susceptibility to depression-related behaviors in chronic social defeat stress, a well-established animal model of depression. Further research is required to fully characterize the mechanisms by which stress induces pathological alterations in the VTA at the level of neural circuitry. Our preliminary studies focusing on the lateral hypothalamus (LH) input to the VTA (LH-VTA) indicate that LH-VTA hyperactivity mediates susceptibility. Mimicking the increase in firing activity of LH-VTA neurons by the use of photostimulation with optogenetics, an approach that can increase neuronal activity through light-sensitive channels in behaving animals, induces depression-like behaviors. In addition, our preliminary work indicates that LH-released hypocretin (orexin), a neuropeptide known to regulate reward, arousal and wakefulness, may mediate the VTA neuron responses to social defeat stress. In this proposal, I will use in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic approaches to investigate whether there are pathophysiological alterations in VTA neuron subpopulations induced by LH-VTA photostimulation, as well as how hypocretin regulates VTA neuron subpopulations in social defeat stress. These studies will provide insight into the role of LH-VTA neural circuitry in depression and reveal novel targets for antidepressant development."

"9220716","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deciding how to most effectively use limited resources for malaria control requires accurate measures of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), which varies dramatically over space and time, especially in response to interventions. Unfortunately, for routine monitoring and surveillance, existing measures are limited by high costs or low accuracy. The force of infection (FOI, number of infections per person time) can be measured in cohort studies, giving accurate measures of exposure, but at too much expense to be practical beyond research settings. Parasite prevalence (parasite rate, PR), can be measured using cross-sectional surveys and is therefore more affordable, but is limited in accuracy as a measure of exposure. Serologic assays offer the potential to provide data approaching the quality of FOI at the cost of obtaining PR. Our preliminary data demonstrate that measurement of appropriately chosen antibody responses can provide quantitative information about an individual's prior exposure, yielding precise information about exposure within and between communities as well as changes over time. The goal of this project is to develop an informative set of novel serologic assays for low-cost and accurate estimation of Pf exposure in countries with a range of malaria endemicity. Our overall hypothesis is that these assays will provide more accurate estimates of exposure than PR across the spectrum of Pf exposure intensity. We are in a unique position to develop and evaluate these assays, with access to samples and data from more than two dozen longitudinal studies spanning 4 continents, and a team with substantial expertise in relevant laboratory and analytical methods. Our preliminary data demonstrate proof of concept for the approach outlined in our Aims, indicating that this approach is likely to succeed and that our team has the capacity to successfully carry out the proposed work. This study has 3 aims: 1) To identify a limited number of serologic markers most predictive of Pf exposure. We will use a protein microarray to screen antibody responses to 1000 Pf antigens in subjects with a range of ages and exposure settings, with well-characterized exposure histories. 2) To develop a set of simple, accurate serologic assays to evaluate Pf exposure. We will use a multiplex bead array to evaluate the detailed kinetics of antibody responses identified in Aim 1 using longitudinal samples, and use these data to develop ELISA-based assays to estimate FOI from cross-sectional surveys. 3) To compare serology vs. PR as estimates of exposure using FOI as the gold standard. Using independent samples, we will compare the ability of serology vs. PR to estimate exposure in communities, quantify changes in exposure within communities over time, and detect spatial hotspots within communities. We anticipate that this project will develop and validate a simple, yet powerful new tool for malaria control and elimination that will dramatically improve the accuracy of global Pf surveillance, facilitating rational malaria control and elimination policy."
"9190657","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that impacts multiple sensorimotor systems, including communication and swallowing. Disordered communication and swallowing in PD can result in severe negative health and psychosocial consequences. Early identification of communication and swallowing changes has the potential to improve outcomes in these patients. However, changes in communication and swallowing function in early PD are subtle, and therefore difficult to identify with current clinical methods. The proposed research aims to narrow this significant gap in clinical practice by identifying and developing tests that can detect subtle changes in cranial and limb movements in early PD. An ideal candidate variable for determining early sensorimotor deficits is within-individual motor variability. Variability in repeated limb movements has been established as a clinical sign in early PD. However, this has not fully been determined in communication, and only recently done so by our laboratory for swallowing behaviors. The proposed research will assemble a battery of tests to evaluate motor variability in the domains of voice, swallowing, gait, and finger-tapping. Because the onset and progression of PD is often monitored by deficits in limb function and because limb and cranial motor function dissociate in terms of treatment, it is important to determine how changes in voice and swallowing are related to limb deficits. Further, detecting subtle motor variability could aid in diagnosis of early/pre-clinical PD. As such, the proposed research has two specific aims: 1) To characterize relationships among and between cranial and limb motor variability in patients with PD and 2) To identify the cranial and/or limb assays reflecting motor variability that will accurately identify patients with early PD from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. To address these aims, we will evaluate motor variability in patients with early-stage PD in order to determine profiles of cranial and limb motor changes and then use these variables to classify patients with early PD vs. age and sex-matched controls. Our central hypotheses are that: a) patients with PD will exhibit within-individual motor variability in voice, swallowing, and limb motor tasks separately, but will show patterns of motor variability that manifest as more of a cranial or limb motor profile; and b) cranial and/or limb motor variability will sufficiently differentiate individuals with PD from healthy controls. Communication and swallowing deficits are under- diagnosed and under-treated in PD, representing a significant detriment to health and quality of life. Results from these studies can provide improved clinical methods to identify early and subtle communication and swallowing dysfunction in PD. Early diagnosis can then lead to optimized treatments, including neuroprotective strategies."
"9393604","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major problem in treating cocaine addiction is the long lasting vulnerability to relapse, even after months of abstinence. This persistent vulnerability suggests that long lasting neuroadaptations contribute to relapse behavior. Understanding these persistent adaptations is critical to the development of therapeutic agents. Our lab uses a rat model of cocaine addiction, termed the incubation model, in which cue-induced cocaine craving progressively intensifies (incubates) over the first 2 months of withdrawal from extended access cocaine self-administration. We focus on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region critically involved in the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse. We showed previously that Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) accumulate in excitatory synapses onto medium spiny neurons of the NAc after 3-4 weeks of withdrawal and then persist for months. Once they accumulate in NAc synapses, these CP-AMPARs mediate the expression of incubated cue-induced cocaine craving. Therefore mechanisms regulating CP-AMPARs are potential therapeutic targets. While our previous work has gathered detailed information on AMPAR plasticity during incubation, little is known about how NMDARs or structural alterations to dendritic spines contribute. Prior studies examining these parameters have typically used non-contingent cocaine regimens which are not directly useful for assessing cocaine craving. The objective of this proposal is to characterize spine morphology and glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling in NAc dendritic spines at a withdrawal time before CP-AMPARs accumulate (WD15) and a time after CP-AMPAR accumulation (WD35), to identify plasticity at the single spine level that is associated with CP-AMPAR accumulation. My central hypothesis is that incubation is accompanied by dendritic spine remodeling that involves the formation of spines that contain CP-AMPARs but not NMDARs. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Characterize dendritic spine density and morphology in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) during incubation of cocaine craving. Single NAc neurons will be filled with Lucifer yellow, imaged with confocal microscopy, and analyzed with NeuronStudio software. 2) Determine if cocaine and control rats differ in NMDAR and AMPAR mediated Ca2+ influx at the individual spine level in NAc MSN. 2-photon Ca2+ imaging with concurrent electrophysiological measurements will be used to analyze the contribution of CP-AMPARs and NMDARs to Ca2+ signaling in NAc spines on WD15 or WD35 from saline or cocaine self-administration. Caged NMDA and AMPA compounds will be used to dissect functional contributions of NMDARs and CP-AMPARs at the single spine level. These studies will provide a novel window on cocaine-induced neuroadaptations at the single spine level and further our understanding of relationships between glutamate receptor and spine plasticity. While this work is underway, I will participate in a Training Plan that employs coursework, mentoring, and collaborative interactions to develop the non-bench skills needed to reach my goal of becoming a PI in an academic setting."
"9240749","Project Summary Ethanol-induced changes in the brain transcriptome underlie the development and persistence of  alcohol use disorder (AUD). INIA-N investigators and others have discovered that ethanol induces  specific and dramatic alterations in a highly restricted group of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  includes long ncRNAs (lncRNAs).  We posit that these ethanol responsive lncRNAs coordinate AUD  brain transcriptomes.  Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that individual lncRNAs are key  regulators of ethanol drinking.  To test this hypothesis, genetically engineered mice with altered  expression of lncRNAs will be created and analyzed.  Those mutant lines with altered drinking  behavior will be scrutinized for mechanistic insight by multiple INIA-N investigators. A barrier to the study of ncRNA function in brain is the dearth of efficient methods of  noninvasively delivering ncRNAs and/or ncRNA antagonists to large portions of the brain. Here we  posit that intransally administered exosomes (endogenously produced, liposome like nanoparticles)  can be harnessed to deliver ncRNA anatagonists or mimics throughout the brain. This approach can  also be used to deliver drugs preferentially to brain.  Such an approach would target drugs  selectively to the desired site of action (brain) while avoiding peripheral toxicities that limit  therapeutic efficacy. Because this approach has the dual benefits of target specificity and  noninvasiveness, it has tremendous translational potential.  Specific Aim 2 will test the  hypothesis that exosomes can be harnessed as effective ncRNA/drug delivery vehicles to modulate  ethanol drinking. Genetically engineered rodents permit investigation of the involvement of putative ethanol targets  in the context of whole animal behavioral responses.  Because hypotheses concerning putative  ethanol targets must ultimately explain ethanol-induced behavioral phenotypes, whole-animal  experiments represent the most rigorous test of relevance.  To this end, Specific Aim 3 will create  designer mice for both INIA-N and INIA-Stress investigators. Genetically engineered animals will be  produced using state of the art CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology.  This collaborative Specific  Aim is the continuation of the INIA-West Genetically Engineered Rodents Core that was funded during  the previous project period."
"9415483","PROJECT SUMIVIARY (See Instructions): The overarching goal of our proposed project, SuCCESS: Studying Colorectal Cancer: Effectiveness of Screening Strategies, is to develop evidence to inform personalized screening recommendations that maintain most or all of the benefits of intensive screening, minimize risks and costs, and respect patient preferences. Based within Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), the SuCCESS project will draw on a wide array of rich electronic data sources available at Group Health (GH), an integrated health care delivery system in Washington State, to gather information about risk factors, screening patterns, diagnostic procedures, pathology, treatment, and cancer outcomes among GH enrollees. The SuCCESS project will use GH data to describe colorectal cancer (CRC) screening as practiced, including behaviors and effectiveness, and will build on this information to examine the potential for personalized screening regimens.  We propose 3 linked projects related to this overall goal. Project 1, Comparative effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening as practiced, will provide information about how screening is practiced, about patient decisions regarding screening modalities, and about the comparative effectiveness of different screening regimens as practiced. Project 2: Personalizing colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, will focus on identifying effective personalized screening regimens based on screening history and other individual risk factors. Project 3, Modeling long-term comparative effectiveness of colorectal screening, will use disease simulation models to predict the long-term effectiveness of different screening and surveillance regimens on botii overall and CRC mortality based on results from Project 1 and Project 2, and will develop a cohort model for CRC that will be freely distributed. Our proposed body of research will provide an important foundation for personalized clorectal cancer screening, and will produce results that are useful to a multidisciplinary audience, including clinicians, patients, policy makers, researchers, and professional medical organizations."
"9325950","Project Summary Despite the remarkable progress in drug development over the past 20 years, antiretroviral treatment success is not universal. The most frequent cause of treatment failure in both therapeutic and prophylactic settings continues to be challenges associated with drug adherence. Although many patients can manage daily adherence for substantial periods of time, treatment fatigue as well as special difficulties exist for vulnerable patient populations including those challenged by substance abuse, mental illness, prolonged periods away from home and stigma within their communities. All too often treatment failure ensues. This has led to an increasing interest in the development of antiretroviral chemotherapeutic agents that can be given at prolonged dosing intervals. Several novel compounds and compounding approaches have emerged that suggest this goal is highly attainable. In this application we wish to develop an effective approach to deliver the globally used nucleotide, tenofovir, to the list of agents that can be administered at monthly intervals. We have demonstrated that ester linkage of an alkoxyalkyl side chain to the parent molecule greatly enhances cellular uptake and that we can modify the rate of intracellular release by the addition of a second promoiety at the remaining phosphonate oxygen. The combined effect of these modifications results in rapid cellular uptake and sustained ?timed-release? delivery of tenofovir diphosphate to the intracellular compartment. One lead compound, the octadecyloxyethyl benzyl diester of tenofovir (ODE-Bn-TFV), has single nanomolar anti-HIV activity and a selectivity index of >3000. Tenofovir diphosphate was slowly liberated in the intracellular compartment where it maintained a half-life of more than a week. We propose to utilize this approach to develop additional compounds of even greater potency and intracellular half-life. We will compound our novel time-release molecules in nanoparticles that will slowly release these molecules into the systemic circulation from the site of intramuscular injection. We believe that by using nanotechnology to first modulate release of prodrug into the systemic circulation and then using a synthetic chemical approach to enhance cellular uptake and to slow intracellular decay that we can deliver potent antiviral activity to sites of viral replication for a month following intramuscular injection."
"9125742","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A heavy burden of drug and alcohol use has been observed among men who have sex with men (MSM) living in South African townships, peri-urban or rural residential areas that were reserved for non-Whites under Apartheid and which are still residential communities for millions of black South Africans today. Our understanding of the determinants of drug and alcohol abuse among MSM living in these townships is limited. Qualitative data suggests that drugs and alcohol are mostly used in social situations and that drinking together is one of a limited number of ways in which MSM interact. Therefore, it is important to explore the influence of social network characteristics on drug and alcohol abuse, in addition to individual risk factors. One potentially harmful effect of drug and alcohol use is sexual risk behavior, which is of heightened importance among MSM in townships as they have high rates of HIV transmission. Thus far, studies that have looked at the relationship between substance use and sexual risk behavior among MSM in townships have reported inconsistent findings. Further research on these topics is needed. This project aims to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between substance use and sexual risk behavior among MSM in South African townships by exploring the individual and contextual causes of these co-occurring risk behaviors, and by juxtaposing two distinct temporal perspectives to investigate them. This project will achieve this using data drawn from the NIH-funded study, HIV and Sexual Risk in African MSM in South African Townships. This study used respondent-driven sampling to recruit 480 black MSM from four South African townships in the metropolitan area of Tshwane. A survey using previously validated measures to assess drug use, alcohol use, and sexual risk behavior was administered among these men. A detailed training plan will be followed in order to acquire the methodological skills, substantive knowledge and cross-disciplinary expertise to address the following aims: 1) assess whether social network characteristics predict substance abuse beyond individual risk factors; 2) assess whether substance use predicts sexual risk behavior over the past year, then test whether the relationship between substance use and sexual risk behavior is modified by reasons for substance use, expectations about the effect of substance use on sexual behavior, or intentions to engage in safe sex; 3) assess whether drug or alcohol use during a defined sexual encounter predict sexual risk behavior, after accounting for individual-, situational-, and partnership-level characteristics. A greater understanding of substance use among MSM in South African townships, as well as the link between substance use and sexual risk behavior, will inform the development of interventions to reduce substance abuse and sexual risk behavior among this critical population. Given that South Africa has a high prevalence of hazardous drinking, a growing problem with drug use, and the highest burden of HIV in the world, identifying and addressing factors that contribute to substance abuse and the spread of HIV in South Africa is of critical importance."
"9198466","PROJECT ABSTRACT Epigenetic factors have emerged as crucial players in metabolic disorders and in aging, both of which are typically associated with a wide range of gene expression changes. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the roles of a novel histone modification, lysine malonylation, and its regulation by the NAD+- dependent protein deacylase SIRT5, as a novel histone modifier in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to metabolic changes. The model is based on our recent identification of histone H2B lysine 5 (H2BK5) as a site of malonylation regulated by SIRT5. We propose that the dynamic malonylation of histone H2B by cellular malonyl-CoA and demalonylation by SIRT5 regulates chromatin structure and gene transcription. Two specific aims are developed to test this model globally in mouse liver and then mechanistically in cultured cells. First, genomic regions bound with malonylated histones (H2BK5) and SIRT5 will be compared using ChIP-seq using tissues from wild type and Sirt5-/- mice. These studies will aim to identify the sites of SIRT5-mediated histone demalonylation. The functional consequences of histone malonylation will be evaluated by comparing gene transcriptional changes using RNA-seq between wild type and Sirt5-/- mice. This data set will be compared to the sites where SIRT5 binds to the genome and demalonylates histones to identify the direct genomic sites of SIRT5 action. Second, we will study in mechanistic details how histone malonylation is dynamically regulated by SIRT5 and by fluctuations in cellular malonyl-CoA that occur during feeding and fasting in mice. In primary cultured mouse hepatocytes, we will also test the effect of feeding malonate (which is converted into malonyl-CoA intracellularly) and the effect of manipulating the cellular synthesis or degradation of malonyl-CoA via acetyl-CoA carboxylase (synthesis) and malonyl-coA decarboxylase (degradation). This research proposal takes the first step towards understanding the function of this newly discovered histone modification, malonylation, and its eraser, SIRT5, in epigenetic regulation. It will contribute significantly to our longstanding effort of unveiling the ?histone code?, its intersection with intermediary metabolism, and to advance our knowledge of gene expression regulation by epigenetic factors. Results from the proposed project will therefore permit mechanistic follow-up studies of the significance of histone malonylation and SIRT5 in epigenetic regulation and how dysregulation may contribute to both pathological conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and to normal aging."
"9231493","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is the renewal application for our current R01 that funds the successful collaborative work of the Wernig and Sdhof laboratories. The goal of the previous funding period of this grant was to develop induced neuronal (iN) cell protocols to provide the proof-of-principle that cell biological phenotypes can be studied in human neurons carrying autism-associated mutations. We have accomplished this goal which allows us now to include iN cells into our portfolio of model systems to investigate synaptic molecules affected in and relevant for neuropsychiatric diseases. In this renewal application, we propose to now apply the technologies developed in the previous funding period and use it to actually study neuronal cell biology in human neurons. The goal of this renewal application is to understand the molecular functions of normal and mutant neuroligins including their sorting to specific synaptic specializations, the identification of their critical binding partners, their detiled role on synaptic modulation, and the mechanism of action of mutant forms of neuroligins found in autism. Neuroligins are critical synaptic cell-adhesion molecules localized as constitutive homo- or heterodimers at the post-synaptic membrane. Their large extracellular domain interacts with neurexins and potentially other presynaptic membrane proteins, their smaller intracellular domain with various postsynaptic scaffold proteins such as PSD-95. We will employ well-established and widely accepted mouse models to define functional neuroligin domains and interaction partners of normal and experimentally modified neuroligins. Most autism-associated neuroligin mutations are found in the X-chromosomal NLGN4 gene. The mouse Nlgn4, however, is not well conserved with a mere 51% sequence similarity on the protein level and is much lower expressed than Nlgn1-3, which questions the relevance of mouse studies for human disease. For this reason, we propose to utilize the human iN cell systems that we developed to investigate normal and mutant NLGN4 synaptic function. The combined Wernig and Sdhof laboratories provide the complementary expertise to make such experiments realistically feasible."
"9192312","Non-invasive, functional neuroimaging is needed to assess the role of psychomotor function in feeding dysfunction present in over 50% of neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) at discharge1. While feeding dysfunction often causes immediate and debilitating consequences in growth and quality-of-life, the lack of quantitative tools to discern whether potential underlying neurologic deficits are psychomotor, reflexive, or more peripheral in origin prevents targeted management before compounding long-term effects manifest at school age. Non-invasive techniques of near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy (NIRS/DOS) for cerebral tissue oxygenation (StO2) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for cerebral blood flow (CBF), provide the opportunity for portable bedside assessment of neonatal psychomotor function by measuring cortical hemodynamic response during motor function. This proposal aims to quantify the maturation of neonatal psychomotor function during feeding by combining real-time functional DOS/DCS (fDCS) metabolic imaging with mechanical quantification of oro-buccal motor behavior. High-frequency (200Hz) mechanical transduction will enable precise temporal correlation of elicited motor function with fDCS measures of cortical response. This work incorporates a novel implementation of advanced ?two-layer? DCS techniques to improve the cerebral specificity of CBF quantification by separating extra-cerebral tissue contributions. Using pediatric patient-specific measurements of extra-cerebral (EC) tissue thickness and optical properties we will address uncertainties in previous implementations due to population-derived assumptions. Retrospective analysis of concurrent, pre-operative cerebral perfusion measurements (DOS/DCS/MRI) in a large cohort of HLHS subjects (n=96) during hypercapnic challenge will permit optimization by maximizing correlation of measured hypercapnia CBF response with arterial spin-labeling (ASL) MRI (Aim 1). Immature white matter underlying the sensorimotor cortex is particularly susceptible to neonatal hypoxic- ischemic insult. Applying improved DCS techniques, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal study in HLHS neonates to understand the impact of white matter injury and developing psychomotor function in the vulnerable sensorimotor cortex on feeding behavior (Aim 2). Our clinical study will extend a larger Augmented Physiologic Monitoring study (IRB: 11-008191) that combines high-resolution anatomical MRI with longitudinal diffuse optical monitoring to study the etiology and timing of a common form of diffuse white matter injury, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in neonates with severe congenital heart disease (CHD). We will assess the correlation of post-operative PVL volume underlying the sensorimotor cortex with achievement of independent oral feeding at discharge. Consistent with learning-related attenuation of the sensorimotor oxy- hemoglobin response in adults, we hypothesize that HLHS neonates with better feeding behavior at discharge will exhibit attenuation of sensorimotor CBF response with time during post-operative recovery."
"9221369","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The grant, Genetic Analysis of the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder, is continuation of a long-standing collaborative effort funded in response to an RFA for sample collections in bipolar disorder. We are thus submitting the current new application from the original group of investigators to continue the collaboration and proceed to its next logical step  analyses of data being generated. We developed the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder in response to a NIMH FOA MH08-130. Under the auspices of R01MH085542 (Smoller/Sklar, PIs) and philanthropic funding we implemented a phenotypically robust, rapid, and cost effective method for sample collection. During the five years of the grant we have banked DNA from ~18,000 cases and 16,000 controls never previously used for genomic study of bipolar disorder (BD). We propose here enhanced aims in a unique sample to increase our knowledge of BD and to keep this highly productive team intact. The samples studied here will more than double the available samples for GWAS, and will be among the first to analyze rare variants using exome chip and exome sequencing. These analyses will provide substantially enhanced power for detection of networks and loci that confer BD risk. In Aim 1 we will perform a genomic characterization of an independent cohort of 15,800 cases and 18,598 controls to identify high confidence genetic loci for risk of BD through association study of common single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variants, and rare single nucleotide variants. We will further use the data to explore genetic prediction models for BD for two specific clinical scenarios. In Aim 2 we will apply these data to characterize the spectrum of genotype-phenotype relationships by examining phenotypic subgroups, cross- disorder relationships, quantitative personality dimensions, and neurocognition. Our goal is to learn more about the genetics of BD and how genes might act to alter disease risk. We propose to do this using the largest and most comprehensively studied sample collection in the field that includes both genetic and phenotypic risk factors."
"9240304","Background: Despite significant reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy, survival for patients with esophageal cancer remains dismal. In most patients, adjunctive therapies including chemotherapy and radiation are beneficial. In fact, patients who achieve a complete pathologic response (pCR) after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation followed by esophagectomy often experience greatly improved survival. Unfortunately, the percentage of patients who currently achieve a pCR is low. Improving survival for esophageal cancer patients following esophagectomy requires that we ascertain how to increase the number of patients who achieve a pCR. In other malignancies, microRNAs (miRs) have been found to serve as effective diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. In addition, based on their ability to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, miR-based therapeutic approaches are currently being investigated. The role of miRs in the pathogenesis and treatment of esophageal cancer has not been thoroughly evaluated. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets based an analysis of miR expression and function in esophageal cancer cells. Preliminary Findings: Our preliminary studies indicate that a) miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p are dramatically downregulated in esophageal cancer cell lines compared to esophageal epithelial cells, b) this expression pattern has been verified in initial human tumor samples, c) specific binding interactions have been identified between miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p with the oncogenic targets survivin and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 11 (MAP3K11), respectively, d) ectopic expression of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p results in a marked decrease in the levels of survivin and MAP3K11 in esophageal cancer cells, and e) ectopic expression of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p results in important functional consequences; specifically, increased sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation, respectively. Based on these exciting observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that downregulation of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p occurs frequently in esophageal cancer cells and can be exploited for prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic purposes. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. (1) To characterize expression of miR- 214-3p and miR-199a-5p in human esophageal cancer specimens and correlate expression with clinical outcomes. Pretreatment biopsies of both tumor and normal esophageal epithelium will be obtained from 50 patients for evaluation of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p expression and correlation with outcomes. (2) To identify novel targets of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p that contribute to the development and progression of esophageal cancer. We will utilize human esophageal cancer cell lines to identify new targets and functions of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p in esophageal cancer cells. (3) To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p overexpression in vivo. Human esophageal cancer cell lines will be engineered to stably express selected miR-214-3p or miR-199a-5p. These engineered cells will then be implanted in nude mice. Their growth characteristics and response to chemotherapy will be compared to wild-type cells. Status: This is a resubmission. Impact: The incidence of esophageal cancer continues to increase in the Untied Sates, especially in males over the age of 50. Based on these demographics, this disease represents a significant problem in the VA healthcare system. Improving outcomes for esophageal cancer patients will greatly enhance the ability of the VA to fulfill its healthcare mission."
"9420043","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender youth, who identify with a gender that is different from their sex assigned at birth, are at increased risk for negative health outcomes due in part to stigmatization and family rejection. Research with non- transgender sexual minorities suggests that family support is crucial to youths' health and well-being and that family rejection may lead to negative outcomes, such as youth homelessness. Yet little is known about transgender youth specifically and how their experiences are linked to their current or past family environment (family of origin, chosen family, foster family, group care). In families with transgender youth, development of a transgender identity and the process of transitioning from assigned sex to identified gender may represent a source of stress for both the youth and the larger family system. Responding to the Institute of Medicine's and NIH LGBT Research Coordinating Committee's call for research on transgender-specific health needs, the specific aims of this research are to: 1) longitudinally investigate how the family environment affects health outcomes among transgender youth, 2) examine whether and what types of social support from within and outside of the family can improve family functioning and be protective for transgender youths' health, and 3) develop a narrative-based intervention to improve family functioning and social support-seeking behaviors in families with transgender youth. The Minority Stress Model and Family Systems Theory are integrated to provide a framework for Studies 1 and 2. Study 1 will investigate how the family environment is longitudinally associated with health outcomes (substance use, sexual risk, self-harm, suicidality, depression, anxiety) among transgender youth. With the goal of informing future interventions, Study 1 will also examine whether and what types of social support from within and outside of the family can improve family functioning and be protective for transgender youth's health. I will use community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles with mixed methods (qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys) to examine multiple aspects of the family environment, perceived stress, health outcomes, and social support using data collected at five waves across 24 months from 40 transgender youth ages 13 to 17 years and their parents/guardians and siblings (Total N = 80-160). Participants will be recruited from multiple sources to capture a diverse range of experiences and variability in family functioning. Previous research has indicated that social support may reduce negative stress-related outcomes in families with transgender youth. Interventions emphasizing social support are needed to ameliorate the effects of stressors and improve the family environment in this marginalized population. Study 2 will develop and pilot an innovative narrative-based intervention based on Social Cognitive and Transportation Theories to improve the family environment for transgender youth, including decreasing enacted stigma (overt anti-transgender attitudes and behaviors) within the family, and improving family functioning and social support-seeking skills. Narrative-based interventions use storytelling to promote health behavior change through mechanisms of transportation (absorption into the story and identification with characters), persuasion, and self-efficacy. The intervention developed in Study 2 will use digital storytelling, a specific narrative-based intervention method, to produce multimedia visual narratives from transgender youth about their family environment. Narrative-based interventions have been used successfully to change health behaviors and reduce stigma in marginalized populations, making this an innovative and promising approach to improve the family environment in families with transgender youth. The planned research will, for the first time, longitudinally investigate effects of the family environment on health outcomes among transgender youth using multiple family member perspectives and develop and pilot test a narrative-based intervention to improve the family environment for transgender youth. Ultimately this work will improve the health and well-being of transgender youth and families and inform future work with other marginalized populations."
"9398663","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methamphetamine (METH) abuse causes serious medical, social, and economic harm in the USA and the world. However, to date, no medications are approved to treat METH addiction. The primary goal of this translational project is to conduct safety studies of a new medicine for METH addiction, a novel anti- METH monoclonal antibody (mAb) called ch-mAb7F9, to support the initiation of a first clinical study in METH users. Results from a Phase 1a study of ch-mAb7F9 in non-METH-using healthy subjects indicate that the antibody is safe for administration in humans. Ch-mAb7F9 was created to selectively and quickly bind METH in the blood and prevent it from entering the brain and other tissues where it causes multiple health problems, including addiction. By so doing, anti-METH ch-mAb7F9 will transform the clinical treatment of addiction by providing the first medication that can reduce METH's reinforcing properties for prolonged periods of time. There is a high rate of recidivism associated with METH use. By using a long-acting antibody antagonist to provide around-the-clock protection from METH effects, patients will be much less vulnerable to relapse to METH use and thereby have significantly improved chances for recovery. Anti-drug mAb medications have major advantages for addiction therapy since steady-state concentrations and precise control of dosing are readily achievable even in immune compromised patients, and because they will not interact with other medicines. Furthermore, mAb medications are safe for most patient populations. For the research and testing program, ch-mAb7F9 will be tested in rats for safety in combination with high, binge-like doses of METH. Additionally, METH self-administration studies in rats will be performed to answer specific questions from the FDA concerning the motivation and ability of users to overcome the antibody's stimulant blocking effects. A highly experienced, trans disciplinary academic and industry team will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) complete essential regulatory work in preparation for a Phase 1b study; 2) manufacture ch-mAb7F9 for necessary nonclinical and future clinical studies, 3) conduct nonclinical testing to determine safety of the interaction between ch-mAb7F9 and METH in rats, and 4) test ch-mAb7F9 in METH self-administration studies to examine the motivational aspect of drug use. These studies are necessary to prepare for a Phase 1b study in METH users that will be crucial for identifying factors that determine optimal human dosing regimens and will allow for the effective design of future clinical studies where ch-mAb7F9 efficacy is the primary endpoint. The therapeutic vision is that this medication, which can be used to initiate and continue pharmacologic treatment, will be used in combination with high quality behavioral modification programs to dramatically improve patient outcomes."
"9243918","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, bacteria were either seen as pathogenic if they caused disease or benign if they lived commensally with the host. In many cases, however, single organisms have not been identified that are consistently associated with disease, but rather it is thought that bacterial community structure and bacteria- bacteria interactions differ between healthy and diseased individuals, otherwise known as dysbiosis. Naturally, investigating the microbiomes of healthy and diseased individuals using systems biology methodology could lead to insight into the processes that underlie dysbiosis. To that end, methodology has been developed to identify co-occurrence networks from microbiome data. However, to date this methodology has primarily been applied to healthy microbiome datasets and we still lack an understanding of the common properties of dysbiosis. To address these gaps, I propose to build gut microbiome co-occurrence networks for 34 immune diseases and 133 quantitative phenotypes using ~2,500 individuals from the United Kingdom Adult Twins Registry (TwinsUK), for which microbiome and phenotype data has previously been collected. First, I will identify disease-associated bacteria using generalized and linear mixed models that take into account relatedness between individuals. Next, I will use a simulation framework to compare six microbiome co- occurrence network software packages to quantify the consistency of co-occurrence networks for individuals either i) with and without disease or ii) from opposite tails of quantitative phenotype distributions. Using these networks, I will identify modules of co-occurring bacteria that are differentially abundant in disease, examine general network statistics (such as modularity and diversity), and examine the properties of disease-associated nodes as determined in Aim 1 (such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality). Additionally, I will take advantage of the twin relationships in our data to identify heritable network characteristics and examine co- heritability of pairs of bacteria. Finally, this will be the first study to compare  these network statistics across a range of diseases in order to develop a model of how microbiome network structure differs in health and disease. Additionally, I will compare underlying network structure across phenotypes to identify diseases that share similar gut microbiome alterations. Understanding the gut microbiome at this level will be beneficial for designing therapies to target the microbiota and ultimately improve human health."
