"9409325","ABSTRACT  Significance: Electronic-­prescribing is now widely adopted by US healthcare systems, but clinical functionality  of  e-­prescribing  falls  short  in  the  realm  of  pediatrics.  Medication  prescribing  is  intrinsically  more  complex  for  pediatric  patients  due  to  weight-­based  dosing,  the  lack  of  widely  adopted  medication  formulation  recipes,  inconsistent  off-­label  usage  of  drugs,  appropriate  drugs  for  given  conditions,  and  appropriate  dose  rounding  percentages  that  will  still  make  the  drug  treatment  clinically  useful.  Clinical  decision  support  (CDS)  tools  can  improve shortcomings in electronic health records (EHR), yet many focus on adult only patient populations, are  limited  in  drug  and  condition  coverage,  exist  as  web-­services  external  to  the  native  EHR  environment,  and  generate  excessive  pop-­up  alerts  that  contribute  to  provider  ?alert-­fatigue?.  Safety  Through  E-­Prescribing  Systems  Tools  (STEPSTools)  is  a  web-­service  that  was  designed  to  be  a  comprehensive  pediatric  dosing  knowledge  dissemination  platform  that  fills  the  void  of  condition  based  medication  usage,  expert  consensus-­ based dosage rounding, and extemporaneous drug formulation recipes currently missing in EHR functionality.  RxCheck  is  a  Prescription  Decision  Support  (PDS)  platform  built  by  RxREVU,  that  is  surfaced  directly  in  the  provider?s  native  Epic  EHR  workflow  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  information  utilization  by  providers,  drive  operational best practices, surface information that may or may not natively exist in the EHR, and improve the  clinical  window.  Hypothesis:  By  combining  the  strengths  and  expertise  of  STEPSTools  pediatric  prescribing  technology  with  RxREVU?s  RxCheck  Prescription  Decision  Support  platform,  a  comprehensive  pediatric  prescribing  product  will  be  developed  that  is  scalable,  interoperable,  and  utilized  directly  at  the  point  of  prescribing in order to drive consistent evidence-­based prescribing patterns for pediatricians, and improve clinical  outcomes  for  pediatric  patients.  Specific  Aims:  By  the  investigators  own  admission,  a  pediatric  prescribing  technology will not be useful if it is not comprehensive and up-­to-­date. This proposal aims to update STEPSTools  technology  from  2011  pediatric  prescribing  standards  to  2016  standards,  as  new  evidence  and  innovative  approaches to pediatric prescribing have occurred. Rapid and effective communication between STEPSTools,  RxCheck and Vanderbilt?s Epic EHR is critical for the accuracy and safety of the prescribing module. These data  handshakes will be rigorously tested for accuracy in the second aim. Provider adoption and clinical utility of an  RxCheck pediatric prescribing module is critical to test the feasibility of widespread scalability of the tool. The  number of times RxCheck is accessed compared to total prescriptions written, as well as provider acceptance  rates of the recommendations surfaced by RxCheck in Epic will be measured and success of this Phase I SBIR  proposal will be determined here.     "
"9347791","High-throughput single-cell sorting and kinetic analysis of secreted particles NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in reagents and analytical tools have improved characterization of cellular phenotypes. However, most studies are still performed on cell populations that are morphologically and genetically homogeneous, yet have important biological heterogeneity; with individual cells having unique phenotypic or `omic profiles. This leads to an average measurement of individual cells, none of which may actually be average. Single-cell analysis can define the scope of cell-to-cell variations within a population and provide in-depth analysis of single, exceptional cells in contexts such as stem cell differentiation or cancer, where these cells can give rise to clonal populations that drive the biology. While novel tools such as multiparameter flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and image-based cytometry provide in-depth analysis of individual cells, these technologies only provide a single time point ?snapshot? and lack downstream molecular analysis. This project will develop for commercialization an integrated cell-sorting, cell dispensing, and single-cell positioning device to allow single cells to be tracked and measured over time. In addition, we will demonstrate a commercial prototype device that allows transfer of individual cells with desired phenotypic characteristics to 1536-well plates for downstream analysis in a standard format. This integrated system will be benchmarked with cells derived from glioblastoma that has been shown to have important exosome biological characteristics."
"9356815","Abstract  The mucus layer lining the respiratory tract acts as the body's first line of defense against inhaled pathogens and airborne particulate matter. Proper trapping of particulates and clearance from the lung is therefore critical to maintaining pulmonary function. The goal of the Analytics for Mucolytics Core is to use the biochemical and biophysical experimental expertise of its investigators to develop biomarkers of the effect of disease and therapeutic interventions. These biomarkers will be derived from a multidisciplinary, basic scientific characterization of pulmonary mucus samples collected by the four Projects of this tPPG. The motivation for the Analytics for Mucolytics Core is rooted in the goals of this tPPG and can be summarize as such: 1) elucidate the biological basis of muco-obstructive airway diseases, 2) investigate the polymeric, physical basis of the underlying pathology of these diseases, and 3) test the efficacy of mucolytic and hydration therapies. The core will be further governed by the hypothesis that muco-obstructive diseases such as cystic fibrosis and asthma cause pathological alterations to the biochemical composition of respiratory mucus, resulting in a hyper-concentrated mucus layer. The thickening of airway mucus leads to altered biophysical properties that impede mucociliary clearance and ultimately cause a decline in lung function. The therapeutic goal of this tPPG is to develop clinical treatments that restore pathological mucus to its proper biochemical and biophysical state, and thereby restore its normal physiological function.  The Analytics for Mucolytics Core will draw on the talents of a diverse team of researchers within the Marsico Lung Institute who have developed and implemented novel, state-of-the-art experimental capabilities for the characterization of the biochemical and biophysical properties of mucus. Core PI, Dr. Mehmet Kesimer, is a world-recognized leader of mucin biochemistry and how changes to the biochemical composition of mucus correlate to changes in pulmonary function. Dr. Ehre and Dr. Livraghi-Butrico add a wealth of experience in biochemical imaging techniques of mucins and mucus, and relating these measurements to pulmonary function in animal model systems and human subjects. Dr. Hill and Dr. Button are experts in the biophysical characterization of the wide range of mucus sample types the Analytics for Mucolytics Core will analyze from the diverse projects that make up this tPPG. Dr. Hill and Dr. Button are leaders in relating mucus biophysical properties to physiological changes. Together, this diverse, multidisciplinary team brings a unique, unrivaled set of skills that the core will employ to develop biomarkers of pulmonary physiology. Further, the proven track record of the core investigators working in concert with clinicians will insure that the basic science approach of the core will be tightly focused on developing biomarkers that are the best descriptors of the physiological effect of disease and assess efficacy of therapeutic compounds to restore normal lung function."
"9409225","Abstract The use of writing to interact with others is of critical importance to persons with severe physical impairments (SPI) and persons with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI). For these people, written communication tools such as email, texting, and social media play essential roles in supporting social closeness, the exchange of information with others, and exercising self-determination. Many people with SPI, however, experience difficulty both in generating and in editing text using traditional onscreen keyboards. Our Phase 1 research has two goals. The first goal is to correct letter-targeting and spelling errors when a person uses an alternative input method to write. To accomplish this goal we will create and evaluate an input-correction algorithm that recognizes input errors and may increase the writing rate of people with SPI who use scanning as their text input method. Our second goal is to address text-editing challenges when using scanning to correct composition errors (e.g., inserting missing words). To accomplish this goal we will use the language model within our onscreen keyboard to predict the location of composition errors within the writer?s recent text. When the writer indicates that they want to edit their text, the onscreen keyboard will create an ?error prediction list? that replaces the word prediction list available when the writer is composing text. The error prediction algorithm will evaluate the text created by the writer and predict the five most likely locations of errors within the text. When the writer selects one of the predictions, the cursor will jump to the associated location within the text to ease the process of editing. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the error correction algorithms three ways: mathematically, using an Alternating Treatment Design, and through evaluation by assistive technology (AT) experts. We will establish feasibility if our algorithms (1) permit faster scanning rates, (2) correct a substantial number of errors, and (3) AT experts rate the technology as having important benefit."

"9507150","Title: Probabilistic multifactorial lifetime assessment for resin-based composite restorations Abstract: While the development of the next-generation dental composites to extend the service life of tomorrow's dental restorations is underway, producing a rigorous tool that can better discriminate the many composite restorative systems by more accurately predicting their clinical performances is necessary. The long term goal of this project is to increase the lifetime of resin-base composite restorations by obtaining more durable restorative systems through a better understanding of the degradation mechanisms of the tooth- composite interface. Our more immediate goal is to develop a complementary analytical-experimental approach for predicting the lifetime of composite restorations. We would like to test the hypotheses that (1) the different mechanical, thermal, chemical and biological challenges work synergistically to reduce the lifetime of resin-based composite restorations; (2) we can predict the lifetime of composite-restored teeth using numerical stress analysis and a multi-factorial failure model; and (3) we can devise an accelerated test method with representative challenges that reproduce the failure rates and failure modes seen in composite-restored teeth clinically. We propose to conduct a series of laboratory and theoretical studies including 1) to develop and implement a multifactorial probabilistic model for failure prediction; 2) to determine the material properties pertinent to the failure model for commercial composites subjected to calibrated representative biomechanical challenges; 3) to predict the lifetime of different types of composite restorations (Class I and II) for premolars and molars using the failure model and the interfacial stresses predicted by Finite Element Analysis; 4) to design and build a microbiomechanical artificial mouth (?BAM) by adding a biofilm reactor to an artificial mouth based on the existing design at the Minnesota Dental Research Center for Biomaterials and Biomechanics (MDRCBB) to simulate the microbiological and mechanical challenges in the oral environment; and 5) to develop an accelerated test regime using the multifactorial failure model together with the step-stress method. This research will introduce a comprehensive and quantitative approach to the structural analysis and lifetime prediction of composite dental restoration, validated by comparison with clinical results. It will assess degradation of the tooth-restoration interface under representative preparation and oral conditions, and the results will help elucidate the individual and synergistic effects of two main oral challenges, namely microbiological and biomechanical, and those of operator error on its lifetime. The project will also produce a microbiomechanical artificial mouth that can test composite-restored teeth under accelerated but clinically representative conditions, thus reducing the scope of clinical studies by providing the initial screening of candidate materials. This will improve the longevity of composite restorations by 1) providing dental materials manufacturers with more clinically relevant assessments for product development, and 2) allowing dentists to make more informed and timely decisions on the selection of restorative materials and treatment plans."
"9472047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracheobonchomalacia (TBM) is a congenital or acquired deficiency of tracheal and/or bronchial cartilages that presents with dynamic airway collapse, respiratory difficulties, and, in severe cases, acute life-threatening events. TBM prevalence is estimated at 1 in 2,200 children1, and severe cases can result in death or require tracheostomy with ventilation for 2-3 years, a significant burden on the child and family2,3. We recently developed a bioresorbable, patient specific 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) splint to treat TBM, reporting the first case in the New England J. of Medicine4. Two subsequent children with life threatening TBM were saved with the splint and the first child continues to be asymptomatic 30 months post-surgery. Based on these results, we met with the FDA on August 22, 2014 to initiate a phase I clinical trial for Humanitarian Device Exempt (HDE) approval. These preclinical questions dealt with the degradation mechanisms and fatigue behavior of the splint, how splint design and 3D printing orientation affect splint degradation and fatigue, and how the splint affects airway mechanics over time with degradation. We will address these questions in two specific aims using both in vitro and in vivo preclinical model, the Yorkshire pig The first aim will characterize splint degradation both in vitro and in vivo for up to 2 years. The second aim will use this data to characterize how the splint affects airway mechanics."
"9544504","Project Summary/Abstract In this application for an NIDDK Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC) at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), we seek to support the field of benign hematology research by providing crucial resources to investigators, by bringing together interactive members who will move the field forward and recruit new investigators to the area, by enriching the environment for trainees at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, medical school) and by offering Pilot & Feasibility grants for highly promising innovative projects of junior investigators. The organization and activities of the CHSCC build on an existing NIDDK-funded Center of Excellence in Molecular Hematology that has served the Harvard Medical School community and investigators elsewhere for 15 years. As the existing Center is the sole facility of its kind in the Harvard Medical Area, it represents a focal point for research in benign hematology and a site for training the next generation of investigators. The CHSCC has members at the affiliated institutions of the Harvard Medical School, and is enriched by interactions with T32 hematology training programs at BCH and Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) and a Harvard T32 training program in transfusion medicine, and with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI). The CHSCC is comprised of three cores, two of which center on the major animal models for hematology research, the mouse (Core A) and zebrafish (Core B). Focus on these two systems leverages the advantages of each, while providing the benefits of synergy from parallel developmental and genetic studies. These cores provide state-of-the-art services for the generation of engineered mice/zebrafish, maintain critical strains that are used in the day-to-day work of the Cores and that are distributed to investigators elsewhere, and export methods by teaching Center members. In addition, these Cores actively develop or incorporate new approaches, including the recently developed CRISPR/cas9 technology for genome editing. In addition, these Cores are active in generating models of human hematologic disorders and encouraging efforts to translate knowledge from these animal models to human. A new third core, CORE C, provides human iPS cell reprogramming, CRISPR/Cas9 for human disease modeling, and consultation on approaches to CRISPR/Cas9 editing of mouse and zebrafish, as well as fee-for-service flow cytometry core that allows for characterization and isolation of hematopoietic cell populations. In aggregate, the three Cores provide investigators with state- of-the-art approaches to hematology and disease, and support innovative and disease-relevant research that will lead to new therapeutic strategies. In addition to these cores, the CHSCC has an Administrative Core that manages communications with the cores, advertises the capabilities of the CHSCC to investigators, and oversees the Enrichment and Pilot & Feasibility Programs. The Enrichment Program includes many educational opportunities for Center members and trainees in the laboratories of members and an active college undergraduate summer program. The Pilot & Feasibility Program has previously supported innovative, promising projects of junior investigators with the hope that these funds will permit obtaining preliminary data for an NIH R01 application or a similar award. As a CHSCC, the impact of the existing NIDDK-funded Center of Excellence can be expanded to promote and support benign hematology research beyond the members of the Center per se. We believe that the CHSCC at BCH will constitute a national resource for hematology research.  "
"9341356","ABSTRACT  Alexander disease (AxD) is a primary disease of astrocytes caused by mutations in the gfap gene.  How AxD mutations lead to protein aggregation and astrocyte dysfunction as well as how mutant  GFAP-expressing astrocytes result in neuronal degeneration remain unknown. Evolutionarily,  astrocytes play increasingly more important and complex roles in human brain functions. Hence, the  ability to directly examine AxD patients' astrocytes will not only complement the existing models but  also reveal potential unique aspects of human astrocytes in AxD pathogenesis. We have built induced  pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from AxD patients with three different mutations through close  collaboration with the Messing lab (project 3). We have also developed a reproducible strategy to  guide hPSCs to enriched astrocytes. Our preliminary study revealed the presence of RFs in AxD  patients' astrocytes in culture and following transplantation into the mouse brain, highlighting the  recapitulation of key AxD pathology in our iPSC system. However, astrocytes derived from AxD  patients exhibit comparable GFAP levels as non-AxD individuals, suggesting that GFAP may not  increase at early stages of AxD and a simple increase in GFAP protein might not be the major trigger  for RF formation and astrocyte dysfunction in human cells as proposed for model animals. Our ability  to produce enriched astrocytes from AxD patients has also led to the discovery that AxD astrocytes  have altered ratio of GFAP-d/a isoforms, which has led to the ?rediscovery? of a similar ratio change in  transgenic mice. We will use advanced gene editing technology to determine if change of GFAP  isoforms mediates the effects of gfap mutations on protein aggregation and/or astrocyte dysfunction.  By neuron-astrocyte co-culture and neural transplantation, we will determine if and how AxD astrocytes  cause neuronal degeneration. As part of the program project, we will validate modifiers of AxD learned  from animal models in our AxD patients' astrocytes/neurons, setting up the foundation for future  translation."
"9345834","Project Summary The broad long term objective of this Fast Track proposal is to develop an innovative self-management intervention (SMI) technology, Inspiration Point, for the treatment and study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This application directly addresses the NHLBI SBIR requests for proposals for the development of innovative technologies for COPD, the development of technologies to enhance clinical research for lung related diseases/disorders, and the development of tools and platforms that, improve the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for lung diseases and disorders, and include multi-level (health systems, provider, and patient) facets. This application also directly addresses NIH's National Action Plan for COPD Goal #2, use COPD-specific technologies for the delivery of treatment (pulmonary rehabilitation, PR) and management of COPD. The first iteration will focus on the research and development of modules similar to those found in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs in an effort to increase and sustain treatment and management of COPD, enhance clinical COPD research, improve dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for COPD, and develop a solution beneficial for health systems, providers, and patients alike. The first iteration of Inspiration Point will focus on the implementation of PR guidelines. We will employ a user-centered design approach, by including people with COPD, care team, clinicians, administrators and researchers. Together we will design, develop and test Inspiration Point, complete with polished expandable modules, backend data processing and Web-UI. Phase 1 research design and methods: identify and evaluate features and content expansions or adaptations, port Health in Motion assets that are aligned with COPD guidelines, create a technical design document, develop new features and complete a pilot usability and feasibility evaluation of Inspiration Point 1.0. Hypothesis: adults with COPD will rate Inspiration Point 1.0 with adequate usability and feasibility. Phase 2 research design and methods: continue user-centered design to develop Inspiration Point 2.0. Obtain ongoing user evaluative feedback during development, expand content aligned with COPD guidelines, and complete a feasibility study. Study Design: A between subjects (Usual Care/APP) repeated measures (pre/post) design to compare the feasibility of usual care compared with Inspiration Point 2.0 used in the home for 8 weeks. Primary outcome: the 6-Minute Walk Test distance. Hypothesis: adults with COPD will demonstrate statistically significantly improved 6MWD when using Inspiration Point 2.0 for 8 weeks, and the outcomes will be similar to or better than usual care. Health relatedness: Management of chronic conditions is one of our most important healthcare priorities given that more than 75% of all healthcare costs and 96% of Medicare annual spend are attributed to chronic disease. Behavioral choices are at the heart of chronic disease self- management models. SMIs, a key constituent of the national respiratory guidelines, empower active, informed, collaboration in health related decision making, engagement in healthy behaviors and development of problem solving skills to address challenges their disease presents. Inspiration Point 2.0 will be a SMI for adults with COPD."
"9312128","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-cellular organisms develop from a single cell that undergoes many stages of proliferation and differentiation that result in the vast array of progenitor and terminal cell types. While dogma defines development as a series of discrete steps, it is actually a continuous process, characterized by transitional stages and intermediate cell types that have yet to be described. We propose reframing development in terms of branching trajectories: We will develop computational algorithms that use high dimensional single cell data to map each individual cell into a lineage tree representing the chronological order of development. Rather than grouping cells into nodes of this tree (cell types), single cells will fill in the branches in a continuum ordered according to their developmental chronology. Thus, each branch is a developmental trajectory that represents all the transitional stages between cell states. In essence, combining single cell technologies with sophisticated computation will empower us to do for Homo sapiens what John Sulston and colleagues did for C. elegans-to construct a complete and detailed map of normal development. This map will provide both a full catalog of all cell types in our body, as well as the developmental relations between them. The detailed resolution of the resulting map will empower developmental studies, help elucidate how and where development is derailed in disease, and guide the next generation of regenerative medicine."
"9296242","Project Summary Zika virus (ZIKV) is a recently recognized global public health threat due to the wide geographic distribution of risk and potential for severe consequences of congenital infection. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies against ZIKV that have established safety in humans, especially during pregnancy. Our preliminary data show that chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and amodiaquine block ZIKV replication in cultured cells at clinically achievable concentrations. These medications have been used for many decades in humans, including during pregnancy. The identification of a class of drugs that are efficacious for ZIKV infection, well tolerated, safe in pregnancy, inexpensive, widely available and orally bioavailable would have the immediately translatable potential to significantly impact this ongoing epidemic. This proposal aims to further develop in vitro models to study the effect of chloroquine and related drugs on ZIKV infection, identify the molecular mechanism(s) of their activity and determine whether these agents demonstrate efficacy in vivo in mouse models. In Aim 1, we will perform dose-response experiments with chloroquine and a panel of related compounds and determine whether protection occurs in primary cells including neural progenitor cells and with currently circulating ZIKV strains. Aim 2 will identify the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of inhibition by chloroquine and related drugs. We propose that understanding how these drugs work will reveal critical insights into the basic biology of this virus and pathways amenable to therapeutic targeting. In Aim 3, we will determine the efficacy of chloroquine and related compounds in mouse models of ZIKV infection, which may provide preclinical evidence to support clinical trials in humans. The experiments we propose will not only determine whether chloroquine and related drugs are efficacious against ZIKV, but also shed light on the basic biology of this virus, which will inform future drug development. Our findings may be relevant not only to ZIKV, but also related flaviviruses of current medical importance and ones that may emerge in the future."
"9559780","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Taenia solium is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system and a leading cause of acquired epilepsy in low and middle income countries. Endemic transmission occurs primarily in rural areas where pigs are allowed to roam and consume human feces, thus risking contamination with T. solium eggs and subsequent infection with larval cysts (cysticercosis). Identification and treatment of adult tapeworm carriers (taeniasis) who shed eggs into the environment is therefore critical to control strategy. In our previous NIH R21 award we demonstrated that targeted screening for taeniasis in household clusters surrounding infected pigs (ring-screening) identifies tapeworm carriers for treatment and significantly reduces community transmission of the parasite. This strategy involves identifying heavily-infected pigs through tongue examination followed by thorough investigation for the source tapeworm among residents in neighboring households. Our long-term goals are 1) to develop effective, affordable and sustainable strategies for T. solium control in endemic areas, and 2) to increase population-based research capacity for neurologic disorders in rural Peru. The first aim of this R01 proposal is to refine ring-screening strategy so that it can be implemented in control programs. We propose a community trial with five parallel study arms to evaluate the long-term efficacy, cost- effectiveness and acceptability of ring-screening for control of T. solium compared against mass treatment. Additional methods for evaluation include use of portable ultrasound and rapid-diagnostic serologic assays to identify heavily-infected pigs in the field, and presumptive treatment within rings (ring-treatment) as a potential alternative to ring-screening. We will enroll communities totaling approximately 10,000 residents and 6,000 pigs in studies which range from 2 to 4 years in duration. Our second aim is to increase the local capacity for planning, developing and operating neuroepidemiologic studies in rural northern Peru. We will train two PhD candidates in advanced quantitative methods at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, as well as 4 Masters level candidates in research-related disciplines at Universidad Cayetano Peruana Heredia in Lima over the 5-year award period. The results of our combined research and training programs will provide tools, methods and capacitation necessary to enable scale-up of the most promising control strategies we identify."
"9437649","The scientific mission of the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch (PECRB) is to determine the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus as it occurs among Pima Indians of Arizona. This population of Native Americans has the highest reported prevalence and incidence rate of this disease of any population in the world. We have used several different scientific approaches to find the cause of the disease including (1) epidemiologic; (2) clinical physiologic; and (3) molecular genetic approaches. In few other laboratories in the world are scientists from these diverse backgrounds working together to apply the latest techniques in each discipline to solve a single problem. Working closely with Pima Indian volunteers the branch has made substantial progress in identifying physiologic and genetic determinants of diabetes risk factors. In addittion, several clinical trials have been conducted to intervene in the natural history of this disease to prevent it and its severe complications. The branch welcomes new investigators to work in the field, in the clinical research center, and/or in the basic laboratories to help develop new ideas and strategies to achieve our scientific goals and to ultimately prevent this disease."
"9462419","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding of the fundamental mechanisms leading to metastatic cancer has been hampered by the need for models that replicate the in vivo situation, yet are amenable to tight control and facilitate high-resolution, time-lapse imagin and quantitative analysis of cell behavior. Over the past several years, we have developed microfluidic systems that are capable of simulating many steps of metastasis including tumor cell invasion, intravasation, trapping in the microcirculation or adhesion to the vessel walls, and extravasation into surrounding extracellular matrix. This prior work has shed new light on the interactions between a transmigrating tumor cell and the endothelium, the role of specific adhesion molecules, and the deformations of the cell and especially the cell nucleus, experience during the transmigration process. The object of this proposed study is to employ these recently developed assays in combination with new measurement methods to interrogate the changes in cell mechanics during the process of extravasation, and understand the nature of the cell-cell and cell-matrix force interactions. We also aim to investigate the nuclear deformations, changes in chromatin structure and the resulting changes in the transcriptome, which could have important implications for the subsequent ability of extravasated cells to form a new tumor. In close coordination with these experiments, computational models will be developed to simulate tumor cell / endothelial cell interactions, nuclear deformation, and the resulting changes in gene expression. We anticipate that these studies will provide new insights, and potentially enhance our ability to identify and screen for new therapies to inhibit the tendency for metastatic spread of disease."
"9524979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This competitive renewal proposes to continue our work on the regulation of mammalian protein-encoding genes with a focus on post-transcriptional processes and, in particular, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD generally occurs when translation terminates sufficiently upstream of an exon-junction complex (EJC) during a pioneer round of translation. We define the pioneer translation initiation complex as bound by the cap-binding protein heterodimer CBP80-CBP20 and, if the mRNA derived from pre-mRNA splicing, one or more EJCs, and we have shown that both CBP80 and EJCs promote NMD. Over the last ~4 years we have continued to characterize changes that typify the pioneer translation initiation complex during the process of NMD. For example, we have shown that the key NMD factor, the ATP-dependent RNA helicase called UPF1, binds to most if not all cellular transcripts at a low level nonspecifically. However, a series of carefully choreographed steps leads to the activation of NMD target-bound UPF1 by phosphorylation. We have found that phosphorylated UPF1 binds specifically to NMD-target 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) and, unlike steady-state UPF1, which is largely hypophosphorylated, provides the first reliable identifier of natural cellular NMD targets. We have also demonstrated that cellular DNA damage by commonly used chemotherapeutics triggers the caspase-mediated cleavage of UPF1 so as to generate a dominant-negative C-terminal cleavage product; this product then downregulates the efficiency of NMD so as to upregulate a battery of natural NMD targets that we have found using transcriptome deep-sequencing include those encoding apoptotic-promoting proteins. In fact, cells can be primed to undergo faster and more efficient apoptosis upon exposure to an NMD inhibitor followed by its withdrawal prior to chemotherapy. By working with the Singer lab during her last year with me, Hana Sato used new Singer-lab technologies that track individual transcripts in intact cells to show that the NMD of premature termination codon (PTC)-containing ß-globin mRNA occurs on the cytoplasmic-side of the nuclear envelop and not in the nucleoplasm or after release into the cytoplasm. In other studies, we have collaborated to examine in cultured cells and in rats how human UPF1 expression overcomes cytotoxicity or paralysis, respectively, caused by proteins implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this proposal, AIM 1 is to conduct a genome-wide inventory to define new NMD factors using haploid genetics. This AIM will supplement our on-going studies of the mechanism of NMD. AIM 2 is to identify new roles for NMD factors based on our unpublished data. We aim to investigate putative roles for (i) UPF1 together with Tudor-SN in microRNA decay, (ii) CBP80 in the PGC1ß-mediated upregulation of estrogen receptor- and orphan estrogen- related receptor-activated genes, and (iii) UPF1 together with FMRP, FRX1 and FXR2 on mRNA metabolism in fragile X mental retardation syndrome.

Depending on the approach, the new CMs may be derived through the differentiation of exogenous pluripotent stem cells, the differentiation of resident progenitors, the proliferation of endogenous CMs, or reprogramming of non-CMs to CMs. Unfortunately, CMs generated by these approaches have thus far made poor substitutes for mature myocardium, with deficiencies in both electrical and mechanical function. Studies indicate that CMs from regenerative strategies often resemble CMs of the fetal or neonatal heart, rather than the adult, making CM maturation a major roadblock in the field. This obstacle has been difficult to overcome due to insufficient knowledge of how CM maturation is transcriptionally regulated. Here we propose addressing this deficiency by first utilizing an established genetic model of a CM growth defect to identify and analyze factors that regulate CM maturation. Second, we will combine insights gained from this model with a novel technical approach to screen for novel transcriptional regulators of CM maturation in vivo.  GATA4 and GATA6 are zinc finger transcription factors that play key roles in cardiac function and development. Mosaic double knockout of myocardial GATA4/6 via low dose administration of AAV9-TNT-Cre to neonatal mice intriguingly appears to result in stalled CM maturation. By adulthood, GATA4/6 mutant cells are dramatically smaller than their Cre- counterparts, resembling neonatal CMs. As GATA4/6 proved to be crucial and redundant regulators of CM growth, we reasoned that analysis of GATA4 targets is likely to reveal factors that mediate CM maturation. Therefore, we conducted neonatal GATA4 ChIP-seq to identify likely regulators of CM maturation. In Aim 1 we outline a strategy to functionally analyze the role of two promising candidates in vivo during neonatal CM maturation. These factors, Fhod3 and Daam1, belong to the Formin family of actin binding proteins, which have previously been linked to sarcomere assembly and maintenance.  The striking phenotype of GATA4/6 mutant CMs indicated that transcriptional regulators of CM maturation can be identified by assessing cell size in a mosaic loss-of-function model. However screening factors in vivo one at a time is prohibitively costly. In Aim 2 we propose an in vivo screen that will utilize cutting edge CRISPR technologies to allow many genes to be tested in a single animal. This screen will use the cell autonomous effect of gene knockout on individual CM growth as the readout. This unbiased approach will be used to discover new transcriptional regulators of neonatal CM growth, which is a hallmark of CM maturation. Successful completion of this Aim will allow us to use candidates as new genetic entry points, which can be exploited by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to rapidly dissect the transcriptional network that governs neonatal CM growth and maturation. Collectively, the complementary approaches of Aims 1 and 2 will greatly increase our knowledge of this maturation network, and will have the potential to enhance regenerative therapeutic strategies."

"9348422","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes in our guts influence our metabolism, moods, and behaviors, but the problem of understanding how these influences arise is demonstrably complex. 100 trillion cells from 1000 species with millions of genes make up the human microbiome. Just as the one gene = one function paradigm has largely evaporated from the field of genetics in favor of understanding how pathways of interactions lead to a phenotype, the field of microbiology has largely begun to recognize that ecology is at the core of many microbiome disease states. Ecology means that a web of biotic and abiotic factors interact to produce a system-level output. One of the core concepts that has developed the field of ecology is the 'keystone species'. In a food web (network map of the interactions between species), keystone species interact with many more species than the average species does and these species have reverberating effects on an ecosystem when they are eliminated, such that the stability of the ecosystem often fails and many other species are eliminated by indirect effects due to loss of the keystone species. One of the toughest problems in treating ailments of the microbiome is that microbiomes themselves are robust to change. While antibiotics can kill off the vast majority of microbes, when the flora recover, they usually represent the same flora the patient started with. The only widely successful change of the microbial ecosystem in patients is through the use of fecal transplants, whereby the entire gut flora of a patient is replaced with a donor's stool using an enema. My aim is to use the keystone species concept as a strategy by which to perturb the gut flora without eliminating them entirely. By mapping the microbial food web, I aim to determine candidate keystone species. By developing targeted bacteriophage therapies against the keystone candidates, I aim to restructure microbial food webs to change the metabolic output, thus affecting the core metabolites that affect host metabolism, mood, and behavior. I will approach the project from two angles: (i) I will establish a model, reduced complexity gut microbiome in the fruit fly, which is ideal for studying behavioral outputs (ii) I wll examine full- complexity gut microbiomes in humanized mouse guts through a collaboration with a gnotobiotic mouse facility to test fundamental principles established in the fly system from a more human- relevant perspective."
"9367001","Expression of proteins in spatially restricted patterns frequently relies on prior localization of the encoding mRNAs. One conserved RNA transport mechanism, used in multiple cell types, involves a stem-loop transport signal within the mRNA, and proteins (Egalitarian and Bicaudal-D) to bind the signal and link the RNA cargo with the dynein motor for transit along microtubules. This transport system also anchors the mRNAs at their destination, although anchoring is poorly understood. The initial step in localization of Drosophila oskar mRNA - transport from the nurse cells to the oocyte - relies on this conserved transport system. However, oskar mRNA differs from simple examples of this system, in that the mRNA must then be transferred to a different localization machinery for a later step in localization. Notably, the cis-acting localization signals in oskar mRNA that direct the initial transport step are individually weak, even though transport is robust. Replacing the multiple weak signals with a single strong signal disrupts the later step in localization. This suggests that weak association with the machinery for the initial transport step allows the mRNA to be handed off to the other type of machinery. A model is proposed to explain what makes the oskar transport signals weak, and how the conflicting requirements for weak signals yet highly efficient transport can both be met. In part, this model relies on Staufen protein to inhibit association of the oocyte transport machinery with the oskar oocyte transport signals. Staufen is more conventionally thought to act in the later step of oskar mRNA localization, although the staufen mutant phenotype is equally consistent with both models. One Aim is to confirm, using an affinity purification approach, that oskar relies on the conserved transport system for its initial step of localization and to reveal candidates for other contributing factors. The second Aim is to test two predictions of what makes the individual transport signals weak: modest affinity for the recognition factor, Egalitarian; and displacement of Egalitarian by Staufen after the mRNA arrives in the oocyte. The third Aim is to ask if the contribution of Staufen to localization of oskar mRNA is limited to the novel role postulated here, or if Staufen also has the conventional role, or both. The novel role for Staufen could explain how it contributes to a wide variety of forms of post-transcriptional regulation, a possibility that will be tested. A final Aim is to exploit unique features of this system in a sensitized genetic assay to evaluate candidate transport/anchoring factors, and to screen for such factors. Further analysis of these factors should provide substantial insights into many aspects of mRNA localization and anchoring."
"9469691","Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland dysfunction occurs as a result of pathological injury after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer as well as due to the autoimmune disease Sjogren?s Syndrome and severely impairs the oral health and quality of life of patients. Current treatment options focus on short-term relief from the symptoms but there are no long-term restorative therapies available. Potential regenerative strategies for restoring saliva production include synthesizing artificial salivary glands from stem cells or repopulating the saliva-producing acinar cells that are preferentially damaged by these pathologies. However, the mechanisms that regulate the formation and replacement of acinar cells are not known. In this application I propose to define the mechanisms that control the generation of secretory acini using the developing salivary gland. Acinar cells develop from SOX10+ progenitors through a series of stages marked by proliferation, differentiation, maturation and polarization. My preliminary data suggests that the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, ERBB3, is necessary and sufficient for the generation of acini, but whether ERBB3 signaling regulates each stage of acinar cell development is unclear. Thus, here I will test the hypothesis that ERBB3 and its ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) regulate multiple stages of acinar cell development. This proposal will address my hypothesis via 3 specific aims: 1) Define the requirement of NRG1/ERBB3 signaling in the different stages of acinus formation, 2) Determine the contribution of neuronal vs. mesenchymal NRG1 to acinar cell development and 3) Identify the signaling pathways downstream of NRG1/ERBB3 that regulate acinar morphogenesis. These aims will be achieved using a combination of biochemical, immunochemical, genetic, and high resolution imaging techniques. Outcomes from this investigation will be utilized in the development of artificial SGs as well as in regenerative studies with the long-term aim of developing therapeutic applications for reversing salivary function."

"9353559","Naïve T cells (TN) are produced in the thymus, but require peripheral mechanisms to maintain their homeostasis and function. The premise of this project is that, while thymic involution is a proximal cause of reduced TN numbers with aging, defects in peripheral maintenance mechanisms in secondary lymphoid organs (SLO) also significantly contribute to immunosenescence. Surprisingly, the nature and the causes of these defects that impair peripheral TN cell maintenance with aging remain largely unexplored. This project will test the hypothesis that defects in the peripheral maintenance of naïve T cells in the SLO must be understood and corrected to achieve lasting immune rejuvenation. This hypothesis is based on our recently published and preliminary findings that aging leads to disorganization of lymph node (LN) architecture resulting in a dysfunctional stromal cell compartment, including the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network in the T cell zone. These defects consequently led to impairment in production and presentation of key cytokines essential for optimal cell-cell interactions critical for recruitment and maintenance of TN cells.  In principle, the age-related changes/defects in TN cell maintenance could be due to changes/defects in TN cells themselves, or the SLO microenvironment or the circulatory factors surrounding TN and SLO . Therefore, we will examine how aging impairs maintenance of TN cells over the lifespan at the levels of: newly produced TN cells (SA1), stromal SLO elements (SA2) and the circulatory milieu (SA3). Once the defects are dissected, we will formulate interventions that improve peripheral T cell maintenance in aged organisms. These interventions will be tested by Core D, individually or combined with thymic rejuvenation treatments coming from P1-3, for the ability to improve protective immunity against infection. This project will also contribute to the generation of the Immune Aging Timeline, that will correlate age-related changes in thymus, LN and peripheral T cells in mice to those in humans, providing direct preclinical data that pave the way for human T cell rejuvenation in older adults."
"9352342","PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been thought that thoracic aortic dissections result from blood entering the aortic wall through an ?intimal flap? and separating the intramural layers. There is no direct evidence for this concept, however. This proposal offers a new paradigm for understanding aortic dissection. It is motivated by (i) serendipitous in vitro observations of load-induced intramural delaminations within the thoracic aorta of two different mouse models that also exhibit dramatic aortic dissections in vivo and (ii) our recent theoretical / computational advances that offer, for the first time, a mechanically mechanistic explanation for the initiation of an aortic delamination (separation of wall layers) that can progress to a dissection (separation with intramural blood). Specifically, we observed spontaneous intramural delaminations, without an intimal flap, during in vitro biaxial testing of otherwise grossly normal appearing aorta that were excised from ApoE-/- mice that were infused for 4 days with a high dose of angiotensin-II and from mice having a conditional knockout of the transforming growth factor type 2 receptor. These observations are the first, to our knowledge, of an intramural delamination as it develops under physiologic loading in a vessel having a native geometry, noting that we have never seen such in vitro delaminations in literally hundreds of experiments on arteries from mice that do not dissect in vivo. Both our novel observations and our new computational results point to an intramural swelling process (i.e., Donnan pressure) that conspires with local intramural stress concentrations to initially separate intramural layers and then to propagate this damage into what could become an aortic dissection in vivo. We will combine our in vitro methods for quantifying spontaneous delamination with three novel computational models to quantify the underlying mechanical mechanism of failure, driven mainly by a high tensile radial stress that separates the layers. The primary goal of this 2-year R21 project is, therefore, to elucidate the mechanical mechanisms by which a compromised thoracic aorta delaminates under physiologic loads (i.e., cyclic pressurization at the in vivo value of axial stretch). This work is significant because of the high mortality associated with aortic dissection and its prevalence in young and old individuals alike. This work builds on a strong foundation that we have built over the past two years via the development of novel computational models (finite element and continuum-particle), yet it is highly innovative because of the fortuitous discovery in vitro of spontaneous intramural delaminations in two mouse models that are prone to dissection in vivo and which promise to provide unique structural and mechanical data for model refinement and validation."
"9464057","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In HIV-endemic settings, many HIV-uninfected women choose to conceive with an HIV-infected or unknown- serostatus partner. For a woman who cannot depend on a partner to test, initiate and adhere to ART, sex without condoms puts her at high risk of acquiring HIV and increases the risk of perinatal transmission to her child. Daily, oral TDF/FTC PrEP dramatically reduces a woman's risk of HIV-acquisition and is the only female-controlled option for reducing her risk of periconception HIV-acquisition. Understanding whether daily, oral PrEP is feasible for uninfected women seeking pregnancy is critical to reducing HIV incidence among women and their children. We propose a single-arm study to offer daily, oral PrEP for periconception use to 350 HIV-uninfected women in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa who report personal or partner plans for pregnancy with an infected or unknown serostatus partner. Women who become pregnant on PrEP will have the option to continue PrEP during pregnancy. PrEP will be offered as part of a safer conception package inclusive of couples-based HIV counseling and testing. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the proportion of women initiating PrEP and determine factors associated with uptake. In Aim 2, we will evaluate objectively-measured PrEP adherence during periconception and pregnancy follow-up. Level, patterns, and correlates of adherence will be evaluated using plasma drug concentrations and electronic pill caps. Our primary outcome is prevalence of protective plasma tenofovir concentrations (> 40 ng/ml). We will also evaluate median adherence to dispensed pills with electronic pill caps. From formative studies in South Africa, we hypothesize that adherence to a proven intervention (TDF/FTC PrEP) for a defined risk period (periconception, pregnancy) with a clear end point (live birth) will be high (protective tenofovir concentrations at 80% of visits, adherence to >80% of prescribed pills). In Aim 3, longitudinal quantitative data and in-depth interviews with initially high- and low-adhering participants will inform our conceptual framework for periconception PrEP uptake and adherence. Placebo-controlled trials identified adherence as a major challenge to long-term PrEP use. However, women are eager for prevention strategies that allow for conception, and we hypothesize that adherence to a proven prevention strategy, for a limited time with the motivation to have a healthy child, will confer drug levels required to prevent HIV transmission. Consistent with PA11-275 Discovery, Development, & Testing of Novel Interventions to Advance HIV Prevention and Care, this application advances combination approaches to HIV- prevention and targets a population highly affected by the pandemic. This project will determine whether daily, oral PrEP is a feasible HIV-prevention strategy for South African women who conceive with risky partners. Given the repercussions of acquiring HIV during conception and pregnancy, this is an important step towards providing a key prevention strategy to women and their children."
"9308707","Project Summary/Abstract One crucial aspect of tissue homeostasis is the ability of adult stem cells to self-renew over long periods of time. It is well understood that tissue-specific transcription factors and microRNAs can act as key regulators of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Recently, a new class of molecules called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been described, and lncRNAs have now been shown to play important biological roles in a variety of cell types. Aberrant lncRNA expression may contribute to human neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer?s disease, and autism. However, it remains poorly understood whether lncRNAs can regulate stem cell self-renewal. The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the mouse brain contains a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) that can produce neurons as well as glial cells. An essential feature of these NSCs is their ability to self-renew, thus enabling the maintenance of a population of NSCs throughout life to support continued neurogenesis. We have previously identified the lncRNA Pnky as a neural-specific transcript expressed in the neurogenic lineage of the V-SVZ. It was determined that knockdown of Pnky in V- SVZ cultures results in a significant increase in neuroblast production, but the role of Pnky in the V-SVZ in vivo has not yet been explored. Since in vivo lncRNA studies are currently very limited, particularly for neural- specific lncRNAs, the major goal of this work is to analyze the expression and function of the lncRNA Pnky in the V-SVZ in vivo. To this end, a conditional Pnky knockout (Pnky-cKO) mouse has been generated. Preliminary studies of Pnky-cKO mice revealed an initial increase in neuroblast production. However, at later ages neurogenesis was substantially decreased, suggestive of possible stem cell depletion. Therefore, work proposed in Aim 1 will characterize the expression of Pnky within the neurogenic lineage of the V-SVZ. The Pnky-cKO mouse will then be used to analyze the effects of deleting Pnky from V-SVZ NSCs. In particular, whether Pnky regulates NSC quiescence will be tested. Aim 2 will analyze the molecular mechanism through which Pnky functions. It was previously determined that Pnky interacts with the splicing regulator PTBP1. Therefore, Aim 2 will address transcriptome-wide changes in NSCs following Pnky deletion, with particular focus on changes in abundance or splicing of known PTBP1 targets. Together, these aims will test the hypothesis that Pnky is required for the long-term maintenance of V-SVZ NSCs. This analysis of the role of a specific lncRNA in neural stem cells in vivo will contribute novel insights into how lncRNAs can regulate stem cells and underlie disease. The feasibility of this work is supported by the Preliminary Data, strong mentoring team, and customized training plan."
"9408813","Project Summary/Abstract: The objective of this proposal is to transform a hand-held surgical robotic system for transurethral laser prostate surgery from a lab prototype into a commercial product. The system will feature needle-sized arms deployed through the endoscope port and will enable independent tissue manipulation, laser aiming, and visual- ization, making surgery more accurate and ef?cient. Clinical signi?cance comes from (1) the large number of patients who could bene?t (1 in 3 men will need surgery for an enlarged prostate (BPH); there are 300,000 surgeries per year in the USA ? projected to double in the next 10 years), and (2) the fact that only 1.7% of these patients currently bene?t from the holmium laser- based procedure we seek to facilitate. This is in spite of multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrating that it reduces reoperation rates from 9-18% to essentially zero, eliminates the need for blood transfusions, and reduces hospitalization time by 43% and catheterization time by 63%. The reason for the underdeployment of holmium laser surgery is clear: the procedure is challenging for surgeons to accomplish, due to the lack of dexterity in current endoscope-deployed instruments. Currently, the surgeon must use the tip of a rigid endoscope to do three things at once: aim a laser ?ber, visualize the surgical ?eld, and maneuver tissue into position for cutting. We hypothesize that the availability of dexterous needle-sized arms to aim the laser and retract tissue at the endoscope tip will make the procedure easier to perform, and thereby facilitate wider adoption of a procedure that is already known to improve patient outcomes. The innovation in this work is that this is the ?rst-ever multi-arm hand-held surgical robotic system. Further- more, in contrast to current commercial surgical robotic systems, which are large, expensive, and complex, our system will be small, cost effective, and require no complex surgeon console or articulated manipulator system surrounding the patient. These bene?ts come from the ability to deliver needle-sized robotic arms through the port in a standard clinical endoscope. The arms are made of telescoping, curved, elastic tubes. By axially rotating and telescopically extending the tubes, our robot will provide the surgeon with two small ?tentacle-like? manipulators at the tip of the endoscope. One carries the holmium laser ?ber for cutting, and the other enables retraction. Our approach in Aim 1 is to design a robotic system that is suitable for regulatory approval, addressing sterility and manufacturability. In Aim 2 we implement safety systems as well as software-based reliability monitoring approaches. In Aim 3 we validate the system experimentally, quantitatively comparing surgeon performance with our robotic system to the current standard of care. The outcomes of this project are (1) an operating-room- ready robotic system, (2) an FDA pre-submission with complete regulatory master plan, and (3) quantitative data showing that our system makes surgeons who have not previously tried holmium laser surgery operate with speed and quality comparable to surgeons without the robot who have done 50+ cases (i.e. it eliminates the instrument dexterity barriers that currently prevent patients from bene?ting from this procedure)."

"9356567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary Care Based Feeding and Screen Time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white children, a disparity that emerges in infancy. Among Latino children, those with Spanish-speaking parents are at highest risk for obesity. Research has shown that optimal feeding strategies in early life and avoidance of screen time may lower the risk of childhood obesity, which in turn, reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities through    adulthood. However, few interventions have sought to promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino parents. In addition, most interventions in the literature that address infant obesity prevention have been conducted through home visits or special trips to the intervention site by parents, approaches that may not be sustainable in low-resource settings due to cost and the burden on participants. Given that infants are expected to have 7 well-child visits in the first year of life, primary care is an ideal setting in which to ofer parental education on infant feeding and screen time recommendations. The overall objective of this proposal is to design, pilot test, and refine a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants born to Spanish-speaking    mothers. Our overarching hypothesis is that focused education on infant feeding and screen time avoidance will lead to use of optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers and result in less weight gain in the first year of life. In preparation for submitting an R01 application to test this hypothesis, we propose research with the following specific aims to be conducted at the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outpatient pediatric clinic: Aim 1: Use the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to design 5 group educational modules that promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers; Aim 2: Use a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test a yearlong intervention in which the 5 modules (Aim 1) are provided to Spanish-speaking Latino mothers just after well-child visits at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (primary outcomes will include use of responsive feeding practices, infant dietary intake, and infant active and passive television viewing time; secondary outcomes will be infant anthropometrics); Aim 3: Use qualitative methods to assess how individual components of the intervention from Aim 2 affected feeding and screen time practices. By the conclusion of    this award, we will have a scalable and potentially reproducible intervention for infant feeding and screen time practices, one that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking Latino parents and aims to reduce weight gain in the first year of life while promoting habits that protect against obesity across the lifespan. Dr. Amy Beck, PI for this mentored career development award, is a bilingual pediatrician with considerable clinical experience caring for low-income Latino children and a deep commitment to improving health outcomes    in this population. Dr. Beck is a pediatric attending at SFGH (a public hospital affiliated with UCSF that serves a majority Latino population) where she provides both general pediatric care and also is the co-director of the pediatric obesity clinic. With respect to her research background, Dr. Beck holds a MPH and completed a General Pediatrics research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). During her fellowship, Dr. Beck used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate risk factors for obesity among Latino children. She has 5 first-author publications, of which 4 directly inform this proposal. She is currently conducting two pilot intervention studies in obesity prevention and treatment for Latino children. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in the field of obesity prevention with a focus on improving preventive services for low-income Latino children. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Beck must strengthen her skills in biostatistics and qualitative methods and acquire new skills in dietary analysis and RCTs of behavioral interventions. Dr. Beck has formed an    interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and consultants with expertise in general pediatrics, nutrition, psychology, anthropology, Latino health, pediatric obesity, and health policy. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Cabana, is an internationally respected health services researcher and the Division Chief of General Pediatrics at UCSF. Dr. Cabana has extensive expertise in the design and conduct of RCTs in the ambulatory setting and a strong track record of mentorship. In addition to her mentored research plan and ongoing tutorials with her    diverse mentorship team, Dr. Beck will take advantage of UCSF's numerous opportunities for research training. She will enroll in additional courses offered through the Training in Clinical Research Program that cover specific areas of her career development plan. She will also take a course at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health on dietary assessment. Finally, she will attend seminars offered by the Division of General Pediatrics and participate in the K scholars program offered by the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at UCSF. Dr. Beck has the full support of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics and the Division of General Pediatrics for this proposed award. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Beck will be well positioned as an    independent investigator in the field of childhood obesity prevention research."

"9322375","The goals of therapeutic intervention in ANCA glomerulonephritis (GN) have evolved from preventing mortality to minimizing adverse effects of immunosuppression. Reduction of complications requires: 1) minimizing duration of immunotherapy for patients in complete durable remission and 2) prevention of infections in patients who need continued immunotherapy. The objective of this Project is to improve long-term outcomes of patients with ANCA GN by maintaining durable remission and minimizing complications of immunotherapy. Aim 1 evaluates the concept of remission and disease cure by seeking a molecular ?remission signature? that can be used to identify those at very low relapse risk. We will measure immunologic, cellular, genetic and epigenetic markers in patients in complete remission off therapy for at least 2 years compared to matched patients with active disease. While Aim 1 strives to define patients who may be cured of disease, Aim 2 builds on the evidence that robust regulatory B cell populations impart a lower risk of relapse and identify patients who do not need maintenance immunosuppression. We propose a proof-of-concept prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial evaluating time to relapse in patients who have attained remission with traditional induction therapy. Patients with recovery of a high proportion of B regulatory cells will be managed expectantly without further immunotherapy. Those with a low proportion of regulatory B cells will be randomized to maintenance immunosuppressive therapy or to close clinical monitoring with immunotherapy guided by clinical signs of active vasculitis. Although Aim 1 and Aim 2 focus on reducing immunosuppression, it is irrefutable that immunosuppression is a requirement for all patients with ANCA GN. Aim 3 focuses on limiting infectious complications of immunosuppression, the chief cause of death in ANCA GN. Knowing that respiratory infections are the leading cause of total and serious infections in ANCA GN, we propose a feasibility trial whereby patients with active disease will be randomized to receive placebo or daily azithromycin for 12 months, in in conjunction with standard immunotherapy. Azithromycin was selected for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary outcome will be incidence of respiratory tract infections, with secondary outcomes of incidence of serious infections, time to relapse, all-cause mortality, and adverse events associated with study medication also evaluated. Overall this Project aims to improve morbidity and mortality in ANCA GN through elimination of unnecessary immunosuppression in those with low risk of disease flare and to find protective strategies to reduce infectious burden in those requiring immunosuppression."
"9477238","The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the frequency of disease outbreaks caused by food and other environmental sources contaminated with enteric pathogens. Identification and removal of sources of contamination is key to achieving this goal. To link sources and patient disease, public health laboratories look for matching genetic fingerprints using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). While PFGE based surveillance has been successful at reducing the number of outbreaks, its low resolution is a barrier to further gains. This leads to many sources remaining unidentified. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is being adopted by state and federal public health laboratories because of its greater genetic resolution when compared to PFGE and demonstrated ability to improve source attribution. WGS is described as offering the ultimate resolution since each nucleotide in the genome can be queried and phylogenetic relationships can be inferred using well established computational models. However, to achieve the full promise of this technology large well curated databases are required that harbor sequence and associated metadata from isolates collected at diverse locations and times. Such databases aid in source attribution, understanding the natural history of the organisms, and provide a valuable resource for data mining. One such database is curated by the GenomeTrakr Network. The immediate goal of this project is to add eight hundred unique and diverse draft genomes from food and environmental bacterial pathogens to this database. This will be accomplished by sequencing well characterized isolates at the Wadsworth Center and sharing the sequence and metadata with the GenomeTrakr network and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The expected outcome of this project will be to expand the GenomeTrakr database of high quality scaffold genomes that are linked to metadata. This will allow more accurate subtyping to link patient pathogens to specific foods or environmental sources and ultimately a reduction pathogen borne illness. !"

"9395799","Project Summary/Abstract  Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are critical transmembrane proteins in skeletal muscle, nerve, heart, and neuronal cells. Malfunction of these proteins has been implicated in numerous health conditions, including epilepsy, arrhythmia, and pain. Saxitoxin (STX) and related guanidinium toxins are highly potent, naturally- occurring compounds which bind select NaV subtypes at low nanomolar potency. One compound, zetekitoxin AB (ZTX), possesses picomolar affinity for several NaVs and is the most structurally complex relative of the guanidinium family of natural products. ZTX is very rare and has only been subject to preliminary study against three of the ten NaVs. The structure of ZTX is also uncertain based on the recorded spectroscopic data, complicating efforts to prepare and study ZTX via chemical synthesis.  This research project aims to study the biology and structure of ZTX using a combination of model toxins containing fragments of the putative structure, computational NMR spectroscopy, whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, and molecular biology. Binding affinities for model toxin compounds, using whole-cell voltage clamp techniques against wild-type and mutant NaV isoforms, will provide insight into the impact of key ZTX structural elements on toxin/channel interactions. Computational spectroscopy methods offer the opportunity to rapidly study candidate structures and direct chemical synthesis efforts. This work also aims to achieve the first total synthesis of ZTX in order to unambiguously confirm its assigned structure, with the flexibility to easily produce diverse congeners for biological study.  Definitive assignment of the ZTX structure and knowledge of critical toxin/channel binding interactions will lead to small-molecule probes that provide deeper understanding of NaV structure, function, and dynamics. These new small molecules and the study of their interactions with NaVs will lay the groundwork for the future development of compounds capable of selectively modulating dysfunctional NaVs implicated in several serious human channelopathies."
"9352376","Data Generation Component  We propose three broad experimental aims based around the type of assay, perturbagens and technologies being applied that will overlap across the years. The first will use iPSCs from three disease states (non affected, SMA and ALS) in which we have shown specific phenotypes. We will use an iterative approach by first screening for a number of perturbagens of interest to the broad neuroscience community using cost effective assays including simple cell death models and a highly novel imaging analysis system. The second parallel effort will be to use the same iPSC lines but in this case test a set of known cell modifiers (Glutamate, ER stressor and SOD1 ASO) as perturbagens and perform massive parallel quantitative molecular phenotyping (QMP) to generate robust signatures and to define the responses of motor neuron cultures to these perturbagens. We will then perform QMP on neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from disease and control cells and in response to the same perturbations as above to elucidate signatures across broadly relevant neural cell types. This data will be compared to motor neuron cultures (where expected disease signature will be) with non motor neuron cultures (where no or a more restricted disease signature is expected) to resolve the question of cell type specificity. We will also generate new iPS lines from post mortem human patient tissues to allow clinical pathological signatures to be incorporated into the LINCS data, providing a unique resource to both the SMA and ALS scientific community and to researchers interested in larger questions relating to the CNS. The third is to bring in disease iPS lines from Huntington's and Parkinson's subjects (from the respective NIH consortia and in coordination with various foundations - see letters of support. Overall) and test the specificity of signatures seen in the motor neuron diseases with other neurodegenerative conditions (both disease and response to perturbagens). All of these studies will be done in close association with the data analysis component community section (being responsive to the needs of the community). Given the speed of discovery in iPSC and new molecule generation, we also aim to be flexible in our design to allow incorporation of breakthrough technologies or drugs should they arise."
"9334880","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pathologic myopia, or extreme nearsightedness, is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, particularly in Asian populations. It has been estimated that up to 2.3 billion people are myopic globally (with a prevalence as high as 80% in Southeast Asia) and the numbers are rising. Although minimal levels of near-sightedness are considered a minor inconvenience, high (pathologic) myopia can lead to irreversible vision loss. Myopia is often due to excessive eye elongation. Pathologic myopia is due to progressive, lifelong and extreme eye elongation with subsequent eye wall (sclera) thinning, which allows for localized outpouchings (called staphyloma). Development of staphyloma often immediately precedes irreversible vision loss. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to stunt myopia progression and identify patients at risk of vision loss. Although scleral collagen dysfunction has been proposed to underlie staphyloma formation, there is no safe, effective therapy to fortify the eye wall collagen or a standard quantitative method to assess for staphyloma progression. We now have a group of chemicals (beta-nitroalcohols or BNAs) that can stiffen tissue by crosslinking collagen in animal models and imaging technology that can assess the eye wall in vivo and potentially monitor scleral strength and pliability in both animals as well as human patients. Taken together, we can now test whether BNAs can stunt physiologic as well as pathologic eye elongation as assessed by in vivo imaging in animal models. We also hypothesize that the same imaging modalities can be used to identify myopic patients at risk of vision loss. Specifically, we propose to employ various BNAs to crosslink scleral collagen to act as a mortar, stiffening the eye wall. In Aim 1, we test which BNAs effectively and safely stunt physiologic eye elongation in growing adolescent rabbits and guinea pig pups. In Aim 2, we will apply the most effective BNAs in an attempt to stunt pathologic eye elongation in a guinea pig model of myopia, recently shown capable of forming staphyloma. We will phenotype these animals using multimodal imaging established in our pilot work. These imaging modalities will be used concurrently in Aim 3 where we perform natural history studies in highly myopic patients with and without staphyloma to elucidate a quantitative measure of susceptibility to staphyloma development/progression and key time points or anatomic locations toward which therapy should be directed. Our goal is to identify the type of patients who would most benefit from BNA treatment. We hypothesize that crosslinking the component collagen will stiffen the eye wall, thereby halting myopia progression and avoiding permanent vision loss and that at-risk patients can be identified by the pliability of staphyloma. This work has the potential to aid millions of pathologic myopia patients with weakened staphyloma, otherwise destined for permanent vision loss. Fortifying eyes that have prematurely reached adult eye length, but have yet to reach physical maturity, may allow billions of young patients to avoid myopia altogether."
"9355582","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women worldwide and the numbers are disproportionately high for women in developing countries. Developing countries demand low-cost, portable diagnostic tools that are easy to use and do not require additional professional staff to be effective. We propose a low-cost, portable, automated ultrasound device containing software to improve the image quality and provide computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) to locate and distinguish between clearly benign and potentially malignant palpable breast lumps. While screening has been the focus for diagnosis in western countries, breast cancer most commonly presents in women less than 50 years of age and as a palpable lump in developing countries. The common types of breast lumps in this age group (cysts, fibroadenomas, fibrocystic change and cancer) are usually distinct on ultrasound with fewer than 10% representing malignancy in young women. Our goal is to develop a device that could be used by a local health aid to determine which breast lumps need to be biopsied because they are suspicious and which can be left alone. This would enable stressed healthcare delivery systems to focus resources on the women most likely to benefit from their efforts.  In order to provide an effective tool for breast cancer triage in developing countries we propose to do the following: 1. Introduce novel algorithms for ultrasound image enhancement and computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD). These algorithms take advantage of temporal information available in a live ultrasound scan to determine the probability of malignancy. 2. Clinical trial in California to determine the sensitiviy and specificity of the ultrasound device. A clinical trial on a cohort group that matches the women in developing countries will determine the effectiveness of the technology. 3. Clinical trial to validate effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of technology in an LMIC environment The clinical trial will be performed in Mexico. This work is a close collaboration with breast cancer expert and surgeon, Dr. Susan Love, breast imaging radiologist, clinical trial expert Dr. Wendie Berg, medical and software product development and commercialization expert, Christine Podilchuk, PhD, technology and commercialization expert, Professor Richard Mammone, and professor of surgery and global health medicine expert, Dr. Ben Anderson."
"9468359","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Objective: To empirically test the Rasch UE motor ability measurement framework. Background: The  overwhelming majority of Veterans who survive stroke are unable to fully re-engage in meaningful activities  because of persistent UE motor impairment. While advances from neuroscience are spurring development of  new rehabilitation strategies, testing new strategies requires accurate quantification of impairment level in  order to determine if a person is appropriate for a therapy and whether they have benefitted. It is essential to  maximize and tailor rehabilitative strategies to an individual's specific impairments. However, currently, thereis  no comprehensive evidence-based framework for objectively quantifying post-stroke UE motor ability (level of  impairment), matching therapy to impairment level, or measuring specific therapy effects. Therefore there has  not been a rehabilitation trial testing the effects of a therapy where a measurement framework is the basis for  designing the treatment not only defining the outcome. In applying Rasch analysis, to the FMA-UE, we  developed the Rasch UE motor ability measurement framework that locates a patient along a continuum of  impairment and identifies the next steps in the recovery process. The purpose of this proposed research is to  empirically test this framework. Methods: This is a double blinded randomized study with parallel arm design,  stratified sampling and blocked randomization. 120 individuals with post-stroke UE hemiparesis will be  enrolled; 40 participants per 3 UE impairment levels as defined by the Rasch FMA-UE measurement  framework. Participants will undergo Rasch FMA-UE assessment each week for 4 weeks (pre-, day 7, mid-,  day 21 and post-treatment) and assessments of 3D unconstrained reaching at 3 time points (pre-, mid-, post-  treatment) and engage in 12 sessions (3x/week for 4 weeks, 2 hrs/session) of reach-to-grasp task-practice.  Within each impairment level, subjects will be randomized to a treatment group; 20 subjects will receive  targeted task-practice and 20 subjects will receive non-targeted task-practice. Targeted task-practice is tailored  to patient-specific UE motor deficits with initial targets (goals) defind according to baseline Rasch FMA-UE  measures and targets continually progressed after every 3 therapy sessions so that the goals match the  patient's evolving level of ability. Non-targeted task practice is defined as a standard of care task-practice  intervention intended to increase UE use but not alter specific impairments. Data analyses will include (1)  ANOVA to test the effects of targeted vs. non-targeted therapy on UE motor ability, (2) multiple regression to  model the relationship between therapy and movement adaptions occurring pre- to post-rehabilitation, and (3)  growth mixture modeling to define responders and non-responders. Hypotheses: Therapeutic task practice at  the just-right challenge of difficulty will maximize post-stroke moto skill reacquisition. We expect that targeted  practice, will increase UE motor ability because the difficulty of task goals will be matched and systematically  progressed according to patients' initial and evolving levels of ability. Significance: The need for novel  interventions to improve the function of Veterans who sustain stroke is important. Many new rehabilitation  strategies are being developed and tested. Standardized assessments are used to define the value of these  new strategies. However, most widely used standardized assessments are inadequate because they fail to  clearly measure baseline ability or define treatment response, as a result, do not inform treatment decisions.  Therefore measurement is disconnected from treatment planning. Unfortunately the development of novel  measurement methods has not kept pace with the development of novel interventions. We strongly believe that  new measurement methods are needed, particularly those that both prescribe treatment and monitor  outcomes. If this Merit Review is successful, the Rasch UE ability framework will lead to future studies aimed  at 1) implementing the Rasch FMA-UE framework into clinical practice for theoretically-grounded treatment  planning decisions, and 2) refining targeted UE treatments for improved treatment efficacy."
"9380526","Project Summary Despite the safe sleep campaign, SIDS remains the leading cause of postneonatal infant mortality in the United States today, with an overall rate of 0.40/1000 live births. Our laboratory has provided compelling evidence in 4 independent datasets of defects in the serotonergic (5-HT) network in the medulla (lower brainstem) involved in protective responses to life-threatening challenges during sleep. These 5-HT defects include significantly decreased levels (~26%) of 5-HT itself in SIDS cases compared to age-adjusted controls. Over the last two decades, our group has provided substantial evidence, from studies using neurochemical techniques in frozen tissue, that a subset of SIDS is characterized by serotonergic (5-HT) brainstem pathology in regions involved in cardiorespiratory control and arousal. In 2015, we then reported a novel anatomic finding, from light microscope studies, in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in a major subgroup of SIDS cases (~40%) in a separate dataset. In this latter dataset, 5-HT brainstem neurochemical defects could not be simultaneously sought because the hippocampal tissues were from formalin fixed brains in the archives of the San Diego medical examiner's system. The dentate abnormality in SIDS is part of the spectrum of granule cell dispersion (GCD), which is characterized prominently by bilamination of the granule cells (GCs), so-called dentate bilamination (DB). DB and associated GC abnormalities in the SIDS cases had almost exclusively been reported previously in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), some of who died from sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We now ask: 1) Do cases of SIDS-DB also have 5-HT brainstem pathology? 2) Does the combined entity of SIDS-DB and 5-HT pathology share molecular, cellular, and genetic features with TLE and/or SUDEP? 3) Does SIDS-DB and 5-HT pathology represent one of many entities on a spectrum of underlying, intrinsic temporal lobe vulnerabilities associated with sudden death across life? In these scenarios, DB is postulated to be a developmental abnormality in GC proliferation and/or migration, and a precursor lesion to Ammon's horn sclerosis in TLE. We will test the overall hypothesis that the DG and medullary 5-HT network are both abnormal in the same SIDS cases, and that SIDS cases with DB share molecular, cellular, and genetic features in common with TLE and/or SUDEP. In four Specific Aims, we will test this hypothesis using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, including transcriptomics with laser capture microdissection in the granule cells of the hippocampus, and whole exome sequencing in SIDS cases with DB. The study's potential impact is the discovery of a cause(s) of large subgroup (40%) of SIDS that will lead to intervention strategies, as well as biomarkers to identify living infants at risk. Understanding DB in SIDS also opens up avenues to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathology of sudden unexplained death beyond infancy, including SUDC and SUDEP."
"9358442","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an RNA virus of the flavivirus genus that is causing an emerging global epidemic. ZIKV infection has been strongly associated with neurological disorders, including congenital microcephaly, in which brain size is severely reduced. Moreover the CDC has recently concluded that ZIKV causes microcephaly. The severity of ZIKV-associated microcephaly is suggestive of an early insult to brain development. In human microcephalic brains, ZIKV RNA has been detected in neurons and prospective glia. In mouse models of ZIKV infection, virus has also been detected in these same populations. ZIKV has also been shown to infect neural stem cells impacting their growth and survival. During early stages of fetal brain development, neural stem cells produce neurons and shift to glia production as development proceeds. Neural stem cell dysfunction is thought to be an underlying cause for genetic forms of microcephaly. Altogether this suggests a potential mechanism to explain why ZIKV infects both neurons and glia. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that ZIKV infection targets embryonic neural stem cells, altering their cellular behavior and transcriptome. Using a novel set of assays developed in our labs, we will pursue two aims. First, we will determine how ZIKV impacts neural stem cells including production of new viable progeny. Second we will define the host mRNAs dynamically regulated by ZIKV infection in neural stem cells. Upon completion, these aims will elucidate a fundamental understanding of ZIKV biology, particularly within the developing nervous system, essential information for beginning to control the ZIKV epidemic."
"9519235","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly is an essential part of development, tissue homeostasis, aging, wound healing, and initiation and progression of disease. The physical and mechanical properties of the ECM are emerging as critical regulators of these processes through their effects on cell organization and signaling. During development and in pathologies such as cancer, fibrosis, and connective tissue abnormalities, the composition and the physical state of the ECM can vary dramatically. To develop treatments to prevent or reverse the effects of abnormal ECM, we need to understand the molecular interactions that assemble a tissue-appropriate matrix and how these are affected in disease. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine how the assembly of the pericellular matrix supports and directs the subsequent assembly of additional ECM components to build a tissue-appropriate definitive matrix. Fibronectin (FN) is a ubiquitous ECM protein that makes an essential connection between cell surface receptors and other ECM components. FN is assembled into a fibrillar ECM via a cell-mediated process that involves FN conformational changes to promote FN-FN interactions and culminates with the definitive FN matrix that can be identified by insolubility in the detergent deoxycholate (DOC). A critical question for understanding tissue-appropriate ECM assembly is the effect of compliance since matrix assembly occurs in tissues that differ significantly in stiffness. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that stiffness of the pericellular ECM governs FN matrix assembly by regulating one or more key steps in the assembly process. We will analyze the major steps of assembly (integrin binding, FN conformational changes, and DOC insolubility) using polyacrylamide gel substrates of defined elastic modulus and will test the idea that FN conformation differs in matrices assembled under different stiffness conditions using a conformation-sensitive antibody. The insoluble FN matrix forms the foundation for assembly of other ECM proteins, including some collagens, yet we have limited understanding of its structure. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that specific FN-FN interactions mediate the final step in assembly of the definitive DOC- insoluble matrix. Mutant recombinant FNs will be used to identify important interacting residues and a novel mass spectrometry screen will be applied to identify other FN domains involved in DOC-insoluble interactions. To understand the interplay between FN assembly, tissue stiffness, and incorporation of other ECM proteins, in Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that FN matrix controls both cell fate and deposition of collagens in a tissue differentiation model, in vitro chondrogenesis. We will manipulate the level of insoluble FN matrix and its stiffness and determine the effects on differentiation markers and assembly of collagens during chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. The information obtained through the proposed studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of normal matrix assembly and will suggest ways in which disease can change assembly to cause abnormal ECM accumulation as in fibrosis, scar formation, and cancer."
"9288055","PROJECT SUMMARY Antibodies against neuronal receptors and synaptic proteins are associated with encephalitic syndromes that produce either movement or psychiatric disorders. While the identification of autoantibodies has facilitated diagnosis and treatments for some of these disorders, the mechanisms by which autoantibodies enter the brain and cause neurovascular pathology remain unclear. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in children are associated with basal ganglia encephalitis (BGE) that produces both motor [Sydenham?s chorea (SC)] and psychiatric [Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus infections (PANDAS)] symptoms. The humoral adaptive immune response plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. Autoantibodies that recognize dopamine receptors (D1R/D2R) are found in sera from acutely ill children with SC/PANDAS. These autoantibodies elicit behavioral abnormalities when infused into rodent brains or administered intravenously (i.v.) into naive recipient rodents in conjunction with agents that break down the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We have previously shown that an intranasal (i.n.) route of GAS infection leads to production of Th17 cells, which are an essential component of the cell-mediated adaptive immune response, in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue of mice and humans. GAS-specific Th17 cells migrate from the nose into the brain via an olfactory route and their presence correlates with BBB breakdown, extravasation and brain deposition of antibodies. We hypothesize that GAS-specific Th17 cells arising after multiple i.n. infections enter the brain via the olfactory nerve using specific chemokine cues, to induce BBB breakdown thus enabling entry of autoantibodies into the brain, and modulate the function of specific neural circuits together with autoantibodies. The primary objective of the study is to examine the mechanisms by which GAS-specific Th17 cells enter the CNS in mice. The second objective is to determine the specific roles that Th17 cells or autoantibodies play in brain vasculature pathology (BBB damage), neuroinflammation and dysfunction of olfactory and dopaminergic neural circuits. We will first examine whether GAS-specific T cells enter the CNS via the i.n. or i.v. route by passively transferring them into naïve mice and examining their distribution into the brain. We will then inhibit migration of T cells into the CNS using pharmacological inhibitors for immune cell trafficking after multiple GAS infections. We will analyze the consequences of i.n. GAS infections for the function of olfactory circuits and odor perception as well as basal ganglia circuitry and motor behaviors. Finally, we will determine the relative contribution that cell-mediated (Th17 cells) versus humoral (autoantibodies) immune mechanisms play in neurovascular and dopamine circuitry deficits in brains of GAS-infected mice using both genetic loss-of-function studies and adoptive transfer experiments. This project will shed light in autoimmune-mediated mechanisms of encephalitic syndromes associated with movement or psychiatric disorders and aid in developing future therapeutics to treat these diseases."

Each trainee will be appointed to the program for two years, although they and all other trainees are encouraged to be involved throughout their training. Faculty activities will initially target the Principal Investigators/advisors of those trainees, plus leaders of all of the biomedical research-based graduate programs from the two universities and other members of the training faculty who are supportive of this change of culture in the career development of biomedical researchers. Taking advantage of the wide variety of activities in the Atlanta biomedical research community at institutions such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and members of the pharmaceutical industry, we will establish, implement, and assess innovative approaches and activities to broaden and compliment traditional research training in the biomedical sciences, in the following three Aims: Aim 1: To expose trainees to a broad variety of career pathways beyond academia. Aim 2: To provide trainees deep immersion into a specific career pathway beyond academia. Aim 3: To better equip faculty at Emory and Georgia Tech to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for the 21st century workforce. The Atlanta BEST Program will leverage existing institutional resources from Emory and Georgia Tech to broaden and enrich training experiences for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, and their faculty mentors, and will develop meaningful opportunities targeting various career pathways outside of academia including a variety of internships with local institutions and agencies. The lessons learned from this effort will be used identify best practices for training of the biomedical research workforce, and will be disseminated broadly via publication, discussion at a local symposium of Atlanta-area research institutions, presentations by faculty and trainees in educational sessions of professional meetings, and via other avenues."
"9280874","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an innovative, systems biology approach to uncover new therapeutic strategies for childhood embryonal tumors. Our project is a collaboration between labs in two separate Integrative Cancer Biology Program (ICBP) centers and a leading hospital-based translational research lab that is not within the ICBP network. Embryonal tumors are the most common central nervous system malignancies in childhood, and there is a pressing need for better therapies. Current survival rates range from 30 - 80%, and nearly all survivors have impaired neurological and neurocognitive function. Extensive genomic analysis of medulloblastomas, the most common embryonal tumors, failed to identify driver genes that could explain the origin of most tumors or suggest new strategies. Nevertheless, these tumors can be grouped into a small number of subtypes that share transcriptional patterns and clinical outcomes. We believe that it is time for a fundamentally new approach that seeks oncogenic driver pathways rather than driver genes. As many different genomic changes can all affect the same driver pathway, such pathways cannot be uncovered by looking for recurring genomic changes. Rather, we will use a systems biology approach to identify these oncogenic driver pathways. We will collect comprehensive datasets in human medulloblastoma tumors and cell lines by measuring mutations, copy number variations, mRNA expression, miRNA expression and epigenomic data. We will then construct network models identifying shared pathways altered across many patients within a subtype. Finally, we will functionally test driver pathways nominated from the network modeling. By merging these diverse genomic and transcriptional data collected from tumors of individual patients, we will have an unprecedented ability to uncover the root causes of cancer, providing new therapeutic strategies. The collective expertise of our collaboration provides a unique environment for solving this critical barrier in cancer, by combining strengths in analyzing genomic data, modeling signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks and clinical expertise in embryonal brain tumors. Together, we will generate and merge all types of transcriptional, genomic and epigenomic data, extract biologically-relevant network models and experimentally validate novel drug targets."

"9338315","Our hypothesis is that advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in combination with the  quantitative evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites can be exploited to develop a comprehensive  set of biomarkers for assessing disease severity and therapeutic response in children with late infantile  neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL). The ultimate goal of our work is to accurately and objectively assess  therapeutic efficacy and thereby improve the medical management of LINCL subjects, especially as new  treatment options for LINCL become available. Our specific goal is to develop an imaging biomarker panel  for assessing LINCL disease severity and therapeutic response at the level of individual substructures in the  brain, and compare this with the results of CSF metabolomics.  Our Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1) To develop a brain-region-specific magnetic resonance imaging  biomarker panel, including diffusion coefficients, diffusion fractional anisotropy, T2 relaxation times, T2*  relaxation times, the volume percentage of CSF, and proton spectroscopic metabolite ratios. We will  examine over 30 brain regions in 16 LINCL subjects in a control group at the time of enrollment, and again  18 months later. Aim 2: To develop a CSF metabolite biomarker panel that includes the evaluation of over  1000 compounds, and test its correlation with the MRI biomarkers, clinical indicators of disease severity, and  subject age. CSF will be collected from the 16 LINCL subjects in the control group via lumbar puncture  performed under anesthesia at one day prior to administration of gene therapy and again 18 months later.  Aim 3: To apply the MRI biomarker panel in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of AAVrh.10 mediated  gene therapy for LINCL. Sixteen subjects in a treatment group will be examined at 5 MRI time points,  including at the time of screening, one day before administration of therapy, and again at 6, 12 and 18  months post therapy."
"9340287","Project Summary The development of the nervous system requires the proper differentiation, migration, morphogenesis and maturation of neurons. The morphological differentiation of individual neurons and assembly of the trillions of neuronal connections that compose the human nervous system occurs through guided extension of axons and dendrites. The long-term objective of our research is to better understand the intracellular signaling cascades and effector mechanisms that are responsible for axon outgrowth and guidance in the developing brain. For this we must understand how nerve growth cones detect, integrate and respond to soluble, as well as cell- and substratum-associated guidance molecules in their environment. Mutations in genes involved in the detection and transduction of axon guidance information into directed neurite outgrowth are responsible for many neuro- developmental disorders, including autisms, dyslexias, psychological disorders and cognitive deficits. Therefore, our work aimed at better understanding the molecular basis of normal neural development, may help inform treatments for conditions leading to abnormal neural network assembly. While extensive studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate axon guidance over two- dimensional substrata in vitro or along axonal tracks in vivo, little is known about the signals that control axon guidance across three-dimensional tissues. Our preliminary and recently published data suggest that along with planar filopodia and lamellipodia, growth cones generate orthogonal protrusions in vitro and in vivo that resemble podosomes or invadopodia. Podosomes and invadopodia, collectively referred to as invadosomes, are actin-based cellular protrusions associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and tissue invasion. We hypothesize that growth cone invadosomes function to actively detect ligands through receptor interactions that regulate actin polymerization and participate in ligand and receptor degradation to modulate ligand-mediated guidance. The three aims of this proposal will use a series of molecular gain of function and loss of function manipulations, together with super resolution three-dimensional fluorescence imaging, to assess the signals that control invadosome formation and their roles in controlling neural network formation."
"9349385","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals has been dramatically improved with the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy, but these drugs are unable to cure the infection due to the presence of latent virus that persists for decades in resting memory CD4+ T cells. If at any point treatment is stopped, this virus can reactivate and reseed the infection. Consequently, expensive and inconvenient therapy must be taken for life, and the risks of adverse effects, immunologic damage, and drug resistance are exacerbated. Major research efforts are now underway to develop therapies to cure the infection and allow individuals to safely stop antiretroviral drugs. These include methods to eliminate remaining viral reservoirs, using latency-reversing drugs or stem cell transplants, or to render infectable cells resistant to infection by gene-therapy. However, there are many challenges and unknowns about these proposed interventions. Patients must be followed for multiple years after stopping treatment to ensure that they are cured. The current assays to quantify the size of viral reservoirs and measures changes in response to therapy have very limited sensitivity. We lack short-term markers to predict eventual therapy success, or in vitro benchmarks to prioritize which drugs to move from the laboratory to the clinic. Two recent HIV-infected patients who received stem cell transplants had undetectable viral reservoirs and were thought to be cured, but rebounded after many months off treatment. New methods are needed to interpret these studies. I propose to develop mathematical and statistical tools to help predict and interpret the leading HIV eradication strategies under investigation. Specifically, this work will include 1) developing a mathematical framework to predict the reduction in the reservoir needed to discontinue treatment, and statistical tools to advise aspects of trial design such as sampling, follow-up and inferring drug efficacy; 2) probing reservoir dynamics during hematopoietic stem cell transplant and determining mechanisms of persistence; 3) modeling viral dynamics during administration of latency-reversing pharmacologic agents and developing methods to quantify their actions; 4) using models to elucidate design principles for gene therapy approaches to create HIV-resistance cells in vivo. This work will be carried out in close collaboration with physician-scientists who are actively testing these therapies. By providing tools and practical guidance that can be used to predict and interpret treatment outcomes, these methods can help accelerate the search for an HIV cure."

"9349381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translational control is a major mode of gene regulation in eukaryotes that is often perturbed in human diseases. Despite extensive mechanistic studies of translation, it has not been possible to monitor in vivo most steps of translation initiation, which is the primary point of translational control. As a result, how endogenous translating messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) are formed and regulated in the competitive cellular environment is not completely understood. The goal of this application is to develop and apply in vivo methods to study the complex process of translation initiation. By revealing fundamental mechanisms of translational control, the proposed studies will provide new insights into how aberrant translation contributes to diseases, particularly cancer. In addition, the experimental systems established in this application can be widely adapted to studying translation initiation in different cellular and disease states. The methods developed in this application are based on the premise that the translating mRNP contains many mRNA-binding proteins, so individual steps of initiation can be studied by identifying and characterizing the underlying mRNA-protein interactions. This novel approach to the translating mRNP leverages in vivo crosslinking to capture RNA- protein interactions as they occur in the cell, and high-throughput sequencing to identify these interactions across the transcriptome. The experiments proposed in this application will investigate three aspects of the translating mRNP in yeast and mammalian cells. The first specific aim focuses on how the closed-loop structure is formed. Translating mRNPs adopt a circular conformation that enhances translation and mRNA stability, but how this closed-loop structure initially forms is not understood. High-throughput methods will be developed to detect endogenous closed-loop structures in yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). These methods will be combined with reverse genetics, chemical inhibitors, and reporter assays to determine how known protein-protein interactions and the process of translation itself contribute to closed-loop formation. These studies will provide a technical and conceptual framework for molecular analysis of the closed loop in vivo. The second major aim is to identify what determines the efficiency with which mRNAs are translated, which varies widely among endogenous genes for largely unknown reasons. The studies in this application will test the hypothesis that translational efficiency (TE) is largely explained by recruitment of the eIF4F cap- binding complex, which is the first step of initiation. Transcriptome-wide measurements of eIF4F binding and TE, combined with biochemical analysis of eIF4F-mRNA interactions, will be used to evaluate this hypothesis. Comparing results obtained in yeast, mESCs, and embryoid bodies (derived from mESCs) will reveal the extent to which principles of translational control differ between organisms and between cell types. The third aim of this project is to study the scanning 40S ribosome, which has not previously been observed or directly assayed. A method will be developed to identify the positions of isolated 40S ribosomes across the mESC transcriptome. Examining how scanning ribosomes are affected by chemical inhibition of the eIF4A helicase will provide new insights into the molecular details of scanning and the role of eIF4A in this process. Collectively, these aims will improve our knowledge of cellular translation mechanisms and our understanding of how these mechanisms go awry in disease."

"9334296","PROJECT SUMMARY HIV prevention science is in a period of marked evolution, prompted by the introduction of biomedical prevention modalities to complement traditional behavioral strategies. The new strategies have created synergies between HIV prevention and treatment outcomes, based on the recognition that there now exists a set of tools that, if utilized in the right combination, could stop the spread of the epidemic and effectively treat the vast majority of individuals living with HIV. Recent policy initiatives place a critical focus on closing the gaps in prevention and care, and on translating interventions into effective practice. We are proposing the addition of the new Intervention and Implementation Science (I&I) Core, to drive the scientific evolution in HIV prevention by integrating research across the spectrum of HIV intervention science, including basic research, efficacy trials, and implementation research. The I&I Core will be guided by the following aims: (1) To galvanize interdisciplinary advances across the spectrum of HIV intervention science, achieved by leveraging the latest findings in basic and HIV-related biomedical, social/behavioral, mental health, public health, and technology- related academic disciplines to inform innovations in HIV intervention design, testing, and scale-up; by identifying areas of complementariness and synergy among clinical, social, and behavioral intervention strategies to support enhanced combination and bio-behavioral HIV prevention approaches; and by fostering collaboration among multidisciplinary scientists to conduct innovative intervention research and guide the translation of effective interventions into practice. (2) To hone the skills among CAPS and its affiliated scientists for working along the spectrum of HIV intervention and implementation science, achieved by increasing knowledge about conventional and cutting-edge intervention development and implementation approaches that are culturally competent, and can be used to address myriad prevention targets, from behavioral, structural, and social change to adoption of and adherence to biomedical advances; and by developing fluency to study and work within diverse organizational, political, and social structures to foster the translation of effective interventions into practice. (3) To assure that CAPS research, including intervention and implementation research, meets the highest ethical standards, achieved by providing consultations on ethical and human subjects issues arising in research projects; increasing awareness about ethical and human subjects issues in this era of greater use of technology; and providing assistance in the formation of Data and Safety Monitoring Boards."
"9334326","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this work is to define the role of a new gene, Vezatin-like (Vzl)/CG7705, in retrograde axonal transport. This proposal will take advantage of genetic and imaging tools available in Drosophila to test the hypothesis that Vzl/CG7705 is required for the initiation of retrograde axonal transport of endosomes and/or other cargos at terminal presynaptic boutons. In human, defects in axonal transport are associated with neurodegenerative disease. Retrograde axonal transport of endosomes, in particular, is required to convey the receipt of neurotrophins and other signals to the soma and thereby promote neuron survival, differentiation, and growth. Loss of Vzl/CG7705 causes the accumulation of neuronal membrane and pMad, a downstream effector of signaling endosomes, specifically in terminal presynaptic boutons at neuromuscular junction. This defect resembles that caused by disrupting subunits of dynactin, a well-established regulator of retrograde transport. Vertebrate Vezatin is not known to regulate axonal transport, but a fungal Vezatin-like protein has recently been shown to be required for the initiation of retrograde transport of early endosomes in hyphae. Aim 1 of this proposal will use live imaging of cargos within motorneuron axons and terminal presynaptic boutons in vzlCG7705 mutants to test the hypothesis that Vzl/CG7705 is required for the initiation of retrograde transport of endosomes at terminal boutons and to test whether Vzl/CG7705 might be required for transport of other cargos as well. Aim 2 will use live imaging of cargos, as well as analysis of fixed images of terminal boutons, to test whether the ability of Vzl/CG7705 to prevent the accumulation of cellular components at terminal boutons is conserved in vertebrate (human) Vezatin. Vertebrate Vezatins bind the GTPase Arf6, which has been shown to affect axonal transport of endosomes. However, complete loss of Drosophila Arf6 does not cause material to accumulate at terminal boutons, suggesting that Vzl/CG7705 does not act through Arf6 in this process. Aim 3 will therefore use co- immunoprecipation and mass spectroscopy to identify potential Vzl/CG7705 binding partners and will disrupt the corresponding genes either by mutation or UAS-RNAi to test their involvement in Vzl/CG7705-dependent processes. This work will define the role of Vzl/CG7705 and, potentially, Vezatin in axonal transport and will generate preliminary data that will motivate testable models of Vzl/CG7705's molecular mechanism of action."

"9439837","The last Ebola epidemic originated from Guinea, expanded to the neighboring countries and led to one of the most challenging public health crisis of history. World Health organization reported that it took nearly three months for Guinea health officials and their international partners to identify the Ebola virus as the causative agent. By that time, the virus was firmly entrenched and spread was primed to explode. This planning grant will develop a research training program on emerging viral diseases (EVD) to address the needs in Guinea where the last epidemic originated in collaboration with NIAID-University of Bamako (USTTB) research centers in Mali, Northwestern University (NU) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This planning of training program will develop a curriculum for training doctoral and master degrees as well as non-degree certifications (professional skill enhancement), which will prepare Guinea to better handle potential future epidemics. Dissertation of Doctoral and Master thesis researches will include clinical and operational research questions related or applicable to Ebola and other EVDs. This program is a sub- regional effort between Guinea and Mali to have researchers from both sides to collaborate more closely on these cross-border diseases for a more coordinated and much efficient public health responses. In the final training grant that we will be developing on emerging viral diseases, Doctoral and Master degree students will have courses and supervision from faculty from the University of Conakry, USTTB-Mali, JHU and Northwestern University. The planning process for the training grant will address three fundamental questions: 1) What types of clinical research and health service research are needed in Guinea to support an effective prevention and control of emerging viral diseases? 2) Who should be targeted, and what kind of trainings are needed to conduct cutting-edge clinical and health service researches related to emerging viral diseases; and 3) how should a training program be organized regarding length, number of participants, venue, facilitators etc. to improve the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct clinical research or health service research related to EVD. The planning process will be organized as follows: 1] A planning meeting that will involve multidisciplinary investigators of consortium institutions (University of Conakry, USTTB, JHU and Northwestern University). At that meeting, the team will evaluate ways of building capacity in Guinea by leverage on experience, expertise and support from NIAID supported research programs at USTTB in Mali and its collaborators of JHU and NU, as well as designing surveys to assess the existing capacity and the additional training that needs to be provided in order to upgrade the country capacity in research on EVDs; 2] Conduct a survey to collect data on existing capacity to help identifying gaps and determining the needs for Guinea; 3] A dissemination meeting to share findings from the need assessment survey and provide detail plans for future training grant activities 4] Develop a research training grant."
"9385867","ABSTRACT - Project 3: Impact of combined medication and behavioral treatment in young children with  comorbid ASD and ADHD Children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have significantly worse outcomes than those with either ASD alone or ADHD alone. Currently, effective early treatment approaches that take into account the presence of ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD. The overarching goals of Project 3 are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention; and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD. We will accomplish these goals by systematically evaluating whether stimulant treatment augments the efficacy of a parent- delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM). Children with ASD+ADHD will be randomized to receive either an extended release amphetamine product (Adzenys-XR-ODT; AMP) or placebo prior to initiating early behavioral intervention. The flexibly dosed AMP or placebo will be provided for 30 weeks under double-blind conditions. P-ESDM will consist of individual parent coaching provided for 90 minutes weekly for 24 weeks beginning six weeks after AMP or placebo is initiated. The primary outcomes will be frequency of joint attention initiations, a core ASD symptom, and social and communicative functioning assessed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Our primary hypothesis is that reducing ADHD symptoms prior to and during P-ESDM will facilitate initial and sustained attention of children with ASD+ADHD to P-ESDM activities, leading to more engagement in and greater benefit from P-ESDM, reflected in greater improvements in joint attention and social and communicative functioning. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy for improving ADHD symptoms, assessed with the ADHD-Rating Scale, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. We will also determine the association between changes (pre- and post-treatment) in joint attention, social and communicative functioning, and ADHD symptoms and changes in social attention (assessed via an eye-tracking biomarker) and sustained social engagement with caregiver (assessed via structured observations of parent-child interaction). Finally, we will examine the association between changes in outcomes and changes in neurophysiological measures of neural connectivity and neural stability (EEG coherence and intertrial phase coherence) and responsiveness to social stimuli (event-related brain potentials). If significant beneficial effects of combined stimulant and behavioral treatment on children's outcomes are demonstrated, Project 3 will significantly inform current clinical treatment of young children with co-morbid ASD and ADHD, which could potentially mitigate the negative impact of co- occurring ADHD symptoms on outcomes of children with ASD."
"9343074","The most promising new therapies for FTLD will target specific proteins that are associated with the majority of FTLD cases: tau and TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). A challenge for conducting clinical trials with such agents is the inability to predict the underlying pathology in the majority of FTLD cases who do not carry a known causative mutation. Of these sporadic cases, the strongest clinical-pathological association for underlying tau pathology is for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy syndrome (PSPS). For TDP-43 pathology, the strongest associations are for semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) and frontotemporal dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS). The major goal of this research project is to determine the barriers to clinical trial enrollment in these syndromes to create a wellcharacterized cohort of clinical trial-eligible FTLD patients with predictable underlying pathology. Recent evidence also suggests that systemic inflammation due to imbalances in Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa) signaling may play a role in tDP-43 FTLD. This cross-sectional study will recruit 650 svPPA, FTD-ALS and PSPS patients from the online FTLD CRC patient registry who will be evaluated at the nearest FTLD CRC clinical site, or from patients already followed at these sites. All individuals will undergo a diagnostic evaluation by an expert FTLD CRC investigator including genotyping for known FTLD-causing mutations, a new FTLD-specific assessment battery (the FTLD Module), as well as questionnaires assessing quality of life and factors that affect clinical trial eligibility. In addition, plasma cytokine levels will be measured using a standard multiplexed ELISA assay to assess whether anti-TNF-alpha drugs should be pursued as a potential treatment for svPPA and FTD-ALS. We aim to: 1) estimate the achievable sample sizes and identify the most important barriers to clinical trial participation for key the sporadic FTLD clinical trial populations, svPPA, FTD-ALS and PSPS; 2) determine the percentage of sporadic svPPA, FTD-ALS and PSPS patients who carry known FTLD-associated mutations; 3) examine the association between autoimmune disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and svPPA, FTD-ALS and PSPS."
"9440106","Liberia, like it's neighboring countries, Sierra Leone and Guinea, was severely affected by the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic, highlighting the need to strengthen infectious diseases surveillance, detection and response in West Africa. In the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic, many assessment panels and expert reports have also underscored the importance of building international research capacity to combat emerging pathogens. The presence of local research infrastructure in affected countries coupled with strong international collaboration is a known successful model for early detection and understanding dynamics of emerging pathogens, as a critical part of control efforts. Advanced training of West African scientists can not only build emerging pathogen response capacity but also in country intellectual capital for future training and mentorship. This proposal represents a collaboration between Boston University (BU), the National Institute of Public of Liberia (NPHIL) and University of Liberia (UL), particularly the A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine. At this stage, there is a dearth of instruction in basic and translational sciences at all levels, but particularly pronounced at the graduate and postgraduate levels, in Liberia. The BU-UL Partnership to Enhance Emerging Epidemic Virus Research in Liberia (BULEEVR) program will create science instructors for UL, while simultaneously training highly qualified masters candidates in basic and translational sciences. The proposed training program will recruit Liberian doctorate of medicine graduates into a Masters of Science program at Boston University. The program will combine a semester of boot camp modules in Liberia aimed at strengthening skills in basic sciences as well as research administration. A select number of highly qualified candidates will then join the Masters program at BU, and return to work at on going research sites in Liberia focused on emerging pathogens. The program will further integrate supplementary research opportunities under mentors from numerous sites including the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) at BU, as well as active partner research programs across West Africa that are working on infectious diseases pathogens of critical interest to Liberia. All candidates in the BULEEVR program will also serve as teaching assistants and co-instructors at UL College of Medicine. The planning grant will allow the assessment of the current knowledge level in sciences among potential Liberian candidates, further delineation of training plans and development of a sustainable funding strategy."
"9360144","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible airways obstruction and nonspecific airways hyperresponsiveness to inhaled bronchoconstrictors. The ability of anticholinergics to approximate the bronchodilatation achieved by direct acting smooth muscle relaxants and to reduce airways reactivity implicates airway parasympathetic cholinergic nerves as key regulators of asthma pathophysiology. The muscarinic receptor antagonists such as ipratropium and tiotropium are poorly tolerated upon systemic administration and thus require topical application to the airways by aerosol. Limiting the effectiveness of this mode of delivery is the fact that the drugs will work only in those airways accessible to topically-applied therapeutics. Mucus plugging, turbulent, limited and/ or uneven airflow distribution limits drug aerosol access to the distal airways. Anticholinergics also provide little or no relief from chronic cough or dyspnea, symptoms of obstructive lung diseases that contribute adversely to patient quality of life. We hypothesize that a therapeutic strategy that could selectively and reversibly targets as needed all afferent and efferent nerve conduction to and from the airways will provide superior control of asthma symptoms when compared to currently used anticholinergic agents and direct acting bronchodilators. We have been developing peripheral neuromodulation approaches for the treatment of obstructive lung diseases. The vagal neuromodulation techniques achieve peak reversal of baseline cholinergic tone that approximates the effects of topically applied anticholinergics, but with maximal effects attained in only a fraction of the time required by the muscarinic receptor antagonists, can target all nerves projecting to the intrapulmonary airways without the constraints of topical delivery, (e.g. superior to anticholinergics in modulating peripheral airway caliber), can be delivered repeatedly as needed, and if combined with a smart technology, such neuromodulators could provide chronic symptom control in patients with obstructive lung diseases. We will use Synapse device by Nuviant, an FDA approved electrode interface used in patients with chronic pain, to generate preclinical proof of concept data in a well-characterized canine model of obstructive lung diseases. We will incorporate high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), a technique optimized for lung studies in our laboratories, to systematically evaluate and compare the actions of anticholinergics to our neuromodulation approaches on the peripheral airways in vivo. We will evaluate two approaches that can induce a inhibition and/or withdrawal of cholinergic tone in the airways and thus bronchodilatation: the blockade of action potential conduction in the preganglionic parasympathetic nerves innervating the airways, and the selective activation of the large myelinated axons of slowly adapting stretch receptors. We will characterize the performance of Synapse over a range of stimulation frequencies and intensities for their ability to induce dilation of the airways and to reduce or eliminate airways hyper- responsiveness when placed unilaterally or bilaterally on the vagus nerves in acute and subchronic studies."
"9369551","Project Summary  Necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants remains a major challenge. Our reactive clinical approach to necrotizing enterocolitis has changed little in four decades. Morbidity and mortality from necrotizing enterocolitis remain unacceptably high, and preventive strategies rely on interventions with limited, if any, efficacy. We have assembled an extensive set of specimens, accompanied by rich clinical metadata, with which to define mechanisms that underlie the development of necrotizing enterocolitis in very preterm infants. Our proposal extends our recently published findings that a gut bacterial dysbiosis, characterized by over-representation of Gammaproteobacteria and under-representation of obligate anaerobic bacteria, precede, and plausibly contribute to, the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.  Our overarching hypothesis is that identifiable microbial and/or host mechanisms signify an infant at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis. Our long-term goals are to use our knowledge of microbial-driven pathophysiology in necrotizing enterocolitis to build interventions to prevent the assembly of dysbiotic gut bacterial populations, to characterize the host biology prior to the sudden appearance of necrotizing enterocolitis. By generating these data, we hope to lessen the severity of necrotizing enterocolitis, or to prevent it altogether.  Our Specific Aims are: (1) Conduct a comprehensive genomic analysis of gut bacteria prior to necrotizing enterocolitis onset, and (2) Define the gut biology and host response prior to necrotizing enterocolitis onset. All specimens from cases will be those obtained before this event occurred. Control materials will be matched to cases, according to gestational age at birth, and day of life specimens were produced.  To accomplish these Aims, we will use our archive of pre-event stools and sera/plasmas from 977 very low birthweight infants from three neonatal intensive care units. Forty-six of these infants experienced NEC, after excluding those who also had congenital heart disease. We will employ genomic characterization of isolates, transcriptomics, metabolomics, viromics, and immunoproteomics in coordinated analyses to illuminate microbial and host biology underlying necrotizing enterocolitis. We will also interrogate populations of bacteria associated with protection from necrotizing enterocolitis. All studies will initially analyze a primary cohort from St. Louis, and then validate findings in specimens from Oklahoma City and Louisville. These case-control and time-series comparisons will provide mechanistic insight into an intractable and highly consequential complication of preterm birth, using an exceptionally relevant system, i.e., the colonized human infant.  By project conclusion, we will generate mechanistically-informed data to guide attempts to better anticipate, treat, or, ideally, prevent, necrotizing enterocolitis, a devastating complication of preterm birth."
"9516302","Abstract Liver fibrosis, a hallmark of many liver diseases, affects millions of people in America every year, and annually kills tens of thousands of these patients. Despite very active research efforts, there still have been no specific antifibrotic drugs approved by the FDA. The liver disease and drug development communities do not currently have well-validated, low-cost, easy to use, noninvasive tools for studying liver fibrosis in preclinical rodent models making it challenging to execute high-quality longitudinal studies. To address this need, SonoVol Inc. proposes to develop a novel benchtop imaging system capable of providing rapid, noninvasive measurements of liver fibrosis in rodents with robotically-controlled shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI). In SWEI, ultrasound pulses are used to generate shear waves in an organ an interest, and tissue stiffness can be inferred by monitoring the speed of the travelling waves. SWEI technology has been very successful in clinical trials and is starting to be adopted by abdominal radiology clinics around the world as a replacement for liver biopsy. While some preclinical SWEI products exist on the market today, all of them follow the conventional ultrasound paradigm of data collection ? a trained sonographer uses a handheld probe and manually selects regions of interest to interrogate with SWEI. Making consistent and accurate measurements requires in depth knowledge of probe placement and sonographic technique, which academic biologists or drug researchers are unlikely to possess. Therefore, SonoVol will develop a device capable of fully-automated, non-contact SWEI that eliminates the need for a trained sonographer and will enable large scale adoption of this powerful technology in the preclinical liver diseases research community. To validate the new system, two different animal models for hepatic fibrosis will be evaluated, and the results compared to conventional postmortem assessments of liver fibrosis. This technology represents an innovative combination of a widefield 3D robotic ultrasound imaging system and noninvasive shear wave elastography. Furthermore, the technology can be applied in the future to many other diseases, including cancer or cardiac models, increasing the potential market and impact on the field."
"9349364","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are members of the ubiquitous ENaC/DEG superfamily of trimeric voltage-independent, Na+-selective and amiloride-sensitive ion channels. Highly expressed in the kidneys, ENaCs assemble as heterotrimers that harbor an exquisitely Na+-selective pore that is critical in the fine tuning of Na+ and K+ balance. ENaC function is regulated at multiple levels from transcription of the ENaC genes, to the trafficking and the proteolytic activation of the ion channel. Abnormal regulation in the functional activity of ENaCs contributes importantly to human disease, and especially to hypertension (high blood pressure), a condition that affects about 1 billion people worldwide. Furthermore, although proteolysis is integral in the activation of ENaCs, aberrant proteolysis of ENaCs contributes to NaCl retention that characterizes nephrotic syndrome. Despite such clinical importance, detail into the mechanism of ENaC function at atomic resolution has remained elusive and the lack of x-ray crystal structures of ENaC has been a barrier to progress in the field. The objective of this research application is to resolve molecula mechanisms underlying ENaC assembly, gating, ion permeation, and allosteric modulation utilizing methods of x-ray crystallography, electrophysiology, and other biochemical and biophysical assays. At present, there are no methods for producing large quantities of heterotrimeric ENaCs for biochemical and biophysical experiments. The aim of this research application is to develop the technology to express milligram quantities of ENaC that demonstrate a homogenous population suitable for functional and structural assays. Central to this application is to determine the x-ray crystal structures of ENaC at different physiological states and these studies will provide the first atomic-level presentation of these Na+-selective channels in their resting, closed and open states, thus contributing to the understanding of the molecular basis of ENaC function. More importantly, these structural studies will serve as blueprints for future therapeutic strategies."

"9354297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Characterizing bacterial infections rapidly is key to effective treatment and identifying the spread of antibiotic resistance e.g. extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Current testing of human specimens primarily relies on culture, which requires infrastructure unavailable at many clinics, especially in low/middle income countries, and is too slow inform initial treatment. This is especially critical in neonatal infections (e.g. urinary tract infections, meningitis), where delays in effective treatment can result in lifelong disability or death. Due to this risk, powerful, broad spectrum antibiotics (e.g. 3rd generation cephalosporins) are empirically given. However, ESBL, which account for roughly 1/3 of the gram negative infections in SE Asia, can destroy cephalosporin antibiotics, leading to initial treatment failure. To address this, we have developed a rapid, mobile platform which can detect pathogen directly from urine or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and identify beta- lactamase related antibiotic susceptibility in < 20 mins. The platform uses disposable microfluidic cartridges into which human samples are injected. A dark probe which becomes fluorescent in the presence of ESBL is then introduced. Any change in fluorescence is detected by a smart phone camera which has been modified with additional clip-on optics. By repeating the analysis in the presence of an antibiotic, information on the antibiotic susceptibility can also be obtained. The end results of this diagnostic are presented on the smart phone screen for facile point of care use. The mobile phone aspect also allows de-identified epidemiological information to be automatically collected, which is of use in rapid infection control of outbreaks and general monitoring of regional antibiotic susceptibility. This study proposes to adapt and test the platform for use in Thailand. The first aim (months 0-6) modifies the U.S. design for sustainable use in Thailand (e.g. sourcing local materials). The second aim (months 6-12) calibrates the platform against pathogens that have already been characterized by standard microbiological methods. This is done by refrigerating a small amount of human sample (few hundred microliters of urine or CSF), which will be analyzed by the platform if standard lab results find bacteria. These data (~100 samples) will be used to tune the analysis against the local pathogen spectrum. The final aim (months 12-24) will validate the platform by directly testing patient samples in parallel with the standard microbiological lab analysis. The samples will be pre-selected based on rapid gram staining to ensure a high number of bacterial samples for statistical significance (~400 specimens). Knowledge of microfluidic cartridge construction and smart phone optics fabrication will also be transferred to Thailand to allow sustainable, long term use of the platform."
"9388793","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 1  Forty to eighty percent of children and preadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit clinically  significant anxiety symptoms, which are associated with increased social deficits, depression, irritability, and  stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. While it is clear that anxiety symptoms represent a substantial problem  for those with ASD, important issues that could inform treatment remain unresolved. For example: 1) there is a  lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms, 2) little is known about how anxiety  manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID), 3) the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly  understood, and 4) it is unclear what treatment(s) to employ to help affected individuals given the early stage of  research. In Project 1 of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum  Disorder, we conduct a comparative efficacy trial with neuroimaging in n=132 participants (ages 8-12 years) with  ASD and clinically significant anxiety to resolve some of these issues. In Specific Aim 1, we attempt to better  characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that exhibit anxiety. We use  clinician-administered gold standard measurements as well as parent reports of overlapping constructs such as insistence  on sameness, sensory processing issues, and emotion regulation problems that complicate the anxiety  phenotype in ASD. We implement multivariate statistical analyses to reveal anxiety sub-types. We then examine  whether anxiety prevalence estimates differ depending on whether clinician-administered or common parent  questionnaires are used to see if the latter produce lower results for those with ASD and ID. In Specific Aim 2,  we conduct a rigorous 16-week randomized, comparative treatment trial of a form of cognitive behavior therapy  (CBT) called Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and pill placebo in  youth with ASD, IQ>50, and at least one clinically significant anxiety disorder. We compare the relative efficacy  of: (1) BIACA vs. pill placebo and sertraline vs. pill placebo in reducing anxiety symptoms, (2) BIACA vs. pill  placebo and sertraline vs. pill placebo in reducing the severity of ASD symptoms, and (3) BIACA vs. sertraline  in reducing anxiety symptoms across sub-types. We predict that both therapies will be effective, but that BIACA  will have advantages in treating ASD symptoms. In Specific Aim 3, we use fMRI to investigate neural predictors  of treatment efficacy, markers of treatment-induced change, and signatures of the anxiety sub-types. Here, we  hypothesize that reductions in anxiety scores during sertraline and BIACA treatment will be predicted by  pre-treatment recruitment of the ventromedial and ventrolateral cortices, along with reduced task-based functional  connectivity between these prefrontal regions and the amygdala during the fMRI task. In summary, the goal of  Project 1 is to better characterize anxiety in ASD, to rigorously test medication and CBT therapies, and to  examine neural mechanisms of anxiety and of treatment change in an effort to make interventions more precise  and likely to promote positive outcomes."
"9334773","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 2% of the US general population harbors an asymptomatic pancreatic cyst, and the incidence is rising due to increasing use of abdominal imaging. Pancreatic cystic lesions include mucin-secreting cysts - specifically, Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) and Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms (MCNs), which are bona fide precursor lesions of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and others, such as serous cystadenomas (SCAs) that have minimal potential for malignancy. Even within the microcosm of IPMNs and MCNs, the majority of cysts are indolent, and current consensus guidelines for therapeutic stratification lead to over-treatment in many cases. Nonetheless, the long-term survival of patients with non-invasive mucinous cysts drops from 90-100% to nearly half once invasion occurs, underscoring the continuing importance of screening cyst populations. Distinguishing pancreatic cysts that harbor greatest potential for progression to malignancy from those that are unequivocally indolent will allow rational screening and management of this burgeoning epidemic. We hypothesize that genetic drivers of pancreatic cyst formation interact with the physical microenvironment to fuel malignant progression, and the latter is reflected in measureable imaging features and humoral immune responses. To address this hypothesis, we will create an Imaging and Molecular Characterization Laboratory (IMCL) at MD Anderson, and partner with four high volume pancreatic centers (UCSF, UCSD, Indiana University and University of Utah), for access to >1,000 surgically resected retrospective cyst samples, and an expected accrual of ~1,300 prospective cyst patients over the period of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will correlate quantitative measurements of the physical microenvironment of pancreatic cysts (obtained from standard-of-care diagnostic CT scans) with underlying histopathology and genomic profiles. In Aim 2, we will identify the host immune response to malignant progression in pancreatic cysts by measuring autoantibody responses in the serum to over three million genome-wide epitopes using a Human Peptide Array (Roche-NimbleGen). In both aims, we will use existing diagnostic imaging and banked serum samples from patients with surgically resected and histopathology validated pancreatic cysts as a training set, followed by application in a test set from prospectively accrued samples. Finally, in Aim 3, we will merge the data from both prior aims to develop an integrated algorithm for predicting neoplastic progression in pancreatic cysts. Multi-center coordination of retrospective and prospective biospecimen collection and all aspects of data management will be supported by a Statistical and Centralized Data Management Core (SCDMC) within the IMCL. By integrating the amplitude and targets of the host immune response with quantitative physical features obtained using standard-of-care diagnostic imaging studies, we hope to develop reliable algorithms that can predict the risk of progression in pancreatic cysts using relatively non-invasive and portable approaches, and thereby address an unmet need of highest significance to public health."
"9348648","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims at developing novel methods for predicting the large-scale cortical network that is activated by spatially focused transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Presently there is no integrated framework that would allow predicting how the activation will spread from the primary target area to secondary locations. The proposal will combine accurate and efficient electromagnetic field computation methods for calculating the primary activations with data from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography to predict the effects of TMS on an anatomically connected cortical network. We will evaluate the modeling framework by measuring the effects of TMS with simultaneous electroencephalography EEG (TMS-EEG) and functional MRI (TMS-fMRI) in humans, and also using TMS adapted to small animals. During the mentored phase, I will utilize my training in theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and computational engineering to build a set of tools to model the TMS-induced network activity. Anatomical MRI data acquisitions and functional TMS-EEG and TMS-fMRI measurements will be carried out for verifying the proposed model. During the second phase, the software will be optimized for real-time operation and more extensive experiments for evaluation of the system performance and prediction accuracy will be carried out. This project optimally fits my long-term career goal of becoming a multi-disciplinary researcher capable of both methodological development and carrying out neuroscientific studies combining TMS with non-invasive imaging. The outcome of the proposed project will be an entirely novel framework for understanding the effects of TMS on cortical networks for scientific studies and therapeutic applications. The grant will allow me to reach the immediate goal of strengthening my skills in the experimental side of imaging neuroscience and broadening my knowledge of the neurophysiology of TMS. The mentored phase will be carried out at MGH-Harvard-MIT Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. The affiliated institutions offer first-rate education pertinent to my career development. Specifically, in addition to building my experimental expertise, I will audit courses on neural engineering and complex networks at Harvard and MIT. The collaborative effort for validating the models with a small animal TMS experiment will also provide hands-on training in electrophysiology. The Martinos Center has cutting edge imaging facilities for carrying out the experimental work and world-class experts available for mentoring and consultation."
"9337385","Project Summary Abstract This application is in response to RFA-CA15-007. It comprises a two-year planning period to develop a Malawi Center of Research Excellence for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), focused on cancer, injury, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Following the intent of the RFA the University of North Carolina (UNC) will serve as the high-income country partner institution for the application, based on its decades-long program in Malawi, long history of collaboration with COM and MOH, and deep involvement in cancer research activities specifically within Malawi. The planning grant will seek to engage US and International partners with significant NCD programs in Malawi, such as UCLA and Baylor College of Medicine, and others. This is a multiple principal investigators application with highly complementary expertise: Satish Gopal (UNC/COM; cancer; clinical investigation); Nyengo Mkandawire (COM; injury; clinical investigation); Mwapatsa Mipando (COM; cardiovascular disease; basic science); Dirk Dittmer (UNC; cancer; basic science). In addition, senior investigators and leadership from government and other supported research programs will participate as key personnel and consultants during the planning period, which leverages an impressive pool of faculty within and outside Malawi. The planning is to develop a center will include administrative, developmental, clinical, laboratory, biostatistics, and implementation cores and which may serve as a resource for the region, e.g. in pathology and surgery training. Partners will be invited during the planning period to contribute to a national plan for each of these, based on existing resources and activities across institutions, as well as new resources and activities that are collectively prioritized. Sustainability of the proposed center and its impact will be ensured by strong ownership from collaborating Malawian partners, including support by the highest levels of COM and MOH. We seek to establish active linkages of collaborating partners within Malawi to international institutions and research networks outside Malawi will allow the center to leverage these external relationships to achieve regional importance in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, by catalyzing a broad national movement to address a rapidly growing NCD burden, the center will deliver measurable benefits to the people of Malawi."
"9376535","Abstract Epigenetic transcriptional regulation is required for a myriad of developmental processes as well as being a significant contributor to human diseases. X-chromosome inactivation provides an experimentally tractable system for the dissection of epigenetic inheritance. X-inactivation results in the mitotically-heritable transcriptional inactivation of one X-chromosome in female mammals, thereby equalizing X-linked gene dosage between males and females. X-inactivation requires the Xist long non-coding RNA that is expressed only from the inactive X-chromosome. Current models posit that Xist RNA induction and coating of the X- chromosome in cis triggers a series of epigenetic events that culminates in X-inactivation. Notably, how Xist is selectively induced in females and not at all in males and how it triggers silencing are still unresolved questions. The objective of this proposal is to address how Xist expression and X-linked gene silencing are triggered during X-inactivation. Our central hypothesis, based on our published work and preliminary data, is that genes that escape X-inactivation function as dose-sensitive factors that induce Xist and, separately, potentiate X-linked gene silencing selectively in females. X-inactivation escapees are expressed from both X- chromosomes in XX females, including from the otherwise inactivated X-chromosome; hence, their expression is higher in females compared to XY males. We developed and employed a custom allele-specific RNA- sequencing pipeline to compile a list of the escape genes in mouse epiblast stem cells, which harbor an inactive-X. We then prioritized validated escapees that are predicted to be evolutionarily conserved and which function as transcriptional/chromatin regulators for a role in inducing X-inactivation. In this proposal, we systematically test the dose-dependent and biochemical activities of two of these escape genes in triggering Xist expression and X-linked gene silencing using unbiased and integrated high-throughput approaches. The results are expected to inform how genes along the length of the X-chromosome are silenced and why females undergo X-inactivation and males do not. The epigenetic factors and mechanisms that execute X-inactivation are known to overlap with those that regulate embryonic development and disease progression. Thus, understanding the cascade of epigenetic events that characterizes X-inactivation offers a window into identifying the common factors and mechanisms that establish epigenetic expression patterns broadly."
"9384115","Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a devastating condition associated with gadolinium (Gd3+) based contrast-agents (GBCAs) in patients with severe end stage or chronic kidney disease (ESRD or CKD). A severe multiple organ condition, that includes lungs, heart, diaphragm, bone, skin and skeletal muscles, is characteristic of the disease. GBCAs are important contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - a powerful medical tool that provides 3D internal imaging of different soft tissues such as brain, muscle, heart, tumors, blood vessels and areas of inflammation. Release of free Gd3+ from the contrast-agent is thought to play a major role in the pathophysiology of NSF since free Gd3+ is toxic. The primary cause and etiology of Gd3+ release from GBCAs in NSF remains unknown.  We have strong evidence that a small (2.2 kDa), acidic, highly-reactive, phosphorylated and protease resistant bone-matrix peptide (ASARM-peptide) plays a major role. ASARM-peptides are potent inhibitors of mineralization that bind strongly to Ca2+ and hydroxyapaptite. Of note, the ionic radius of Gd3+ (107.8 pm) is close to that of Ca2+ (114 pm) and this element interferes with Ca2+ activated or mediated biochemical and physiological processes. Increased ASARM-peptides are responsible for bone-mineralization abnormalities and contribute to renal phosphate-handling defects in familial hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor induced osteomalacia. The ASARM-peptide is proteolytically released into bone and circulation from a family of bone- matrix proteins (SIBLINGs) that characteristically have ASARM-motifs. These proteins all map to a single cluster on chromosome 4 in mice and 5 in humans. They include DMP1, MEPE, osteopontin, dentin sialo phosphoprotein (DSPP), bone-sialoprotein, statherin and enamelin.  We hypothesize that a subset of renal-compromised patients with renal osteodystrophy, abnormal ASARM-peptide levels and reduced renal clearance of GBCAs are at high risk for NSF because of: (A) Increased binding of ASARM-peptide to GBCA and (B) ASARM-induced destabilization of the Gd3+-GBCA complex resulting in localized release of toxic Gd3+.  Our aims are to: (1). Determine whether ASARM-peptide in vitro and in vivo specifically binds to GBCAs particularly those associated with NSF; (2) Determine whether ASARM-peptide in vivo and in vitro induces release of free Gd3+ from the GBCA complex; (3) Determine whether a bio-engineered 4.2 kDa peptide (SPR4) stabilizes the Gd3+-GBCA complex by competitively binding to ASARM-peptide; (4) Use a rat model of NSF to show whether SPR4-peptide is an adjuvant for preventing the disease or reducing risk in patients requiring GBCA enhanced MRI scans: (5) Determine whether ASARM peptides and Gd3+ complexes are increased in human NSF samples and associated with disease."

"9430682","Abstract  The candidate, David P. Sparling, MD, PhD, proposes a Clinical Scientist Development Award project as a means to achieve his goal of becoming an independent physician scientist studying the regulation of adipose tissue and inflammation in obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While much effort has been put into understanding the role of inflammatory cells, e.g. macrophages and T cells, in the progression of adipose tissue insulin resistance, there should also be a focus on the cell likely originating those inflammatory signals?namely, the adipocyte. A variety of signaling events likely occur during the inflammatory processes in excessive adiposity, and a novel tool has been implicated to study these processes: the ?-secretase enzyme complex. Signaling cascades regulating both adipose differentiation and insulin sensitivity cascades utilize ?-secretase, and it plays a role in several immune signaling cascades in other cell types. However, the function of??-secretase in adipocyte-initiated inflammatory signaling is unknown. Dr. Sparling proposes that ?-secretase blockade could be a tool to identify novel cascades and signaling functions in adipocyte inflammation. Preliminary data has suggested that adipocyte-specific blockade of ?-secretase alters the inflammatory milieu of lean and obese adipose tissue.  Dr. Sparling hypothesizes that ?-secretase is integral to adipocyte-initiated inflammatory signaling cascades, and that this hypothesis can be tested in vitro with two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine if ?-secretase is required for adipocyte-initiated macrophage recruitment and activation, and Aim 2 will determine if the immunoreceptor TREM2 in adipocytes is regulated in a ?-secretase dependent manner. Dr. Sparling will first identify the role of adipocyte ?-secretase in recruitment and activation of macrophages. He will identify changes in established inflammatory cytokines MCP1 and IL6 secreted by adipocytes following ?-secretase inhibition. He will also explore novel targets of ?-secretase regulated intramembrane proteolysis that play a role in adipocyte inflammation. He will then examine the alterations in TREM2 signaling following ?-secretase inhibition. TREM2 is a known ?-secretase target in immune cells, and can regulate adipose function. He will determine if ?-secretase inhibition alters TREM2 protein-protein interactions and downstream signaling in adipocytes. In the long term, this work seeks to establish how adipocytes regulate inflammatory signals in the progression of obesity to T2DM.  Dr. Sparling has shown a lasting commitment to basic research and its possible translation to clinical practice. His dissertation at the University of Oklahoma was on the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4. After pediatrics residency at Columbia University he completed a fellowship in pediatric endocrinology, studying the role of the Notch cascade in developed adipose tissue. This work was funded by the Endocrine Fellows Foundation and the Pediatric Endocrine Society, and resulted in a first author publication. He accepted his position as an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Department of Pediatrics, in the Section of Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology, where he now has protected time to begin his research career.  The basis of Dr. Sparling's work has been in adipose biology, but has now expanded to focus on inflammatory signaling. As such, training gaps for Dr. Sparling have been identified: his understanding of immune cell function and inflammatory regulators, as well as a need for better understanding of appropriate techniques in advanced data analysis. To reach his goal as an independent clinician scientist studying adipose inflammation, these gaps must be addressed. The K08 award provides an excellent means to achieve these goals. During the award Dr. Sparling will:  1) Expand his understanding of the immune system and inflammatory signaling cascades. This will primarily be  through instruction and training by his mentor, Dr. Mary Beth Humphrey, chair of the Division of  Rheumatology, Immunology, and Allergy in the Department of Medicine at OUHSC. He will also attend  graduate didactic courses in immunology, as well as immunology research conferences on campus.  2) Acquire advanced training in statistical analysis through additional statistics courses offered through the  Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology in the College of Public Health at OUHSC.  Obesity continues to plague both pediatric and adult populations, and inflammation can play a role in insulin resistance. What is not fully known is what degree inflammation is initiated directly by the adipocyte, and how that signaling evolves in the progression to T2DM. The goal of this award is to develop the skills to examine how inflammatory signals effect cross-talk between adipocytes and the immune system. The environment at the University of Oklahoma is well suited for this work, with mentors, collaborators, and resources all available to successfully complete this project. The training afforded by this award will prepare Dr. Sparling to seek ongoing extramural funding to continue to contribute to the field of diabetes and endocrinology."
"9525183","ABSTRACT In this grant application, we propose to establish the University of Arizona Health Sciences ? Banner Health (UA-Banner) Healthcare Provider Organization (HPO) Enrollment Center for the primary purpose of recruiting the large majority (50-70%) of the American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Hispanics/Latinos (Hisp/Lat) participants required in the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program (PMI-CP) which will initially enroll one million participants. The PMI-CP is a timely development that will facilitate the ability to lever advances in genomics, metabolomics, and health technologies to reduce health disparities which are contributing to excessive suffering, disability, premature death, and economic losses particularly in racial/ethnic minority populations. Today, greater than 20 years after the NIH Revitalization Act, the goal of increasing the participation of minorities in biomedical research remains an unfulfilled dream with participation rates in clinical trials remaining at 0.2% for American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) and 1-2% for Hisp/Lat; far less than their 1.0% and 17.4% representations in the U.S. population, respectively. Without adequate representation of minorities in research studies, we will continue to practice ?Imprecise Medicine? in which research findings from studies conducted almost exclusively in non-Hispanic white populations are extrapolated to racial/ethnic minorities. The UA-Banner proposal is a formal partnership between the University of Arizona and Banner Health serving as the primary healthcare provider for 4.5 million individuals in seven Western States including 60% of the population of Arizona. We will utilize a well-defined potential participant pool of 1.725 million patients across 12 enrollment sites in Arizona, Alaska, and Wyoming to accomplish the following: (1) Enroll >150,000 volunteers, including 7,000 AI/AN, 90,000 Hisp/Lat and 53,000 non-Hispanic Whites, and individuals of other races/ethnicity into the PMI-CP; (2) Implement a comprehensive participant engagement plan that values the participants as ?partners in discovery? rather than ?research subjects?; (3) Use a secure and robust Enterprise Data Warehouse system to obtain, curate, de-identify, and normalize Electronic Health Records to transmit ?core datasets? quarterly to the Coordinating Center (CC) and provide ?subgroup? datasets for special studies; and (4) Collaborate with the CC, other HPOs, the participant technologies center, the PMI-CP Biobank, and the Steering Committee to develop and implement protocols and procedures, perform special studies, obtain additional specimens and increase the number and types of data collected. Our targeted enrollment of AI/AN and Hisp/Lat populations into the PMI-CP will bring us closer to one of the President's PMI goals - to reduce ethnic/racial health disparities in the U.S. through the robust participation of the AI/AN and Hisp/Lat populations in PMI-CP special research studies and novel clinical trials as a necessary step to realize the benefits of individualized therapies and tailored preventative strategies in racial/ethnic minority populations."
"9362535","PROJECT SUMMARY Our goal is to generate knowledge that will inform programs to improve pregnancy outcomes among women with physical, sensory, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. In the first phase, we will conduct a province-wide study using Ontario (Canada) health care and social services data. Our specific aims are to: (1) Describe the fertility rates and pre-pregnancy characteristics of women with and without disabilities; (2) Compare maternal and infant outcomes of women with vs. without disabilities; and (3) Evaluate factors that exacerbate or explain risks for poor outcomes. In the second phase, we will interview women with disabilities, service-providers, and decision-makers in Ontario. Our specific aims are to: (1) Further explore factors that could exacerbate or explain risks; and (2) Identify how knowledge of risks can be used to improve pregnancy-related care for women with disabilities.  In the first phase, we will obtain data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, an independent, non-profit organization that houses databases containing health data gathered from the health care encounters of all Ontario residents. This information can be linked with disability income support documentation from the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services. Women will be classified as having physical, sensory, intellectual and developmental, or multiple disabilities if they have relevant diagnoses recorded in health care data or in documentation for disability income support receipt. We will identify all obstetrical deliveries to 18- to 49-year-old women with and without disabilities between 2009 and 2014. Study outcomes will be indicators of maternal and infant health monitored by the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System. In the second phase, we will interview women with disabilities, service-providers, and decision-makers who will be recruited from our existing partnerships with self-advocacy, clinical, and government organizations. We will analyze interview transcripts to identify themes that describe clinical applications to improve pregnancy outcomes of women with disabilities.  The goal of this funding opportunity is to stimulate research that will result in evidence-based interventions to improve pregnancy experiences of women with disabilities. Our aims directly address this goal. Detailed estimates of pregnancy risks, grounded in the experiences of women with disabilities, service-providers, and decision-makers, will create information needed to improve screening, follow-up, and support for pregnant women with disabilities. We use methods not currently available in the US, thus significantly adding to scientific and clinical knowledge in this area."
"9394896","Abstract: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are deleterious birth defects that result in herniation and exposure of nervous tissue during embryogenesis when the neural tube fails to close. Folate deficiency has shown a high association to the development of NTDs and 70% of all NTDs are folate responsive. However, the mechanism of this rescue effect remains to be elucidated. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in development. Studies in vitro demonstrate interactions between p53 and folate one carbon metabolism, specifically the de novo thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis pathway. The Stover laboratory has demonstrated that impairments in the de novo dTMP biosynthesis pathway ultimately leads to an increase in NTDs. Previous studies have demonstrated impaired de novo dTMP biosynthesis leads to uracil accumulation in DNA and genomic instability and another paper has shown that uracil accumulation in DNA leads to p53-mediated apoptosis. Compiling this information, a proposed mechanism of the development of folate deficient NTDs has been developed and will be examined. Specifically, this proposal aims to investigate the role of p53 in folate deficiency and how it may affect genomic instability and NTD incidence. The first part of the proposal will determine the effect folate deficiency has on the incidence of NTDs in the absence of p53 and whether p53 null NTDs are folate responsive. These results will illustrate the in vivo interaction between p53 and folate one carbon metabolism in the development of neural tube defects. In this aim, embryos will be phenotyped for NTDs. The second part of the proposal will determine the effect folate deficiency has in p53 null embryos in terms of genomic instability. This question will be answered by measuring de novo dTMP synthesis, uracil in DNA, and DNA damage with the biomarker ?H2AX. This proposal will uncover the interaction between p53 and folate deficiency in regards to de novo thymidylate synthesis, uracil in DNA, and genomic instability. Most importantly, this project may elucidate a possible mechanism for the development of genomic instability and NTDs in embryos from maternal folate deficient diets."
"9418439","Abstract The Annual Health Econometrics Workshop (AHEW), www.healtheconometrics.org, provides a forum to discuss the use of econometric and other quantitative methods to address issues in health economics and policy, health services research, and outcomes research. The meeting is the only one of its kind in North America and facilitates the exchange of ideas among the growing number of health econometricians around the world. It allows for the considerable exchange of ideas between junior and senior investigators in ways that no other health economics or econometrics workshop in the US does. AHEW was inaugurated in 2009. The 2012 ? 2016 workshops were funded by an R13 grant from AHRQ 2013 (5R13HS021019) that provided the much-needed support to establish this workshop as a premier meeting in the world. We have seen record increases in paper submissions in last consecutive years. We are seeking renewal of our current R13 grant for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The venue for the 2017 workshop is tentatively planned at Washington University in St. Louis. Venues for 2018 - 2019 are not yet finalized. However, we have received overwhelming responses from researchers across the country offering to host these workshops. We seek funds to enable us to continue to build a strong workshop over the next three years and expand upon the scientific program to maximize participation and interaction, scientific content, and dissemination and training efforts."
"9361985","The loss of motor function due to neurological injury or disease has significant consequences on independence, health, participation in society, and quality of life. Neurological disorders such as stroke, cerebral palsy (CP), spinal cord injury (SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS) can lead to loss of mobility and significant loss of independence in daily activities. In many of these diseases, the motor system remains intact but cortical control over these functions is lost. One method of restoring function to these individuals is the use of electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves, known as neuroprostheses, to restore coordinated control of the paralyzed muscles. In order to address the needs of this patient population, a new concept in neuroprostheses has recently been invented and developed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). This neuroprosthesis is the ?Networked Neuroprosthesis? (NNP), and uses a modular approach to implanted devices. The NNP system is the first fully implanted modular neuroprosthesis that includes implantation of all power, signal processing, biopotential signal recording, and stimulating components. The modular design of the NNP System allows it to be configured and tailored for the needs of each type of disability and each individual with a disability so that maximum use is made of the individual's remaining voluntary function, with electrically-stimulated function provided as needed. A major milestone of our program that has been achieved is the implantation of the NNP in the first subject. We now seek to advance the technology to impact a broader patient population, improve users to access the technology, and enable the transfer of the technology to the real-world clinical setting. To achieve these goals, our Specific Aims are to 1) enhance the hardware, particularly through improved power management and circuit upgrades; 2) improve software, with a focus on transfer of this technology to multiple sites; 3) build completed systems, and 4) fully test all components in preparation for regulatory approval.  All proposed changes will be introduced to the FDA as modifications to the current design, and appropriate regulatory approvals will be sought prior to advancing to clinical trials. At the end of this proposal, we will have completed the full upgrade of the NNP System, greatly expanding clinical indications and usability of the entire system. This work will culminate in the submission of an Early Feasibility IDE for clinical implementation in SCI, establishing a beachhead for future studies."
"9398842","PROJECT SUMMARY    Background: Sex Chromosome Trisomies (SCT) including Klinefelter (XXY), Trisomy X (XXX), and XYY syndromes occur in 1 out  of every 500 births and are associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum including increased risk for developmental delays  (DD), language/learning disorders, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). XXY is also associated with testicular failure, XXX  increases risk for ovarian failure, and disorders of insulin resistance and other medical problems resulting in increased mor? bidity and mortality occur in all 3 SCTs. Historically, less than 10% of SCT diagnoses occur in childhood, however the rate of  newborns with SCT has markedly increased with new noninvasive prenatal cell?free DNA (cfDNA) screening. SCT natural  history research is limited to studies from the 1970's, and we have little knowledge of early predictors of the wide heteroge? neity in later outcomes. Increasing research suggests that androgen therapy during infancy in XXY may improve develop? mental and health outcomes, supporting the need for newborn screening so intervention can be delivered during this criti? cal period. The very high risk for DD in SCT also suggests that newborn screening may improve timely initiation of interven? tions. However, it is not clear whether all SCT infants indeed require intensive developmental assessments and therapies, or  if primary care screenings are sufficient to identify those in need. The surge in prenatal SCT diagnoses from cfDNA methods  provides an opportunity for longitudinal study of a cohort of infants to explore natural history, and to improve care.   Aims: This study aims to: (1) describe and compare the natural history of neurodevelopment, health and early gonadal func? tion in infants with the 3 SCT conditions through a national prospective eXtraordinarY Babies Study in partnership with the  Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN), (2) identify early predictors of poor neurodevelopmental and  cardiometabolic outcomes, and (3) evaluate the sensitivities of common primary care developmental screening measures to  detect DD and ASD in this high?risk population to inform recommendations for an early neurodevelopmental care protocol.   Approach: Infants with a prenatal diagnosis of XXY (n=100), XYY (n=50), or XXX (n=50) will be followed prospectively every 6? 12 months for 2?4 years at 2 eXtraordinarY Kids Clinic sites. Demographics, health history, development, interventions, and  social/family history will be collected using NBSTRN common data elements. Assessments will include: (1) measures of cog? nitive, language, social, motor, and adaptive function, (2) physical exam, gonadal function labs, cardiometabolic measures,  and body composition, and (3) quality of life outcomes. Developmental and hormonal profiles for each SCT condition will be  modeled, and the association between early risk factors and outcomes at 3?4 years of age will be tested. Further, the sensi? tivities of common primary care DD and ASD screeners will be calculated for each condition using direct developmental test  results as gold?standard.  Impact: Prospective study of the natural history of prenatally diagnosed infants with SCT will allow  investigation of important questions to inform newborn screening considerations, such as the interplay between early hor? monal profiles and developmental outcomes. Results will be immediately relevant for counseling and establishing evidence? based care guidelines for the rapidly increasing rate of SCT diagnoses from cfDNA screening. Results will serve as the basis  for ongoing longitudinal studies of health and psychological outcomes of SCTs through the lifespan.    "
"9545398","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although significant resources have been invested in HIV programs, Uganda is still far from the universal access-to-care target of 80%. While Uganda has developed highly successful research collaborations in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over the last 30 years, most of this work has been focused on clinical research, and the findings have not always translated into policy and practice changes. At present, we need an urgent and comparable investment in implementation science (ImS) research to strengthen the response to the HIV epidemic. Effective service delivery by HIV/AIDS programs and engagement in care among HIV-infected individuals will allow antiretroviral medications to reach their optimal public health impact. Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) has collaborated with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) for over three decades on a range of scientific studies. We plan to leverage this foundation and build a multi-disciplinary team to create a world-class training program for ImS focused on delivery of HIV/AIDS services and engagement in care. Building on the findings of our planning grant, we propose a unique multi-disciplinary ImS research training program at Makerere University School of Medicine. The goals of the proposed program are to: 1) provide training and mentoring in the field of implementation science to Ugandan scholars 2) establish an ImS training site at Makerere University School of Medicine for Uganda and other institutions in Africa. The specific objectives of this training program are to: 1) strengthen the scientific leadership and expertise needed for implementation science research; 2) strengthen the sustainability of implementation science research at Makerere University by integrating ImS research into on-going capacity building programs; 3) promote collaborations between academic research institutions and faculty in Uganda and those in the US; 4) Strengthen trainee contributions to evidence-based decision making related to HIV prevention, care and treatment services through regular interactions with policy makers and HIV program implementers; 5) optimize training through utilization of additional available resources in Uganda (including projects funded by the NIH, PEPFAR and other international agencies); 6) strengthen research capacity in Uganda by helping trainees to integrate into Ugandan institutions and pursue independently-supported scientific careers; 7) create a Centre of Excellence for ImS at MakCHS to serve as a training site for other institutions in Africa. The proposed ImS training program will build on existing relationships between scientists at MakCHS and its affiliated HIV programs (medical), the Makerere University College of Humanities and Social Sciences (non-medical), UCSF and UCB. During our five year program, we anticipate training Ugandan trainees as follows: 2 candidates in master's degree programs at UCSF, 8 candidates in master's degree programs at Makerere University, 4 candidates in long-term non-degree training (including post-doc training), 20 candidates in a modular certificate program and over 700 candidates in short-term non-degree programs."
"9360241","Project Summary (Kasus-Jacobi Project) Amyloid beta (A?) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). No clinical intervention to stop or slow the progression of the disease is available, but a few clinical trials revealed encouraging results in terms of cognitive decline for patients with a mild form of the disease when A? or RAGE were targeted, demonstrating the validity of exploiting these targets for AD treatment. We have recently discovered that CAP37, a cationic antimicrobial protein, is significantly up regulated in the brains of patients with AD, binds and cleaves A?, and interacts with RAGE, which suggests that CAP37 modulates the pathogenesis of AD. Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective therapeutic approaches targeting A?, RAGE and CAP37 for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Our objective in this application is to define the mechanistic and structural aspects of CAP37's interactions with RAGE and A?. The rationale for the proposed research is that a better understanding of how CAP37 regulates AD pathogenesis will guide the development of new drugs for the disease. We propose two specific aims. Our first aim is to define the CAP37-RAGE binding interface and determine how CAP37 interferes with the binding of other ligands of this receptor. Our working hypothesis for this aim is that CAP37 binds RAGE through a different domain than the other RAGE ligands. This may affect the binding of other ligands to RAGE through allosteric modification of the receptor. In this aim, we will elucidate the complex formed by CAP37 and RAGE. Successful completion of this aim will allow us to 1) propose a model for the binding of CAP37 to RAGE relative to A? and other RAGE ligands, 2) determine how the binding of CAP37 to RAGE interferes with the binding of other ligands, 3) propose a mechanism for a possible activation of RAGE by CAP37, and 4) if CAP37 activates RAGE, identify compounds with therapeutic potential for inhibition of endogenous CAP37 signaling through RAGE. Our second aim is to define the structural determinants of CAP37's binding and cleavage of A? and determine if CAP37 interferes with the polymerization of A?, which is the most relevant form of A? in AD. We will determine if CAP37 binds A? monomers and/or toxic polymers, and if the binding of CAP37 prevents or reverses the toxic polymerization of A?. We will define the mechanism by which CAP37, originally predicted to be enzymatically inactive, operates as a serine protease on A?, and determine if CAP37 can cleave polymerized A?. When our aims are accomplished, we will know the mechanisms by which CAP37 interferes with the A?-RAGE axis, leading to a better appreciation of how CAP37 might influence the progression of AD. This will allow the development of better therapeutics for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases involving A? and RAGE."
"9246802","We previously published an unexpected finding that mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in experimental animals enhances pulmonary defenses against bacterial pneumonia. This finding was validated in patients with mild brain injury who had a lower incidence of pneumonia compared to blunt trauma patients. We show that mTBI enhances innate immune responses and blunts deleterious coagulation responses in a mouse pneumonia model. These findings, coupled with substantial new preliminary data, provide the rationale for our hypothesis that the neuroimmune response to mild traumatic brain injury primes the host so that it will survive a subsequent pathogen challenge. New data demonstrate that the neurotransmitter substance P (SP) is released into the murine lung and plasma within minutes of mTBI. Neurokinin 1 (NK1R) is the preferred receptor of SP and NK1R agonists and an FDA approved NK1R antagonist are available. These reagents will allow us to precisely determine the mechanisms of how mTBI signaling through NK1R augments host responses to improve survival. This experimental design increases scientific reproducibility by both augmenting and blocking the same receptor to prove a cause and effect relationship. Specific aim 1 will determine how SP enhances pulmonary neutrophil recruitment to a pathogen challenge. We will use three distinctly different pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Candida albicans to identify shared innate immune pathways that foster neutrophil recruitment. Tail trauma will replicate blunt trauma patients and SP function will be manipulated by augmenting or blocking its receptor. The second specific aim will determine the mechanisms of how SP augments phagocytic cell eradication of pathogens from the lung. A novel, recently published flow cytometry assay examines three different phagocytic cell functions simultaneously to provide clear data concerning which function(s) are altered. Inflammation and coagulation are intimately linked, and new data show that mTBI blunts disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during pneumonia by enhancing fibrinolysis. Aim 3 will determine the protective mechanisms provided by SP. These three aims are inter-related which allows efficient use of resources. For example, after trauma and pathogen challenge we can determine in a single mouse how NK1R activation alters neutrophil recruitment, neutrophil function and coagulation responses. These studies are innovative since they challenge existing dogma that TBI only increases susceptibility to pathogens and increases DIC. The studies also have clinical relevance since NK1R antagonists are FDA approved to treat nausea in chemotherapy patients, which may increase their risk of infection. Further, NK1R agonists may augment the hosts? ability combat pathogens and would serve as a welcome addition to combat the emergence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens."
"9294936","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare systems in the US face complex questions regarding what healthcare decisions truly improve population health. To answer such questions, we need new investigators who can conduct innovative, pragmatic research on patient-centered outcomes and on the comparative effectiveness of medical treatments. These investigators must be able to implement the findings of comparative effectiveness research (CER) and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) in varied and complex healthcare settings. We propose to have a stakeholder-driven educational and experiential training program to prepare scientists and clinicians for conducting CER and PCOR. Our program includes a focus on community-based healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives, a largely underserved population. Trainees will benefit from experiential training mentored by experts in CER/PCOR at the University of Washington and also mentored by our four partners: the Urban Indian Health Institute, Southcentral Foundation of Alaska, Swedish Medical Center, and the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho Practice and Research Network. Our specific aims are to: 1) Collaborate with our partner organizations, revise an existing CER/PCOR curricula and develop new in-person training sessions that meet our partners' needs; 2) Develop asynchronous, online training modules that complement our in-person training; 3) Recruit and train a cadre of 24 new trainees from our partner organizations who lack or need improved CER/PCOR skills. We will also offer CER/PCOR training to participants in K and T32 programs at UW and other Seattle-based research and clinical organizations. We will help all trainees develop collaborative CER/PCOR pilot studies; 4) Develop a mentored training experience jointly with our partners; 5) Develop an advanced peer-training network that will focus on observational data, on eliciting stakeholder and patient perspectives, and on developing and using patient-centered outcomes in research and practice; and 6) Use innovative approaches, including continuous process improvement and social network analysis, to evaluate our program and strive to translate it into a sustainable effort that can be implemented in other sites across the US. Our overarching goal is to develop a partner-driven model for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Partnership. This Partnership will also strive to develop and conduct CER/PCOR studies that will reduce health disparities. Our effort will directly affect the quality of public health and healthcare systems and develop sustainable collaborations to improve healthcare in our region."
"9209198","SIMP CORE ABSTRACT: The capabilities of this technical Core predicate the kinds of questions we can address in our projects. Our strategies emphasize biophysical methods, to process large numbers of human samples run consistently and quantitatively. These approaches expand on our previous successes with imaging molecular colocalization in tissues and proteomics. In this cycle we extend antibody based detection approaches such as imaging/cytometry/ELISA, to mass spectrometry (MS) based metabolomics, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) for protein:protein discovery and stable isotope labeling for flux analysis and absolute quantification. This Core centralizes various animal experimentation and animal care protocols to provide uniform and reproducible quality for all projects. These animal models provide the critical bridge between in vitro studies and clinical findings that is necessary to complete the missions of our translational research. We have adopted bar coding and sample aliquot cataloguing, as practiced by HS core, to store tissues and biofluids from animal experiments. Over the past cycle, we have installed and implemented state-of-art MS metabolomics capabilities and established productivity. Metabolites offer a valuable readout for phenotype, as they are the end product of catalytic events that are modulated at multiple levels (transcription, modification, protein turn-over, etc.). Stable isotope flux analysis and the use of a wide array of available metabolic enzymes inhibitors allow for detailed mechanistic studies. Above and beyond, processing microliter volumes of hundreds to thousands of samples in a timely fashion, this Core must address emerging bottlenecks and develop solutions in advance. The Core Leaders Drs. Banerjee and Hansen have identified several such areas including fast point-of care-metabolomics, label free imaging (e.g. with 2nd harmonics) and improved imaging of fibrinolytic processes in whole blood under physiological flow that are being explored. Impact: The goals of this Core are to provide projects with the animal models and analytical procedures necessary to test hypotheses and discover new mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive responses to trauma and hemorrhagic shock. All of this is aimed at the ultimate goal of improving personalized diagnosis and care for the individual patient. 1"
"9353963","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this project is to develop precision therapies that target glutamine metabolism of colorectal cancers (CRCs) that harbor PIK3CA mutations. As a metabolite, glutamine is first converted to glutamate by glutaminase and then to ?-ketoglutarate (?-KG) by transaminases to replenish the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This proposal is based on our preliminary studies showing that: (i) CRCs with PIK3CA mutations are addicted to glutamine through upregulation of glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2); (ii) a glutaminase inhibitor, CB-839, suppresses the growth of PIK3CA mutant CRC xenografts; (iii) aminooxyacetate (AOA), an inhibitor of GPT2 and other aminotransferases, inhibits the growth of PIK3CA mutant CRC xenografts; (iv) neither CB-839 nor AOA inhibit growth of CRC xenograft with WT PIK3CA; and (v) combination of CB-839 with 5-FU overcomes resistance to 5-FU alone in xenografts. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which CB-839 augments the activity of 5-FU in PIK3CA mutant CRCs. In Aim 2, we will perform clinical trials to assess the pharmacodynamic effects and clinical activity of CB-839 in CRC patients with PIK3CA mutant tumors. In Aim 3, we will develop more potent and specific GPT2 inhibitors as tool compounds to validate GPT2 as a viable cancer target. One of the PIs (ZW) co-discovered that PIK3CA is highly mutated in many human cancers, including ~20% of CRCs. These studies will lead to an innovative selective approach to treating CRC patients whose tumors harbor PIK3CA mutations, and development of novel GPT2 inhibitors that could be further developed as potential anti-cancer drugs."
"9387821","Engineered Protein Nanocarriers for Intracellular Antibody Delivery There is a long list of ?undruggable? targets, disease related protein-protein interactions inside cells that small molecule drugs cannot block. Antibodies, in particular, can be engineered to bind almost any protein and inhibit protein function but have not yet been used against these targets. This is primarily due to the significant, unmet challenge in delivering sufficient amounts of folded, functional antibodies inside cells. The goal of this proposal is to build an intracellular antibody carrier using protein self-assembly and assess the therapeutic activity of delivered antibodies. By utilizing a hexameric protein bundle (HEX) and generic antibody-binding peptides (SPABs), nanoscale complexes containing only protein can be formed with antibodies. Our hypothesis is that the HEX antibody nanocarrier will significantly increase intracellular antibody uptake compared to soluble antibodies, and will enable therapeutic antibody binding to cytosolic targets. Our preliminary data suggests that Hex-SPAB protein nanocarriers do deliver functional antibody into the cytosol and, therefore, could be broadly applicable to future intracellular antibody therapeutics. Three aims have been set to meet the objective and test the hypothesis. (1) Fabricate and characterize the size, stability and antibody loading of HEX antibody nanocarriers. (2) Measure cellular uptake, cytosolic localization, and therapeutic function of model anti-cancer antibodies delivered by HEX nanocarriers. (3) Determine the therapeutic potential of HEX nanocarriers by adding anti-HER2 targeting antibodies to direct carriers to breast cancer cells, and evaluate the blood circulation time and immunogenicity of HEX nanocarriers in vivo. Two main outcomes are expected. First, an innovative protein nanocarrier will be created that facilitates cytosolic delivery of functional therapeutic antibodies. It will provide proof of concept for intracellular antibody therapeutics to inhibit proteins, including combinations with targeting antibodies. Second, this work will measure key properties necessary for translation, blood circulation time and immunogenicity. This will open the door for intracellular antibody engineering comparable to current extracellular antibodies that are successfully treating human disease."
"9410203","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. A dominant factor underlying this behavior is the lack of rapid methods to determine whether or not an individualized patient would actually benefit from the intended course of antibiotics. Furthermore, if a course of antibiotics are chosen to be administered, it is not clear how to optimize the de-escalation of the antibiotics. This results in a blanket antibiotics approach, where nearly every patient with even a possibility of sepsis is dosed with broad spectrum antibiotics and stays on these antibiotics for far longer than is necessary. Procalcitonin (PCT) has shown much promise in recent years as a potential discriminator between bacterial and viral infections. Various assays for PCT from company such as bioMerieux and Roche have received 510k clearance from the FDA for use by physicians in optimizing the administration of antibiotics. In addition, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria are often used as rough indications of a global inflammatory problem in patients. Of these four criteria (WBC count, respiratory rate, heart rate, and temperature), only the WBC count is not currently possible to measure outside of clinical labs. A handheld device that could combine both a WBC count and a plasma PCT measurement from a drop of blood in 10 minutes could revolutionize the administration of antibiotics in acute care settings. In particular, obtaining the first measurement of both PCT and WBC as early as possible before arrival to Emergency Departments is critical. Ideally this would be obtained in the most common ?funnels? into the acute care EDs, including outpatient, ambulatory, and nursing home settings. Several studies have shown that the temporal trends of these two parameters can be very powerful for further adjustments to the administered antibiotics. For example, Roche?s Elecsys BRAHMS PCT system recommends that a PCT measurement is performed at both day 0 and day 4, and that the difference should be used to inform optimization of the antibiotics. ElectroCyt, Inc. is an early stage company that has raised $1.7M in investment and has licensed its core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The company aims to develop a hand-held electronic reader with an accompanying pipeline of cartridge designs to measure a variety of cell counts, cell surface receptor expression levels, and plasma protein expression levels. Our first cartridge will measure a total WBC count and PCT from a drop of blood. The company has signed an exciting joint development agreement (JDA) with Foxconn Interconnect Technologies (FIT) to co-develop the low cost prototype cartridge and hand- held readers (letter attached). In addition, ElectroCyt has also established two clinical partnerships with hospitals to perform clinical studies (letters attached) to build a unique combined biomarker/EMR dataset. This dataset, when combined with machine learning for predictive analytics and the patient?s latest biomarker readings, will provide real time feedback to physicians as to a patient?s overall ?immune state score?. This score could be used as individualized evaluation of how well a patient is recovering or not recovering from a septic event, which can help physicians adjust course of antibiotics with real time feedback. In this project, we will adapt our core technology, which has focused on cell measurements, to enable plasma protein measurements as well. In addition, we will continue to perform clinical studies to build the unique combined biomarker + EMR dataset at three clinical sites, University of Chicago Main Hospital, Carle Foundation Hospital and Order of Saint Francis (OSF) hospital."

"9469844","Project Summary/Abstract Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) retain the ability to generate any cell type in the human body, offering unprecedented access to a wide-array of human cell types. hPSCs are therefore a powerful model to study human neurodevelopmental diseases in vitro.57,59 Rett Syndrome (RTT), a devastating Autism-Spectrum- Disorder that affects 1 in 10,000 female births and causes severe regression by 18 months of age, is one such neurodevelopmental disorder.1,2 Hallmarks of RTT include an imbalance in inhibitory:excitatory synapses as well as excessive microglial pruning, but how these two pathologies are interconnected has yet to be fully explored. In this study, my goal is to decipher how inhibitory:excitatory synaptic imbalance in RTT is related to microglial-neuronal interplay using an iPSC-derived multi-cell type in vitro model containing both neurons and microglia. While there are established protocols for deriving neurons from hPSCs, to date there have been no developmentally-based differentiation schema for generating hPSC-derived microglia. Preliminary data shows that I can generate yolk sac primitive hematopoiesis in vitro to isolate microglial progenitors, and I have developed two different paradigms to generate microglial-like cells after co-culture with neurons. In this study, I aim to 1) compare the two paradigms to determine which generates microglial-like cells most similar to human primary microglia, and 2) use these cells to study the contribution of microglial-neuronal interaction in an iPSC-model of RTT. Specifically, I will investigate whether the inhibitory:excitatory synaptic imbalance in RTT is caused by a neuron-only phenotype or whether it is affected by microglial pruning. Through this study, I hope to generate bonafide human microglia through a novel, developmental paradigm, as well as answer a key mechanistic question behind RTT synaptic pathology."
"9531581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to reveal mechanisms by which the long non-coding (lnc) RNAs Xist and Tsix find their genomic target sites and control gene expression at these sites during the process of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). XCI is a remarkable paradigm of lncRNA-mediated chromatin regulation, controlled by the oppositely transcribed RNAs Xist and Tsix, that transcriptionally silence one of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells. While Xist induces silencing of the X chromosome, Tsix negatively regulates Xist early in development to ensure that Xist only becomes active on one X chromosome. We already know several functions of Xist, including spreading in cis from its site of transcription to cover the entire X chromosome, excluding RNA Polymerase II, triggering the accumulation of repressive chromatin marks, and inducing a chromosome-wide compaction, demonstrating the remarkable versatility of this lncRNA. The mechanisms by which Xist carries out these functions remain poorly understood. In particular, with few exceptions, we still do not know domains of Xist or interacting proteins that mediate these various roles. However, our preliminary data yield new insight into the roles of Xist and Tsix. Specifically, we have been able to define three domains of Xist as mediators of distinct functions, consistent with the idea that distinct RNA domains carry out different functions. We hypothesize that these domains are required for the efficient association of Xist with the X, ensuring its function in cis; the targetng of Xist to active genes, which is a prerequisite for their subsequent silencing; and for changes in chromosome conformation, respectively. To further define the mechanisms by which these domains act, we have also identified a critical protein interaction partner of one of these domains. Moreover, our recent work on Xist spreading suggests an intriguing link between Xist and genome organization, that led to the hypothesis that Xist utilizes long-range chromatin interactions to spread across the X chromosome, and, upon tethering to distal sites acts as a nuclear organization factor that creates a new 3D topology of the chromosome to induce gene silencing. Finally, by comparing the RNA localization of Tsix and Xist on the X chromosome, we found that Tsix can spread along the X, but in contrast to Xist, only spreads locally around its site of transcription. We speculate that specific RNA sequences in Xist and Tsix direct these distinct localization patterns. Based on our findings, we are well positioned to unveil regulatory mechanisms by which Xist and Tsix control XCI, with these Aims: 1) To understand how Xist RNA mediates its various functions through specific RNA domains. 2) To investigate the link between 3D chromosome structure and Xist. 3) To characterize the function and localization of Tsix. Each aim will be supported by outstanding collaborators. Together, our proposed studies will provide novel insights into XCI, and should significantly advance our understanding of the role of nuclear architecture on nuclear function. Exploring the differences between Xist and Tsix will also yield a better understanding of how lncRNAs locate to their genomic targets."

"9545358","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a transition from a P30 Core Center of Excellence in Hematology (DK056465-16) to an NIDDK-sponsored U54 Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC). This transition will facilitate collaborations, training, and resource sharing on a national level. The goal of this CHSCC is to advance research in stem cell and transplantation biology and thereby accelerate the development of new therapies. This requires resources that anticipate and meet the needs of an ever evolving research base. Our past experience has shown that new investigators can be recruited into this area of research if critical cells, technologies, and expertise can be accessed at reasonable cost. To address these needs we are proposing to provide an Administrative Core and five biomedical research cores. These include Cell Procurement and Processing, to provide large quantities of purified normal hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and stromal populations harvested from adult blood and marrow as well as cord blood and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); Vector Production to provide lenti, retro, foamy and adeno-associated virus vectors for gene transduction, marking, and editing; Specialized Mouse Services including in vivo xenogeneic transplantation assays and the generation of custom transgenic models; the Canine Large Animal Model for preclinical studies including protocol development and IACUC approval; and Molecular Library Development and Screening, that provides access to CRISPR genome editing and shRNA libraries. The services provided by these cores will enable individual investigators to: 1) isolate and characterize stem/progenitor cells, 2) genetically mark, edit or otherwise alter their gene expression, 3) accurately detect and quantitate their progeny in vitro and in vivo, and 4) determine the effects of these manipulations on hematopoiesis at the molecular, cellular, and whole animal levels. The Administrative Core provides budgetary and scientific oversight of all CHSCC activities, and manages a charge back system to generate program income. Program income is used to enhance and expand Core operations as well as support the Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) and Enrichment programs designed for trainees and young investigators in the CHSCC network. Finally, the Administrative Core will work with Sage Bionetworks to create a publicly searchable data archive linking investigators to annotated data, techniques, and protocols generated through the CHSCC programs. The 30 member research base of this CHSCC receives more than 29 million/year direct costs in non-malignant Hematology-related research, 3.8 million comes directly from the NIDDK."
"9537956","Project Summary: To protect our nation's security, medical countermeasures (MCMs) for high consequence pathogens (HCPs) must be developed to treat and prevent threats to global health. Fifteen years ago, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the final rule for New Drug and Biological Drug Products; Evidence needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible (21 CFR Parts 314 and 601, Federal Register, May 31, 2002). The Animal Rule (AR), as often referenced, states that for drugs/biologics developed to ameliorate or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic substances, when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible, FDA may grant marketing approval based on adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies when the results of those studies establish that the drug is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans. Because of the highly infectious nature of HCPs, these studies are often performed in high or maximum biocontainment (BSL-3/4). The logistics of assuring accurate and reliable data collected from these environments is challenging. These products are subsequently evaluated through clinical trials during a public emergency. Data derived from the nonclinical AR studies and the clinical studies for HCPs are reviewed by FDA and global authorities to draw a regulatory conclusion; therefore, data quality and integrity are imperative.  In 2012, the FDA and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) collaborated to design and implement an education program to cross educate sponsors, scientists, veterinarians, physicians, nurses, quality assurance personnel, regulators, reviewers, and policy- makers to enable the conduct of regulated studies supporting product approval via the FDA's AR. These studies require compliance with the FDA Good Laboratory Practice regulations (21 CFR Part 58) to the extent practicable in order to assure data quality and integrity. The result was a robust education program that delivered annual training to 269 registered attendees from 2013- 2017. The FDA and UTMB plan to expand the education program curriculum to include a course addressing the conduct of HCP clinical trials and also expand the catalog of on-line courses for distance education of individuals conducting HCP clinical trials at remote sites. Knowledge gained will address barriers to progress and increase communication between parties involved in the conduct, policy-making, funding, review, and inspections of studies necessary for the advancement of MCMs and protection of human health."
"9436878","Project summary For cardiac MRI pulse sequences to function properly, a signal or trigger must typically be obtained to help synchronize the acquisition process with the cardiac motion. As a result of such synchronization, reconstructed images represent a given cardiac phase, mostly free of cardiac-related motion. Improper detection of such triggers would cause data from different cardiac phases to mix into a same image, leading to motion artifacts and loss of image quality. Most commonly, electrocardiogram (ECG) leads are employed to detect the electrical activity of the heart and to generate such triggers, allowing the MRI acquisition and the heart motion to remain in sync. Besides a small risk for skin burns, one of the main challenges with using ECG leads for cardiac MRI comes from the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect, which tends to distort the ECG signal. Because of the Lorenz force, and in a manner similar to the Hall effect, the positive and negative ions in blood tend to curve in different directions as they move through a magnetic field, creating a charge separation and an electric field that tends to corrupts the ECG signal. Because the aorta carries a large amount of fast-moving blood, it tends to be the main source of corrupting electrical fields, and the problem becomes more significant at higher field strength. Scanner operation, especially gradient switching, can also further corrupt ECG signals.  Real-time cardiac imaging, as opposed to cardiac-gated imaging, does not necessarily require reliable triggers, but typically suffers from lower spatial and temporal resolution. Presumably for this reason, cardiac- gated imaging represents the overwhelming bulk of clinical cardiac MR (CMR) scans. Alternatives to ECG leads for CMR gating include pulse oximetry, which typically takes the form of a sensor clipped around a finger. While it has the advantage of being insensitive to the MHD effect, pulse oximetry and other forms of peripheral gating detect heartbeats with a delay, the time for the pressure wave to reach the detection point, as opposed to ECG detection that is more direct and immediate. With a perfectly regular heart, such delay would be of little to no consequence, but cardiac patients often have irregular heartbeats and immediate detection of a contraction allows the MRI acquisition to react in a more sensible way, with better outcomes on image quality.  The present project introduces an alternative to ECG monitoring for cardiac-gated MRI which detects cardiac motion directly. An ultrasound-based sensor is proposed, along with 3D-printed capsule for quick application to the skin and realistic clinical workflow. Before the patient table slides into the scanner, as the magnetic field is weak and the MHD effect is minimal, we will validate our approach with ECG detection as the reference standard. As the patient goes into the scanner, the ECG trace will be degraded but our MR- compatible sensor will remain unaffected. With patients in the scanner, we will demonstrate an improved detection of cardiac triggers and improved image quality using our sensors as compared to using ECG leads."

"9358370","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In order to uncover novel genetic variants that influence tau toxicity, and also recapitulate the genetic diversity characteristic of the human population, Project 2 aims to take advantage of the observation that severity of tauopathy in transgenic mouse models is significantly impacted by altering genetic background. While most transgenic lines have been created on a standard genetic background, a single inbred strain does not incorporate one of the major sources of phenotypic variation in human populations: genetic diversity. The lack of genetic diversity also limits the translational utility of standard mouse models because it grossly underestimates the variation of responses that will be seen in the human population. Therefore a genetically- diverse mouse model of tauopathy will be created in the current study, using AAV to drive mutant tau expression in a panel of Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mice, as well as Diversity Outbred (DO) mice produced from random repeated outcrossing of CC strains. Collectively, the CC and DO mouse populations offer high mapping resolution and broad allelic diversity, carrying 45 million SNPs and structural variants and thus providing a unique opportunity to discover new genes that regulate tau toxicity in vivo. Although there are currently no genetically diverse models of tauopathy that are representative of the diversity present within the human population, the development of such a model would enable researchers to test the efficacy and toxicity of new therapeutic strategies, improving translational relevance by incorporating the genetic variation missing from traditional models. Here, based on the compelling evidence presented in Project 3 demonstrating that antibody-induced elevation of plasma tau fluctuates with disease progression, we will evaluate the extent to which genetic background and disease severity influence plasma tau levels in our AAV-injected, CC and DO mice. These findings will not only provide key insight into the potential significance of changes in plasma tau concentrations to progression of tauopathy, but also offer an indication of the magnitude of variability that could be anticipated in the human population. Collectively, the studies proposed will not only increase our understanding of underlying pathogenic mechanisms and pathways, but also drive the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of tauopathy."
"9407421","Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic cardiotoxicity is a clinically unresolved issue for cancer patients who are treated, particularly with anthracycline based drugs. Currently, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have no option, but to rely on these nonspecific chemotherapeutics. New technologies are needed to reduce the off-target toxicity including anthracycline related cardiotoxicity (ARC) and more importantly, monitor the reduction of cardiotoxicity in vivo.  ?A priori activation of apoptosis of pathways of tumor? (AAAPT) is a novel technology which sensitizes low responsive tumor cells and cancer stems cells (CSCs) in several types of cancers (e.g. colon, lung, prostate, breast, brain and renal) by multiple mechanisms including a) activating cell death pathway (CD 95), b) inhibiting survival pathway (NF-kB) and c) inhibiting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Most cancer cells circumvent exogenous and endogenous toxicity by deactivating cell death pathway, activating inhibition pathway and hyperactivating PARP in heart leading to cardiotoxicity. Current guidelines for predicting/monitoring ARC include left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV volume and diastolic function which appear to be too late as compared to biological functions at molecular level such as cell death in heart. Our collaborators from Johns Hopkins University have demonstrated the prediction of dose dependent cardiotoxicity for doxorubicin using 99mTc- SPECT-CT. Hence, we propose AAAPT leading candidates AMP-001/002 to be neoadjuvant to chemotherapy (e.g. doxorubicin) in order to reduce ARC since combination of AAAPT and doxorubicin has reduced IC50 significantly in vitro compared to doxorubicin alone. Our specific aims are; Specific Aim 1: To a) synthesize leading AAAPT candidates AMP-001-002 and b) validate sensitization of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells to front line therapeutics (e.g. doxorubicin, gemcitabine, Herceptin and paclitaxel) and c) assess the cardiotoxicity of the combination of drugs in induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSc) during first 6 months. The objective will be accomplished at Sci-Engi-Medco Solutions associated laboratories under PI/PD supervision. Specific Aim 2: To a) determine the dose at which doxorubicin exhibit cardiotoxicity in orthotopic TNBC MDA-MB- 231 tumor xenograft nude rat (nu/nu) by quantifying cell death in myocardium correlated to cardiotoxicity. The milestones include in vivo tumor cardiotoxicity data corroborated with transthoracic echocardiography and cell death in myocardium by tunnel assays respectively and further correlated to image density in 99mTc-SPECT-CT, which will be carried out by Dr. Pomper/Gabrielson at Johns Hopkins University. Specific Aim 3: To assess the efficacy of AMP-001/AMP-002 and doxorubicin combination for tumor regression with low or no cardiotoxicity in vivo using two animal models namely, TNBC MDA-MB-231 and BT4 tumor xenograft nude rat (nu/nu) model. The milestones include a) tumor volume measurement correlated to tumor cell death using SPECT-CT imaging, histology of tumor ex-vivo with tunnel assays and b) quantification of cardiotoxicity. Expected Outcome: The foremost outcome is a potential use of AAAPT as a neoadjuvant to chemotherapy and SPECT-CT as an imaging tool to risk stratify patients for CRC prior to develop cardiomyopathy. The second outcome would be a potential extension of AAAPT synergy to other front line chemotherapeutics (e.g. doxorubicin, gemcitabine, carboplatin, PI3K inhibitor Novartis) and other cancers (e.g. colon, lung, prostate, breast, brain and renal) which are refractory to current treatments."

EBV and KSHV are linked to multiple cancers in the human population. This proposal will study the role of several viral and cellular genes and proteins in modulating EBV- and KSHV-mediated oncogenesis. To identify the mechanisms responsible for the oncogenic properties of these viruses, the projects will characterize the basic molecular properties of viral proteins and their interactions with cellular proteins. The experiments will identify how viral proteins interact with cellular proteins to change their function. Furthermore, the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting viral and cellular proteins will be tested in cell culture assays and animal models. This application consists of five projects and two cores. Project 1 will utilize electron microscopy to analyze the structure of KSHV proteins and replication complexes. Project 2 will elucidate the role of a cellular deubiquitinase, UCHL1, in membrane trafficking and cell-cell communication of EBV-infected cells. Project 3 will investigate how KSHV modulates the tumor microenvironment and the cellular and viral proteins involved in these processes. Project 4 will examine KSHV carcinogenesis using novel mouse models and cell culture assays, and Project 5 will investigate how the EBV oncoproteins, LMP1 and LMP2, modulate the cellular proteome and cellular pathways to contribute to EBV-associated malignancies.

"9396882","Project Summary The rising obesity epidemic affects more women than men and obese premenopausal women are at higher risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than men. The mechanisms that underlie this loss of protection from CVD in young obese women are unknown. The adipose-derived hormone leptin plays a significant role in CVD in obesity. Leptin-mediated sympatho-activation in obese male animals specifically increases blood pressure. In contrast, our lab has published that leptin-induced CVD in females involves activation of the aldosterone-mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) axis. Preliminary data in this proposal demonstrates that there is a sex-discrepancy in aldosterone sensitivity. Our results show that vessels from female mice develop endothelial dysfunction in response to acute aldosterone exposure, whereas those from males do not. In addition, female mice have ~3-4-fold higher expression of the endothelial cell mineralocorticoid receptor (ECMR). In addition, the sex-difference in ECMR expression is exacerbated in obese females compared to obese males. Suppression of female sex hormones by ovariectomy ablates the sex difference in ECMR expression, which is restored with the female sex hormone progesterone. Furthermore, female mice with deletion of ECMR do not develop leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction. Collectively, these data suggest that ECMR mediates the increased sensitivity to aldosterone in obese premenopausal females. We, therefore, hypothesize that ECMR mediate obesity-associated, leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in obese female mice. We will test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims. Experiments described for Specific Aim 1 will determine if ECMR expression is increased in female mice when progesterone levels are endogenously elevated as well whether progesterone receptor inhibition in female obese mice ablates the sex-difference in ECMR expression. We will also determine if progesterone activates MR promoter activity up- or down-regulates microRNAs. The results of this aim will determine whether progesterone inhibition downregulates ECMR in females. Specific Aim 2 will determine if increases in ECMR expression in females mediates leptin-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. We will assess blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction in ECMR knockout mice. In addition, we will investigate whether conditional ECMR overexpression ablates the sex difference in leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Collectively, these studies will assess if progesterone mediates increased ECMR activation in obese females and if ECMR is required for leptin-induced CVD in females. These data will increase our knowledge of mechanisms that contribute to CVD in obese premenopausal women, and will give evidence for whether pharmacological progesterone inhibition is a potential treatment strategy for CVD in obese women."
"9396483","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In the adult nervous system, peripheral sensory neurons maintain appropriate innervation patterns despite continual turnover of the target epithelia they innervate. The goal of this research is to elucidate fundamental neuronal mechanisms that govern plasticity of peripheral neurons in healthy tissue. The project focuses on Merkel cell-neurite complexes, which are high acuity touch receptors composed of epidermal Merkel cells innervated by myelinated (A?) sensory afferents. These discriminative touch receptors are enriched in fingertips, whisker follicles and touch domes in hairy skin. In mice, skin goes through marked changes in thickness and stiffness during the hair growth cycle, which repeats throughout adulthood. These target-organ changes are accompanied by rapid plasticity in the complexity of peripheral axonal arbors of Merkel-cell afferents. This application's central hypothesis is that the intrinsic pathways that dictate neuronal remodeling after injury also govern structural plasticity in healthy tissue, which causes behaviorally relevant changes across sensory modalities. The hypothesis will be tested using a combination of transgenic mouse models, quantitative neuroanatomy and three-dimensional neuronal tracing, in vivo, live-cell imaging and sensory behavioral tests. Aim 1 will test whether pathways that mediate axonal degeneration and regrowth after axonal injury are involved in afferent remodeling in healthy tissue. This aim will evaluate differences in neuronal morphology at defined hair cycle stages in transgenic mice lacking genes that interfere with injury-induced signaling pathways. Aim 2 will use mouse behavioral assays to test whether somatosensory afferents that mediate distinct sensory modalities remodel in parallel. These studies will define the functional consequences of neuronal remodeling in healthy tissue as well as cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate structural plasticity."
"9337443","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucosal atrophy often leads to barrier failure and sepsis in starving or fasting patients despite total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Many patients who undergo massive bowel resection fail to adapt and require permanent TPN with high mortality. Current interventions to prevent mucosal atrophy or enhance adaptation have limited efficacy, perhaps because they mostly induce proliferation. We hypothesize that hyperproliferation can be maladaptive as it is often accompanied by decreased differentiation. Thus, we propose that we must learn to promote differentiation as well as proliferation to achieve an intact functional mucosa, reverse mucosal atrophy, and engender maximal intestinal adaptation. Schlafen (Slfn)-family proteins mediate cell growth, differentiation, or development in hematopoietic cells in a Slfn and cell-specific fashion. We showed that the rodent protein Slfn3 is induced during and required for intestinal epithelial differentiation in response to various stimuli. We further found that Slfn3 varies with intestinal development and mucosal atrophy and promotes differentiation in vivo and that SLFN12 is its human ortholog. We hypothesize that Slfn3/12 induction represents a fundamental and essential common pathway for enterocytic differentiation that can be specifically targeted to promote differentiation and maintain the mucosa. We further propose that Slfns act in the cytosol through Slfn P-loop domain binding to specific proteins lowering proteasomal activity, increasing Cdx2 homeobox protein levels and enhancing transcription via a Cdx2-dependent positive feedback mechanism.  We will study 1) intestinal mucosa in patients fasting on TPN (atrophy) or after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (hypertrophy), 2) rat and human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, and 3) the effects of in vivo manipulation of Slfn3/12 levelsin Slfn3 knock-out mice after 60% massive small bowel resection and a novel rodent model of intestinal epithelial atrophy and hypertrophy to: 1) Demonstrate that Slfn3 determines enterocytic differentiation in mucosal atrophy and adaptation in rodents, 2) Show that SLFN12 is the relevant human ortholog of Slfn3, and 3) Establish the mechanism(s) by which Slfn3/SLFN12 act. This study will fill a critical knowledge gap because we will delineate a fundamental mechanism by which diverse stimuli regulate intestinal epithelial differentiation. This will facilitate interventions to maintain the mucosal barrier in starving or critically ill paients with mucosal atrophy and promote nutrition in pediatric or adult short bowel syndrome. The Slfn3 knock-out mouse will provide valuable insights not only into the convergent differentiation regulatory pathway we will study but also into normal gut development, mucosal healing and other intestinal disorders such as IBD. In addition, understanding how Slfn proteins promote differentiation will have broader implications for differentiation and development in other epithelial tissues."
"9544372","Project Summary Coronary heart disease (CHD) presents an enormous physical, social and economic burden, and this burden may be exacerbated in the estimated 6.2 million and rapidly growing number of CHD patients who are obese. Cardiac rehabilitation programs have the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in CHD patients. However, the efficacy of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for improving exercise capacity and CHD risk factors is blunted in CHD patients with obesity. As such, a large proportion of these patients are not experiencing optimal treatment benefits with the current standard of care. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are currently limited by their short duration (3 months), inadequate focus on obesity treatment (nutrient vs. caloric intake), and inability to produce meaningful weight loss (<3%). While multiple lines of evidence suggest that a strategy such as caloric restriction that produces weight and fat loss will improve outcomes in CHD patients with obesity, a definitive randomized clinical trial using evidence-based approaches to weight loss in the cardiac rehabilitation setting is needed. The primary goal of this study is to test the main hypothesis that adding a novel 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention (i.e., calorie-restricted diet with meal replacements) to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation will lead to greater improvements in exercise capacity, arterial function, body composition and fat distribution, quality of life, CHD risk factors, and inflammation. We will also examine whether short-term benefits are sustained long-term by reassessing outcomes 12 months after intervention completion and exploring effects on cardiovascular events and mortality during a 3.5 year follow-up period. To accomplish this goal, we will randomize 120 obese adults (BMI ?30 kg/m2 or waist circumference >102 cm in men and >88 cm in women) aged 55-75 years with CHD to 6 months of cardiac rehabilitation (Rehab) alone or to cardiac rehabilitation plus a behavioral weight loss intervention (Rehab+WL) that elicits body fat loss. The specific aims are to determine the effects of Rehab+WL vs. Rehab alone on exercise capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk (primary aim); indices of arterial wave reflection (aortic augmentation index, reflection magnitude, late systolic load), arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity), peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak), quality of life (SF-36), body composition (by DXA), body fat distribution (by CT), CHD risk factors (lipids, glucose, blood pressure), and inflammation (secondary aims); and a composite endpoint including all- cause mortality and cardiovascular events during up to 3.5 years of follow up (exploratory aim). Determining whether novel interventions designed to promote meaningful weight loss and sustained behavioral changes can improve outcomes and long-term prognosis in CHD patients with obesity has the potential to significantly advance the field and lend additional support for health care policy changes focused on obesity. Confirmation of our hypothesis will provide strong impetus for adding a formal weight loss program to cardiac rehabilitation guidelines and implementing new models of care for CHD patients with obesity."
"9479495","Salmonella, Listeria and STEC isolated from retail meat, fresh produce and their environment have been implicated as the leading causes of bacterial foodborne illness in the US and around the world. It is important that we monitor the prevalence and trends of important foodborne bacterial strains in food products that can eventually pass to the consumers along the farm-to-fork chain resulting in significant public health impact. It is, therefore, important to expand the current surveillance network and monitor these important pathogens at the global scale to prevent future outbreaks. We propose to do this in collaboration with the WHO-AGISAR (Advisory Committee on Integrated Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance) which funds countries to conduct surveillance of antimicrobial resistant foodborne bacterial pathogens in humans, food products and the environment. We strongly believe that the data generated through the proposed work will assist in monitoring Salmonella, Listeria and STEC from at the international level where current surveillance systems are not robust enough to track them. The WGS data and metadata will significantly improve the power to resolve outbreaks by helping to quickly link clinical and retail product samples and assist in outbreak investigations. The PD (Dr. Thakur) laboratory, in partnership with the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDACS), is a GenomeTrakr collaborating laboratory. Our proposal will significantly assist us in tracking emergence of potential new Salmonella, Listeria and STEC strains and allow the public health agencies to take appropriate steps to safeguard human and animal health at the global level. The specific objectives of our proposal are: 1) Establish a robust surveillance system based on whole genome sequence (WGS) profile of 400 Salmonella, Listeria and STEC isolated from food and environmental sources within and outside the US. 2) Compare the WGS profiles of Salmonella, Listeria and STEC at the global scale to assist in outbreak investigations and track emerging strains of public health importance. The long-term objective of our proposal is to protect and promote public health by strengthening the surveillance of Salmonella, Listeria and STEC within and outside the US by generating critical WGS data and contributing to the GenomeTrakr mission."
"9430560","PROJECT SUMMARY Strong evidence links central hypothalamic neuroendocrine output to complex biological processes and behaviors that control energy and metabolic homeostasis. Dr. Kershaw?s collaborative research group recently identified a novel obesity-risk variant in a putative transcriptional regulator, CREBRF, that is highly expressed in the hypothalamus. Although virtually nothing in know about CREBRF, it has been linked to glucocorticoid signaling, raising that possibility that its energy and metabolic effects in humans is mediated, in part, by influencing hypothalamic glucocorticoid and/or neuroendocrine output. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine how CREBRF and its obesity-risk variant contribute to the central regulation of energy homeostasis and the stress response. The overall objective, which is the next step in the pursuit of this goal, is to characterize the role of this gene/variant in central hypothalamic glucocorticoid and neuroendocrine output. The central hypothesis is that CREBRF is expressed and regulated in key hypothalamic neurons and that the loss of CREBRF or expression of its missense CrebrfR457Q will differentially impact the metabolic control transcriptome and the chromatin landscape within the hypothalamus, thereby influences behavioral and metabolic outcomes. This hypothesis is based on the following: 1) endogenous CREBRF is highly expressed in the central nervous systems including the hypothalamus where it co-localizes with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR); 2) ectopic expression of CREBRF in cells influences subnuclear GR targeting and stability; 3) global CrebrfKO mice have dysregulated glucocorticoid signaling and abnormal postpartum maternal behavior; and 4) global CrebrfKO mice have reduced body weight. The above hypothesis will be tested using molecular, cellular, and physiological approaches with the following specific aims: 1) To characterize the impact of CREBRF and its obesity risk variant (CREBRFR458Q) on hypothalamic output in vivo using murine models; and 2) to determine the function of CREBRF and its obesity risk variant (CREBRFR458Q) on chromatin accessibility and cell-specific transcriptome using murine models. This research is innovative because 1) it examines obesity in a murine model without the complications of diabetes, 2) examine the mechanisms for the phenotype observed in Samoans and 3) will lay the foundation for numerous avenues to pursue the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting central CREBRF. This contribution will be significant because it will identify CREBRF expression, regulation, and function in specific hypothalamic neuropeptide-containing neurons and HPA-axis output during defined stress conditions and determine the impact of CREBRF and its obesity-linked variant on the genome-wide chromatin landscape and single cell transcriptomes within the hypothalamus. Such findings are expected to have a broad translational impact by improving strategies for prevention and/or treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Finally, at the completion of this proposal, Dr. Frahm will be well poised to lead her own independent research program in the field of neuroendocrinology."

"9309362","Project Summary The development of gene therapy has advanced to a point where a cure for Pompe disease can be foreseen. Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II; acid maltase deficiency) is a devastating myopathy resulting from acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency in striated and smooth muscle. Despite the availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human (rh) GAA, many patients have poor outcomes including mortality due to clinically significant anti-GAA antibody response. The limitations of ERT have prompted the preclinical development of gene therapy for Pompe disease. Clinical translation of efficacious gene therapy will greatly advance treatment for Pompe disease by correcting GAA deficiency and suppressing immune responses against rhGAA."
"9382629","Chemoenzymatic Synthesis, Mode of Action and Evolution of Natural Product-based Macrocycles Natural peptide macrocycles are promising next-generation therapeutics, due to their abilities to bind to challenging protein targets, such as protein interfaces and transcription factors. The goal of our lab is to use insights and chemistries from natural product biosynthesis to facilitate the discovery and development of new natural product-like peptide macrocycles. We will use a combined chemical and enzymatic approach for synthesis of highly constrained peptide macrocycles similar to those used in nature. Over the next five years, these efforts will be divided amongst three project areas. In the first project, we develop a chemoenzymatic platform for the preparation of analogs of the thiopeptide natural products. We further exploit this platform to examine new, diversity generating enzymes from complimentary ribosomal natural product pathways. In the second project, we will investigate the multi-faceted biological activities of thiopeptides and develop potent and selective inhibitors of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1. A major thrust of this research will be structure elucidation of thiopeptides bound to FoxM1. In the final project, we combine enzymes from ribosomal peptide natural product with mRNA display to allow laboratory scale directed evolution of new peptide macrocycle inhibitors. This work is expected to yield new avenues and technologies for development of peptide macrocycle- based therapeutics."
"9349352","PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder that ranks among the top 10 health burdens worldwide, yet current treatment options are not effective for many patients. In order to develop new therapies, we must gain a better understanding of how the physiology of the brain is altered in the disease. This will require links to be established between pathophysiological processes that occur at the levels of synaptic transmission, neuronal activity patterns, circuit dynamics, information processing, and finally cognitive performance. Our current body of knowledge is based on the two extremes of this spectrum: genetic defects that lead to dysfunction in cellular function on one end, changes in global brain activation patterns and cognitive performance on the other. What we are missing is an intermediate link at the level of neural circuits, or more specifically, an understanding of how distortions of the spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity in schizophrenia ultimately derail the computations performed by the networks, leading to cognitive failure.  A widely-accepted theoretical model of schizophrenia called the disconnection hypothesis posits that the disease results from disordered functional connectivity between brain regions. While some functional imaging evidence supports this theory, it has never been tested at the neuronal circuit level and thus a mechanistic framework has not been developed. Here we propose to test the central hypothesis that schizophrenia is a disease in which aberrant action potential timing in prefrontal circuits leads to weakening of synaptic connections over time, through established mechanisms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity.  In the Specific Aim 1, we propose to analyze a previously collected dataset of neuronal activity obtained from nonhuman primates performing a working memory task after receiving a drug that mimics features of schizophrenia. Preliminary analysis of this data suggests that spiking activity is disordered such that cells in the same local circuits are desynchronized and functional connectivity between cell pairs is reduced; these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that spike timing disruption leads to functional disconnection in schizophrenia. We will further develop these analyses and relate them to the disruptions in cognitive processing that parallel those seen in human schizophrenic patients. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to conduct large-scale neural recordings in transgenic mice in order to investigate how a mutation that increases risk for schizophrenia changes the properties of neuronal interactions. We will apply similar analytical techniques to the neural data from Aims 1 and 2 in order to maximize the translational power of both animal models. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we propose to perform computational neural network simulations in order to establish a theoretical framework that causally links disordered spike timing to functional disconnection. The information gained through these studies will form a basis for a new theoretical framework of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia which can be used to guide a rational search for new treatments."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy has transformed the health of HIV-endemic populations in South Africa, with unprecedented gains in life expectancy (Bor et al. 2013) and significant reductions in HIV incidence (Tanser et al. 2013). To achieve the full potential benefits of ART scale-up, further evidence is needed on the pathways (behavioral vs. biological) through which ART coverage reduces incidence, and the reasons why so many people with HIV continue to die when life-saving ART is available. We will establish this evidence base through analysis of demographic and health surveillance data from rural KwaZulu-Natal. This research will inform interventions to maximize the impact of South Africa's ART program."
"9322613","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several studies have shown that calcium phosphate (CaP) stones are formed in the early segments of the nephron, namely the proximal tubule (PT) and the loop of Henle (LOH), where conditions are favorable due to high calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate concentrations, as well as a relatively high pH. The PT is the major site for Ca2+ reabsorption, where a paracellular pathway has been reported. However, existence of any regulated Ca2+ transport through a transcellular route is unknown. Our present proposal will study this yet unknown regulated Ca2+ entry mechanism that controls transcellular Ca2+ transport, which has a role in stone formation. Our preliminary data show that Ca2+-sensing receptor (CSR), a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to alterations in extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o), and a transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3), a Ca2+ permeable channel, both localize at the luminal region of PT cells. Our data show also that: 1) CSR couples with TRPC3 both physically and functionally; and 2) [Ca2+]o mediates this coupling response through CSR which signals TRPC3 channels via a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent pathway. More importantly, we found that the pharmacological/genetic disruption of both CSR and TRPC3 markedly attenuated this Ca2+ influx in PT cells and that TRPC3-null mice displayed a phenotype of elevated [Ca2+] in urine, calcification in kidney and scattered crystals in the urine and the LOH. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that increased [Ca2+] and other modulators, like protons and amino acids, in PT luminal fluid can activate CSR-TRPC3 signaling via a PLC-dependent pathway, thereby initiating transcellular Ca2+ transport across the PT. We further hypothesize that such a mechanism to increase Ca2+ transport plus the acidification of the PT luminal fluid together serves to prevent the nucleation of CaP stone at the LOH. We have the following specific aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 proposes to determine the mechanism of CSR-mediated Ca2+ entry/transport into PT cells by determining the role of CSR-TRPC3 signaling in Ca2+ entry/transport in PT cells using TRPC3 knockout (KO) mice and the pharmacological/genetic disruption of CSR-TRPC3 signaling. In Aim 2, we propose to study the Ca2+ entry/transport in vivo in TRPC3 KO mice, and to disrupt the phosphate and oxalate transport mechanism in TRPC3 KO mice by introducing in vivo siRNA application to PT to favor the process of CaP and CaP+CaOx stone formation at LOH. Finally, in Aim 3, we plan to rescue the phenotype (e.g., normalize [Ca2+] in urine) of TRPC3 KO mice and determine the role of increased [Ca2+] and pH in PT and its contribution to CaP stone formation by acidifying or alkalinizing the urine with or without inducing hypercalcemia in TRPC3 KO mice, and then measure the urine properties and degree of calcification/stone formation in LOH. Proposed aims will unravel novel mechanisms: i) the regulated transcellular Ca2+ transport in PT; and ii) maintenance of [Ca2+] in PT luminal fluid. Information gained will help to understand the formation of CaP stone that could potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies."
"9338309","Fabry disease, due to an inherited defect in the enzyme enzyme alpha galactosidase A, causes kidney  failure in most males and about 1 in 6 females with this disease by resulting in the accumulation of the  glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in lysozymes of kidney cells. Once kidney disease is  clinically manfest with substantial increases in urinary protein, treatment using enzyme replacement therapy  (ERT) frequently cannot stop progression towards kidney failure. Some cells in the filters of the kidney  (glomeruli) clear quickly including endothelial and mesangial cells. The podocytes (PC), on the outside of  the glomerular filter, are crucial for maintaining the filter's barrier to protein leakage into the urine and loss of  PC leads to scarring of glomeruli with resultant loss of filtering function and kidney failure. Unfortunately the  poorly replicating PC clear poorly of their GL-3 content with ERT. There are data supporting that earlier ERT  initiation may result in better PC GL-3 clearance with ERT. Delayed or inadequate (low ERT dose)  treatment, we posit, leads to PC injury and death, and when PC loss becomes critical, glomecular scarring.  Our aims are to 1) determine the effect of age on PC GL-3 content and PC numbers in males and females  with Fabry disease. 2) study the effects of age of ERT initiation, gender, duration of treatment and ERT dose  on PC and other renal cell GL-3 clearance in children and adults with Fabry disease. 3) evaluate the effects  age of initiation, gender duration and dose of ERT on PC foot process width, an important indicator of PC  injury and correlate of proteinura. 4) evaluate the effects of age of ERT initiation of ERT on PC number in  Fabry disease males. We will have access to the world's largest collection of kidney biopsies performed  before and at various times after ERT initiation in Fabry disease male and female adult and pediatric patients  with ERT given at variable dose and for variable duration. We have a world class renal morphometry  laboratory and will use quantitative electron microscopic measurement tools that we have developed to  accurately estimate the kidney structural variables mentioned above."

Kawut, MD, MS is a Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (Penn) who has committed his career to the research and care of patients with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). He heads a federally-funded research program based on the epidemiology and treatment of PVD and right ventricular dysfunction. He has also mentored more than fifty trainees to success in patient-oriented research (POR), resulting in publications and funding and in many cases their own independent academic careers. The candidate's immediate- and long-term career goals during this competitive renewal center on acquiring skills in performing comparative effectiveness research (CER) in rare PVDs and developing his mentorship abilities, specifically in transitioning his funded mentees to independence and in becoming mentors of their own trainees. The environment at Penn is ideal to develop the applicant as a mentor and to foster the academic growth of mentees in these areas.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease which affects people of all ages, leading to significant morbidity and a high risk of mortality. However, many questions about the study and therapeutic approach to PAH remain unanswered. The minimally important difference (MID) for the six-minute walk distance (6MWD) has not been clearly established in PAH. The use of the 6MWD in early phase studies and as a component of clinical outcomes makes this an important area of research even in the era of long-term studies in PAH. With the proliferation of new therapies for PAH, CER of different treatments in PAH in terms of health-related quality of life and clinical worsening is a major area of interest. Dr. Kawut is involved in two new initiatives which can address these critical questions in PAH and serve as training vehicles for himself and his mentees. First, the FDA has provided Dr. Kawut with individual patient-level data (IPD) from all submitted randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in PAH. Second, Dr. Kawut chairs the Steering Committee of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR), which is a prospective registry of newly-diagnosed patients with PAH at Pulmonary Hypertension Care Centers. We aim to derive and validate the MID in the change in 6MWD in PAH and to determine the comparative effectiveness of different drug classes on health-related quality of life and time to clinical worsening in patients with PAH.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to refine the conduct of RCTs and clinical care in PAH by validating the MID of the 6MWD and studying the comparative effectiveness of different treatment approaches. These aims provide not only training opportunities for the mentor, but also valuable training and research experiences for mentees at all levels. The opportunities for direct patient involvement in the CER being proposed and direct patient contact make this project ideal for this K24 renewal."
"9445572","PROJECT SUMMARY Fibroblast-like synoviocytes populate the synovial surfaces of the joints. They have critical roles in the maintenance of joint health and in the pathology of arthritic diseases. Our data suggest that the SOXC group of transcription factors are key players in implementing the pathological properties of fibroblast- like synoviocytes. SOXC proteins were previously shown to be critical for the survival of mesenchymal and neural progenitor cells that give rise in the embryo to multiple body structures, including the skeleton, heart, and nervous system. They were also shown to promote the proliferation, migration and invasive properties of many types of cancer cells. Our preliminary results suggest that SoxC genes contribute to the aggressive cancer cell-like behavior of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in arthritic diseases. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the biological activities of SOXC proteins in the fibroblast-like synoviocytes significantly contribute to the inflammation-mediated degeneration of articular cartilage and bones in arthritis and related joint diseases. Our primary goal is to determine whether the SoxC genes are involved in regulation of gene expression and cellular behavior of fibroblast-like synoviocytes that are under the stress of inflammation. We will then investigate the upstream molecular mechanisms that regulate the activities of SOXC proteins in fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Next, we will test whether blocking SOXC protein functions in fibroblast-like synoviocytes reduces joint degeneration in arthritic diseases. We anticipate that our new findings will lead to a more profound understanding of the molecular regulation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in joint pathologies. These new findings will likely impact the design of new, successful strategies for synovial fibroblast- based joint repair and regeneration therapies for patients suffering from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  "

"9401973","The long-term objective of this project is to develop a novel dual-targeting therapeutic strategy (MDM2 and NFAT1) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Patients with advanced breast cancer, especially those with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), cannot benefit from the recently-developed targeted therapies. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the dysfunction of several key signaling pathways, including NFAT1-MDM2 pathway, is associated with a poor prognosis and chemo-/radio-resistance, providing novel molecular targets for breast cancer therapy. The MDM2 oncogene is a major negative regulator of p53 and also has p53-independent oncogenic activity. It has been suggested to be a valid molecular target for breast cancer therapy. To date, the majority of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of MDM2 have been designed to block the binding of MDM2 to p53, and their anticancer activity was therefore dependent on the expression of wild-type p53 in the cancer cells. However, the majority of TNBC harbors mutant p53 and has high levels of MDM2, so the existing MDM2 SMIs are expected to have low or no efficacy against this subtype of breast cancer. Therefore, it is highly desirable to discover and develop novel MDM2 inhibitors that have direct effects on MDM2 and exert their anticancer activity independent of the p53 status of the cancer cells. The activation of NFAT1 is also commonly observed in breast cancers, especially in TNBC, promoting the development of an invasive, high-grade, and late-stage tumor phenotype. Therefore, the applicants propose NFAT1 as a novel target for the development of anti-breast cancer agents. Thus far, there has been no specific NFAT1 inhibitors developed for cancer therapy. Specific to this proposal, the applicants have recently discovered that NFAT1 up-regulates MDM2 expression and contributes to MDM2 overexpression in cancer cells and cancer tissues, including breast cancer. Based on newly-generated preliminary data, the applicants propose simultaneously targeting NFAT1 and MDM2 as a promising therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer. The applicants have recently accomplished a high-throughput screening of a natural product-based library, and have identified a series of disesquiterpenoid candidates with potent inhibitory effects on both NFAT1 and MDM2. One of the lead compounds, Japonicone A (JapA), has shown significant in vitro activity, in vivo efficacy, and minimal host toxicity in breast cancer models. Mechanistically, JapA directly binds to the MDM2 and NFAT1 proteins with high affinity, and induces MDM2 and NFAT1 protein instability. It also inhibits NFAT1-mediated MDM2 transcription by disrupting the binding of NFAT1 to the MDM2 P2 promoter. This first-in-class MDM2 inhibitor is distinct from all of the existing MDM2 inhibitors. In this revised proposal, the applicants will use JapA as a lead compound to test the central hypothesis that the dual targeting MDM2 and NFAT1 represents an effective and safe strategy for the treatment for advanced breast cancer. Three hypothesis-driven specific aims are proposed: 1) To demonstrate the therapeutic potential of JapA for advanced breast cancer; 2) To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which JapA elicits anti-breast cancer activity as a specific NFAT1-MDM2 dual inhibitor; and 3) To characterize the pharmacological and toxicological properties of JapA. Upon completion of the proposed studies, the anticipated results will provide critical information about the therapeutic efficacy and safety of JapA and the value of simultaneously targeting MDM2 and NFAT1 in breast cancer. This project is highly significant, has high translational potential, and will generate a novel clinical candidate for breast cancer therapy, which would have a major impact on patient care and public health."
"9374827","Project summary. The innate immune system plays an essential role in protecting host tissue function by eradicating pathogens and other foreign elements, promoting proper wound healing, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, dysregulated innate immune system activation resulting from aberrant self-directed immune responses can lead to states of chronic local inflammation that induce tissue damage or dysfunction. Chronic inflammatory diseases are often incurable, and therefore the current standard of care involves managing pain or fever via drugs that inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines or their receptors. Although effective, these treatment modalities can suppress immune system function and render patients susceptible to opportunistic infections. In contrast, natural resolution of inflammation is mediated in part by enzymes anchored to the cell membrane that convert immunostimulatory signals to an inactive, or in some cases immunosuppressive, form. For example, extracellular ATP (eATP) released by one?s own damaged or dying cells acts as a ?danger signal? that activates inflammation, and eATP immunostimulatory activity is locally regulated by membrane-anchored enzymes that dephosphorylate ATP to adenosine (Ado), an immunosuppressive signal. Inspired by these observations, an ATP dephosphorylating enzyme, apyrase, is currently investigated as an immunotherapeutic biologic, and has demonstrated efficacy for suppressing inflammation in pre-clinical models. However, clinical efficacy of soluble apyrase delivered via parenteral routes is likely to be hindered by the short effective half-life typical of biologic drugs. To address this limitation, the proposed research program will develop biomaterials with integrated ATP dephosphorylating enzymes as immunotherapeutics that can be locally delivered to specific tissue sites to suppress aberrant inflammation. Toward this end, the proposed research program will create hydrated polymeric gels (i.e. ?hydrogels?) of self- assembled peptide nanofibers with integrated enzymes that dephosphorylate ATP to Ado. Specifically, we will adapt our established platform, Co-Assembly Tags based on CHarge complementarity (?CATCH?), to create hydrogels harboring Adenosine Synthase A (AdsA), an enzyme that dephosphorylates ATP to Ado. Through this grant, we will (i) optimize CATCH-AdsA hydrogel enzymatic activity through material redesign, (ii) assess CATCH-AdsA hydrogel efficacy for immunomodulation using in vitro and in vivo models, and (iii) establish a pre-clinical safety profile for these biomaterials by assessing host innate and adaptive immune responses to CATCH hydrogels and their individual components. Success of the proposed research will lead to new biomaterials that can locally suppress inflammation via presentation of an immunomodulatory enzyme, which will provide the basis for future efforts to develop new immunotherapeutics to resolve chronic inflammation. More generally, a biomaterial platform with interchangeable integrated enzyme components is likely to enable new opportunities to harness natural enzymatic mechanisms to treat various immune-related pathologies."
"9539013","PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasing in all developed and developing countries, but the increase is especially severe in people of Mexican ancestry, whether in the US or in Mexico. It is understood that these increases are due in part to effects of excess or unhealthy nutrition, implying that variation in cardiometabolic disease risk may be due to variation in the capacity to manage a nutritional load. However, few studies have examined postprandial metabolism, where this variation should be most evident. Our colleagues in the GEMM Family Study (Genética de las Enfermedades Metabólicas en México, or Genetics of Metabolic Diseases in Mexico), a multi-center study conducted by 10 university-based teaching hospitals, have an ongoing recruitment of healthy urban adults who volunteer for a novel meal challenge. Each participant receives a mixed meal, representing a healthy combination of carbohydrate, fats, and protein, individually dosed as 30% of daily energy expenditure, and provides a timecourse series of blood and tissue biopsy samples at fasting and for 5 hours after the meal. In this study, we propose to conduct comprehensive molecular profiling, including conventional biochemical phenotypes in blood (insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, etc.) to define variation in postprandial response, plus comprehensive metabolomic profiling in blood and transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling in skeletal muscle, a key tissue for insulin response and utilization of carbohydrate and free fatty acids. We expect to characterize postprandial response at unprecedented resolution ? establishing individual trajectories of established and novel biomarkers of metabolic activity in blood and using combined ?omics? data to identify pathways and genes involved in postprandial response in muscle. We expect this information to help us define the range of variation in metabolic flexibility, and therefore the risk of cardiometabolic disease, in nominally healthy individuals. We further expect to identify novel biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk and to expand our knowledge of the biological mechanisms of metabolic flexibility, as a basis for novel approaches to preventing and treating these serious pathologies in a population at elevated risk of CVD and T2D. These findings should have a positive impact on public health initiatives for dealing with these serious conditions, both in Mexico and in the rapidly- growing Mexican American community."

"9382795","ABSTRACT  Most human cancers have chromosomal structural changes, and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are the major cause. Nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) is the major pathway for repairing DSBs, and NHEJ is sufficiently flexible that it can join any pair of DNA ends, regardless of their structure. The flexibility of NHEJ is essential because natural causes of DSBs (e.g., ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species, failed nuclear enzyme reactions) generate DNA ends with diverse molecular configurations. Hence, that flexibility is well suited for the task, but it has the negative impact of causing DNA sequence alterations at nearly all repair sites. NHEJ represents one of the most sophisticated protein:DNA interaction pathways because transiently there is no covalent connection between the two DNA ends. Although we know most of the proteins that participate in NHEJ and know, in broad terms, how they function, we do not have a clear picture of their spatial and temporal interactions, or how some components are required for some NHEJ events but not others, depending on the DNA end molecular configuration. With a clearer mechanistic and structural picture of human NHEJ, we will be in a position to develop small molecule inhibitors that may be useful for treating many cancers (e.g., chemotherapeutically or as a radiation sensitizer). Aim 1 describes our innovative steps toward elucidating the structure of the Artemis:DNA-PKcs:Ku complex. Though a few individual proteins in the complex have known structures (e.g., Ku and portions of DNA-PKcs), we want to understand how different assemblies of the NHEJ proteins, such as Ku, DNA-PKcs, and Artemis, are needed to repair the various DNA end molecular configurations that arise in the cell. Aims 2A and 2B describe our ability to directly follow the chemical steps of NHEJ using purified proteins and our ability to dissect which steps are critical for each type of DNA end configuration. Aim 2C and 2D determine how wrapping the DNA duplex around histone octamers (mononucleosomes) affects the NHEJ joining mechanism and chemistry of the steps. Aim 3 examines the noncovalent approximation (synapsis) of the two DNA ends during NHEJ, which is optimally studied using sm-FRET. Aim 3A determines the extent to which the synapsis step (approximiation of the two DNA ends) determines the overall rate of NHEJ. Aim 3B uses sm-FRET to test whether nucleosomal DNA can be synapsed by NHEJ proteins. Aim 4 describes our innovative development of small molecule inhibitors of Artemis, which is an essential nuclease for resolving DNA repair intermediates due to damage from ionizing radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors (both of which are used therapeutically). A high throughput screen of 433,000 compounds has identified 20 compounds that merit further study, and a subset satisfy a highly stringent human cellular bioselectivity test in which a specific half of the reaction products are blocked without affecting the other half or DNA metabolism."

"9551739","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prions are infectious, self-propagating protein aggregates that were first described in the context of a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which afflict humans and other mammals. The protein culprit in the case of the TSEs is an endogenous protein called PrP that has an inherent ability to undergo a dramatic conformational conversion, leading to the formation of distinctive cross-? aggregates (termed amyloid) that are both self-templating and infectious. Prions have also been uncovered in budding yeast and other fungi, where they act as protein-based genetic elements that confer new phenotypes on those cells that harbor them. Like PrP, fungal prion proteins exist in either a native, soluble form or a self-perpetuating, amyloid form (the prion form) that is infectious. Involved in diverse cellular processes, fungal prion proteins can, in their prion forms, enhance cell survival under specific stress conditions. Although prion proteins are widely distributed throughout the fungal kingdom, it is not yet known if they exist in the bacterial domain of life. The foundation for the proposed research is our recent demonstration that E. coli cells can propagate a model yeast prion in a manner that depends on the activity of a conserved cellular chaperone assembly that is also required for prion propagation in yeast. These findings indicate that the basic requirements for protein-based heredity are satisfied in the bacterial domain of life, suggesting that prion-like phenomena may predate the evolutionary split between bacteria and yeast. The proposed research will address this hypothesis through the development of tools and approaches for uncovering prion-like proteins in bacteria, while at the same time investigating the determinants that dictate protein amyloidogenicity. In aim 1, we will systematically investigate the chaperone requirements for prion propagation in E. coli. In aim 2, we will screen bacterially encoded polypeptides for amyloidogenicity, as a means to identify candidate prion-like proteins and also to generate an unbiased experimental data set for evaluating the steric zipper model for protein amyloidogenicity. In aim 3, we will develop and implement a complementary set of approaches to detect prion-like phenomena in bacteria. Together, the proposed experiments will enable a deeper understanding of the cellular requirements for prion formation and propagation, will help elucidate the intrinsic determinants of protein amyloidogenicity and will facilitate the discovery f new protein-based epigenetic sources of phenotypic diversity in the bacterial domain of life."
"9354445","As more Americans of all ages use smartphone and web-based technology to manage their lives, there is increased pressure to use digital media to bring health care services to patients. While many software companies develop attractive and sophisticated apps, the development of apps grounded in evidence and behavioral science theory lags behind. The (BITS) Core will create an infrastructure that will bring together those with diabetes specific knowledge and skills and people who can develop, evaluate, and deploy digital technologies. Vanderbilt currently has a critical mass of clinical, translational, and behavioral scientists who have external funding to develop and test web-based and mobile technologies that will enhance diabetes self- management and health-related behavior change. Three units are proposed within this core. Unit 1 will work with junior and senior investigators to develop innovative, evidence-based mobile and web applications that take advantage of cutting edge technology and that are firmly grounded in best practices in clinical management and behavior change. Unit 2 will work with investigators to find ways to leverage their developed applications into productive pathways to additional research funding and publications. Vanderbilt, with the largest biomedical informatics department in the nation, is rich with resources to support these efforts including the StarBRITE research portal, the Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translation Research (VICTR) studio system for giving scientists constructive feedback on all phases of their research study, VICTR community engagement studies which provide feedback from patient and community experts, a number of expert industry consultants, and the REDCap platform. Unit 3 will provide training and professional development to support young investigators interested in integrating mobile and web technologies into their developing research programs. To accomplish this, we will offer a two-day national conference to funded NIDDK Junior investigators with sessions covering the full range of design, implementation, and deployment problems associated with successful use of these technologies. The core will have clear criteria for identifying users, will screen projects to prevent funding overlap, will monitor delivery of services, and will deliver these services through the existing VICTR system of StarBRITE and studio sessions. The BITS core addresses the growing need to bring scientists and developers together to create tools that improve patient care, reduce risk of complications, improve quality of life, and provide high quality data for research."

"9356816","Core C: In-Vivo Imaging of Mucus Obstruction and Clearance Non-invasive imaging of the lung is an integral part of clinical projects 3 and 4 for the grant proposal ?Development of Novel Mucolytic Therapies for Lung Disease?. It is widely recognized that reduced lung function is associated with compromised clearance of mucus from the airways surface and mucus accumulation/plugging in the airways for both cystic fiibrosis and asthma. The ability to image the slowing of mucociliary and cough clearance by 2D gamma scintigraphy and the effects of mucus obstruction by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of fluorine 19 gas ventilation provides the clinical projects with powerful tools to assess the efficacy of new mucolytics. The goals of the in-vivo imaging core are to provide 1) measurements of mucociliary and cough clearance (MCC/CC) by gamma scintigraphy, 2) assessment of radio-particle deposition and clearance heterogeneity, 3) quantitative measures of pulmonary function on a regional basis, and 4) direct evaluation of lung ventilation through 19F MRI ventilation imaging. Baseline and post mucolytic treatment MCC/CC rates will be measured in CF and asthmatic patients by 2D gamma scintigraphy of inhaled/deposited radiolabeled (Tc99m) sulfur colloid particles on the bronchial airway surface. In the same patients 19F MRI will provide the ability to detect lobar changes in ventilation kinetics through a wash-in and wash-out phase of inhaled gas with high sensitivity. Demonstrating the potential of the 19F technique may contribute to its utility for evaluating airway diseases. In combination these two imaging modalities may provide new, sensitive regional measures of disease and heterogeneity of mucus accumulation that may be modified by novel mucolytics."
"9353887","PROJECT SUMMARY: Eukaryotic growth is regulated by TOR, a kinase that is activated by amino acids and glucose and then broadly promotes anabolism, including protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. TOR dysregulation causes or contributes to an array of human diseases, including cancer, obesity, viral infections, diabetes, aging, and neurodegeneration. TOR signaling is under intense investigation among yeast and animal cell biologists, who seek to characterize the mechanisms that control TOR signaling networks in order to develop treatments to fine-tune TOR activity as therapies for human diseases. Much less is known about the TOR signaling network in the other major eukaryotic lineage, plants. This project uses a combination of genetic, biochemical, genomic, and proteomic approaches to pursue my recent groundbreaking discovery of an amino acid sensor that activates TOR in plant cells. No amino acid sensors have been previously characterized in plants, although amino acids are the primary form of nitrogen found in many natural soils, and amino acids are the primary transported form of nitrogen between organs in most plant species. Understanding how plants sense and respond to nitrogen is a top priority for plant molecular biologists, because global crop yields rely massively on heavy use of environmentally-harmful and expensive petrochemical fertilizers. This proposed investigation of a nitrogen sensor that activates TOR will enable intelligent breeding efforts to produce crops that are able to generate high crop yields in low nitrogen environments by modulating plants' nitrogen sensing mechanisms. The first specific aim of this project is to first determine how nitrogen sources affect TOR activity, and then to confirm that the proposed amino acid sensor, an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, does act upstream of TOR signaling. The second aim of this project is to use powerful contemporary proteomic techniques to identify proteins that interact with TOR and/or the proposed nitrogen sensor to control nitrogen-mediated TOR activation using powerful proteomic techniques. Finally, the role of the proposed nitrogen sensor in plant development, crop yields, and responses to environmental nitrogen sources will be explored in several of the most important global crop species. With this innovative approach to exploring how amino acid sensing mechanisms have evolved with TOR signaling in eukaryotes, this project will simultaneously advance understanding of how plants coordinate growth and development with nitrogen availability, and provide original insights into amino acid-TOR networks that will benefit biomedical studies of TOR cell biology in humans."
"9348427","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, and leads to symptoms in all muscle types, in the form of skeletal muscle wasting, cardiac arrhythmias, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. A multi-systemic disease, DM also commonly affects the central nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems. DM is caused by expanded CTG or CCTG repeats, which are transcribed into RNA, sequestering the Muscleblind- like (MBNL) RNA binding proteins and titrating them away from their normal mRNA targets. CUG repeat expression also leads to hyper-phosphorylation of the CUGBP/ ELAV-like factors (CELFs), resulting in CELF protein elevation. Dysregulation of MBNLs and CELFs causes hundreds of changes to the transcriptome, including many changes in alternative splicing. To date, the full spectrum of transcriptome changes in DM remains uncharacterized, and it is unknown whether MBNL and CELF perturbation can fully account for those changes. Furthermore, the molecular causes of only a few DM symptoms have been discovered. Another cellular process mediated by the MBNL proteins is RNA localization. Subcellular localization of RNA is important for numerous cellular and physiological processes, including cell motility, embryonic patterning, and synaptic function. However, our understanding of RNA localization remains restricted to a small subset of transcripts, and we lack a molecular parts list for how RNA localization is achieved. Identification of these players will reveal the extent to which RNA mis-localization contributes to pathology in DM and other diseases. Therefore, we will systematically characterize transcriptome changes in DM and assess the extent to which MBNL and CELF per- turbation can explain these changes in DM transcriptomes (Aim 1). We will define a parts list for RNA localization, including cis- and trans- elements, and elucidate how these players control subcellular distribution of RNAs (Aim 2). We will study how changes in all steps of gene expression, including splicing, RNA localization, and translation, may be linked to DM phenotypes, and develop therapeutic approaches to correct these changes (Aim 3). Together, completion of this work will further our understanding of the molecular changes in DM, a paradigm for diseases of RNA toxicity, lay the groundwork for better understanding RNA localization, and help connect these molecular events to physiology."
"9379014","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the University of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and University of Pittsburgh (UPCI) Ovarian Cancer SPORE is to reduce the morbidity and mortality of ovarian cancer through innovative translational research. It includes four individual research projects, four supportive cores, and research and career development programs. This proposal brings together basic and applied investigators to conduct innovative and diverse translational investigations aimed at risk stratification, treatment of primary and recurrent ovarian cancer, and prevention of relapse in patients in remission. The four projects have been carefully designed to have significant potential to change clinical practice paradigms in ovarian cancer within five years. The theme of the program uniquely reflects immune based approaches in the etiology, prognosis and treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. The proposed projects will: 1) Test a novel therapeutic strategy to break indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated immune tolerance in ovarian cancer, while inducing anti-tumor-specific immunity in patients in second remission (Project 1); 2) Test a combinatorial strategy of mTOR inhibition and IL-21 for ex-vivo conditioning of antigen stimulated CD8+ T cells for effector and memory functional attributes; and test whether the ex vivo generated cells produce durable immunity against ovarian tumor in a clinical trial (Project 2); 3) Test whether autologous tumor-loaded type-1-polarized dendritic cells (?DC1s) will generate CTLs capable of recognizing ovarian cancer in either MHC class I-restricted- or MHC class l-unrestricted fashion; when used both as a vaccine and for adoptive T cell therapy (Project 3); Determine the predictive significance of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which have strong immunosuppressive properties in the long term survival of ovarian cancer patients (Project 4). Each project addresses at least one of the translational areas outlined in the SPORE guidelines and together, the program addresses the translational pathways defined by the Translational Research Working Group. Four Cores will support these projects: Administration, Biospecimen, Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Immune Monitoring. The Developmental Research Program will support a pathway for continued identification and support of diverse research that could replace or improve current projects, and a Career Development Program will recruit and support candidates committed to training in translational research in ovarian cancer. The Developmental Research Program and the Career Developmental Program will provide a framework to mentor young investigators to develop careers in ovarian cancer translational research, and to fertilize testing of high risk, potentiall paradigm changing projects with translational potential."
"9341358","ABSTRACT  Alexander's disease (AxD) is a fatal leukodystrophy caused by mutation in the gene encoding glial fibrillary  acidic protein (GFAP). Pathologically, AxD is characterized by reactive gliosis, upregulation of GFAP, and  accumulation of Rosenthal fibers. AxD is associated with early and progressive loss of neurons and  oligodendrocytes. Understanding how an astrocyte specific genetic defect of a non-essential intermediary  filament, can so severely influence neuronal function, is critical to developing therapeutic strategies. We  believe that the discovery of a brain-wide interstitial clearance system in CNS - the glymphatic system - driven  by astrocytes and dependent upon the astrocytic water channel, AQP4, could begin to address this question.  This novel clearance path subserves a function homologous to the lymphatics, which in other organs is  essential for the clearance of extracellular proteins. We propose that glymphatic flow comprises an important  pathway by which GFAP and its proteolytic products can be cleared, but that the formation of Rosenthal fibers,  or the toxic effects of GFAP oligomers, and consequent disruption of astroglial cytoarchitecture in AxD result in  the mislocation of AQP4, and the consequent failure of glymphatic flow. This in turn leads to reactive changes  in affected astroglia, which further increase the transcription of mutated GFAP in a feed-forward process that  accelerates both Rosenthal fiber accumulation, and effectively abrogates glymphatic flow, inexorably extending  AxD pathology to all cell types and regions within the affected brain.   Aim 1 will be to evaluate the contribution of the glymphatic system to the physiological clearance of  soluble GFAP in wild type mice using several alternative approaches, including in vivo 2-photon imaging, ex  vivo mapping of fluorescently-tagged GFAP distribution at defined time-points, quantitative measurement of  radiolabeled GFAP clearance, microdialysis combined with ELISA detecting of endogenous GFAP,  immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Aim 2 will characterize the impact of AxD in Gfap+/R236H mice on  glymphatic GFAP clearance and manipulate glymphatic clearance by inducible, astrocyte-specific deletion of  AQP4 in juvenile AxD transgenic mice. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that increasing glymphatic clearance in  Gfap+/R236H mice by inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) will reduce Rosenthal fiber burden and  delay age-related impairment of cognitive function.   To our knowledge, these studies represent the first analysis of GFAP clearance on an organ level and  the first systematic analysis of how AxD affects this clearance pathway. We hope that the experiments will  provide fundamentally new insights into the role of glymphatic GFAP clearance on reactive gliosis and  Rosenthal fiber burden and thereby define novel targets for treatment of this grave disease."
"9544551","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-congenital aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease most commonly found in the elderly that results in death if left untreated. Transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has now become a treatment option among these older individuals not considered surgical candidates, and with the aging of the population, more patients will likely be undergoing treatment. With the reduction in mortality after TAVR, the question is how normalization of blood flow across the aortic valve might also benefit the brain. There is converging evidence from our lab and others that high-grade carotid artery stenosis and late-stage congestive heart failure can compromise cerebral auto regulation, resulting in cognitive impairment, and that improving cerebral hemodynamics can improve cognition. To date, however, there has been no direct measurement of the impact of AS on intracerebral hemodynamics. With the increasing recognition that vascular factors play a crucial role in the development of dementia, we propose to assess the potential cerebral hemodynamic and cognitive impact of AS, and we hypothesize that if there is restoration of normal cerebral blood flow after TAVR, then there will be a significant improvement in cognition. The reversibility of impaired cognition would expand consideration of TAVR beyond its systemic benefit. In this pilot project, we propose to recruit 78 TAVR patients from Columbia's Center for Interventional Vascular Therapy and 40 in whom TAVR will be delayed. All subjects will undergo baseline transcranial Doppler using measures of mean cerebral blood flow velocity (mCBFV) and vasomotor reactivity (VMR). There will also be cognitive assessment with a 50-min battery to evaluate processing speed, memory, attention, executive function and memory demonstrated to be most sensitive to the effects of diffuse hypoperfusion. After thirty days, both patients after TAVR and controls will return for follow-up TCD and cognitive testing to ascertain the potential gains of intervention, with an exploratory assessment of quality of life at baseline, 30-days and 90 days. Successful elucidation of the relationship between aortic valve disease and cerebral hemodynamics, in conjunction with the impact on cognition, will provide the impetus to progress to a larger study to determine if we can develop a risk stratification model for TAVR based on neurological and neurocognitive status. With the strong likelihood that TAVR will be extended to intermediate risk patients, they may have an even greater potential for cerebral hemodynamic recovery and cognitive improvement, and prevention of cognitive decline.

"9388807","PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the biological underpinnings of variation in social ?wanting?, or lack thereof, in individuals with ASD could open important areas for intervention. Despite solid evidence-based approaches for improving social functioning in ASD, the majority of high-functioning adults with ASD remain isolated, with outcome studies consistently noting little or no motivation to achieve relationships. Yet contrary to Kanner's original hypothesis that autism is a ubiquitous ?deficit in affective contact?, contemporary studies find extraordinary variation in social behavior in ASD, with preservation of typical attachment behaviors, social cognition, and social knowledge in many. Social neuroscience has revealed the importance of central nervous system dopamine interactions with other systems such as neuropeptide signaling in normal social function, but dopamine's role has not been carefully probed in people with ASD. This project proposes a proof of mechanism study to test the hypothesis that individual differences in dopaminergic tone will help reveal differences in social motivation, and that modification of dopaminergic tone will impact social ?wanting? and social reward responsivity. We plan to enroll a sample of high-functioning adolescents and young adults with ASD who will be receiving a 16-week social skills training program. We will examine differences in indices at multiple levels of social motivation and social reward, from: 1) neural reward circuit activation; 2) physiologic responses; 3) affective responses to social interaction; and 4) social interest and enjoyment, at pre-treatment, and during the placebo-controlled administration of a dopamine agonist. This project is synergistic with other Center components, obtaining common measures of reward responsivity in Project 3, applying shared Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core measures, and collecting biospecimens for combined genetic and other analyses, enabling broader investigations of heterogeneity across age and gender. Project results will yield a definitive ?Yes? or ?No? confirmation of dopamine as a possible treatment target for social dysfunction in ASD. !"

"9232230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to understand how brains generate behavior both in normal and pathological situations relies on our understanding of the neural computations carried out by behavioral circuits. The nature of chemical communication between neurons is determined by the specific neurotransmitters released onto postsynaptic targets and it was thought for many years that neurons released a single type of transmitter onto all their targets. In recent years, however, it has become clear that key neurons in vertebrate and invertebrate circuits involved in addiction, memory formation, feeding behavior and reproduction contain neurons that violate this rule, releasing multiple neurotransmitters. In this proposal we develop genetic tools to allow mapping of the distribution of specific neurotransmitter release sites in single neurons in multiple colors by modifying the endogenous genetic loci of vesicular transporters for neurotransmitter with fluorescent proteins. This allows both accurate and complete accounting of transmitter release sites since the marker's generation and turnover rely on processes that control the presence of the endogenous protein. Single cell resolution is obtained via an intersectional version of this strategy in which split fluorescent proteins become reconstituted only in specific cells. There is no current technique in any system which can provide this level of resolution. This technology will provide the ability to determine, in complex neurons releasing several chemical substances, the spatial distribution of each of the chemicals and its relationship to downstream targets of that neuron. It will also allow the mapping of temporal changes, either developmental or plasticity-induced, in neurotransmitter release. The technique is developed initially for use in Drosophila, a model organism which has been immensely important for our understanding of both the genetic and circuit basis of behavior, but as a general strategy can also be adapted for use in mammalian brain."
"9364670","Project Summary/Abstract Adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) represent an underserved segment of the US population with a high prevalence of obesity, obesity related chronic disease, and limited options for weight management. We have demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss of 6.4% and 7.0% in 2 trials in adults with IDD using an enhanced Stop Light Diet (eSLD) in combination with monthly at-home face-to-face (FTF) behavioral sessions (adult/caregiver), and a recommendation for increased physical activity (PA). The eSLD recommended daily consumption of 2 ~ 200 kcal portion-controlled entrées, 2 ~100 kcal shakes, 5 servings of fruits/vegetables, and ad-libitum non-caloric beverages and additionally low energy foods selected using the SLD system: green (low energy), yellow (moderate energy), and red (high energy). Although this intervention produced significant weight loss, the time and cost associated with FTF delivery (travel + sessions) limits the potential for scaling and implementation, and suggests the need for the evaluation of less costly and burdensome strategies for intervention delivery. Therefore, we propose a 24 mo. randomized trial to compare 2 weight management interventions (6 mos. weight loss, 12 mos. maintenance, 6 mos. no-contact follow-up) delivered to adults with IDD in their home, either remotely (RD) using video conferencing (Zoom software) on a tablet computer (iPad mini), or during FTF visits. Both intervention arms will include individual monthly at-home behavioral sessions (participant & caregiver), an eSLD, and increased PA. The RD arm will include group PA (2 session/wk.) delivered using video conferencing and will use commercially available web-based applications for self-monitoring/participant feedback for diet (Lose it!), PA (Fitbit activity tracker), and weight (Wi-Fi scales). The FTF arm will be identical to the intervention shown to be effective in our previous trial (DK83539) and will include self-directed PA, self-monitoring of diet and PA using paper and pencil self-reports, and weight assessed during monthly home visits. The primary aim will determine whether RD is non-inferior to FTF for weight loss (0-6 mos.). Non-inferiority will be declared if mean weight loss for RD is no worse than FTF, within statistical variability, by a margin of -3 kg. Secondarily we will compare the RD and FTF groups on mean weight loss, the proportion of participants who achieve clinically meaningful weight loss, and changes in quality of across 24 months. We will also conduct cost, cost-effectiveness and contingent valuation analyses to compare the RD and FTF groups. We will also explore the influence of behavioral session attendance, compliance to recommendations for diet (energy intake, number of entrées/shakes, servings of fruits/vegetables, PA (min of moderate-vigorous PA), self-monitoring of diet and PA, sex, age, IDD diagnosis, caregiver self-efficacy/turnover, and obesogenic medications on weight loss across 18 months."
"9345369","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical Science and Engineering PhDs are faced with a dwindling number of faculty openings, and therefore, an increasing proportion of trainees conduct research in non-academic venues such as the private sector and the government, and yet another substantial number pursue non-research careers in the broad health and life sciences industry. Predoctoral and postdoctoral training programs provide little formal training for nonacademic jobs, and faculty trainers poorly understand the non-academic paths themselves. Biomedical PhDs are therefore unaware of the opportunities that may exist outside of academia, and lack many professional skills that sought after in these sectors of the job market. To address these gaps, we will establish the Rutgers Interdisciplinary Job Opportunities for Biomedical Scientists (iJOBs) program, open to predoctoral, postdoctoral, and recent Rutgers alumni in all biomedical sciences and engineering disciplines. For trainees, the iJOBS program begins with site visits to partnering companies and monthly networking events with working professionals to learn about various professional options. Participants then receive formal training via courses and shadowing experiences in core professional skills (such as communications, performance management, and team building) and in one of five professional tracks of their choice: i) science and health policy, ii) business management, iii) intellectual property management, iv) clinical and regulatory sciences, and v) health and science data analysis. Each participant is assigned a professional mentorship pod consisting of their research faculty advisor, iJOBS program faculty member, and an external mentor from industry, who assist the trainee through their individual Professional Development Plan. Several months prior to graduation, trainees work jointly with iJOBS staff and Rutgers Career Services for application package development and interview skill support, participation in career fairs and assistance with job placement. Finally, employed alumni of the program are invited to give back by providing mentoring and shadowing opportunities to current trainees. An external assessor will evaluate the program on an ongoing basis using data provided by trainees, faculty, and external mentors to determine its strengths and weaknesses. Simultaneously, the assessor will monitor changes in the supply and demand needs for PhD graduates, so that the program activities and areas of concentration can be adapted to the constantly evolving job market. Workforce data and iJOBS best practices will be disseminated to educate our faculty about the changing needs of our students and postdoctoral fellows. We will also disseminate this information nationally by publishing research articles and opinion pieces, collaborating with other existing BEST programs, and holding annual symposia to encourage dialogue among other universities and the bio-industry. The iJOBs program will enable flexible and informative exploration of careers outside of academia by trainees, and strive to increase cooperation between academia and industry so that a new workforce model for biomedical trainees can emerge."

INSTITUTIONAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed UCLA CTSI KL2 grant involves partnerships between UCLA, Charles R. Drew University, Cedars Sinai and LA Biomed, building upon long-standing relationships of jointly training research fellows and junior clinical investigators. Deeply committed to rigorous translational science training, these institutions have been highly successful in developing outstanding scientists through exemplary mentoring, innovative project- based learning, and a wide array of formal didactic opportunities. In this proposal, we propose to build upon the success of our educational and training programs with several innovative additions to the KL2 Program. The KL2 program objectives are to: 1) Enhance career development and research training support for junior investigators in translational science; 2) Provide a flexible, supportive environment to meet the needs of a diverse group of Scholars; 3) Facilitate and improve mentorship through new mentorship training programs; 4) Leverage institutional support and matching funds to expand the KL2 program for additional institutional K Scholars; 5) Foster collaborative research, promote leadership, and encourage entrepreneurship and development of intellectual property among our Scholars and other junior investigators; 6) Improve the recruitment, career development support, mentoring programs, and funding support for women and minority faculty; 7) Provide structured oversight of educational and training needs for all junior investigators. The KL2 Program will select 3 junior faculty (assistant professor or equivalent) per year and provide 3 years of support at 75% effort. We will recruit and train the most promising and diverse junior faculty in a range of disciplines related to translational research. With institutional funds, we will supplement the program with additional institutional career development awards for highly qualified junior faculty. All KL2 Scholars will participate in the KL2 Core Curriculum, which will also be available to other junior faculty with a NIH K or equivalent award. The Core Curriculum includes strong mentorship with a team of senior scientists, training in team science and communication of science, mentorship training in our a ?daisy-chain? mentoring program, seminars in career development, and training in the responsible conduct of research. KL2 Scholars will also be assigned a K to R studio in which a panel of senior faculty will meet regularly with the Scholar to provide grant writing guidance for the Scholar's transition to an R01 award.

"9352379","Administration Component  The Administrative Core is responsible for setting the overall direction of the NeuroLINCS center and for ensuring that the resources and components of the Center are optimally utilized. The successful development and evolution of the NeuroLINCS center requires strong interactions between the leaders and co-leaders of each Component and of the center as a whole. Hence, the NeuroLINCS Administrative Component plays a vital role in facilitating these interactions. Moreover, the Administrative Component and its personnel provide the necessary administrative and fiscal oversight to ensure that the NeuroLINCS center is run efficiently. The NeuroLINCS center involves 5 principal sites with defined responsibilities of growing, differentiating and generating new induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs), performing data generation assays on human brain cells made from iPSCs in response to perturbagens, performing basic analyses and developing cell signatures through integrated data analysis .methods, and establish community interactions. An integrated and highly collaborative group of investigators with expertise in stem cell biology, IPS cells, quantitative molecular phenotyping (omics and single cell imaging) and bioinformatics will work closely together to generate significant and highly predictive cell signatures. The PIs of the NeuroLINCS center are Steven Finkbeiner (Gladstone), Ernest Frankel (MIT), Jeffrey Rothstein (JHU), Clive Svendsen (Cedars) and Leslie Thompson (UCI), who will serve as leaders and co-leaders of components. Each Component has identified co-investigators/collaborators/consultants appropriate for the planned scientific investigations. Component leaders and co-leaders will also be active participants in NeuroLINCS consortium working groups as they are developed to address specific issues. Results of the genetic, proteomic and other characterization conducted by consortium labs will provide important feedback for further enhancement of induction and differentiation protocols and related methodologies and it is anticipated that this collaborative and iterative approach will lead to the broadest success for the study. An Evaluation Program within the NeuroLINCS is in place to determine if the programs supported are meeting the needs of the research community, are efficiently managed, and demonstrably effective and annual objectives and milestones."
"9150662","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Due to limited resources, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been unable to implement World Health Organization (WHO) models for improving depression outcomes, in which community health workers (CHWs) deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other psychological treatments. We will develop and evaluate an mHealth intervention that can increase the reach and effectiveness of mental health care in LMICs. Building on our established foundation of collaborative mHealth research in Bolivia, we will develop and test AniMóvil, a scalable mHealth service designed to monitor patients' depressive symptoms and deliver tailored behavioral activation messages derived from CBT principles. In Aim 1, we will collaborate with Bolivian mental health professionals, potential CHWs, and people with depression to develop AniMóvil's mHealth components, including automated phone (IVR)- and text message (SMS)-based patient monitoring and psychoeducation, plus smartphone resources that will enable CHWs to deliver brief, structured CBT by telephone. Patients' depressive symptoms and CBT skill-practice will be reported weekly via IVR, and patients will receive tailored behavioral activation messages during those calls. Patients will report their mood daily via SMS and receive reinforcement and follow-up based on those reports. Patients with severe depression will be stepped up to receive a minimum of 3 CHW-delivered telephone CBT sessions. CHWs will use smartphone tools to: access information about CBT training, manage appointments and clinical records, share information with one another and their supervisor regarding challenging cases, and request supervisory consults. In Aim 2, we will conduct a randomized trial among 114 depressed patients to determine the impact of AniMóvil on depression-related outcomes. Patients will be randomized to the intervention or an enhanced control condition in which they receive written materials and report daily mood information via automated SMS. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with remitted depression at 3 months. SMS daily mood reports in both arms will be a key secondary outcome. The trial includes an evaluation of intervention processes such as use of mHealth tools by patients and CHWs, and program costs. By emphasizing collaborative engagement with Bolivian co-investigators, we will increase their capacity for independent mHealth scientific discovery. If effective, AniMóvil could improve population-based mental health care in LMICs, as well as the efficiency and quality of CHW training and supervision for delivering WHO-recommended treatments. Evidence from this study will directly inform decision-making by the Bolivian Ministry of Mental Health regarding national scale-up and financial sustainability. Results also will guide the design of larger effectiveness trials and international dissemination efforts. By combining SMS/IVR monitoring and patient activation with smartphone support for CHWs and supervisors, Animóvil can serve as a prototype for mHealth services that increase access to care management for LMIC patients with other high priority non-communicable diseases."
"9389988","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is among the deadliest cancers worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of ~30% in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and ~50% in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). It is a rare cancer, affecting ~8,500 (5,500 ICC, 3000 ECC) patients in the U.S. each year. Often cancers develop from an imbalance between signals that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. While most advances in cancer therapy have been made by inhibition of cell proliferation, the re-establishment of cell differentiation has resulted in the cure of certain forms of leukemia. In this proposal, we will focus on the interaction between hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4?), the master regulator of hepatic differentiation, and the Wnt/?- catenin signaling pathway, which enhances cell proliferation. We will use zebrafish for our studies, which has advantages as a model organism because of in vivo imaging, time resolution, and chemical screening methods not available or feasible in rodent models. Importantly, zebrafish display disease morphology and pathophysiology that is similar to mammals. We hypothesize that an HNF4?/?-catenin interaction is important in hepatobiliary development playing an important role cell fate during both development and cholangiocarcinoma formation. Our first aim is to characterize and define the importance of HNF4?/?-catenin interaction in regard to hepatobiliary development. We have recently generated novel HNF4? knockout zebrafish and are in the process of generating a heat shock-inducible HNF4? over-expression zebrafish. These models will allow us to not only define the role of HNF4? in hepatobiliary development, but, in combination with genetic and pharmacologic models of Wnt/?-catenin modulation, will allow us to characterize an interaction between these two pathways. We will use these mutants and and chemical modulators to characterize liver growth, morphology, and physiology during hepatobiliary development and assess perturbations in normal hepatic and biliary cell fate. Our second aim is to determine a role for the HNF4?/?- catenin interaction in cholangiocarcinoma formation. We will first characterize tumor incidence, progression, and mortality in zebrafish with mutations resulting in dysregulation of the HNF4?/?-catenin pathway. Further, we will utilize both genetic and pharmacologic means to re-establish a normal HNF4?/?-catenin interaction and observe changes in tumor burden. These studies will not only reveal novel mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma pathogenesis, but also will allow us to develop new targets for therapeutic development for this devastating disease."
"9340121","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The characteristics of health systems and the environment they operate in affect the effective implementation of patient centered outcome research (PCOR) practices. This, in turn, influences the quality of healthcare patients receive. Yet little is known about the specific characteristics of health systems today that make them more effective at delivering high quality patient care, in part because so much has changed within health care systems due to recent innovations and new models of patient care. The fundamental purpose of the Data Core is to support the work being conducted within the RAND-Penn State Center of Excellence, which is focused on identifying key attributes of health care systems that are likely to be important for successful implementation of PCOR practices and, hence, improved patient outcomes. The data core will accomplish this in two main ways. First, it will focus on collecting, improving, and analyzing primary and secondary data in five regions so as to assist Center investigators with the identification and testing of key characteristics of health systems that may be associated with improved patient outcomes. Second, through this research, the Data Core will develop a novel taxonomy of health systems that can be used to classify health care systems and identify those that are highly effective in implementing PCOR practices.          The Data Core also will provide the essential infrastructure for maximizing the efficiency, consistency and quality of the data operations and research conducted throughout the Center of Excellence. This will be accomplished by minimizing unnecessary duplication of effort involved with cleaning data, creating measures, constructing data files, and resolving difficult methodological problems. The Data Core will help to facilitate sharing of information and metrics useful for analyses across the component projects and other investigators in the field."

"9331449","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of adverse events such as surgical site infections and surgical errors are a huge problem in the operating room (OR) due to the high vulnerability of the patient and the complex interactions required between providers of different disciplines and a range of equipment, technology and the physical space where care is provided.  Two to five percent of all patients who undergo an operation will develop a surgical site infection leading to significant mortality and morbidity.  Distractions and interruptions are major causes of medical errors during surgery and often lead to serious patient harm.  While significant efforts to improve patient safety have been focused on enhancing skills and training for surgical staff, little effort has been directed at the environment in which healthcare provider work.          The overreaching goal of the proposed 'Realizing Improved Patient Care through Human-Centered Design in the OR' (RIPCHD.OR) learning lab is to develop an evidence-based framework and methodology for the design and operation of a general surgical operating room to improve safety.  RIPCHD.OR will use a multidisciplinary human-centered approach incorporating evidence based design, human factors and systems engineering principles.          Clemson University will collaborate with the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the Health Sciences South Carolina (HSSC) to develop the RIPCHD.OR learning lab.  The design, process and technology solutions that emerge from this learning lab will be implemented and tested in the new MUSC Ambulatory Surgery Center in Charleston, SC.          Three highly interrelated and integrated patient safety focused projects related to key aspects of OR suite design will be undertaken over the course of four years:          Project 1: Unmasking of anesthesia related alarms and communications     Project 2: Understanding traffic flows and door openings in the OR     Project 3: Integrated OR suite design"
"9493041","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma affects 5% of the world population. In the U.S., asthma death rates are four-fold higher in Latinos and African Americans compared to Whites. Childhood asthma is a complex disease historically defined by partially overlapping clinical features. However, the heterogeneity observed in clinical disease and airway pathology suggests that the standard definition of asthma is composed of multiple clinical subgroups each with a distinct pathogenesis (i.e. endotypes). Gene expression profiling of bronchial airway brushings identified the type 2- high asthma endotype, defined by excessive airway inflammation driven by type 2 cytokines. We found that the type 2-high asthma endotype can be identified by gene expression profiling of minimally invasive nasal airway epithelium brushings. We also found high nasal expression of the type 2 cytokine, IL-13, was associated with higher risk of asthma attacks among Puerto Ricans, who have the highest asthma morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The populations with the highest asthma morbidity also have the poorest response to the most common asthma medication, albuterol. We hypothesize that specific molecular airway endotypes will define children with severe asthma and poor drug response and that these endotypes will have a strong genetic basis. To investigate this hypothesis the following aims are proposed: (1) Determine the expression endotypes of childhood asthma that underlie poor albuterol drug response and severe disease, using minimally invasive samples. Molecular endotyping with be performed by computational analysis of whole transcriptome sequencing data generated from 745 asthmatic and healthy children. Correlates of airway endotypes will be identified using peripheral blood gene expression. (2) Determine how IL-13 modifies airway cell responses to albuterol and HRV infection, and the genetic control of these responses. A powerful in vitro airway epithelial model will be used to determine if type 2 inflammation of the airway epithelium modifies transcriptional response to albuterol (most common asthma medication) and human rhinovirus (HRV) infection (most common trigger of asthma attacks). (3) Determine the genetic basis of and validate poor drug response and severe asthma endotypes in ethnically diverse children. We will perform the first genetic screen of type 2-high and other asthma endotypes. We will examine data from 4,379 minority children with asthma to determine how asthma endotypes influence response to albuterol and risk for severe asthma. Our goal is to understand the genetic basis of racial/ethnic differences in asthma severity and lung function. Results from this proposal will inform public health policy and clinical practice and aide in the mechanistic understanding of asthma severity (morbidity), which may lead to more targeted therapies. Data generated from our proposal will become a valuable resource for the medical and scientific communities."

"9441070","The ever-increasing demand for chiral compounds and the impressive prevalence of fluorinated pharmaceuticals on the US drug market generate compelling motivation for the development of synthetic methods that yield practical access to multifunctional organofluorines. The introduction of strategies that provide control over the unique stability and reactivity patterns of fluorinated species offers invaluable opportunities to streamline chemical synthesis of current and future drugs. The versatile chemistry of terminal ynamides which have been barely investigated to date and new C- F functionalization methodology recently discovered in our lab bear similar promise.  The goals of the proposed research are to introduce asymmetric methods for catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation with fluorinated nucleophiles generated either by mild deacylative C-C cleavage of readily available precursors or from multifunctional prenucleophiles, to continue our spearheading efforts with asymmetric ynamide addition reactions, and to develop new C-F functionalization chemistry. The general feasibility of the planned activities and the synthetic utility prospects are highlighted with ample proof- of-concept results and mechanistic insights. Considerable emphasis will be placed on the introduction of currently elusive reactions and new methodologies, for example unprecedented asymmetric Michael addition/Nef reactions, C-F activation for selective carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation, and base-free ynamide additions. In addition, the overall usefulness of the proposed multifunctional chiral building blocks for the total synthesis of biologically active compounds will be explored. The reaction development efforts will be guided by detailed mechanistic studies and include screening and systematic optimization of a variety of organocatalysts and chiral ligands, including bisoxazolidines which have been developed previously in our laboratory. Altogether, the anticipated outcomes of this proposal are likely to afford new tools and directions for asymmetric catalysis with organofluorines and terminal ynamides as well as general reaction insights and synthetic opportunities that will be of interest to a wide range of synthetic and medicinal chemists."
"9341956","Project Summary/Abstract  Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), encoded by the nuclear gene, TK2, is a mitochondrial matrix protein  that phosphorylates thymidine and deoxycytidine nucleosides to generate deoxythymidine  monophosphate (dTMP) and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), which in turn, are  converted to deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) required for mitochondrial DNA synthesis.  Autosomal recessive TK2 mutations cause devastating neuromuscular weakness with severe  depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in infants and children, as well as progressive external  ophthalmoplegia with mtDNA multiple deletions in adults. The central nervous system is variably  involved in these disorders. To determine the bases of disease onset and organ-specificity of  TK2 deficiency, Michio Hirano, Drs. Orhan H Akman, and collaborators have generated a  homozygous Tk2 H126N knock-in mutant (Tk2-/-) mouse that manifests a phenotype strikingly  similar to the human infantile encephalomyopathy. Between postnatal day 10 and 13, Tk2-/-  mice rapidly develop fatal encephalomyopathy characterized by decreased ambulation,  unstable gait, coarse tremor, growth retardation, and rapid progression to early death at age 14  to 16 days. Molecular and biochemical analyses of the mouse model demonstrated that the  pathogenesis of the disease is due to loss of enzyme activity and ensuing dNTP pool  imbalances with decreased dTTP levels in brain and both dTTP and dCTP levels in liver, which,  in turn, produces mtDNA depletion and defects of respiratory chain enzymes containing mtDNA-  encoded subunits, most prominently in the brain and spinal cord. We have demonstrated that  molecular bypass therapy with orally administered dCMP and dTMP ameliorates the  abnormal phenotype and extends the lifespan of Tk2-/- mice by 2-3 fold, but does not cure the  disease. Therefore, more effective therapies are needed to treat TK2 deficiency. Based on our  unexpected observation that dTMP and dCMP supplementation increased blood and tissue  levels of deoxythymidine (dT), we hypothesize that increasing dT and deoxycytidine (dC)  substrates for TK2 will be therapeutic. An alternative treatment approach is gene therapy.  Taking advantage of our Tk2 knockin mouse model, this proposal seeks to test both  therapeutic approaches: 1) pharmacological treatment with deoxynucleosides and 2) gene  therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated TK2 delivery."
"9386560","ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal by a multi-disciplinary team at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the University of Texas Southwestern Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburg Cancer Center is to explore approaches based on circulating protein markers and autoantibodies to develop a blood based marker panel to assess risk of harboring or developing small cell lung cancer (SCLC). There are currently several established SCLC protein markers which individually lack sufficient performance for early detection. Additionally, the applicant group has uncovered several protein marker candidates through integrated analyses of mouse models and human SCLC samples. To assess the potential of established and newly discovered candidate markers to yield a combined panel of markers indicative of risk of harboring or developing SCLC, validation studies will be conducted using plasma samples collected up to 5 years prior to a diagnosis of SCLC, from participants in the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) cohorts. Additonally, plasmas collected at the time of diagnosis of SCLC and post-treatment as well as tissue molecular profiles will be interrogated to establish the biological relevance to candidates to SCLC. Two approaches will be implemented to identify antigenic proteins and peptides that induce autoantibodies that can be mined for SCLC early detection. One consisting of Ig bound proteins in plasmas from SCLC cases and another novel approach consists of interrogating whole genome derived peptide arrays for reactivity with aliquots of SCLC plasmas utilized for validation of circulating proteins. The resulting combination of the most promising markers will be further validated using pre-diagnostic SCLC samples and matched controls from the US Prostate Lung Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort. The applicant group has a substantial track record of collaboration and expertise relevant to project objectives, with rigor in experimental design for discovery and validation studies of lung cancer biomarkers.  "
"9357697","Summary The long term objective of the project is to implement new motion robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology into wide clinical and research use. Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool that aids in the diagnosis of individual subjects, guides their clinical care, and provides insights into the mechanisms of normal and atypical development. The characterization of mental health disorders across the lifespan has been facilitated by brain MRI. However, conventional magnetic resonance imaging requires the subject being imaged remain perfectly still for the duration of the image encoding. Young children and non-cooperative adult patients have difficulty to hold still long enough for successful imaging. For clinical imaging such patients are frequently sedated or anesthetized, which runs the risk of adverse events, is costly, and does not ensure the subjects remain perfectly still. Research studies are typically unable to use sedation or anesthesia due to its significant risk. This hampers our ability to identify the neurobiological underpinnings of mental health disorders. The ability to use routinely motion robust magnetic resonance imaging will enable dramatic improvements in our capacity to chart the trajectory of mental illness over the lifespan. This will have a significant impact on our ability to determine when, where and how to intervene, and enable improved evaluation of potential interventions. The project proposes to utilize a combination of hardware for prospective motion tracking during scan and post-acquisition processing to enable the construction of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio images of the brain from subjects who are unable to hold still. The specific aims of this Phase IIB SBIR application are to optimize the EndoScout configuration and workflow for routine clinical and research use; to implement of the hybrid prospective/re-acquisition/retrospective framework into a wide scale clinical and research use; and to develop new, sophisticate motion correction approaches. This is a joint project by Robin Medical, Inc., which will optimize the motion tracking system for routine clinical and human research use; the Research Section at the Department of Radiology, Children?s Hospital Boston, which will implement the prospective motion correction algorithm into wide range of imaging sequences and will conduct the clinical studies of the project; and the Martinos Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital that will develop advanced sequences for prospective motion correction, using the EndoScout tracking data along with image navigators, and will use the motion immune MRI sequences in ongoing human research studies."
"9417964","Understanding how cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their tissue microenvironment (mechanosense) would enhance our ability to control stem cell differentiation, enabling advances in regenerative medicine, and to develop drugs to disrupt tumor metastasis, the cause of the vast majority of cancer deaths. Despite the importance of extracellular matrix stiffness in controlling cell fate and behavior, the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanosensing remain unknown. Cells interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through focal adhesions and associated stress fibers, actin-rich structures which enable a cell to pull on its surroundings via myosin II motor protein mediated contractility. Focal adhesions contain more than 150 different proteins, forming a highly complex interaction network whose composition changes dramatically in response to contractile forces which are modulated by the stiffness of a cell's environment. The proposed studies will dissect a primary mechanism underlying this compositional remodeling: how dozens of proteins containing motifs known as LIM domains are recruited to focal adhesions and stress fibers when they are under tension. Although the role of most LIM proteins in focal adhesions and stress fibers has not been well characterized, substantial cytological evidence suggests that one family member, the protein zyxin, accumulates at sites where the actin cytoskeleton is deformed or damaged in a LIM domain-dependent manner. I therefore hypothesize that myosin motor activity, which is known to distort actin cytoskeletons in vitro, generates binding sites for LIM domains in cells when contractility is high on stiff ECMs. This proposal builds upon an innovative application of electron tomography, which I previously adapted to quantify the distributions of single molecules in reconstructed three-dimensional maps of heterogeneous networks of interacting proteins. I will employ this technology to characterize the distortions which myosin motor activity generates in reconstituted cytoskeletal networks. This will reveal for the first time the structural consequences of a physiological force generator on the actin cytoskeleton in molecular detail. I will then uncover which of these distortions act as binding sites for LIM domains using zyxin as a model, and how the interaction is formed. Finally, I will stringently establish which LIM proteins are mechanosensitively recruited to focal adhesions and stress fibers in cells, and how they also recognize deformed cytoskeletal structures. Developing pharmacological inhibitors of force-dependent LIM protein accumulation, a key aspect of a cell's mechanosensitive response to its microenvironment, will be accelerated by identifying and establishing the structural details of the interaction between force-sensitive LIM domains and their receptors on the actin cytoskeleton. My studies will also provide insight into how the prevalence of modular LIM domains in the focal adhesion and stress fiber protein-protein interaction network enables a large-scale mechanosensitive response by the alteration of a single class of interactions."
"9209200","Project 2: The Plasminogen ?Interactome? following Injury ABSTRACT: With improved care most mortality after major trauma now occurs early (<12 hrs). Our hypothesis from Project Alpha, implicates Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), specifically dysregulated clot stability with either too much or too little fibrinolysis, which can change quickly). Decades of research on blood clotting disorders point to plasmin as the chief regulator of clot breakdown. Recent advances in the ability to analyze the hundreds of proteins changing rapidly in patient blood, leads us to conclude that some of these may be playing roles that have not been previously suspected. We hypothesize that blood loss or replacement (transfusion) versus cell lysis releases proteins that try to ontologically correct clotting by activating or deactivating plasmin.  In Specific aim1, we correlate which proteins (both known and unknown) predispose towards enhanced or diminished plasmin activity and thereby clot stability, paying particular attention to proteins that were introduced during transfusion.  In Specific aim 2, we concentrate on three classes of proteins that might interact with plasmin, due to their structure, but that are, typically, not present in abundance in normal blood, nor known to regulate plasmin and clot stability. Focusing on those protein structures containing lysines which bind to kringle domains, actin binding domains, and collagen binding domains, we verify their ability to activate or inhibit clot stability as predicted in Aim 1. These laboratory studies will assess the ability of these candidate proteins to physically bind and influence plasmin, directly or indirectly, by interfering with associated activators and inhibitors.  Lastly, in Specific aim 3, we utilize the fact that certain non-trauma surgical patients show aspects of defective clot stability similar to the states of fibrinolysis in injured patients. These include a. patients who require liver transplantation, who demonstrate weak clot stability and hyperfibrinolysis, b. obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, who are at risk for developing unwanted venous clots with fibrinolytic shutdown, and c. end- stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, who demonstrate clots that are slow to form but not easily dissolved with physiologic fibrinolysis. While these conditions are attributed to higher or lower levels of known plasmin mediators, or even enhanced platelet-fibrin interactions, the roles of new proteins, that we have discovered as capable of modulating plasmin regulated clot stability, has not been investigated. Impact: This proposal will reveal novel mechanisms of plasmin dysregulation, which can be examined more closely by Project 1 in trauma patients. These results are also likely to improve personalized resuscitation with blood products in the near future. Therapies based on the regulation of plasmin by these unique proteins may impact survival from blunt and penetrating injuries as well as for other surgical patients with coagulopathies."
"9408810","Project 5: HIV-1 genome stability and editing mediated by host proteins Summary In HIV-1 infected cells, many host proteins interact with viral RNA. These interactions can have positive or negative effects on viral replication. Some of these RNA protein interactions lead to editing of the genome, while others regulate RNA fate. CRNA investigators have discovered and characterized such several RNA:host protein interactions that form the basis for Project 5. This project will comprise a mix of structural and biological approaches to determine the precise nature and role of these important host protein-viral RNA interactions in HIV-1 replication. In Aim 1 Bieniasz and Smith will determine the X-crystal structure of a novel dinucleotide- sensing RNA-destabilizing antiviral protein bound to its target. This protein appears to impose a major selective pressure that drives the biased nucleotide composition of the HIV-1 genome, and likely the genomes of many other viruses. Its discovery has far reaching implications for the understanding of the selective forces driving nucleotide composition of viruses and their hosts and the detection of non-self RNA. For Aim 2, APOBEC3 proteins were shown by CRNA investigators to be incorporated into virions through interactions with viral RNA that appear to mimic the sequence preference of HIV-1 NC. Therefore, Bieniasz, Smith and collaborators will determine crystal structures of pigtail macaque and human APOBEC3H bound to an RNA target or a DNA substrate. Finally, Cullen has demonstrated that adenosine methylation at specific sites in the viral genome facilitates HIV-1 replication, and in Aim 3 of this project Cullen, Rouskin and Telesnitsky will determine the effect of m6A modification and m6A binding proteins on HIV-1 RNA structure and function, and their role in HIV- 1 replication."
"9470650","PROJECT SUMMARY The Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is necessary for multiple steps of craniofacial development. Mutations in this pathway lead to devastating birth defects including holoprosencephaly and Pallister-Hall syndrome. Furthermore, a spectrum of diseases collectively referred to as craniofacial ciliopathies, are caused by ciliary mutations that affect the processing of GLI proteins, the transcriptional effectors of the pathway. This disruption in processing often leads to a reduction in both GLI activator (GLI-A) and GLI repressor (GLI-R). While GLI-A is necessary for activation of several transcriptional SHH targets, most genes are in fact activated by the de- repression of GLI-R. Despite a clear genetic requirement for GLI-R in craniofacial development, the mechanisms by which it elicits repression are undefined. This proposal aims to fill a fundamental gap in our understanding of how GLI-R proteins maintain transcriptional repression during craniofacial development. Specifically, I seek to determine if GLI repression regulates transcription by regulating epigenetic markers and by physically altering chromatin structure in terms of chromatin accessibility and GLI enhancer-promoter interactions. I hypothesize that GLI-R recruits HDACs to maintain GLI enhancers in an epigenetically repressed state with restricted chromatin accessibility and prevents GLI enhancer-promoter interactions from being established. The experiments in this proposal will provide direct mechanistic insight into the processes underlying the transcriptional regulation of SHH target genes. By identifying GLI-bound enhancers regulated by SHH signaling in craniofacial patterning, it will also serve as a resource for other scientists studying SHH regulation. !"
"9313169","Project Summary/Abstract  The CDC states that smoking causes 80% of lung cancers and 443,000 deaths annually and is the leading preventable cause of death in the USA. Smokers have peak cravings at predictable times, but existing NRTs are not tailored to preempt cravings. Further, NRT is often used in isolation from behavioral support despite data supporting the benefits of traditional and mobile-based interventions.  Chrono Therapeutics, Inc. (CTI) has developed, patented and clinically tested in humans a smoking cessation system (SCS) for programmed and patient-individualized pulsatile nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) paired with behavioral change techniques for smoking cessation. SCS is the first system that can automatically tailor nicotine plasma throughout the day based on the consistent, daily, predictable craving patterns that smokers experience, providing sustained peak plasma levels when cravings are high and lower (maintenance) levels when cravings are low. The SCS programmable NRT delivery device is integrated with a smartphone-based smoking cessation application, Digital Coach, which provides behavioral support that is synchronized with the smoker?s NRT, craving, and smoking cycle to enable ?smart,? tailored just-in-time digital coaching support. A ?smart? patient compliance sensor that detects when a smoker is not wearing the device will trigger compliance alerts on SCS and a smartphone for real time compliance interventions designed to increase adherence and efficacy.  The proposed SBIR Phase IIB project is predicated on a recently-concluded $2.23M Fast Track SBIR Grant 5R44CA171786-03, awarded by the National Cancer Institute, entitled ?SmartStop: Programmable Transdermal Nicotine Replacement Therapy,? and will provide funds for CTI to finalize the designed-for- manufacture SCS prototype, complete FDA validation, and conduct an FDA-indicated definitive double-blind fully-powered (n=200) two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of smoking cessation efficacy comparing SCS (programmable NRT Device dispensing replacement nicotine + Digital Coach) with SCS Placebo (programmable NRT Device without replacement nicotine + Digital Coach). The end goal is to show SCS functionality and superior 6-month quit-rate efficacy over placebo. CTI believes that SCS?s combination of ?smart? NRT, ?smart? behavioral support, and compliance monitoring to increase adherence will more than triple the efficacy of existing NRT products. CTI has successfully raised over $34M in private funding to date in pursuit of this important public health goal."
"9480498","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Damage to connections within the adult Central Nervous System (CNS) by injury or disease is often irreparable. To design therapies to repair CNS damage requires a detailed understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying CNS development. As the brain develops, neurotrophic cues, such as netrin, guide axons to their postsynaptic targets and induce axon branching to increase synaptic capacity. Both the guided locomotion of axonal growth cones, and their ramification into multiple axon branches, require the same fundamental cellular machinery. F-actin and microtubule (MT) dynamics initiate and steer membrane protrusions. Exocytosis delivers phospholipids and membrane proteins required to supply material to the expanding plasma membrane. Coordination of cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicle trafficking likely plays key roles in axon guidance and branching. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate such interactions during axon guidance and axon branching are not understood. Our findings place TRIM9 at the junction of netrin/DCC signaling to both the cytoskeletal and vesicle trafficking machinery. Using a combination of mouse genetics, primary cell culture, live cell imaging and neuroanatomical studies, my lab found that TRIM9-deficient cortical neurons show misregulated exocytosis and defective actin and MT dynamics. Furthermore, we found that cortical neurons devoid of TRIM9 have constitutive branching defects, fail to form from branches in response to netrin, and are defective in netrin-based axon guidance. In vivo, we have found that loss of TRIM9 is associated with defective cortical axon fiber tracts. Our findings that TRIM9 interacts with and regulates the exocytic tSNARE, SNAP25, lead us to hypothesis that TRIM9 spatially and temporally regulates exocytosis in the growing axon. Novel interactions identified with multiple cytoskeletal regulators, including Ena/VASP proteins, Lamellipodin, and MAP1B lead us to hypothesize that TRIM9 participates in protein networks that play key roles in F-actin and MTs dynamics. As we have found that TRIM9 binds directly to the netrin receptor, DCC, and is required for functions downstream of the axon guidance cue netrin, we hypothesize that TRIM9 is essential for the coordinated activities of the cytoskeleton and exocytosis that dictate axon branching and guidance in response to netrin/DCC. My lab is in a unique position to determine the molecular mechanism that link guidance cues to local changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and axon branching through live-cell imaging, quantitative image analysis, biochemistry, and mouse models. Our long-term goal is to understand how neurons integrate environmental cues to orchestrate changes in their morphology and movement necessary to establish a functional nervous system. A better understanding of the mechanistic basis of axon guidance and axon branching will provide fundamental insight into how connections in the nervous system are established and how they are remodeled during plasticity. The results of our research plan should be of great value to the development of therapeutic approaches to repair these connections subsequent to disease or injury."
"9476533","Project Summary: The main objective of the Division of Laboratory Services (DLS) at the Kentucky Department for Public Health is to maintain ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation (achieved in September 2016 for food chemistry and microbiology testing) and enhance testing capabilities by expanding the scope of current accreditation for additional testing to include food microbiology whole genome sequencing analyses. ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation is one of the most important standards for testing laboratories and attests to the competency and technical capability of a laboratory to perform specific tasks. The results generated are defensible to a recognized standard. In addition, accreditation supports the traceability of technical results generated by a laboratory. In the event of a large-scale terrorist activity or other large-scale events affecting foods or food products, States and Federal authorities can use laboratory test results from accredited laboratories to respond rapidly with streamlined analytical review and enforce regulatory compliance to protect the safety of the nation's food supply. DLS is the primary servicing laboratory for conducting microbiological and chemical food analyses on behalf of the KY State manufactured food regulatory program (MFRPS) in the Department for Public Health / Food Safety Branch, which has a current food safety inspection contract with FDA and is enrolled in the MFRPS. DLS has a quality management system that is in compliance with the managerial and technical requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 standard. DLS is a Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Laboratory and participates in Food proficiency testing and submits laboratory results through electronic laboratory exchange network (eLEXNET) as requested. The Division of Laboratory Services?s goal is to enhance laboratory activities by bringing in new testing capabilities. DLS will implement whole genome sequencing tests for environmental micro food samples to complement progressive testing performed on clinical samples in outbreak situations. This would result in faster identification of the food/pathogens implicated in the outbreak and matching clinical to environmental samples. Funding of this proposal will assist the KY State MFRPS in achieving conformance with Standard 10 ?Laboratory Support? of the MFRPS and will contribute to production of accurate and reliable test data, a quicker acceptance of analytical results by FDA, and other regulatory agencies for enforcement actions, surveillance purposes and response to foodborne outbreaks. In addition, DLS will provide insight into the origin of the contaminated food by the genomic information provided by the GenomeTrackr network which will point investigators to specific food products potentially related to an outbreak. This will lead to develop a stronger international rapid surveillance system for pathogen traceback by further enhancing the GenomeTrackr network and growing the database."
"9345365","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the rapidly advancing sphere of biomedical research, there is a growing national need to prepare biomedical trainees for the broad range of careers that are critical to supporting a strong and effective biomedical enterprise. The proposed program will provide early professional development and guidance, as well as networking experiences for trainees, such that they may efficiently identify and succeed along directed career paths. A second goal is to endow trainees with an understanding and appreciation for the diverse functions served by the biomedical research (and research-related) workforce, and learn firsthand how these entities cooperate to advance human health. To this end, an innovative new professional development course will be implemented, where biomedical graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from across the university will develop a comprehensive understanding of the many important and interconnected roles involved in advancing and implementing biomedical discoveries, and develop communication skills that are critical for these interprofessional interactions. This course will include academic and non-academic guest lecturers, who will guide students through a diverse set of case studies and communication exercises to achieve this aim. During this course, trainees will be guided through construction of their own individual career development plans to identify where they may fit in this scheme, and will utilize resources from the course to outline the skills and experiences that will best allow them to achieve these goals. The course will also include a series of optional mini-internships at local organizations to expose students to a variety of professional environments. Independently of the course, a mentorship program will be offered, where trainees participate in regular advisory meetings with mentors from academic and non-academic partner institutions and businesses (selected based on trainee career interests), and which culminates in an annual career development and networking event. Mentors will provide additional guidance for shaping the trainees' individual development plans, and help identify mechanisms for further growth, including use of existing courses, certificates, and degree programs at VT that would provide complementary experiences, such as in policy, public health, business, management, or writing. Overall, the program will serve as a first-step in trainee career development, offering essential professional skills, glimpses into the roles of professionals from a multiple job sectors, and a forum for carving out a training plan that may ultimately include pursuit of more time intensive and specialized training activities. The program is designed to be both broadly appealing to biomedical trainees, regardless of ultimate career path, and one that could be implemented across a range of training institutions."
"9352333","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The synchronization and entrainment of coupled biological oscillators is an emerging research area in complex network systems. The mammalian circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus consists of approximately 20,000 pacemaker neurons that are coupled together to produce a robust overall rhythm that drives other bodily functions such as sleep patterns. The SCN represents an ideal model system for studying biological network design and behavior due to accumulating data on individual SCN neurons and their interactions. Experimental studies have shown that SCN intercellular communication is primarily mediated by two neurotransmitters: vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA). While VIP is well established as an essential synchronizing agent, the role of GABA with respect to its inhibitory/excitatory, day/night, synchronizing and entrainment effects remains controversial. Improved understanding of neurotransmitter mediated intercellular signaling in the SCN will have important clinical implications for prevention and treatment of circadian rhythm disruptions, including mood and sleep disorders and metabolic diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a multiscale model of the SCN and to integrate this model with targeted experiments and novel computational tools to gain improved understanding of SCN connectivity, synchronization and entrainment properties. The research focuses on GABA signaling because its role in the SCN is prominent, not well understood, and recent advances by the three participating investigators will enable a complete and careful dissection of the role of this common neurotransmitter with synapse-level resolution across large arrays of circadian neurons. The multiscale model will establish a link between core clock genes and ion channels at the individual cell level and network synchronization and entrainment behavior at the SCN tissue level through cell-to-cell connectivity. Targeted experiments will be performed to inform the construction and validate the predictions of the network model. General computational techniques for model reduction and efficient simulation of heterogeneous cellular networks will be developed to facilitate analysis of model behavior over a wide range of environmental conditions. The research has the potential to be highly transformative by both advancing the multiscale modeling of coupled oscillators/complex networks and by fundamentally changing our understanding of GABA signaling in circadian timekeeping and potentially in other brain regions. Our participation in the Multiscale Modeling Consortium will provide a unique perspective on networked cellular systems where we will explore cross-cutting topics such as network topology, dynamics, robustness and function."
"9345023","Abstract Bullying is all too common in the early school years, occurring at approximately the same rate in Kindergarten and 1st (K1) grades as in later elementary school. Research underscores how bullying at an early age is predictive of continued bullying and peer victimization, and how all involved?bullies, victims, and bystanders? are at elevated risk for negative outcomes in many aspects of a child's social, emotional, and academic life. Recent reviews of school-based programs demonstrate that punitive, disciplinary approaches to bullying prevention do not work, and that social emotional learning (SEL) is a critical ingredient in effective programs. Unfortunately, logistical barriers (e.g., time, cost, need for trained staff) too often undermine schools' abilities to implement traditional in-person SEL strategies with all students. This SBIR Fast-Track will leverage cutting- edge intelligent social tutoring game technology to create a new, evidence-based serious game specifically designed to help younger students develop the social emotional skills they need to navigate bullying situations. 3C Institute is a leader in the field of game-based Intelligent Social Tutoring Systems (ISTS) with extensive experience creating and testing SEL games. 3C's ongoing collaboration with the Bellevue Public School in WA, Communities in Schools-Wake County Public Schools, NC, and our commercialization partner, Personalized Learning Games, will provide a solid foundation on which to build, test, and commercialize the proposed serious K1 SEL game product. Five specific aims will be accomplished. In Phase I, we will (1) create a serious game prototype based on input from K1 students, parents, and educators with a custom graphic design and storyworld and five prototype social problem solving (SPS) scenes. We will also (2) conduct end user tests with K1 students and educators who will review and evaluate the prototype. In Phase II, we will (3) develop the full product through an iterative testing process for a total of 25 SPS scenes aligned to CASEL's SEL framework (Self-management, Self-awareness, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills, & Responsible Decision Making) as well as online Student, Home, and Educator Portals. Then, we will (4) conduct a randomized active control pilot study to test the serious game's impact for improving K1 students' social emotional behavior, ability to problem solve in bullying situations, self-efficacy for coping with bullying, and awareness of behaviors that constitute bullying. We expect the SEL serious game to result in significant improvements in all areas compared to the active control group. Lastly, we will (5) prepare for commercialization by conducting focus groups with educators to finalize the complete product and formulate implementation guidelines for schools. We will also develop all needed online training demos and materials, finalize online reporting functions, and integrate e-commerce functions into the website. Our proposed product will meet a significant market need as the first rigorously tested serious game for SEL bullying prevention with younger students. We have already secured a pathway to market, with Personalized Learning Games, Inc. committed to offering the product."
"9287096","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of the proposed research is to advance policy approaches to support Precision Medicine research (PMR) with American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people through culturally respectful dialogue, empiric data collection, and deliberation with rural and urban AIAN community members and tribal representatives in Alaska and Montana. We propose to address three complex and important challenges to conducting PMR within a successful community-academic partnership involving AIAN communities: (1) alignment of PMR with tribal health priorities; (2) return of PMR results to participants and communities; and (3) data stewardship.  Understanding the importance of PM relative to other tribal health priorities, and how PM may benefit AIAN people, is an important first step in developing a clear understanding of the kinds of PMR that could be pursued and its potential value to AIAN communities. Identifying cultural, logistical, and environmental factors that must be considered is an essential first step because these factors influence the acceptability of PMR within AIAN communities, community members? willingness to participate, and ultimately, the uptake and usefulness of results and interventions that emerge from PMR.  Flexible, community-responsive approaches to the return of results from PMR need to be developed. AIAN community members want to be involved in defining best practices for returning research results that maximize benefit and minimize risk for AIAN people. Moreover, developing trustworthy approaches to data stewardship ? who owns research information, whether it can be shared and with whom, and who decides ? is required if PMR is to move forward in AIAN communities.  The proposed research will identify principles and approaches that can provide the foundation for effective PMR in AIAN communities. In collaboration with our AIAN Community Advisory Groups, we will: (1) Conduct empiric data collection from stakeholders at each study site, to understand community views regarding PM and PMR participation; (2) Convene local dialogs with tribal leadership at each site to review Aim 1 findings and discuss tribal health priorities, return of research results, and data stewardship, in addition to holding cross-site deliberation among AIAN tribal leaders in Alaska and Montana to identify areas of common ground and disagreement on these issues; (3) Develop a comprehensive communication plan to chart key messages, audiences, and communication vehicles for each study site to share the results emerging from this work with a full range of stakeholders, including other tribal organizations, researchers working with tribal communities, and research funders; and (4) Convene a national meeting to identify areas of consensus and challenges to be overcome in implementing PMR in AIAN communities."
"9388885","PROJECT SUMMARY   The goal of this project is to map transitions in brain and behavior over the first 6 months of life in infants at  high- and low-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study builds on results demonstrating that a basic  mechanism of social adaptive action?looking at the eyes of others?was already in decline in the first 6 months  of life of infants with ASD (Jones & Klin, Nature, 2013). Interestingly, these findings contradicted prior hypotheses  postulating an absence of social adaptive orientation in ASD from birth: early levels of eye-looking were not  immediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD; instead, these infants exhibited a slight but  statistically significant increase in eye-looking at 2 months, which then declined. Together with evidence of early  normative transitions from experience-expectant mechanisms (that is, largely subcortically-mediated ?reflex-like?  predispositions) to experience-dependent ones (that is, largely cortically-mediated adaptive actions that build  upon early newborn experiences), these data suggest a very specific hypothesis in ASD: reflex-like  predispositions may be initially present, whilst early pivotal transitions, dependent upon the way in which initial  predispositions are integrated into contingent social interaction, are disrupted. The proposed study will directly  test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will identify brain networks associated with transitions from reflex-like/experience-  expectant to interactive/experience-dependent forms of social adaptive action, and will identify the  developmental phase?experience-expectant or experience-dependent?in which disruptions in brain and  behavior first emerge in ASD. Aims 2 and 3 will identify aspects of brain maturation and early infant experience  that are necessary and/or sufficient for guiding brain-behavior transitions over the first 6 months of life. Aim 2 will  identify aspects of brain maturation that drive the emergence of sensitivity to social contingency, a critical  mechanism of social interaction between infant and caregiver. Aim 3 will identify aspects of early infant  experience that are necessary and/or sufficient for shaping the development of infant social brain networks.   Brain-behavior transitions will be measured in the same cohort of infants shared by Projects I-IV. Measures  (in brain and behavior) are harmonized with Project V to facilitate comparisons between human and model  systems. Anatomical, structural, and functional MRI scans will be collected at 3 time points between birth and 6  months, and region-of-interest and network analyses will be used to characterize how subcortical and cortical  networks interact and reorganize over infants? first 6 months. Bidirectional relationships between developmental  change in the brain and developmental change in behavior (measured in Projects I and II) will be examined using  innovative statistical approaches for modeling time-varying longitudinal data and for detecting statistical causality  within complex systems. By intensively studying the brain-behavior bases of emerging social disability in very  early infancy, this research will offer new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of ASD, and identify new  targets for innovative early interventions."

"9376344","Detecting and understanding the genetic basis of multivariate traits related to human health are critical to the future of personalized medicine. An important aspect is understanding pleiotropy (when a single gene influences more than one trait), which can improve the biological understanding of a gene in multiple ways, and ultimately advance prevention and treatment of complex diseases. However, the statistical methods to evaluate the simultaneous impact of a gene on multiple traits have mainly relied on standard multivariate analyses that do not directly address biological questions. We recently developed novel statistical methods to evaluate the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism with multiple quantitative traits, overcoming the limitation of standard multivariate analysis in order to improve biological understanding of how a gene influences multiple correlated traits. We propose to build on our experience in order to develop new statistical methods that allow for different types of traits (e.g., binary, ordinal) in order to facilitate human genetic research, such as use of the rich medical diagnostic information from electronic medical records. We also plan to develop statistical methods that decipher the genetic basis of multivariate traits in the context of genetic pathway analyses. To enhance understanding of how genes influence multivariate traits, we plan to develop and evaluate causal mediation models in order to provide guidance on the most likely sets of models that ?explain? the association of genes with traits, thereby providing much needed guidance to epidemiologists and laboratory scientists on follow-up studies."

"9467760","Project Summary/Abstract Hypertension is the leading risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and chronic kidney disease. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age from less than 10% among adults aged 18-39 to more than 65% among adults above the age of 60. While there is a demonstrated benefit of blood pressure reduction on measures of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, less than one half of elderly patients with hypertension achieve therapeutic control of blood pressure. Importantly, the mechanisms underlying age- related hypertension have not been fully elucidated. This proposal seeks to delineate the integrated renal and sympathetic nervous system mechanisms that regulate sodium balance and blood pressure in aging, with the goal of identifying potential therapeutic avenues and informing the personalized application of current antihypertensive therapies in the elderly. We hypothesize that an age-related reduction in afferent renal nerve activity contributes to sympathoexcitation, leading to sodium chloride cotransporter-mediated sodium retention and the development of age-related hypertension. We will use a novel method to selectively ablate the afferent renal nerves and test the age-dependent role of the afferent renal nerve-mediated mechanosensitive sympathoinhibitory reno-renal reflex in homeostatic responses to acute and chronic challenges to sodium and fluid balance. In Specific Aim 1, we will establish an age-dependent decrease in afferent renal nerve activity and a failure to increase afferent renal nerve activity in response to a chronic high salt diet. We will demonstrate that intact afferent renal nerve activity facilitates sympathoinhibition, sodium homeostasis, and normotension in response to an acute volume expansion that directly activates renal mechanoceptors in young Sprague-Dawley rats, and that the role of the afferent renal nerves in these responses is age-dependent. In Specific Aim 2, we will demonstrate that intact afferent renal nerve activity facilitates sympathoinhibition, sodium homeostasis, and normotension in response to chronic dietary high salt intake in young Sprague- Dawley rats. We will demonstrate that the role of the afferent renal nerves in these responses is age dependent, and that decreased afferent renal nerve responsiveness evokes age-dependent sodium retention and hypertension via an efferent renal nerve-mediated ?1-adrenoceptor-dependent pathway that activates the sodium chloride cotransporter. We will use bilateral renal denervation to demonstrate that removal of both the afferent and efferent renal nerves attenuates age-related sodium retention and hypertension, providing mechanistic insight that may inform candidate selection for ongoing human renal nerve ablation studies. Our studies will identify new therapeutic targets and inform current treatment paradigms for hypertension in the elderly, meeting an urgent public health need for the rapidly aging global population."
"9528132","While the epidemic of HIV in the US has leveled off for many age groups, from 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) (13-24 year old) more than doubled. In 2010, YMSM accounted for 72% of new infections among people ages 13 to 24, and 30% of all new infections among MSM. The success of treatment as prevention in reducing the number of new HIV infections among youth, and particularly YMSM, relies on HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment (both for treatment and prevention), adherence and viral suppression among those with HIV. The UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech) aims to impact the HIV epidemic by conducting innovative, interdisciplinary research on technology-based interventions across the HIV prevention and care continuum for adolescents and young adults in the United States (US). The iTech also creates an infrastructure to share and disseminate best practices in technology-delivered HIV interventions to other ATN projects and programs serving adolescents. The iTech overall goals seek to decrease the impact of HIV on the lives of adolescents and young adults in the US, particularly YMSM, by providing: 1) treatment as prevention for those without HIV but at risk; 2) earlier identification and treatment for those infected but undiagnosed; 3) interventions to address structural determinants that decrease access to and uptake of prevention and care services; and 4) treatment interventions to encourage adherence for youth dealing with substance use, mental health related issues, stigmatization and disenfranchisement. The necessary resources and support for HIV/AIDS investigators addressing these goals will be provided by the iTech Cores: 1) Management (Hightow-Weidman); 2) Analytic (Rosenberg/Muessig); and, 3) Technology (Sullivan/Hightow-Weidman). To accomplish our Overall Goals we have developed the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To provide scientific leadership with expertise and experience in technology-based research to address fundamental questions related to the HIV prevention and care continuum, guide our overall research strategy and foster collaboration and synergy both within our iTech and with the broader ATN scientific community. Aim 2: To support the development and assessment of innovative technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for at-risk or infected youth aged 15-24 years.

"9314186","Project Summary/Abstract Alcohol use disorders are third leading cause of preventable death, accounting for approximately 90,000 preventable deaths each year (Danaei et al 2009). Nearly 50% deaths are secondary to diseases that are associated with inflammation and aberrant immune activation such as sepsis and alcoholic liver disease (Mokdad et al 2000). Recent discoveries find that alcohol activates the innate immune system in both the CNS and periphery. Thus, understanding the effects of alcohol on the immune system is critical to form a foundation of discovery leading to the understanding of both the pathology of alcoholism and numerous alcohol-associated diseases. We have found recently that alcohol activates the innate immune system through the ?master regulator? of innate immunity, HMGB1. In this proposal we aim to investigate the effects of alcohol on central and peripheral immune activation through HMGB1 and its companion cytokine IL-?. Using in vitro cell culture systems (Aim 1), in vivo experiments (Aim 2-3) and assessments in human alcoholics, burn patients and alcoholic hepatitis patients (Aim 4), we hope to gain an understanding of the immune effects of alcohol throughout the body. I will gain new laboratory experience with real time-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting, intracerebral AAV5 viral injections, mass spectrometry, immunocytochemistry, and live fluorescent imaging. We also investigate a novel mechanism of cell-cell communication in this pathology, alcohol-induced release of pro-inflammatory microparticles. Further, we investigate the role of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the immune effects of alcohol, and study inhibitors of this pathway which may be novel therapeutic options. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that alcohol causes central and peripheral HMGB1 and IL-1? release in microparticles through a PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR linked mechanism. This project also incorporates substantial career development with career and research mentoring from top tier researchers and clinicians, the learning of new experimental techniques, and course work to enhance clinical/translational expertise. Co-mentors Fulton T. Crews, PhD and Bruce Cairns MD provide a depth of basic science, clinical research, and career development mentorship that will help ensure the successful transition of the candidate to being a top independent translational researcher."

"9389397","ABSTRACT Exposure to trauma and abuse during childhood, a critical neurodevelopmental period, is a major risk factor for adult psychopathology. However, not all children exposed to childhood trauma will develop adult psychopathology. Variability in the risk for trauma-related pathology is expected to arise in part from genetic susceptibility. Several genes have recently been identified that interact with childhood trauma to increase rates of anxiety and mood disorders in adulthood. This risk can be more easily detected by examining endophenotypes such as brain measures obtained from MRI because of a simpler underlying genetic architecture with fewer individual genes or pathways than the multiple factors driving overall risk for psychopathology. Understanding the molecular-genetic contributors to brain structure that conspire with early-life environment (psychological trauma) and lead to adult psychopathology, will require large-scale collaborative efforts which harness big-data methodologies. Our goal is to conduct a GWAS of relevant structural brain measures in individuals exposed to childhood trauma, with the long-term goal of identifying genetic modulators of brain structure that are informative for early prediction and treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders where childhood trauma is a major risk factor. We hypothesize that (1) childhood trauma will interact with specific genetic markers to produce structural brain alterations and adult psychopathology, (2) that unique genetic variants, in the context of genetic vulnerability to childhood trauma, will influence the onset of specific disorders (e.g. depression vs PTSD), as well as (3) the presentation of specific symptom constructs (e.g. sustained threat) across disorders. Finding disease-associated genetic variation that point to molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis has proven challenging due to the polygenicity of clinical phenotypes. Leveraging neuroimaging phenotypes may offer a more direct path than clinical phenotypes in identifying these elusive genetic markers and relevant neurobiological pathways. Ultimately, the promise of finding genetic contributors of any psychiatric disorder is in identifying the presence of new biologic pathways for which targeted interventions may be devised and deployed."

The result is that while interest in?and ability to treat?lysosomal conditions has improved dramatically over the past two decades, the path to diagnosis has not become significantly altered. Further, the fostering of those with an inherent interest in lysosomal conditions?and rare diseases in general?can get lost in the practicalities of medical training.    In order to support the educational goals of those with an interest in lysosomal disease, the Lysosomal Disease Network has implement two major educational/training activities. The first of these is a commitment to provide fellowships for two qualified (postdoctoral level) individuals each year. These Lysosomal Disease Network Fellows will be provided a stipend that allows them to pursue a clinical research project in the field. In addition to the execution of a project vetted by the Training/Education Unit PI, these fellows will also be expected to attend WORLD Symposium Lysosomes 101, the biennial Clinical Conference on Rare Disease Research, and other educational events as appropriate. They will present the outcomes of their research at these conferences.    The second major component of the Network Training Unit is the annual WORLD Symposium. The Symposium provides travel grants to young investigators interested in lysosomal conditions. The Training/Education Unit is led by Dr. Patterson who will assist Drs. Whitley and Cloyd."
"9337429","OVERVIEW. The Enrichment Program seeks to accomplish the goals of the Liver Center in four related ways. First, the Program provides Center members with the latest information about their specific areas of interest. Second, the Program seeks to broaden the appreciation that Center members have for related areas of research in liver biology and pathobiology. Third, the Program seeks to enhance collaboration among Center members; In part because of the enrichment program, nearly all Center members collaborate with at least one other Center member (Illustration IV) and 50% of all Center-related publications are co-authored by multiple Center members (Illustration VII). Finally, the Program serves as an outreach mechanism to non-liver physicians, scientists and lay people to enhance their understanding of liver disease. We have established several mechanisms to achieve these goals. This includes a regular seminar series, a bi-annual retreat, a newsletter, and certain special educational programs. All Center seminars, conferences and symposia are posted on the Center's website and advertised via poster and e-mail notification."
"9354447","This P&F program has been highly successful over the first five years of funding of this CDTR. Eight investigators have been funded at $30,000/year for two years (total of $60,000 per investigator). In general, year one of funding has come from the CDTR while year two has come from a combination of philanthropy or shared expenditures with Vanderbilt's CTSA (see letter of support from Gordon Bernard, M.D., director of Vanderbilt's CTSA). Four investigators have already received either a K award or a DP3 award and a fifth awardee has secured a RO1 (two P&F recipients have pending K applications at the time of this writing ? the results of which will be updated on our website (https://labnodes.vanderbilt.edu/cdtr). Our R01 recipient (Chandra Osborn, Ph.D.) who received a K award will lead a new core (Behavioral Intervention Technologies and Services Core) that reflects both her research focus as well as research base demands. Translation core investigators support both the design (structured statistical and measurement support pre-submission), implementation and analysis of the P&F grants. Vanderbilt CDTR proposes continuation of support for Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) funding for type II translation research in diabetes through it's Administrative Core. These funds are used for: 1) new investigators; 2) established investigators from other fields who bring their research expertise to diabetes; or 3) investigators in diabetes research who wish to test a new idea. This funding mechanism provides support that will allow an investigator the opportunity to develop the pilot data that will serve as the basis for obtaining independent research support through conventional external, peer-reviewed granting mechanisms. Two P&F studies in any one year (one new and one continuation) are funded and the funding is not intended for large undertakings by established investigators for which it would be appropriate to submit separate research grant applications nor to support or supplement ongoing research. Currently applicants must be a member of the VUMC or Meharry faculty (Instructor or above) to submit a P&F proposal, and they must meet the NIH Eligibility Guidelines for P&F support.  "
"9339667","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is on the rise to the extent that diabetes rapid and widespread nature has been referred to as pandemic in the United States; type 1 diabetes is also increasing at an unexpected rate. As such, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutics and technologies to deal with this situation, and hence a need to train a cadre of future scientists who can engineer devices and therapeutics with in-depth knowledge and training to link their research to clinical care to address the prevention and treatment of diabetes. The Indiana Bioengineering Interdisciplinary Training for Diabetes Research program was conceived to meet this need. A novel and notable aspect of our program is the interaction and integration of premier faculty of the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University with the exceptional diabetes research faculty of the Indiana University School of Medicine, providing and elite training experience for future bioengineer-diabetologists. This educational model has already proven feasibility, by virtue of the successes of our Indiana MSTP T32 and our Indiana CTSI training programs. The aim of the Indiana Bioengineering Interdisciplinary Training for Diabetes Research program is to provide interdisciplinary, integrated research training to develop predoctoral students into bioengineers capable of leading integrative and team-based approaches to solve issues relevant to the understanding, prevention and treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. This unique and integrated format benefits from co-directorship by each institutional program using the multi-PI mechanism, with Dr. A. Panitch (Biomedical engineering PI, Purdue University) and Dr. D. Thurmond (Diabetes research PI, Indiana University School of Medicine) coordinating a select group of exemplary bioengineering and diabetes-based research faculties to co-mentor our students, in combination with a carefully designed flexible curriculum that provides in-depth training for students in engineering relevant to diabetes. Our program emphasizes coursework that broadens research training at the bench with quantitative skills, provides opportunities for public speaking, provides a range of enriching extracurricular opportunities, and allows for integration of medicine and science/engineering throughout all years of training. Defined oversight mechanisms are in place to track the progress of trainees throughout the program. By training in an environment and culture that gives strong interdisciplinary support for bioengineering and diabetes research, there is a significant probability that the bioengineering trainees will sustain an interest in diabetes, even as their specific research interests evolve over their careers."
"9539138","The long-term goal of this project is to develop a detailed molecular understanding of the CLC (Chloride Channel) family of membrane proteins. The CLCs comprise two major classes of ion-transport mechanisms: half of CLC homologs are electrodiffusive ion channels (catalyzing downhill movement of chloride), while the other half are secondary active transporters that stoichiometrically exchange chloride for protons (harnessing the energy from movement of chloride to pump protons or vice versa). That both types of ion-transport are within one gene family suggests their mechanisms may be subtle variations on a single central theme. Indeed, CLC channels appear to act by a broken transporter mechanism. Here we propose a highly concerted approach composed of complementary computational and experimental biophysical and biochemical techniques to study the molecular details underpinning the mechanism of CLC-ec1 and CLC-0, model homologs for antiporters and channels, respectively. Our main goal is to elucidate the antiporter (unbroken) mechanism, taking advantage of high-resolution CLC-ec1 structures and the molecular dynamics simulations they allow, and of antiporter amenability to spectroscopic analysis. We will apply insights from studies of the unbroken transporter CLC-ec1 to electrophysiological analysis of the CLC-0 channel's broken mechanism to study conservation between channel and transporter mechanisms. AIM 1 will determine global structural changes associated with the CLC transport cycle. Here we will use EPR to measure distance changes between pairs of site-directed spin labels on CLC-ec1, evaluate changes in accessibility of spin labels, and use computational modeling to develop structural models for the inward- and outward-facing states. AIM 2 will determine how CLC conformational change affects water dynamics and water-wire formation involved in proton transport. These studies will help reveal how proton transport fits into the overall CLC transport mechanism. AIM 3 will characterize the chloride/proton coupling mechanism ? evaluating detailed models of how transport occurs, using a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic measurements on WT and uncoupled mutants, together with computational analysis to investigate in detail how binding and translocation of ions are coupled to protein conformational changes. Overall Impact: Revealing molecular details of CLC ion channel broken and antiporter unbroken mechanisms, and how they are alike and different, will help reveal how CLC function can go wrong, with implications for neurological diseases, hypertension, and diseases of kidney, muscle, and bone. Our methodology will be applicable to other large membrane proteins of medical importance where unraveling molecular mechanisms has similarly been stymied by limitations of crystallography."
"9350370","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a research and training plan that is designed to enhance the career development of Dr. Erich G. Chapman. The research aims of this proposal revolve around a series of RNA structures recently discovered within the genomes of different positive-sense RNA viruses. These RNA structures allow portions of these viral genomes to resist or evade the major 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' RNA decay pathways that exist in eukaryotic cells. This leads to a drastic lengthening of the cellular lifetimes of co-transcribed viral RNAs and their high-level accumulation during viral infection. Several lines of evidence suggest that these different RNA stability elements are capable of operating outside of their contexts in different viral genomes. Research described in this proposal will test this hypothesis by transplanting several different viral RNA structures into messenger RNA reporter systems in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Experiments will be conducted to verify their operation and quantify any extensions in cellular RNA lifetimes. These investigations will preface Dr. Chapman's long-term research plans regarding the regulation of RNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells. The career development goals of this proposal are designed to train Dr. Chapman in yeast biology and genomic techniques and to facilitate his transition to an independent academic career. The laboratory skills that Dr. Chapman will develop will build upon his expertise in RNA biochemistry and round out the skill set that he will need as a long-term NIH funded investigator. The training plan that Dr. Chapman will pursue en route to an independent faculty position will include mentoring by Prof. Jeffery S. Kieft, an accomplished HHMI Early Career Scientist and leader in several fields of RNA-related research. Under Dr. Kieft's guidance, Dr. Chapman will engage in a variety of career development activities including mentoring junior scientists, publishing his work in scientific journals, training in the responsible conduct of research, grant-writing, and entry onto the academic job market. Together these activities will enhance Dr. Chapman's skill set and propel him into the successful launch of an independent academic career."
"9530961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UDP_755 patient presents craniosynostosis, microcephaly, congenital extremity contractures, and global developmental delay. Genomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses by the NIH-UDP program have identified two mutant variants, GBAS (NM_001483.2: c.181C>G; p.His61Asp) and SLC41A2 (NM_032148.3: c.1648G>A; p.Gly550Arg) as candidate causal mutations for UDP_755. GBAS gene encodes glioblastoma amplified sequence, a member of the NIPSNAP (4-nitrophenylphosphatase domain and non-neuronal SNAP25-like) gene family. GBAS is also known as NIPSNAP2. SLC41A2 encodes solute carrier family 41, member 2. SLC41A2 has been reported to mediate voltage-dependent Mg2+ uptake activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The function of GBAS and SLC41A2 are largely unknown and no previous mutations have been identified or characterized. We plan to study the function of GBAS and SLC41A2 in vivo and establish Drosophila models for UDP_755, in collaboration with UDP to investigate the underlying genetics, biochemistry and pathophysiology of the GBAS and SLC41A2 mutant variants. The goal of this proposal is to seek mechanistic understanding of (1) the nature of mutant variant of GBAS and SLC41A2 identified in UDP_755, (2) the normal function of GBAS and SLC41A2, specifically in the nervous system, (3) the genetic interaction of GBAS and SLC41A2 in vivo, and (4) the pathological consequence of the combination of GBAS and SLC41A2 mutant alleles. Our studies proposed here will characterize the neuronal function of GBAS and SLC41A2 and analyze the neurological phenotypes associated with human mutant variants. The result will provide significant and important insights into the function of GBAS and SLC41A2 and the disease pathophysiology associated with UDP_755 neurological disorder. We believe that our multidisciplinary approaches involving several research models are the most appropriate to accelerate discoveries that can be subsequently translated to humans."
"9332760","ABSTRACT Background: The mammalian heart beats spontaneously and autonomously due to few thousand (~10,000) pacemaker cells. Although we have a general understanding of how individual cardiac pacemaker cells beat automatically, there is a lack of understanding in how a few pacemaker cells can drive the beating of the entire heart. This problem, known as a ?source-sink mismatch?, is a fundamental concept that has been difficult to study due to it being painfully low-throughput to study these pacemaker cells. This is because no testable model of the SAN exists, incorporating the cardiac pacemaker cells and quiescent cardiomyocytes. Typically, just a handful of native pacemaker cells can be isolated from the native SAN, and the isolated cell cannot be cultured. Recently, my group has demonstrated conversion of ordinary ventricular cardiomyocytes to induced pacemaker cells (iPCs) by singular expression of TBX18. In this proposal, we seek to engineer tissue models of the SAN by exploiting the de novo iPCs. We hypothesize that 2- and 3-dimensional architectures of the iPCs may serve as in vitro models of native SANs. Approach: We will examine four design principles of the native SAN, i) minimum number of iPCs required to pace a given number of neighboring ventricular myocytes, ii) role of non-myocyte population in pacemaking, iii) shape of the SAN, and iv) the need for exit pathways. Our 2D model will consist of patterned monolayers while our 3D model uses patterned cardiac spheroids. Using routine polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stenciling techniques, we will create a population of iPCs enclosed by a population of quiescent ventricular cardiomyocytes. The major readouts are i) real-time, whole-cell Ca2+ transients of the entire monolayers, ii) fast, high-resolution optical mapping of the monolayers with a voltage-sensitive dye, and iii) macro-scale, multi-electrode array measurements of field potentials. Our preliminary data indicate that iPC-spheroids are viable for at least three weeks. When a cluster of 15-20 TBX18 spheroids was surrounded by a monolayer of ventricular myocytes, TBX18, but not GFP (control), spheroids were able to pace and drive the neighboring sheet of ventricular myocytes. Successful completion of our project can lead to creation of engineered SA nodes (eSANs) that recapitulate the design principles of the native SAN. In turn, this technology provides a convenient platform on which other SAN design principles may be built toward persistent biological pacemakers."
"9349612","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a peak time for the onset of mental illnesses, with anxiety being the most common disorder and affecting as many as 1 in 10 youth. A core feature of anxiety disorders is difficulty identifying when situations that have been experienced as threatening in the past are currently safe. Despite substantial changes in the neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation and fear extinction across development, interventions for youth are largely based on treatment principles studied and implemented in adulthood. The primary goal of this application is to investigate the efficacy of safety signal learning as a novel method of fear reduction targeting the biological state of the developing brain. Rodent studies have shown that safety signals effectively reduce anxiety to treat and prevent the development of new fears. This learning relies largely on the hippocampus, a region that shows significant development from childhood to adolescence. Yet safety signal learning remains largely unexplored in humans, especially during adolescence when anxiety peaks. The proposed research adapts a paradigm used in animal studies to test the efficacy of safety signals across development in healthy children and adolescents and those with anxiety disorders. Aim 1 will examine the normative development of safety signal learning and related hippocampal-frontoamygdala circuitry across childhood and adolescence. Aim 2 will test safety signal learning for reducing fear among anxious children and adolescents and test the hypothesis that hippocampal-frontoamygdala circuitry deviates from typical development in these individuals. Aim 3 will examine how type and severity of anxiety relate to safety signal learning and hippocampal- frontoamygdala development. Understanding these neurodevelopmental changes and the roles that they play in both the emergence of illness onset and in treatment efficacy is critical to alleviating the high psychological and economic burden that psychiatric disorders have on the individual and on society. This project is expected to have direct implications for the timing and types of intervention for child and adolescent anxiety, fillng a large gap in the current literature."
"9346632","Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder featuring devastating clinical symptoms that include motor deficits, cognitive decline, and behavioral impairments. To date, most research efforts towards the development of therapeutic strategies in HD have been largely focused on inhibition of pathways leading to the loss of neuronal somata, failing to address or even consider the progressive loss of neuritic connectivity that takes place much earlier in the disease process. Building on a solid body of published findings and strong preliminary data, this application aims to illuminate specific therapeutic targets and mechanisms underlying axonal pathology in HD. Experiments proposed under Aim 1 will directly evaluate the contribution of JNK3, a potentially druggable protein kinase, to the axonal pathology induced by mutant huntingtin (mhtt) expression in vivo. Extending these studies, experiments under Aim 2 will identify JNK3-dependent alterations in the phosphorylation of axonal proteins induced by mhtt. Together, these studies will help illuminate a molecular basis linking JNK3 activation to mhtt-induced axonal degeneration."
"9330851","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a public health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 29 M people in the U.S. Over 26 M people in the U.S. suffer from chronic kidney diseases (CKD) (3,4), and diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of CKD, accounting for 45% of incident end stage renal disease (ESRD). Among subjects with diabetes and/or CKD, morbidity and mortality is significant, with the most common cause of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The ability to predict which diabetic patients will develop DN or CVD is poor.  Current biomarker standards for DN progression, serum creatinine and albuminuria, are suboptimal. Serum creatinine is insensitive; microalbuminuria frequently regresses spontaneously, and diabetics often develop renal dysfunction without albuminuria. In DN diseased glomeruli leak non-esterified fatty acids, which are then exposed to the proximal tubule luminal surface. Tubular atrophy, a strong predictor of DN progression, is linked to proximal tubule reabsorption of palmitate, which leads to lipotoxicity and apoptosis. Data from a longitudinal diabetic cohort revealed that Upalm:creatinine ratio better predicts eGFR decline compared to Ualb:creatinine.  The causes and risk predictors for CVD in CKD differ from those in the non-CKD population. The serum concentrations of 5 solutes (trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA and ADMA), p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate) rise with CKD and have been proposed as CVD predictors in the general and CKD populations. We developed targeted LC/MS assays for all 5 solutes, and found 2-40 fold greater serum levels in ESRD subjects compared to normal controls.  Hypotheses: (1) Urine palmitate is an accurate predictor of eGFR decline in DN, and is a superior biomarker compared to albuminuria. (2) A panel of uremic solutes (TMAO, SDMA, ADMA, p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate) will have an additive effect to traditional Framingham risk factors for predicting cardiovascular events in a diabetic population. The hypotheses will be tested with the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Test urine palmitate:creatinine ratio as biomarker for DN progression. The correlation between baseline Upalm:creatinine vs. Ualb:creatinine and rate of eGFR decline, will be tested in a diabetic cohort with baseline eGFR >60 using a mixed effects model and AUC analysis of ROC curves. A secondary composite outcome (serum creatinine doubling, eGFR decrease by >50%, incident ESRD), will be analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Analyses will be validated in matched ACCORD trial subjects.  Aim 2: Test a panel of 5 retained solutes as a predictor of CVD in CKD. The discrimination ability of the 5 markers (in addition to the traditional Framingham factors) will be evaluated in an ACCORD cohort with stages 1-3 CKD by computing the increase in the estimated AUC from ROC curve analysis. Computation of the integrated discrimination index will be used to assess improvement due to inclusion of the 5 markers."
"9379082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poorer breast cancer (BrCa) prognosis among African Americans (AAs) compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States is likely multifactorial, including tumor characteristics, socio-economic factors and poor access to care. While there is strong evidence that obesity and obesity-related comorbidities increase BrCa and competing cause mortality among women of European ancestry (EAs), its prognostic role among AAs is uncertain, and potential mediating mechanisms have not been elucidated. We propose to evaluate (1) the impact of body fatness (body mass index, body fat distribution, and body composition) on BrCa treatment received (including chemotherapy dose reduction and delay) and outcomes (BrCa-specific mortality, competing-cause mortality, all-cause mortality, quality-of-life); (2) the impact of obesity-related comorbidities which are more common among AAs, including hypertension and diabetes, in relation to BrCa treatment and outcomes, and whether optimal management of these conditions impact outcomes; and (3) potential mechanistic pathways, including immune factors, vitamin D, adipokines, and indicators of insulin resistance that potentially mediate the effects obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. Estimates of genomic ancestry, obtained using genotypes from Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) will be included in all analyses. We propose a cost-effective study that builds upon an ongoing population-based case-control study of BrCa in AA women (P01 CA151135). Rapid case ascertainment by the NJ State Cancer Registry (NJSCR) is used to identify newly diagnosed BrCa cases in ten counties in NJ. Here we propose to extend recruitment of AA cases up to March 2018, increasing the total number to ~1,700, with ~1,100 cases with blood samples collected 18 to 24 months after diagnosis and ~860 blood samples collected 30 to 36 months after diagnosis. We propose to establish a cohort of AA BrCa survivors to assess disparities in care, quality-of-life (QoL), and survival, particularly in relation to obesity. A baeline home interview conducted shortly after diagnosis collects information on risk factors, including lifetime weight history. Anthropometric and body composition measurements are taken and a saliva sample is collected. Medical records from multiple providers are obtained and reviewed. We propose to collect blood samples ~12 months and ~24 months after completion of treatment to evaluate obesity-related biomarkers, and to conduct annual active and passive follow-up and obtain detailed medical records. Active follow-up will involve interviews to collect annual updates on anthropometric measurements, diet and physical activity, medical history, including information on comorbidities and their management, as well as survivorship factors (e.g., QoL, lymphedema, perceived stress, and fatigue). Passive follow-up will include record linkage with the NJSCR to obtain vital status and time and causes of death for those who are deceased. Findings from this study have great potential to improve clinical management of obese AA BrCa patients to improve the survival and QoL of BrCa survivors."
"9209199","Project 1: Mechanisms of Dysregulated Fibrinolysis in Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy ABSTRACT  With the incidence of multi-organ failure (MOF) after severe trauma falling below 10%, most mortality after trauma occurs early (<12hrs) and is attributable to coagulopathy. However, acute lung injury remains a common sequel and resource consumer in the ICU. In this project, we propose that the cause of acute mortality and late morbidity results from dysregulated clot stability due to over- or under-activation of the enzyme plasmin. We hypothesize that hemorrhagic shock predisposes towards systemic hyperfibrinolysis that leads to uncontrolled bleeding, whereas tissue injury provokes hypofibrinolysis (fibrinolysis shutdown), leading to organ dysfunction and venous thromboembolism. Unfortunately the coagulopathy seen in critically injured patients cannot be reproduced in animal models, thus this proposal relies predominantly on trauma patient assessment, employing animal experiments to address specific mechanistic questions. Aims 1 and 2 dissect the role of the preeminent regulator of plasmin, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), in the blood of injured patients and animals, while Aim 3 evaluates novel tPA/plasmin regulators proposed by the discovery program described in Project 2. Determining the regulation of plasmin and its upstream regulators requires measurements of dynamic and fragile protein complexes in fresh blood. By activating plasmin, tPA appears to be the key factor in humans initiating excessive clot degradation following severe blood loss. This could occur due to excess tPA activating proteins or a loss of inhibitors of t-PA or plasmin. Conversely, any increase of such inhibitors or clot stabilizing proteins would promote systemic inhibition of fibrinolysis. Therefore: Specific Aim 1: Determine if early systemic hyperfibrinolysis is due to unopposed tPA activity after hemorrhagic shock in severely injured patients.  The hypothesis that tissue injury and blood loss lead to opposite regulation of clot breakdown cannot be determined unequivocally in patients, because severe trauma is often a combination of severe tissue injury and major blood loss. Hence, Specific Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms regulating systemic fibrinolysis, in animal models that dissociate shock from tissue injury.  Major trauma releases abnormal proteins into the blood from disrupted cells, blood component transfusions, and reactive stress responses. In Specific Aim 3: Determine the role of novel proteins (Project 2) and metabolites (Project3) generated during shock or tissue injury that modulate the plasminogen interactome and regulate systemic fibrinolysis.  Impact: Since patients can present with vastly different levels of fibrinolysis, and since the phenotype can change over time, each patient must be treated differently as conditions change. The methods and information gained will enable patient specific management to mitigate the consequences of dysregulated fibrinolysis."
"9432421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant gamma rhythms are seen in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia and may relate to memory impairments in these disorders. It is thus imperative to understand gamma rhythms role in memory. Separate fast (~65-100 Hz) and slow (~25-55 Hz) gamma subtypes differentially route inputs to hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory. Fast gamma links the hippocampus to current sensory inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Slow gamma couples hippocampal subfield CA1 with CA3, a subfield essential for memory retrieval. Still, the functional relevance of slow and fast gamma with regard to memory processing remains largely unknown. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that slow and fast gamma perform distinct functions in the hippocampal network, with fast gamma promoting memory encoding and slow gamma mediating memory retrieval. The studies will employ multisite electrophysiological recordings of local field potentials and single unit activityin freely behaving rodents. Specific Aim 1 will test whether hippocampal 'place cells' and MEC 'grid cells' code locations differently during slow and fast gamma, as expected if slow and fast gamma are functionally distinct. Ensembles of place cells and grid cells will be recorded in rats running on a linear track. The track's one-dimensional nature will allow identical trajectories to be compared for slow and fast gamma periods. Bayesian decoding techniques will be applied to decipher neuronal ensemble activity for slow and fast gamma-associated trajectories. If fast gamma is involved in memory encoding, then place and grid cells should encode recent locations during fast gamma. If slow gamma is involved in memory retrieval, then place and grid cell codes should predict upcoming locations during slow gamma. Specific Aim 2 will test whether fast gamma promotes memory encoding using spatial memory tasks. The proposed studies will determine whether fast gamma correlates with memory encoding and also whether significant decreases in fast gamma during memory encoding are associated with error trials. Furthermore, Aim 2 will test whether fast gamma stimulation of the perforant path during encoding will improve memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Effects will be compared to slow gamma stimulation to determine whether fast gamma timing in particular facilitates memory encoding. Specific Aim 3 will test whether slow gamma promotes memory retrieval in the same spatial memory tasks. The studies will determine whether slow gamma correlates with memory retrieval and whether slow gamma is selectively enhanced during memory retrieval in correct, but not error, trials. This Aim will also test whether slow gamma stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals during memory retrieval improves memory in AD mice. Effects will be compared to fast gamma stimulation to determine if slow gamma timing is particularly well suited for memory retrieval. Discovering functional differences between slow and fast gamma is expected to change the field's concept of gamma rhythms and thereby lay the foundation for exciting future discoveries."
"9345669","This proposal aims to develop a polymer hydrogel strategy that can be used to improve the clinical care of patients receiving brachytherapy for gynecological cancers. The biocompatible hydrogel will form in situ after being injected into the vaginal space, and later removed by instillation of water to soften the hydrogel for easy extraction. This Phase I proposal focuses on optimizing the polymer hydrogel strategy using clinically relevant reagent volumes to deliver a product ready for preclinical and clinical testing. The hydrogel will serve as vaginal packing material during cervical cancer brachytherapy, displacing rectum and bladder, providing attenuation and stabilizing the applicator. Current alternatives include packing the vagina with gauze, which is uncomfortable for patients, subject to errors and provides limited attenuation of radiation dose, and a commercially available balloon system that is expensive and cumbersome to use. The proposed polymer hydrogel strategy would provide a simple, customized strategy for vaginal packing that provides attenuation and consistent imaging properties while improving patient comfort and limiting costs. Our team has also developed a rigid, reusable, 5-channel vaginal cylinder brachytherapy applicator to be used in conjunction with the hydrogel for vaginal cuff brachytherapy. This improves upon existing options for vaginal cuff brachytherapy by providing a customized solution that conforms to patient anatomy and offers more precise radiation delivery while maintaining an efficient workflow. The small business and academic partners will work together to translate this polymer hydrogel prototype to a clinical product that is readily commercializable. The proposed research in phase I will focus on (Aim 1) optimization of the hydrogel for use as vaginal packing for brachytherapy and on (Aim 2) preclinical validation of hydrogel application and removal in the presence of brachytherapy applicators in a model system designed to simulate clinical conditions. The phase I research will provide the foundation for a phase II program focusing on establishing safety and biocompatibility of the hydrogel for human testing and designing clinical trials to evaluate clinical application of the polymer hydrogel product."
"9356819","  Project 2 has focused on the hypotheses that: (1) hyperconcentrated (dehydrated) mucus produces airway mucus adhesion/plaques that drive the progression of muco-obstructive lung diseases; and, (2) that clearance of these plugs/plaques will be therapeutically useful in patients with the muco-obstructive phenotype. Recent data have indicated that once mucostasis has occurred, modification of mucus plaques may occur that make them ?permanent? and resistant to rehydration therapies. Our biophysical analyses suggest that mucin molecular weight (MW) reduction will be effective in clearing mucus in this setting without rehydration. Further, Project 2 hypothesizes that by the generation of disease specific models, that effectively mimic the extracellular mucins/mucus targets of our disease populations, will produce useful information to guide the clinical projects with respect to selection of drug doses, dosing frequency, requirement for an active vehicle (e.g., hypertonic saline) and generate data on ?off target? redox effects. In collaboration with tPPG investigators, we have established that in CF (and COPD) MUC5B is the dominant mucin obstructing airways. In contrast, we have identified that MUC5AC is the dominant airway mucin in subjects with asthma. Accordingly, we have generated appropriate cell culture, small animal, and sheep models that mimic the mucin dominance phenotype for each disease entity. Utilizing these tools, Project 2 will measure and compare the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties of two different, but complementary, thiol reducing agent clinical candidates. P2176 is a di-thiol compound with rapid reductive activity (Kcat) whereas the mono-thiol P2114 has a slower intrinsic reductive (Kcat) activity. Both molecules share features designed to retain the molecules on the airway surface and both molecules have their thiols ?capped? by acetate groups that are cleaved by esterases on airway surfaces to liberate active compounds. The relative effectiveness/properties of each molecule will be tested in: (1) in vitro HBE cultures designed to mimic the extracellular MUC5AC/MUC5B ratios of CF/COPD (Il-1? treated) and asthma (IL-13 treated); (2) mouse models of CF/COPD (?ENaC) mice, and asthma (house dust mite treated) to measure clearance of mucus plugs after aerosol drug delivery; and, large animal sheep models, including wild-type, Ascaris suum exposed, and HNE/CF172 treated sheep to measure pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on these data, and GLP toxicology studies, a lead molecule doses/dosing frequency, and a vehicle will be selected. Importantly, Project 2 will also utilize information gained from Project 1/Project 2 studies and clinical Projects 3 and 4 to study backup compounds as improvements in the frontrunner become identified/implemented in the parent thiol compound chassis. Thus the overarching goal of the 2b Project is to identify the optimal drug properties, balancing rate of mucin thiol reduction, duration of activity, and safety, to develop a new class of muco-clearance assisting agents that focus on mucin MW reduction that can be delivered alone or in combination with hydrating agents.  "

The central hypothesis is that guiding clinics in selecting their own implementation strategy, based on the EPIS implementation framework and Lewin?s theory for organizational change, will increase dental providers? uptake of this guideline. The rationale for our proposal is that once we identify an effective implementation process for this guideline, we can adapt the process for other evidence-based guidelines in dental practice. By the completion of the study, we expect to have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a process for developing site-specific implementation strategies and the effectiveness of an implementation strategy to increase implementation of the ADA?s pit-and-fissure sealant guideline among providers in a large, multi-site dental practice. Determining the effectiveness of the process and strategies is expected to have an important positive impact, because it is likely that the findings will contribute toward better oral health for patients through the development of implementation strategies for other guidelines. The goal of Aim 1 is to identify the forces and group dynamics influencing Permanente Dental Associates (PDA) providers? current clinical practices relative to the ADA?s pit and fissure guideline. Our approach will be to conduct interviews, run focus groups, and conduct surveys at each level of four levels of influence. The goal of Aim 2 is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a process for developing an implementation strategy for the ADA?s guideline. Our approach will be to pilot test the process in one PDA clinic. The goal of Aim 3 is to determine the effectiveness of an implementation strategy for the ADA?s guideline. Our approach will be to compare the percentage of 8 experimental PDA clinics meeting their target implementation goal with the percentage of 8 control PDA clinics meeting the lowest of the experimental clinics? goals. The immediate contribution of this study is expected to be the development of a process that creates an implementation strategy that is effective in increasing the implementation of the ADA?s pit-and-fissure sealant guideline in a large, multi-site dental practice. This contribution will be significant in a broader manner because it is expected to have broad applicability in facilitating the prevention and treatment of a wide range of oral diseases through enhanced implementation of effective practices."
"9383127","PROJECT SUMMARY The alignment of chromosomes during metaphase is one of the most well conserved events in cell division, yet the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process are not understood. As cells progress from prometaphase into metaphase, chromosomes are aligned at the equator of the mitotic spindle through (A) the spatial restriction of their movements and (B) an increase in attachments between kinetochores and microtubules. The mechanisms that temporally coordinate the confinement of chromosome movements with increased attachments have not been identified. The kinesin-like motor Kif18A (kinesin-8) is required for the alignment of all chromosomes in mitotic cells, however, the motor's role in this process is not fully understood. During mitosis, Kif18A concentrates at the plus-ends of kinetochore-microtubules, which generate the primary forces that move chromosomes. The proposed studies will address key questions related to understanding how Kif18A functions mechanistically during chromosome alignment including: (A) how does Kif18A access the plus-ends of kinetochore-microtubules, which are embedded in a dense protein matrix, (B) how do Kif18A ensembles affect kinetochore-microtubule-generated forces, and (C) how does Kif18A increase attachments between kinetochores and microtubules. The primary goal of the proposed work is to answer these questions by determining how Kif18A's biochemical and biophysical properties translate to its complex effects on the movements and attachments of mitotic chromosomes. We hypothesize that the accumulation of Kif18A at kinetochore-microtubule plus-ends temporally coordinates the spatial confinement of chromosome movements with increased kinetochore-microtubule attachments through two independent mechanisms. We will use an approach combining single molecule biophysics, quantitative live cell imaging, and structural mutagenesis to test these predictions."
"9530754","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technologies presented in this application have the potential to greatly expand the molecular toolbox available to the researchers and pathologists who analyze cancer patient tissue specimens. Our proposal details the development of a new methodology to simultaneously measure the expression of a large number of genes in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Alternative approaches begin with extraction of damaged, relatively low quality RNA, which limits downstream analysis. In contrast, our system takes advantage of the crosslinked RNA molecules to obtain amplifiable signals in situ, which provides several distinct advantages related to assay sensitivity and workflow simplicity. Importantly, our system utilizes widely available instrumentation and reagents, making it immediately accessible to researchers and clinicians. We seek to achieve three overlapping goals in this project: 1. Development of a robust system to generate PCR amplifiable signals in situ using FFPE tumor sections. The success of this effort will provide the research and clinical community with a completely new method of performing gene expression analysis of FFPE specimens and fixed suspension cells. 2. Integration with high throughput DNA sequencing analysis. High throughput, or next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology for analyzing complex mixtures of DNA sequences. We propose to integrate our new methodology with NGS analysis for the highly multiplexed measurement of gene expression in FFPE specimens. 3. Multiplexed measurement of spatially resolved gene expression. This part of the project is devoted to the development of a novel methodology for measuring a large number of genes in FFPE sections or fixed cell spreads, while retaining single cell resolution of the original tissue. To this end, e propose to adapt recently developed techniques for 'local' DNA amplification. Such a system has the potential to dramatically increase the amount of information that researchers and pathologists are able to glean by analyzing a single microscope slide."
"9360002","PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson?s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ?sensed? by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor."
"9326002","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angelica Roncancio, Ph.D. is a motivated postdoctoral fellow, trained as a behavioral scientist, who is currently working at the Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Research at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health. The overall goal of this NCI K01 career development proposal is to provide Dr. Roncancio with the additional research skills necessary to launch an independent career focused on reducing HPV-related cancer disparities among Latinas. Dr. Roncancio's research examines the psychosocial and cultural determinants of cervical-cancer screening and HPV vaccination among Latinas and seeks to modify health behavior through innovative approaches to screening and vaccination completion. Under the mentorship of Dr. Maria Fernandez she will receive specialized, mentored training in the following areas: 1) cancer disparities in Latino populations, 2) the development of theory-based interventions, and 3) the use of technology in health promotion.          UTHSC-H's rich training environment provides junior investigators with the resources necessary to become independent, productive, and highly successful researchers. For example, it provides outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, manuscript publication, and project management. UTHSC-H also offers a large variety of courses, workshops, and seminars relevant to public health and behavioral science, along with access to some of the most renowned prevention scientists in cancer research.          Dr. Roncancio's long-term career goal as an independent health researcher is to improve both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination rates, ultimately aiding in the reduction of cervical cancer disparity in Latinas. She will develop a research program focused on the development and implementation of innovative, culturally appropriate, theory-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among underserved Latinas.          In addition, Dr. Roncancio outlines four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that will serve as the foundation for an independent research career: 1) to increase her science-based knowledge in behavioral theory and its application to the development of cancer interventions for underserved populations, particularly Latinas; 2) to increase her knowledge in the use of technology in interventions targeted at hard-to- reach underserved populations; 3) to increase experience in implementing interventions in hard-to-reach populations; and 4) to participate in professional development activities related to cancer health disparities. These goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and directed readings, experience in implementing several research projects, experience in developing and publishing manuscripts, and intensive mentoring to ensure that Dr. Roncancio achieves each of her specific short term goals and becomes a successful independent cervical cancer disparities researcher.          The aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) that explains Spanish-speaking Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series, and 2) develop and pilot test an innovatively-delivered IM-based intervention (via video text messaging) for Spanish-speaking Latino mothers to encourage HPV vaccine series completion for their adolescent daughters. This research is both important and timely given the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer's 2012 recommendation to increase HPV vaccination efforts to combat the rise in incidence rates of some HPV-associated cancers and the finding that Latino adolescent girls are less likely non-Latino white adolescent girls to complete the HPV vaccine series.          The proposed aims will be accomplished through four successive plans of study: 1) a qualitative study to identify the beliefs that underlie Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series; 2) a longitudinal study to identify the associations between the IM predictor variables, intentions, and behavior; 3) a usability study to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the video texts to be delivered to the mothers' cellular phones that were developed to increase HPV vaccine series completion; and 4) a longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based intervention that uses video text messaging as an innovative channel of delivery."
"9349375","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbiome represents a previously underappreciated influence on numerous biological processes. While most microbes express determinants that are distinct from self, many microbes synthesize surface antigens that resemble host-like structures as a form of molecular mimicry. Although adaptive immunity can recognize a nearly infinite range of antigenic determinants, tolerance reduces reactivity toward self-like antigens, creating a critical gap in adaptive immunity toward molecular mimicry. Thus, immunological protection against molecular mimicry likely resides within the innate arm of immunity. As molecular mimicry often reflects decoration of microbes with distinct mammalian-like carbohydrate antigens, we screened innate immune factors for carbohydrate binding activity. Our results demonstrate that several innate immune factors, in particular galectin-4 and galectin-8, bind and kill blood group B-positive microbes, providing a mechanism whereby blood group-positive individuals protect themselves against blood group molecular mimicry. As molecular mimicry is not limited to the blood group B antigen, and galectins can recognize a variety of mammalian-like structures, galectins may also provide innate immunity against a variety of microbes that utilize molecular mimicry. Furthermore, as blood group-positive microbes can stimulate naturally occurring anti-blood group antibodies and galectins target these microbes in vivo, galectin-mediated immunity may regulate the development of naturally occurring anti-blood group antibodies, which represent the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and transplantation. Thus, we hypothesize that galectins provide innate immunity against molecular mimicry, which in turn impacts the formation of naturally occurring anti-blood group antibodies. To test this, we will examine the following specific aims. 1) Examine the impact of galectins on anti-blood group antibody formation. 2) Determine whether galectins provide broad protection against molecular mimicry. 3) Define the specificity of galectin family members for microbial antigens. These studies develop new models, characterize new paradigms in immunology, and develop new tools to study host-pathogen interactions with broad implications in transfusion medicine, infectious disease and autoimmunity."
"9389673","Project Summary/Abstract Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of malignancy and a source of therapeutic targets. Progress in translating reprogrammed activities into new therapies is limited by the fact that the vast majority of knowledge in tumor metabolism is derived from studies in cultured cells with unknown relevance to disease biology. We developed methods to assess metabolic flux directly in tumors from human subjects and mice, thereby eliminating artifacts of culture. Our approach integrates multi-parametric imaging of the tumor with intra- operative infusions of isotope labeled nutrients like 13C-glucose. We use information from pre-surgical imaging to guide tissue sampling, so that we can assess the effects of relevant biological features (glucose uptake, perfusion, tissue density) on tumor metabolism. After surgery, we perform a fragment-by-fragment analysis of tumor and adjacent lung to measure fluxes and examine their relationship to histology, genetics and gene expression. Our published work in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated that a) contrary to long-held expectations, these tumors oxidize glucose in excess compared to adjacent lung; b) tumors oxidize other fuels in addition glucose, and regional fuel choice is predicted by pre-surgical imaging; and c) extensive metabolic heterogeneity exists among human lung tumors and even within distinct regions of the same tumor. As far as we know, our multidisciplinary approach integrating clinical imaging with metabolic flux analysis, quantitative histopathology and molecular features is unique. Here we propose to expand our program in human NSCLC metabolism to address emerging, pressing questions over the next several years. We are establishing novel computational methods to better report altered fluxes throughout the complex metabolic networks of human NSCLC. We are establishing a series of NSCLC xenografts from patients recruited to the study, providing us with a biological test bed for hypotheses stimulated by observations made in the clinical studies. In patients and mice, we will examine the evolution of metabolic phenotypes during cancer progression, including by sampling metabolic flux before and after conventional and targeted therapies. We have identified a number of candidate fuels and are now infusing patients with a series of 13C and 15N-labeled nutrients to test which ones are consumed by tumors and how their metabolism is regulated in vivo. Finally, we are establishing methods to disentangle the metabolic contributions of distinct cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment in patients and mice. We believe that understanding metabolic crosstalk between cancer and stromal cells in the intact tumor microenvironment is one of the most daunting technical challenges in the field, but also the best opportunity to make fundamentally new discoveries. Altogether, these efforts will generate a unique view of NSCLC metabolism with an unprecedented level of detail, biological accuracy and relevance to human disease. They have the potential to establish new paradigms in metabolic regulation and tumor heterogeneity and to predict which patients will respond to metabolic therapies."
"9538351","?    DESCRIPTION: Low socioeconomic status (SES), typically associated with chronic psychosocial stress and poor early- life family environments, is a powerful predictor of adverse outcomes, including achievement deficits, delinquency, social emotional distress, substance abuse, mood disorders, and poorer overall physical health. Recent life course approaches to understanding future health emphasize the importance of early life influences, including the pre- and postnatal periods. That is, it has become increasingly recognized that maternal psychosocial stress-more common in low SES groups-can affect the development of fetal and infant systems critical for future health. Low SES has been associated with poor outcomes; however, low SES is not deterministic-not all born in low SES circumstances are burdened by illness. Biological measures of maternal perinatal functioning may help differentiate which women succumb to SES-related stress, an outcome that could pave the way for earlier and more targeted interventions, for them and their children. Two viable biological measures include: 1) allostatic load (AL), an index of multi-system physiology including endocrine (e.g. cortisol), immune (e.g., interleukin 6 (IL-6)) and other physiological systems that respond to psychosocial stress and 2) brain activation measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). AL and brain activation are strong candidate indices to consider when investigating the range of maternal functioning in situations of low SES. They are established measures in non-pregnant samples that go beyond self-report, and it is their biological, quantifiable nature that renders them promising as targets for intervention. With the research and training on this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, I propose a novel approach to understanding SES-based compromised maternal well-being, which is so detrimental to children's future health. Specifically, using extant datasets (NICHD-nuMoM2b-001; 5R01MH092580-03A), predictive validity of AL will be established in pregnancy by examining SES and pregnancy AL in association with pregnancy outcomes such as gestational age at birth and birth weight (Aim 1). Additionally, the association of SES and pregnancy AL with maternal caregiving behavior at 4 months postpartum, controlling for postpartum AL, will be examined (Aim 2). In a new study, pregnancy AL will be examined in association with maternal caregiving behavior and brain activation to infant cry stimuli at 4 months postpartum in low SES women, controlling for postpartum AL (Aim 3). This award will provide critical training and mentorship during the K99 phase that will foster the transition to the R00 phase. The proposal includes a strong team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines, training visits to their respective labs, and coursework and formal seminars at Columbia University. In its training and research goals, this project represents a novel integration of maternal-child health and behavioral medicine research with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide new insights on biological targets for intervention with the overall goal of using intervention in early life to enhance future health."
"9299551","Abstract  The interactions of proteins with material surfaces is a fundamental aspect of biomedical technology, but little is known of the molecular-level mechanisms underlying the binding of proteins to biomineral surfaces. Even less is known of how proteins structurally adapt to non-native material surfaces. The aim of this R21 proposal is to apply a solid state NMR approach to elucidating the fundamental molecular-level nature of interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, that have evolved to interact with biological materials like hydroxyapatite (Hap), and inorganic oxides that are used as coatings for dental implants and scaffolds. Salivary statherin is an enamel pellicle protein that inhibits hydroxyapatite (Hap) nucleation and growth, and is an adhesion site for oral bacteria involved in periodontal disease. Statherin is one of the few biomineralization proteins for which there is an experimentally constrained structure of the surface-bound form. In this project statherin will be used as a model to study how ECM proteins adapt structurally to implant material interfaces. We will focus on statherin?s structure/interactions with titanium (IV) oxide TiO2 , whose properties as an implant coating have been studied extensively. The anticipated outcome of this two year research effort is the development of a solid state NMR-based methodology which provides a rational, structure-based approach for predicting protein binding to and folding on inorganic oxide surfaces and other materials used as dental implant materials.."
"9349613","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying how infants learn words from the language they hear and the world around them, rather than through highly constrained in-laboratory measures alone, is crucial for understanding language acquisition. The proposed research involves videotaping infant-parent interactions monthly over the course of a year (between 6-18 months), during a critical time range for word learning. These same infants, along with others, will be tested in the laboratory during this period to examine their eye-movements and word learning in response to known and novel visual stimuli, in order to examine the effects of experience, familiarity, linguistic structure, speech- sounds, and semantic properties on word learning. The two specific aims of this project are as follows: 1. Determine how infants' daily experiences lead to word learning, with every day and novel words 2. Develop paradigms that query links between visual (perceptual) and linguistic (cognitive) processes. There are three main components of this project: an in-home video corpus, word learning experiments using eye tracking and elicitation methods, and further experiments and computational analyses using the corpus-generated videos. One key set of in-laboratory studies uses the infants who were recorded for the in-home corpus. Additionally, both sets of experiments include infants who do not partake in the corpus study, ensuring the collection of appropriate baselines and independent evaluation of predictors whose success does not rely on any specific outcome from the corpus work. The large video library resource created by this project (including technologically innovative head- mounted camera footage) would add a unique, freely available and sorely needed resource for the research community. This resource would be invaluable for scientists interested in aspects of infants' early auditory and visual home environment. While limited infant video corpora exist, the sort of rich resource we propose to create is currently unavailable. The paradigms developed for analyzing visual saliency and conceptual/ perceptual learning would add to the arsenal of experimental methods available to cognitive scientists. More broadly, the outcomes of the corpus analyses, word learning, and visual saliency experiments will increase our understanding of word learning in specific, and language in general. This is a critical aim not just for language acquisition research, but for the fields of infant development, cognitive science, psychology, linguistics, pediatrics, and speech-language pathology as well. This project provides an opportunity for advancing fundamental theory in language acquisition by establishing a normative baseline, which, in turn will allow for improved assessments of infants from disadvantaged backgrounds, and for infants with auditory, visual, and language-based impairments, such as Autism, as an essential part of future research."
"9300730","?     DESCRIPTION :     Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of disability in Veterans and a major environmental risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. A key neuropathological link between the two conditions, increased brain concentration of amyloid-? (A?), is also a therapeutic target. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a non-invasive therapeutic paradigm that can reduce pathological concentrations of A? in the brain. Our pilot data in uninjured genetically modified mice expressing human A? (hA? knock-in mice) demonstrate that compared to standard (STD) environment, two months of EE exposure reduces basal levels of A? oligomers and improves cognition. Whether EE therapy, alone or in combination with pharmacological treatment, can reduce post-injury accumulation of brain hA? and related pathology (tau hyper-phosphorylation, synaptic loss) and improve neurobehavioral recovery, is unknown. We propose to address this question using well characterized controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in the unique hA? mouse model of TBI-induced increases in brain concentrations of human A?. We will first examine if clinically-relevant, delayed EE exposure (initiated 2 weeks after CCI injury), maintained for either 1 or 3 months will suppress TBI-induced increases in brain A? and p-tau, synapse loss, and inflammation, and improve neurobehavioral recovery in hA? mice (Aim 1). The second major goal is to determine if delayed EE combined with simvastatin therapy in CCI injured hA? mice will be more effective in suppressing chronic injury-evoked increases in brain A? and p-tau concentrations, and improving neuronal, synaptic, and neurobehavioral recovery compared to either therapy alone (Aim 2). Simvastatin has recovery-promoting and A?-lowering effects, and is an FDA approved drug with great translational potential thus we expect that the proposed combination therapy paradigm will maximize the chances of success and favorable recovery in our preclinical model. Thirdly, we propose to investigate the correlation of epigenetic factors with TBI-induced neuropathology/neurological dysfunction and the recovery promoting effects of EE and EE/simvastatin therapy, by assaying histone modifications (acetylation) and DNA methylation in experimental groups from Aims 1 and 2. We will also examine if in the absence of EE exposure, pharmacological enhancement of histone acetylation (through administration of the novel histone deacetylase inhibitor ITF2357) can achieve beneficial outcomes (Aim 3). The results of these studies will a) provide insight into novel mechanistic pathways underlying the effects of EE therapy that are amenable to pharmacological manipulation and b) characterize and test a novel pharmacological intervention to benefit Veterans for whom EE (or simvastatin therapy) is less feasible. In all studies, mice will be evaluated for vestibulomotor function and learning/memory prior to the endpoint assays of human A? (in hA? mice), murine A? (in C57 mice) and p- tau (both genotypes), axonal damage, synapse density, microglia/astrocyte activation, and neuronal loss. Analyses of epigenetic changes will focus primarily on histone H3 acetylation; these studies will be complemented by measuring recovery-promoting molecules (eg. BDNF, NGF, secreted APP?), markers of neurogenesis, and neurobehavioral recovery. Collectively, these experiments will determine if EE, alone or combined with simvastatin therapy, can be of dual benefit by both improving the rehabilitation and reducing the risk of developing AD pathology in brain injured Veterans."

"9240315","Project Summary Hybrid vigor, also known as heterosis, refers to the increase in stature, biomass, and fertility of a hybrid that is superior to one or both parents. Hybrid vigor is a fundamental biological phenomenon that has translational impact on agriculture, food security, and human health. Heterosis is commonly observed in flowering plants and other sexually reproducing organisms including humans. In spite of its scientific significance and economic importance, molecular bases for heterosis are poorly understood. A recent breakthrough finding has linked altered circadian rhythms to growth vigor in Arabidopsis hybrids and allopolyploids. The altered circadian regulation in the hybrids increases expression of circadian-mediated genes in energy and metabolism, promoting growth vigor. In humans, disrupting circadian rhythms causes jet leg, diseases and physiological disorders. A key question remains: how and when does the genomic mixture in the hybrids alter gene expression and growth vigor? Several findings have led us to address this question. First, there is a parent-of- origin effect on altered circadian gene expression and hybrid vigor in embryos, which resembles a classical epigenetic phenomenon of imprinting. Second, consistent with the notion, chromatin modifications and RNA- directed or de novo DNA methylation mediate the parent-of-origin effect. Third, a circadian clock regulator and a histone deacetylase are found in the same complex, supporting an interactive role between chromatin and circadian regulation. A long-term goal of the project is to define mechanisms and processes for improving circadian rhythms and heterosis. Towards this end, experiments are designed to determine if de novo and/or maintenance DNA methylation is necessary and sufficient to regulate allelic gene expression and hybrid vigor and if maternally inherited small interfering RNAs move to regulate spatial gene expression in the embryo. Notably, the parent-of-origin effect is confounded by imprinting in nuclei and by maternal effect in the cytoplasm. These confounding effects will be discriminated using newly developed isogenic cytoplasmic- nuclear substitution lines (CNS); each pair contains the same cytoplasm and different nuclei or vice versa. The CNS lines will be used to make different hybrid combinations to identify the genes that are subject to imprinting or maternal effect. At the mechanistic level, there is evidence that clock regulators interact with chromatin factors. Genetic and biochemical approaches will be employed to determine how DNA methylation and chromatin factors are integrated into the circadian pathway that regulates hybrid vigor. Proteomic approaches will be used to identify new chromatin factors in hybrid embryos, and their functions will be elucidated. Results from these integrated approaches will provide new and mechanistic insights into the establishment of hybrid vigor in embryos. The principles for developmental and epigenetic regulation of circadian rhythms, imprinting, and maternal effect will be directly or indirectly relevant to animal development and human health."
"9349370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to RFA-RM-13-009, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of targeted dosing of oral naltrexone among non-dependent binge-drinking MSM at risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV. Binge drinking (defined for men as drinking five or more drinks on one occasion), also known as heavy episodic drinking, is highly prevalent in the US. In 2010, the overall estimated prevalence of binge drinking (past 30 days) was 17%. Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the 80,000 annual deaths attributed to excessive alcohol consumption. In 2006, the economic costs of binge drinking exceeded $170 billion in the US. National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data indicate that 57% of men who have sex with men (MSM) reported binge drinking (past 30 days). Binge drinking among MSM has been independently associated with unprotected sex and HIV infection. Binge drinking is by far the most prevalent exposure attributed to HIV infections among MSM, who comprise over half of the 56,300 new HIV infections in the US in 2006. Thus, effective interventions to reduce binge drinking among MSM may function as an important HIV prevention intervention by reducing alcohol-related sexual risk behaviors. Despite the high prevalence of binge drinking and the continued domestic HIV epidemic among MSM, few alcohol interventions have been proven to be effective in this population. Oral naltrexone is a low-cost FDA-approved medication for alcohol dependence with few toxicities. Naltrexone is a ?pioid receptor antagonist that attenuates the rewarding effects of alcohol. The standard daily regimen for oral naltrexone hampers compliance and alternate regimen schedules have been proposed to increase effectiveness of the drug and expand the population that may benefit from this pharmacologic intervention. One promising approach is the intermittent, targeted administration of naltrexone, whereby individuals take the medication as-needed, in anticipation of heavy drinking. Preliminary studies have observed that targeted naltrexone is efficacious in reducing heavy alcohol use, particularly for men. However, there have been no efficacy studies that have assessed targeted naltrexone among binge-drinking MSM and no trials aimed at reducing associated HIV risk behaviors. The aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of targeted naltrexone in binge-drinking MSM. Research Design: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 120 binge-drinking MSM to 12 weeks of naltrexone 50mg, to be taken in anticipation of heavy drinking. Ethnically and racially diverse participants will be recruited using Respondent Driven Sampling. MSM will be seen weekly for alcohol-metabolite urine testing, study drug dispensing and brief counseling for alcohol use. Safety assessments and behavioral surveys will be completed monthly. Efficacy on alcohol consumption and alcohol-associated sexual risk behaviors (Aims 1-3) will be assessed using weekly time-line follow-back, screening for ethyl glucuronide (EtG)-positive urines, and computer administered monthly interventions. Tolerability and acceptability (Aim 4) will be assessed through tracking of adverse events and medication adherence. GEE models will be fitted to estimate treatment effects on repeated study outcomes."
"9352820","PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY The Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Diabetes Translation Research (CAIANDTR) nurtures innovative research at the intersection of diabetes, related morbidities, and health inequities, focusing on their prevention, treatment, and consequences across the lifespan. Toward this end, it funds pilot and feasibility projects that develop novel approaches to improving the health of underserved American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. Such investments seed emerging research areas, explore new methodologies, and pursue new collaborations that could evolve into independently funded research or demonstration projects. Pilot data from preliminary studies are also crucial for obtaining significant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), industry partners, and private foundations. Accordingly, CAIANDTR's Pilot and Feasibility Program allocates up to $20,000 per year per project for a maximum of 2 years to support scientifically meritorious studies that rigorously test practices, treatments, educational efforts, and policies that can effect sustained, widespread reductions in AI/AN health disparities due to diabetes. Projects to date have focused on factors related to recruitment and retention of participants and patients; on innovative, culturally informed methods for improving health literacy; on the influence of family structure and processes on adherence to treatment recommendations; on the relationship between organizational climate and culture to intervention outcomes; and on effective dissemination of findings.

"9369398","Genetic engineering is a powerful approach for discovering fundamental aspects of bacterial physiology, metabolism, and pathogenesis. The problem is the vast majority of bacteria that can be grown in a laboratory remain genetically intractable, beyond the power of genetics for elucidating function or for engineering for human use. The challenge of genetic intractability stymies basic-, synthetic-, and translational-microbiology research and development. Researchers spend years constructing ad hoc genetic systems one species at a time, an arduous and expensive process. Here, we introduce a groundbreaking, rapid, broadly applicable technology for rendering any cultivable bacterial species genetically tractable, irrespective of taxonomic lineage or genetic and physical barriers. We expect our approach will transform microbial research in medicine, the environment, and biotechnology. Our SyngenicDNA-?POET (Microfluidic Parametric Optimization of Electroporation based Transformation) platform is a combination of two entirely novel, broadly applicable, and currently unavailable technologies, co-operatively designed to overcome the two underlying causes of genetic intractability within most bacteria. The first new technology, SyngenicDNA, overcomes the complex bacterial defense mechanisms that degrade non-self DNA by using a rapid host-mimicking strategy. This novel strategy recodes the DNA of any genetic tool (e.g., plasmids or transposons) to eliminate target non-self signatures recognized by a specific bacterial strain of interest, thus preventing DNA degradation by innate Restriction Modification (RM) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems. The second new technology, ?POET, overcomes the physical barrier to non-self DNA entry using microfluidics and robotics. ?POET leverages high-throughput microfluidic electroporation to create a transformation platform compatible with 96-well plate liquid handling systems to enable rapid screening of electroporation conditions, two to three orders of magnitude faster than traditional cuvette based approaches. Once established, the SyngenicDNA- ?POET platform will be a resource allowing the generation of genetic tractability in virtually any cultivable bacterial species over the span of weeks, rather than years. As proof of principle, we will demonstrate the power of the SyngenicDNA-?POET platform on the human oral microbiome. The paucity of genetically tractable bacteria is a formidable challenge to deciphering the functional attributes of members of the human microbiome. We will expand the current Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) and establish the Human Oral Microbiome Culture (HOMC) collection: an initial repository of 200 model bacterial strains representing species across six different phyla within the oral microbiome, each made genetically tractable using the SyngenicDNA- ?POET platform. This resource will rapidly accelerate fundamental investigations into the role of oral species in human health and disease. Our overarching goal is to provide a universally applicable methodology to rapidly render most bacteria genetically tractable."
"9357739","Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a major cause of HIV-related mortality in Africa. Successful management of Cryptococcus in resource-limited areas is often hindered by unsatisfactory or unavailable antifungal regimens. In these settings, treatment failure and relapse are common. Furthermore, widespread availability of ART has led to changes in the meningitis epidemiology in Africa. Persons with cryptococcal meningitis now have more complex disease presentations, with 40-50% presenting while receiving ART. Large knowledge gaps exist in the diagnosis and management of increasing proportions of complex patients, in particular those developing cryptococcal meningitis shortly after initiating ART, second episodes due to paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with sterile CSF, or second episodes of culture-positive relapse.  This mentored international research project is a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected Africans with Cryptococcus in Uganda. The candidate will determine if persons who develop cryptococcal meningitis while already receiving ART will have worse outcomes compared to ART-naïve persons in a resource-limited area. The candidate will evaluate whether differential outcomes based on ART status are dependent on expression of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Specifically, the candidate will assess whether persons receiving effective ART will have inflammatory patterns of biomarker expression in CSF. Finally, in cases of recurrent symptomatic meningitis, the candidate will evaluate the role of novel laboratory techniques and biomarkers as more sensitive indicators of infection for rapid differentiation of paradoxical IRIS from culture-positive relapse.  Dr. Rhein's long-term career goal is to become an independent translational global health researcher who bridges the gap between basic science and clinical research, moving basic science concepts to clinical application in resource-limited settings. During his training to date, Dr. Rhein has spent 4 years on the ground in Kampala, Uganda working on cryptococcal meningitis research. This K01 award will provide for mentored career development using a combination of coursework to supplement current knowledge gaps and practical mentored-research experience to build a strong foundation of laboratory research skills in HIV immunology and CNS pathogenesis. The award will build upon existing international collaborations and help the candidate develop experience in clinical trial design and implementation in an international setting."
"9461246","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer accounts for over 18,000 deaths each year in the U.S. with disease progression rates estimated at 60-70% after 4 years. The efficacy of a physical activity + dietary intervention to increase progression-free survival (PFS) in this vulnerable population is currently being tested in a hypothesis-driven, randomized, attention-control study of 1070 women with prior invasive disease [(Gynecological Oncology Group (GOG) 0225 study (Lifestyle Intervention for oVarian cancer Enhanced Survival- (LIVES) Trial]. Here, we propose to take advantage of the trial infrastructure and capacity to collect repeat blood samples to evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings that might explain any changes in health indices by treatment arm over time. The overarching hypothesis is that change in metabolic and inflammatory status of participants, that is expected to demonstrate a reduction in inflammation and metabolic deregulation in the intervention group participants more so than the attention-control group, will be associated with increased PFS. A secondary focus of the proposed work will be the interaction with central adiposity. The Specific Aims include: To determine if the LIVES intervention alters biomarkers of metabolic deregulation in women previously treated for stage II-IV ovarian cancer; Aim 2: To determine if any effect of the intervention on biomarkers is mediated by change in central adiposity; and Aim 3: To determine if any effect of the intervention on biomarkers is modified by baseline central adiposity including exploration of central adiposity using Computerized Tomography (CT) scans. Our longer term goal is to determine whether change in central adiposity, insulin/lipid metabolism or inflammation is associated with progression free survival."
"9332483","Abstract The incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) with vascular degeneration is greatly increased following cerebral hemorrhagic stroke in which cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) occurs in affected brain areas. The most common form of CAA is of the amyloid beta-peptide (A?) type. A?, which is derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages from ?-secretase (BACE1) and ?-secretase, is widely believed to trigger a cascade of pathological events culminating in AD including accompanied by degeneration of vascular cells: vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), vascular endothelial cells (VENCs) and pericytes. While extensive studies on pericytes in CAA have been performed, multiple studies demonstrated that an increasing accumulation of A? in the vessel basement membrane is associated with the degeneration of adjacent VSMCs and VENCs. Importantly, our recent preliminary data showed that cerebral vascular cells from human CAA brains express high levels of ?-secretase (BACE1). However, what causes vascular degeneration or death in CAA remains unclear. We recently reported that a cell death receptor, TNFRI, is required for A?- induced cell death and depletion of TNFRI reduced BACE1. In this application, we will study whether and how BACE1 can be up-regulated in vascular cells and what molecular mechanisms of BACE1 elevation causes cerebral vascular cell death in our new mouse models of AD related CAA. The ultimate goal of this proposal will not only advance our understanding the mechanisms of CAA- induced hemorrhage but, also to, in principle, identify novel therapeutic targets and offer novel alert for potential side effects of BACE1 inhibitors in patients with Alzheimer?s disease accompanying vascular degeneration. Key words: BACE1, TNF? inflammation, animal models, neurodegeneration"

"9361418","Antibiotic-resistant infections kill tens of thousands of Americans and cost our nation billions of dollars every year. ?-lactamase enzymes are one of the most common sources of resistance and are capable of quickly evolving the ability to degrade new ?-lactam antibiotics as they are introduced. Surprisingly, many of the mutations that confer ?-lactamases with new functions are far from the enzyme's active site and have little effect on the structure of the active site, as observed by x-ray crystallography. Such non-active site (NAS) mutations also appear frequently in other contexts, such as the evolution of other forms of drug resistance and directed evolution studies. Understanding how NAS mutations allosterically impact distant sites would provide a basis for predicting new forms of drug resistance and designing allosteric drugs to combat diseases like antibiotic-resistant infections. The objective of this proposal is to understand how NAS mutations confer ?- lactamases with activity against new substrates. A predictive understanding of NAS mutations remains elusive because of the ruggedness of proteins' energy landscapes and the great diversity of mechanisms that couple distant residues, including both concerted structural changes and correlations between the dynamics of different residues. These obstacles will be overcome by integrating novel computational methods with in vitro and in vivo experiments to converge on a quantitative understanding of the full spectrum of correlated fluctuations responsible for allosteric coupling. For example, the research team will apply new methods they developed to facilitate comprehensive sampling of proteins' energy landscapes, such as their FAST algorithm for leveraging Markov State Models (MSMs) to efficiently sample conformations with pre-specified features. In Aim 1, these methods will be used to identify what features of ?-lactamase's structure and dynamics give rise to new activities by comparing models for variants with different activities against the antibiotic cefotaxime. In aim 2, new methods for identifying both concerted structural changes and correlations between the dynamics of different residues will be developed. These methods will be used to predict new sites where NAS mutations can alter activities of ?-lactamases. To test insights from each aim, mutations will be designed to confer ?- lactamases with new activities. Then experiments will be performed to test 1) whether these mutations have the intended impact on the activities of ?-lactamases and 2) whether the designed variants are capable of protecting bacteria from the target antibiotic. Completion of this work will result in a general framework for understanding allosteric communication that will serve as a basis for future efforts to predict drug resistance, design new antibiotics that allosterically inhibit their targets, and manipulate allostery in other systems."
"9416374","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suena Massey, MD is a board-certified Psychiatrist with additional qualifications in Addiction Medicine who proposes the resubmission application for the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled, Psychological Mechanisms in Prenatal Smoking Behavior Change. Based on her clinical work with pregnant and non-pregnant substance abusers, Dr. Massey aims to build a foundation for an independent program of research on the psychological characterization of women who successfully quit smoking during pregnancy as a basis for identifying modifiable factors linked to cessation that can be targets for future interventions. To accomplish this long term goal, in this K23 study, she will combine analysis of extant data in a large phenotypically characterized community sample with state-of-the-art longitudinal repeated prospective measurement of prenatal smoking patterns with a new pilot study. This strategy maximizes impact of the K-award study while providing necessary didactic training and mentored experience in the day-to-day conduct of independent research with a prenatal cohort.  Specifically, she will examine differences in empathy between women who quit smoking during pregnancy and women who do not drawing on a prenatal cohort oversampled for prenatal smoking (R01 DA023653; PI: L. Wakschlag). Guided by these results, she will conduct a pilot study to develop a multi-level battery for assessing empathy in pregnancy and provide preliminary evidence for its utility for use in future large scale studies of prenatal smoking cessation. Complementing these scientific aims, training goals are to: (1) develop sophisticated analytic skills in multi-level modeling, random-effects regression, and creation of latent variables; (2) acquire depth of expertise in multi-level measurement of empathy including direct assessments, and (3) acquire training in intervention development. Dr. Massey's outstanding mentorship team includes Lead Mentor, Katherine Wisner, MD, MS, and Co-Mentor Lauren Wakschlag, PhD, and Advisors Daniel Mroczek, PhD (Statistician, Personality Research), Michael Fleming, MD (Intervention Development), Jordan Grafman, PhD (Cognitive Neuroscience), and William Grobman, MD (Obstetrics).  If prenatal smoking cessation is independently related to empathic capacity as hypothesized, interventions aimed at increasing empathy during pregnancy can significantly improve smoking cessation rates and reduce prenatal exposures to nicotine. Enhancing the unique motivation for behavior change during pregnancy holds the potential to interrupt a devastating intergenerational transmission of risk, while yielding immediate health benefits for mothers."
"9533036","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many organisms employ a fascinating array of gene silencing pathways - including the best- known example, RNA interference (RNAi) - to confront invasive foreign nucleic acids. In 2007, a novel genetic interference pathway was discovered in bacteria and archaea. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and their associated cas genes provide adaptive, inheritable, sequence-based genetic interference against viruses and mobile elements. Over the past 7 years, incredible progresses have been made in elucidating the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas as a defense system. However, the non-canonical functions of CRISPR-Cas components beyond defense, in areas like endogenous gene regulation and bacteria pathogenesis, were poorly understood and have only recently begun to be appreciated. We are using the gram-negative human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) as a model system, because of its clinical importance and experimental tractability. Our preliminary findings prompted me to hypothesize that the meningococcal CRISPR-Cas9 system has alternative roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation and in bacterial physiology. The goal of this proposal is to test this hypothesis and to address some fundamental questions including: How does NmCas9 recognize and cleave RNA targets? What endogenous transcripts are regulated by CRISPR-Cas9? And, finally, how is Cas9 involved in meningococcal physiology and virulence? In the K99 phase of this award, I will perform in-depth analyses of the unusual RNA recognition and cleavage activities of NmCas9 in vitro. In addition, I will identify endogenous meningococcal RNAs that associate with, or are regulated by NmCas9. Moreover, I will also examine how is NmCas9 involved in adherence to human epithelial cells, and search for additional Cas9-dependent phenotypes in various aspects of meningococcal physiology and pathogenicity. With the biochemical skills developed and NmCas9's regulatory targets defined, I will further dissect and reconstitute NmCas9-based regulation of endogenous transcripts during the R00 phase. In addition, new NmCas9-dependent virulence defects identified in the K99 phase will be further characterized during the R00 phase. Taken together, my proposal will shed light on the understandings of alternative roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in gene regulation and bacterial physiology. Importantly, findings from this proposal will be of importance to a wide audience with interests in exploiting CRISPR-Cas9 systems in practical areas like antimicrobial treatments, human meningococcal disease interventions, as well as the developments of novel Cas9-based RNA targeting tools."
"9548420","The Woriey project examines molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that contribute  to drug addiction. Aim 1 will use newly developed mouse models that afford in vivo regulation of expression  of the immediate eariy gene (IEG) Rhebl to examine how signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin  (mTOR) controls dynamic protein translation. In work supported by this grant, we have demonstrated that  Rhebl is essential and sufficient to activate mTORCI in vivo, and have established viable mouse models  that either conditionally delete Rhebl or express an activated Rhebl transgene (Zou et al., 2011). To  explore the role of mTOR in protein translation, we will process brains of Rhebl transgenic mice to isolate  mRNAs that are associated with polyribosomes or ribosomes in the process of translation initiation, and  identify those RNA sequences that are protected from RNase digestion using RNA seq (Ingolia et al., 2009).  Studies will test the hypothesis that mTOR controls translation of a specific set of brain mRNAs, and will test  the scanning hypothesis for translation initiation. Aim 2 will focus on mTOR-dependent proteins that are  generated in neurons, and that regulate myelination in the CNS. Myelination is known to be dependent on  neural activity and is disrupted in patients with drug addiction, however the molecular basis ofthis process is  unknown. Rhebl transgenic mice show prominent changes in myelination (Zou et al., 2011) and preliminary  studies indicate a role for neuron-generated proteins that control the differentiation of oligodendrites and their  generation of myelin proteins. Information from Aim 1 mRNA analysis and direct assays of protein  expression will generate candidate proteins, and these will be tested using in vivo assays for effects on  myelination. Aim 3 will explore the role of a novel protein family termed LanCLI in regulation of activity-  dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS). LanCLI is regulated as an lEG and is highly expressed in normal  brain. We have developed models that conditionally delete LanCLI gene or express LanCLI transgene in  brain and we will use these models to test the hypothesis that dynamic expression of LanCLI is essential for  normal synaptic plasticity and cocaine-evoked plasticity."
"9344636","SPECIFIC AIMS  The overall goal of this project is to develop a better understanding and improved quantitative characterization of the complex dynamics that result from abnormal regulation of the respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic control systems in important chronic diseases or clinical syndromes, such as hypertension. Type 2 diabetes, sickle cell disease, metabolic syndrome, and sleep disordered breathing (SDB). These problems will be addressed by employing a combination of structured (parametric) modeling and minimal (non-parametric) modeling approaches that we have successfully applied in previous cycles of this grant. The proposed project will build on the work that has been accomplished in the current funding cycle, addressing several important issues that remain unresolved and extending our modeiing efforts to more clinical applications. There are three major emphases in our proposed studies. The first pertains to developing models that can characterize the dynamics of the interactions among the participating physiological control systems (eg. respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic and renal) as they are altered with time because of disease progression or therapy. The second lends recognition to the fact that the vast majority of computational models of human physiology (and pathophysiology) have been designed with the adult forms of the disorder or disease under study; in the next cycle, we will devote significant effort to developing models that pertain more specifically to the pediatric manifestations of these multi-factor disorders. A third focus is translate the computational methods and models that we have developed in this core project into clinical applications (biophysical markers) that can be used for early disease detection, noninvasive assessment of disease severity, and therapeutic decision- making."
"9320519","Project Summary  The neocortex contains a great diversity of neuronal subtypes that wire precisely into local and long- distance circuits to execute higher-order functions. To understand the cell-autonomous mechanisms that govern the generation and maintenance of individual classes of neurons, defined neuronal populations have been purified and molecularly profiled across development. However, much less is known about how neurons, once generated, maintain their class-specific traits over long periods of time. Cell intrinsic mechanisms, including transcriptional and epigenetic changes, are being actively studied, yet little is known regarding the role of the extracellular environment. Specifically, the extracellular matrix (ECM) contains many molecules that regulate neuronal function, from migration to synaptogenesis, and its degradation enables synaptic plasticity, wiring, and axonal regeneration, yet little is known about how it influences and is influenced by neuronal identity.  Broadly, the goal of this proposal is to understand the contribution of extracellular matrix molecules to the maintenance of neuronal identity. Specifically, I ask: 1. Do different classes of projection neurons produce distinct ECM molecules that help define the molecular composition of their local extracellular microenvironment? 2. Does reprogramming one class of projection neuron into another in vivo result in a change in ECM composition? 3. Does the ECM maintain projection neuron identity through the lifespan of the organism? Here, I propose a set of feasible experiments to explore these questions that builds upon my preliminary data and takes advantage of the expertise of the Arlotta lab. Indeed, my preliminary data already suggests that different subclasses of neurons differentially express ECM-related genes. Answering these questions will reveal a new role for cell-extrinsic cues on neuronal development, highlight an unexplored form of neural plasticity, and pave the way for reprogramming neuronal subtypes in the adult brain, and repairing tissue and circuits upon CNS injury."
"9381879","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hereditary deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, E.C. 2.7.7.12) activity in humans can lead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving consequences of newborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, many patients with Classic Galactosemia suffer later in life from complications including growth, neuropsychological, and speech delays as well as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). There are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent/alleviate any of these complications. Several lines of evidence, which include the absence of acute toxicity syndrome and chronic complications in patients with inherited deficiency of galactokinase (GALK1), as well as the reversal of glycosylation/neurological defects in GALT-less fruitflies by deleting the dGALK gene, indicated that galactose-1 phosphate (gal-1P), product of GALK1 and an intermediate accumulated in GALT deficiency, is toxic in susceptible tissues and plays a pathogenic role in the organ- specific complications of Classic Galactosemia. Therefore, we hypothesize that pharmacological inhibition of human GALK1, which will prevent the accumulation of toxic gal-1P, can confer the less severe phenotype of GALK1 deficiency and improve the outcome of Classic Galactosemia. To test this hypothesis, we collaborated with scientists at NIH/NCATS/NCGC and launched a quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) campaign to identify small molecule inhibitors of human GALK1. After extensive characterization and optimization efforts of the positives, we have identified some unique and promising lead GALK1 inhibitors with dissociation constants (a measure of the strength of the inhibitors) at the nanomolar range, as well as favorable cell-based and in vivo activities. The translation of these promising small molecule GALK1 inhibitors into useful therapeutics, however, requires further chemical modifications and in vivo studies in a mammalian animal model. To prepare for the testing of the preclinical in vivo studies of selected GALK1 inhibitors, we have constructed a new GalT-gene trapped (GALT-deficient) mouse model. Expanded characterization of the new mouse model revealed disease-relevant phenotypes, which include galactose sensitivity in the newborn mutant pups, subfertility of the adult female mutants, motor impairment and growth restriction in mutant mice of both sexes. Specifically, in Aim 1 of this application, we propose to further optimize the selected GALK1 lead inhibitors to improve their biological activities and drug-like properties; and in Aim 2, we will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the selected GALK1 inhibitors in ameliorating selected disease-relevant phenotypes in the homozygous GalT-gene trapped mice."

In this application, the Frontiers KL2 program builds upon the successes and lessons learned from its first cycle of scholars. Frontiers links more than 200 federally funded investigators in clinical and translational research. These investigators will be leveraged to train a new generation of clinical translational research (CTR) scientists. We have created translational research clusters headed by Faculty Research Cluster Experts who will connect each scholar with a research mentor and mentoring team. The KL2 leadership team and Cluster Experts have created a support system designed to provide junior scientists with the mentoring, tools, and environment they need to become successful translational researchers. This support system is augmented by a rich set of translational research tools and learning experiences. Each scholars' KL2 experience will be driven by an Individual Development Plan (IDP), which prompts the scholar to formulate specific, achievable scientific and career goals. Each objective is linked to specific educational, training, and research activities selected from Frontiers' training opportunities. These opportunities include formal coursework, time-limited workshops, research experiences, opportunities to interact with experts at other institutions, and other activities designed to deliver what scholars need to know, when they need it, in a manner that is convenient and readily accessible. Each scholar will collaborate with their mentoring teams to complete a research project that will serve as an anchor for many of their training activities and as a springboard for an R01-level research application to be submitted within the first 2-3 years of their KL2 tenure. We ask for 4 KL2 training slots, and successful awardees will be able to retain their KL2 award for up to five years. In addition to Frontiers training opportunities, the KL2 program provides bi-monthly Frontiers Club sessions, mock study sections, grant review sessions, and targeted training in team science and career development. The KL2 program also provides support and training for mentors to enable them to provide focused guidance to KL2s amidst competing demands. The KL2 program will conduct ongoing, multi- level evaluation of scholar and mentor performance to facilitate mid-course adjustments and pinpoint effective training components and areas for improvement. Many of our KL2 program components, including the IDP process, course offerings, and evaluation measures, draw from other CTSA hubs, which will facilitate pooled evaluation that will contribute to the science of translational research.

"9385116","ABSTRACT The Clinical and Translational Core (Clinical Core) aims to facilitate patient-oriented research for investigators spanning from clinical translational research to population epidemiology. Resources and expertise will be pooled under the common Clinical Core umbrella to provide a wide range of clinical translational research resources including, but not limited to access to biosamples, technical resources such as sample analysis and biostatistical support and clinical data while increasing the efficiency of operations through expert knowledge for the construction, implementation and interpretation of the studies. The primary advantages of the Clinical Core are that 1) it enhances the quality of the experiments by providing a priori step- wise design process; 2) it alleviates experimental constraints by providing access to a variety of clinical research resources; and 3) it includes an infrastructure for data and sample coordination and storage. The Clinical Core will accomplish these goals by establishing three Subcores: 1) Biorepository Subcore; 2) Human Metabolic Phenotyping Subcore and 3) Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Subcore. The internal and external users will access these resources by: 1) direct requests for biosamples, including tissue; 2) request for clinical and research data from large cohort studies, including BioVU and Research Derivative; 3) requesting statistical support for design and interpretation of new, ongoing or completed studies; and 4) request for analytical resources. For implementation and administration, the Clinical Core proposes to channel all information and specimens into analytical, statistical, and bioinformatics services, thereby enhancing the utility of these resources. The Clinical Core will also assist investigators in the process of communicating research findings to stakeholders and members of target communities that are partners in the research process. In accomplishing the goals, the Clinical Core will take advantage of available institutional resources, such as the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR), Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC) and Digestive Disease Research Center (DDRC)."

Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement."
"9378968","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer Genes and Pathways Research in the newly restructured Cancer Genes and Pathways (CGP) program focuses on the study of biologically significant genetic alterations and molecular pathways that underlie cancer development and immune surveillance. The primary goal of this basic science program is to better understand fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis and cancer immunology, thereby defining new molecular entities that can be exploited as disease biomarkers and/or innovative anti-cancer therapies. This is accomplished through three overlapping research themes centered on 1) genome organization, regulation and cancer gene expression, 2) cellular proliferation, survival and transformation, and 3) tumor immunosurveillance. Key scientific achievements over the prior funding period include advances in understanding mechanisms of damaged DNA repair and replication, identification and characterization of novel tumor-promoting genetic alterations and cancer gene networks, development of innovative animal models of cancer, and determination of pathways controlling B and T lymphocyte survival and activation. CGP membership includes 54 full and 6 associate members spanning 16 departments (10 basic science, 6 clinical) across 3 colleges. Annual CGP total funding for peer-reviewed research in the last budget year was $10.36 million ($2 NCI funding) and $1.99 million for non-peer-reviewed research projects. CGP members are highly collaborative having authored or co-authored 353 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past 4 years, with 17% (n=59) intra-programmatic, 22% (n=77) inter-programmatic, and 32% (n=113) inter-institutional. 49 manuscripts appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor >10). Productive intra-/inter-programmatic and multi-institutional groups are leading advances in mature B lineage tumors (myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) and neuroendocrine tumor research, and making major contributions to other human malignancies including leukemias, breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and liver cancers."
"9388881","PROJECT SUMMARY The Emory ACE joins 12 laboratories in 6 institutions under the auspices of Emory University, creating a center for clinical and translational science built ? from its outset ? on the expectation of transformative impact on the community. These laboratories combine methodological and conceptual expertise in child development, speech science, behavioral neuroscience, and treatment research. The thematic mission of the Emory ACE guides each of its 5 projects and 4 cores: to execute science that leads directly to a future of optimized outcomes for the next generations of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Projects I-III study reciprocal behavior, in the visual and vocal, brain and behavior domains, within the first six months of life, and in subsequent brain-behavior transitions until 30 months of age, in infants and toddlers at low and high risk for ASD. Project IV advances rigorous, randomized-controlled trials for treatment of ASD into infancy and toddlerhood, testing infant and infant- caregiver characteristics that predict treatment response and outcome; its goal is to optimize treatment effects, personalized to the developmental stage of the child, and within the structure of the child-caregiver dyad. Project V advances a nonhuman primate model of social development, interrogating the underpinnings of social disability in brain and behavior studies. Together, these Projects advance our understanding of the developmental unfolding of ASD, and sets the stage for changing its course prior to the point when disability is even fully manifest. Four Cores provide the resources to support these goals, spanning Clinical Assessment and Care, Informatics, Administration and Dissemination & Outreach. In its efforts to meet and exceed the aspirational goals for autism set forth by the US DHSS Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee and by NIMH Research Priorities, the Emory ACE expands a new scientific community, focused on the translational social neuroscience of ASD, in service of children and families. Its ultimate goal is to change the narrative of ASD from one of potentially devastating disability to one of positive diversity, in which individuals with autism are able to succeed despite their learning differences and because of their unique assets, unencumbered by the burdens of language, intellectual disabilities, and severe behavior challenges."
"9407466","PROJECT SUMMARY Over $200 billion dollars' worth of biological products, including antibodies, vaccines and proteins, are produced each year. This continues to grow worldwide at about 15%/year, making biopharmaceuticals a fairly recession-proof, growing and pro?table industry. This shift towards biopharmaceuticals re?ects a fundamental shift within the pharmaceutical industry. Biomanufacturers are under constant pressure to reduce costs by increasing productivity of their cell culturing activities. We believe, by taking advantage of post-transcriptional regulation, that we can achieve a 20%-50% improvement in productive yield, defined as titer, as well as significant reductions in workload and time. For perspective, a 25% improved titer from each cell in production could save $16 billion in biomanufacturing costs. Current biomanufacturing practice is to express a drug resistance gene as a selectable proxy for successfully transformed cells, which are then sub-cloned and screened for production of the GOI. These basic techniques have not changed in any substantial way in over 20 years, but they have two major drawbacks: (1) they require the production of the antibiotic resistant gene which competes with the GOI for scarce translational resources placing an additional metabolic burden on the cells, and (2) the selection marker or antibiotic resistance gene production is not directly coupled to the GOI giving the potential for false positives. Our protocol, PTSelect, uses post-transcriptional regulation as an alternative to using a drug resistance gene by using an siRNA coupled as an intron to the GOI. Rather than force the cells to transcribe and translate an additional drug resistance gene that serves as a proxy for GOI expression, we introduce a custom siRNA into an intron upstream of the GOI. Expression of the tethered siRNA and GOI is thus directly coupled making future selection potentially more accurate. We then use mRNA to perform selection with an mRNA has sequences that are perfectly complementary to the siRNA to induce RNA interference (RNAi) ultimately down regulating the death gene mRNA. Thus, the more the GOI is produced, the more the siRNA is also produced which results in more degradation of the mRNA. Instead of adding a chemical to select for resistance, we transfect a death gene encoding mRNA into the cells, or a fluorescent marker than identifies desired cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), or a cell surface marker gene mRNA coupled with magnetic-bead-Ab to perform magnetically activated cell sorting (MACS). This project will allow us to finished development of these techniques and performa a comparison study between current resistance gene products and our new PTSelect product."
"9548322","Chronic pain affects -100 million adults in the US, and is inadequately treated with drugs, that are often toxic and have side effects (e.g., addiction). Electrical stimulation in targeted nerve fibers is a promising new therapy, but has had suboptimal efficacy and limited long-term success as its mechanisms of action are unclear. Complementary therapies, such as acupuncture and massage that also involve neuromodulation as a mode of action, have not been quantitatively assessed. Critical to advancing pain therapy is a deeper mechanistic understanding of how a nociceptive signal is processed and modulated in spinal dorsal horn (DH), the first central relay station of nociceptive signaling. There are 3 major functionally distinct subsets of neurons in the DH that play different roles in pain transmission. Excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons form important local pain circuitry that modulates activity of projection neurons that send ascending pain signals to the brain. It is critical to understand the specific roles for each neuron subset and the therapeutic actions of neurostimulation, tactile inputs, and drugs. For example, do they respond differently to different therapies? Can certain patterns of stimulation selectively inhibit or excite any subset neurons to maximize pain inhibition? These fundamental questions could not be easily addressed in a quantitative manner before this study. First, experimental barriers limit probing the DH to uncover the circuit topology, because it has been difficult to differentiate different subsets of DH neurons while simultaneously studying their physiological properties. Computational models of the DH, on the other hand, can predict how changes in sensory inputs influence pain transmission, but current models are hand-tuned, assume a fixed circuitry, nonlinear, high dimensional and thus intractable for sensitivity analysis - rendering a computational barrier. We will break these barriers and will construct a tractable data-driven computational model of the DH that enables powerful predictions on how different treatments alter neuronal activity in the DH. State-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques and powerful mouse genetic approaches will delineate the effects of sensory stimuli and stimulation on various subsets of DH neurons, and these data will be used to estimate the parameters and circuit topology of a mechanistic model of the DH. Model reduction will then be applied to generate a tractable characterization of the DH enabling sensitivity analysis. Developing and validating this innovative model will allow predictions that may differentiate various pain treatments and integrative approaches that can be readily tested in animals. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Chronic pain affects about 100 million adults in the US, but remains inadequately treated. Critical to advancing pain therapy is a deeper mechanistic understanding of how a nociceptive signal is processed and modulated in spinal dorsal horn (DH), the first central relay station of nociceptive signaling. We will combine state-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques and mouse genetic approaches with system identification tools to construct a tractable computational model of the DH that will enable powerful predictions on how different treatments alter neuronal activity in the DH."
"9360242","Project Summary (Lin Project) Apoptosis is a cell death program that normally eliminates dysfunctional cells, and hence is essential to human health. Insufficient apoptosis leads to cancer, while excessive apoptosis worsens brain damage after stroke. To develop effective treatments for these diseases we need a comprehensive understanding of how apoptosis is regulated. Mitochondrial membrane perforation is the commitment step of apoptosis that is regulated by interactions among the Bcl-2 family proteins, such as the pro-apoptotic Bax and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. While anti-cancer drugs that selectively target and inhibit the anti-apoptotic proteins have shown promise in clinical trials, limited structural information on the pro-apoptotic proteins has become a bottleneck for development of neural protective agents that can reduce stroke damage. In particular, structures of active Bax oligomers that can form giant pores in the mitochondrial membrane to release deadly mitochondrial factors are unknown. Since native Bax proteins have multiple ways to interact and can generate different types of heterogeneous oligomers that are not amenable to structure determination, an alternative and innovative experimental approach is required to determine the structures of these different oligomers and the giant pores they can form. We hypothesize that: (A) Homogeneous small oligomers suitable for structure determination can be created by using truncated or mini-Bax proteins that retain key interacting regions seen in intact Bax oligomers; (B) These small oligomers will be ideal tools to dissect the mechanism by which intact Bax proteins perforate the mitochondrial membrane, and by which anti-apoptotic compounds target Bax to prevent this mitochondrial leakage and neuronal cell death. Our project for the Oklahoma COBRE in Structural Biology Phase II application will test our novel hypotheses in the following Specific Aims: (1) What are the structures of the mini- Bax oligomers and how do they contribute to the giant pore assembly by intact Bax? (2) How do anti-apoptotic compounds block Bax pore formation in the mitochondrial membrane? In Aim 1, we will use molecular biology techniques to construct mini-Bax proteins. We will perform disulfide crosslinking experiments and size exclusion chromatography to select the mini-oligomer forming proteins and a mitochondrial protein or liposomal dye release assay will be used to identify the mini-pore forming oligomers. We will conduct crystallization trials with the pore-forming, size-selected homogeneous mini-oligomers and solve their structures using X-ray diffraction. If suitable crystals are not obtained, we will measure small-angle X-ray scattering of the mini-Bax proteins in solution, detergent micelle, or lipid nanodisc to reveal the mini-oligomeric structures. Moreover, we will use electron cryo-microscopy to reveal the mini-pore structures in membranes, and mutagenesis to assess how these mini-structures contribute to mega pore assembly by intact Bax in vitro and in vivo. Our collaborator Dr. David Andrews has discovered several compounds that block Bax oligomerization at an undefined dimer stage and protect primary neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity in an in vitro model for stroke damage. In Aim 2, we will explore if these compounds inhibit the oligomerization but not dimerization of our mini-Bax proteins and if so, whether this inhibition is sufficient to abolish mini-pore formation. We will also explore if these compounds force intact Bax into a dead-end dimer that cannot induce mitochondrial membrane perforation and if so, we will solve the dead-end dimer structure. The anticipated project outcomes are the structural details of the molecular interactions that are critical for pro-apoptotic Bax pore assembly in the mitochondrial membrane, and the regulation of this process by anti-apoptotic compounds. The impact of these significant outcomes to the apoptosis field will be vital, because they will reveal the relevant targets and mechanisms for developing better neural protective drugs to effectively combat brain damage from stroke."
"9348031","Project Summary: The objective of this proposed research program is to develop a platform for planning and guidance during Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA). RFA is a thermally mediated ablation technique, where an applicator carrying one electrode is inserted into tumors percutaneously (or via laparoscopy, or open surgical approaches). Radio Frequency (RF) energy is applied, denaturating and coagulating tissues in a volume of 2cm to 5cm of diameter. Some RFA electrodes are shaped as straight needles; others deploy an umbrella of tines to ablate a larger volume. RFA is attractive as it can be used percutaneously resulting minimally invasive. RFA is a widely accepted cancer treatment therapy, and is applied to primary and secondary tumors in different organs, including liver, lung, kidney, breast, and in musculoskeletal interventions. RFA is often the preferred treatment option for inoperable patients. The typical approach for RFA is percutaneous. Physicians therefore have no direct view of the location of electrodes and of tissues. CT and Ultrasound are used intraoperatively to track the location of electrodes, but both CT and Ultrasound (US) have limited ability to visualize the necrotization of tissues under RFA. It is hard therefore to assess which tissues have been treated and which not. Currently physicians rely on ?mental maps? of where they have previously ablated tissues and estimate where to go next. The necrotization volume is also ?mentally estimated? from lesion geometry charts provided in print by electrode manufacturers. These charts show the expected ablation geometry for a uniform tissue and do not account for the anatomy or the presence of blood vessels, which can modify and reduce the ablation volume as they transport heat away. The overarching goal of this program is to develop a platform for pre-operative planning and intraoperative RFA guidance, based on simulation of the electrical / thermal effects of RFA and real-time intraoperative prediction of necrotization patterns. Image fusion of RFA simulations onto CT intraoperative images would constitute a guidance system able to show which tissues have been treated and which not, allowing the physicians to properly repositions electrodes and achieve consistent overlap. This would improve outcomes of RFA particularly for patients with tumors greater than 2cm, for which total necrotization has been shown to be particularly hard to achieve without guidance."
"9529100","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This multidisciplinary five-year program provides integrated training in Environmental Biostatistics, Environmental Epidemiology, and Environmental Health Science, with the goal of preparing scientists to address emerging challenges in modern environmental health research. By constructing a training program that involves collaboration across three critical scientific areas, we have a unique opportunity to advance environmental health in ways that could not be achieved if the training were conducted via three separate programs. Funding is requested for 23 predoctoral (9 BIOS, 7 EPID, 7 ENVR) and 5 postdoctoral trainees (1 BIOS, 2 EPID, 2 ENVR). Assessment of exposure-disease relationships requires understanding connections between exposure, early biological effects, host-factors, and potential interactions with the environment. Thus current environmental health research, whether involving experiments with laboratory animals or observational studies of human populations, is becoming increasingly complex. Across the lifespan, individuals are exposed to multiple contaminants at varying windows of development. These windows may differ in their sensitivities to toxic insults, potentially resulting in different health outcomes. Understanding the relationship between environmental toxicants and disease susceptibility therefore requires sophistication in the measurement of biological markers of exposure and disease processes. New technologies that allow investigators to obtain a more comprehensive estimate of exposure (the exposome), in combination with `omics- scale biological markers (genomes, epigenomes, microbiomes, proteomes and metabolomes) present both opportunities and challenges to the next generation of environmental science researchers. The ability to incorporate these data into a sophisticated systems biological framework is essential and requires cross-disciplinary training in exposure science, epidemiology, and biostatistics. A program that prepares and trains students to integrate these next-generation tools in the ?big data? era is essential to environmental health science research."
"9330857","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dry eye syndrome (DES) affects 7- 33% of the population worldwide and is one of the leading causes for individuals to seek eye care. Patients experience chronic ocular discomfort and have an increased risk for corneal ulceration. Despite its common occurrence, the pathophysiology that initiates inflammation still perplexes many clinicians and investigators making DES difficult to treat and manage. Previous studies suggest that a reduction in the tear film volume stimulates hyperomolar stress and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), therefore disrupting the ocular surface. The mechanism that initiates this inflammation is unknown and is a prime target for novel therapeutic intervention. One mechanism suggested by data from my laboratory and now others, is that toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in DES inflammation by stimulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from stress induced molecules or pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from intact or degraded microbes. On the other hand, since TLRs stimulate an innate immune response against invading pathogens, they may also play a protective role by reducing microbial colonization via the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) when the ocular surface is compromised from desiccation. This scenario is consistent with the clinical presentation of DES, as concomitant microbial infections are infrequent. For these reasons, investigations into the role of TLRs in DES are imperative and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic options for the treatment of DES and microbial infections. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that DAMPs are increased on the ocular surface in dry eye and can activate TLRs to increase the production of damaging proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs while also enhancing pathogen protection through the production of AMPs. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims. Specific aim 1 will examine the involvement of DAMPs in DES and DES-associated conditions. Specific aim 2 will investigate the impact of TLRs on the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs in mice with experimental dry eye (EDE) and in human ocular surface cells. Specific aim 3 will determine the involvement of TLRs in modulating the risk for microbial infection in mice with EDE. With the prevalence of DES expected to double over the next few decades and lack of definitive treatment regimes, there is a critical need to better understand the pathophysiology of DES. At the completion of these studies, the role of TLRs in ocular surface inflammation and infection in DES will be identified, providing new insight into the pathobiology of DES inflammation and infection which will aid in the development of therapeutic regimes that reduce inflammation while not increasing the risk for infection."
"9535531","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career development award proposal (Neurobehavioral Study of Graphic Warnings on Adolescents At Risk for Nicotine Dependence) will facilitate the candidates' transition to independence in prevention research by applying her rigorous scientific training and her recent post-doctoral work on neuroimaging of public health communications to an acute issue of smoking in adolescents. The training phase will enhance the readiness of the applicant for the independent research project through a personalized training program in: (a) Risk behavior and cognition in adolescent smokers; (b) Nicotine dependence; (c) Clinical neurobiology of addiction; (d) Developmental neuropsychology and neuroimaging; and (e) Tobacco control policy. According to the Surgeon General (2012), 88% of adult daily smokers start smoking before the age of 18 and two thirds of them become daily smokers by that age. Despite such heightened vulnerability, neurobiological data on the strategies to prevent the initiation and progression of smoking in adolescents are lacking. Graphic warning labels (GWLs) is a prevention strategy that has been intensely debated in the US. The proposed GWLs consist of a textual warning mandated by law and an emotionally arousing image depicting the negative health consequences of smoking. Dearth of objective experimental data on the effects of GWLs has been cited as a key obstacle to their implementation in the US. This project will take a unique trans-disciplinary approach to fill this knowledge gap at the clinical and neurophysiological levels. Adolescent smokers will be exposed to GWLs rated either high or low on the emotional reaction scale (High ER GWL vs Low ER GWL) over a 4-week period using mobile devices. Dependent variables will be brain response to GWLs measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and cigarette consumption indexed by urine cotinine levels (biochemical marker of smoking), as well as self-report measures of persuasion. Primary (clinical) hypothesis is that High ER GWL group will exhibit greater reduction in urine cotinine and greater intention to quit smoking after the 4-week exposure period than Low ER GWL group. Based on preliminary data and literature pointing to the mPFC and the amygdala as key opponent brain regions mediating brain response to anti-smoking messages, the neuroimaging hypothesis is that acute exposure to high ER GWLs will be associated with stronger amygdala and mPFC responses than low ER GWLs. Furthermore, brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in response to GWLs at the first fMRI session will predict urine cotinine levels after the 4-week GWL exposure. The project will advance our understanding in communicating health promoting messages with adolescents and help development of evaluation for effectiveness of such messages."
"9532338","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although epigenetic dysregulation is already recognized to play an important role in the initiation and progression of many types of cancers, studies on epigenetic cancer therapy have been primarily focused on targeting a single epigenetic regulator to disrupt the maintenance of the disease. The cross-talks between epigenetic pathways that dictate gene expression/silencing and therapeutic outcome are just beginning to gain recognition. This application has immediate clinical relevance since DOT1L inhibitors are now in clinical trials for individuals with MLL-r leukemia. Important clinical responses have been noted with DOT1L inhibitor treatment alone, but there is no doubt that combination approaches will be necessary. The objective in this application is to determine the critical epigenetic effectors and mechanisms that establish oncogene silencing in MLL-r leukemia upon DOT1L inhibition. Preliminary studies based on a genome-scale RNAi screen have identified an essential role of histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in silencing DOT1L-dependent oncogenes in MLL-AF9 leukemia (published in Nature Medicine). This proposed study will further utilize genome-wide genetic and epigenetic research tools to dissect the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the expression and silencing of oncogenes in both MLL-r leukemia and normal hematopoiesis. The proposed application is INNOVATIVE, in our opinion, because it introduces a novel concept of combinational targeting that simultaneously induces and stabilizes epigenetic silencing for profound oncogene suppression. In addition, this research will be of SIGNIFICANCE because it immediately provides novel therapeutic opportunities against the difficult-to-treat MLL-r leukemias by simultaneously activating the oncogene silencing mechanisms. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1. Examine the direct effect of SIRT1 enzymatic activity on silencing DOT1L-driven oncogenes in MLL-r leukemia. 2. Evaluate the efficacy of SIRT1 and DOT1L combinational targeting as a novel therapeutic strategy against MLL-r leukemia. 3. Investigate the role of SIRT1 in silencing DOT1L-dependent genes in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Dr. Chun-Wei David Chen is currently a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Building on his scientific training in epigenetic regulation and experimental hematology, Dr. Chen uncovered and is now investigating the role of SIRT1 and DOT1L interactions in MLL-AF9 leukemia and normal hematopoiesis. His initial achievement identifies cross-inhibitory mechanisms between epigenetic pathways for cancer therapy was recently published in Nature Medicine. His long term goal is to provide novel opportunities for advanced cancer therapies by understanding how epigenetic regulators control gene expression under normal and malignant conditions. Dr. Chen will carry out his proposed project in a stimulating academic environment under the mentorship of Dr. Scott Armstrong, a recognized leader in the fields of leukemia genetics and epigenetics. Dr. Scott A. Armstrong has successfully helped two trainees who have obtained support through the NIH-K99 Career Development Award to obtain tenure-track faculty positions. He has proposed a career development plan to further Dr. Chen's scientific development and to help his transition to independence."
"9344704","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of NINDS is to reduce the burden of neurological disease. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and  disability,  affecting  795,000  people  annually  in  the  US  at  a  direct  and  indirect  cost  of  $38.6  billion.    Stroke  i  a  rapidly  progressive  disorder,  with  brain  damage  being  near  complete  by  3  hours  after  stroke  onset.  There is a major unmet need for safe stroke treatments to reduce the burden of stroke and improve stroke victims' outcomes. We will address  this  need  by  developing  an  emergency  stroke  medication  that  is  safe  enough  to  be  given  to  stroke  victims  in  the  community  even  before  arrival  to  a  hospital  (e.g.,  by  paramedic),  or  immediately  on  hospital  arrival,  thus  arresting  stroke progression within the first golden hour and preferaby no later than 3h after stroke onset. This will be achieved by developing a safe and effective drug that targets neuronal postsynaptic density 95 protein (PSD95), termed a PSD95  inhibitor. We have already developed a prototype (termed NA-1) that reduces stroke damage in animals and humans, but that has the side effect of producing hypotension. This makes NA-1 unsuitable for use in emergency situations. To  improve  on  NA-1  we  identified  7  potential  related  candidates.  Our  objective  is  to  evaluate  each  in  order  to  select  the  optimal Lead Candidate for further development in future clinical trials. This will be done through the followin steps:  In vitro  lead  selection:  The  7  candidates  will  be  evaluated  in vitro  for  optimal properties  that  are  predictive  of  efficacy in animal stroke models and for clinical utility; Lad selection in animals: The same candidates will be evaluated  in rats for lack of hypotension and then advanced to more detailed animal studies that include evaluations of the drugs'  efficacy  in  experimental  strokes.  The  most  effective  and  safe  single  candidate  will  be  advanced  to  the  next  steps;  Manufacturing  and  formulation  studies:  The  lead  PSD95  inhibitor  will  be manufactured  to  regulatory  (FDA/ICH)  standards and used to create a formulation in a drug vial that protects the drug from degrading and that can be used in  an  ambulance  or  a  hospital;  Safety  Pharmacology  and  Toxicity  testing.  This  lead  candidate  will  then  be  tested  in  the  necessary studies to demonstrate safety in animals, and to confirm that it is appropriate for advancement to a filing of  an IND for a Phase 1 human trial. Filing of an IND:  The project will culminate with a filing of an IND with the FDA for a Phase 1 human trial.   We  have  already  successfully  translated  NA-1  all  the  way  from  its  discovery  to  a  successfl  phase  2  human  clinical trial and are experienced in the process of developing a PSD95 inhibitor and the filing of IND submissions. We are  thus  confident  that  this  project  will  provide  a  safe  emergency  neuroprotectant  for  further  development  in  order  to  reduce the extraordinary burden of stroke on our society."
"9317479","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of childhood obesity is essential to the future of a healthy and productive society. It is very likely that obesogenic eating phenotypes manifest themselves before children become obese. If so, identifying these phenotypes early will move primary prevention strategies in a new direction. This study will be the first to use an integrative approach to concurrently study select eating behaviors under states of hunger and satiety and to assess the impact of short-term appetite and intake regulation on longer-term weight outcomes in normal-weight (NW) and obese (OB) children, ages 7 to 9, who are at high risk (HR) or low risk (LR) for obesity. It is important to determine whether HR-NW children are similar in their eating behaviors to LR-NW children or if they have already adopted behaviors that resemble more closely those of HR-OB children, which, if so, may put them on the path to excess weight gain. Caloric compensation, which refers to adjustments in intake in response to changes in the energy density of a preload, will be evaluated in the context of children's overall appetite control by comparing their satiety quotient and postprandial ratings of appetite after consuming fixed amounts of foods (preloads) and ad libitum (free-feeding) meals. The study will also determine if these eating traits predict 1-year changes in children's BMI z-score, waist circumference, and percent body fat. Additionally, this study will assess if eating in the absence of hunger, which refers to children's susceptibility to eating when satiated in response to the presence of palatable high energy-dense snacks, extends to healthier low energy-dense snacks (fruit). Lastly, this study aims to determine the relationship between children's home food environment (i.e., availability of low and high energy-dense foods in the home), eating phenotypes, and 1-year changes in weight-related outcomes. Primary outcomes will include children's percentage caloric compensation index, appetite control, daily energy intake, and 1-year changes in BMI z-score, waist circumference, and percent body fat. Secondary outcomes will include intake of low and high energy-dense snacks in the absence of hunger and families' household food environment. The knowledge gleaned from this research can be used to design personalized behavioral interventions for children who are at greatest risk for obesity that target the individual components of the behavioral phenotype."
"9377046","LAMMER-related kinases play major roles in cell growth, differentiation, hepatitis B virus infection, cancer development and sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs, insulin-regulated glucose metabolism and nutrient homeostasis. Members of the kinase family are subjects of extensive interest because of their potential to serve as therapeutic targets for various human diseases. Despite their importance and disease relevance, considerable gaps of knowledge exist regarding the mechanisms by which the LAMMER-related kinases carry out their functions. Building upon previous work on their functions in cell cycle control and pre-mRNA splicing, the PI's laboratory obtained preliminary data that implicate the fission yeast members of the LAMMER-related kinases, Dsk1 and Kic1/Lkh1, in nuclear export of mRNA and centromeric gene silencing. The primary goal of the proposed research is to decipher the molecular basis underlying the novel roles of Dsk1 and Kic1 kinases in mRNA export and centromeric gene silencing. The experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that Dsk1 and Kic1 may execute their novel roles in gene expression by modulating the activity of poly(A)-binding protein Pabp in mRNA export and participating in Swi6/HP1 phosphorylation cascade for centromeric gene silencing. Molecular genetics, biochemical and fluorescence microscopy will be employed to assess in vivo phosphorylation and cellular localization of Pabp and Swi6 proteins affected by the kinases, as well as to determine the possible kinase-substrate relationship of Dsk1/Kic1 with Pabp or Swi6. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as a genetically and a cell biologically tractable system with small genome size of less redundancy, offers a valuable model organism to dissect the multifaceted kinase functions. Achieving the goal of the research will not only provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of LAMMER kinase function in all eukaryotes but also contribute to elucidation of molecular pathology of the diseases involved and unraveling more targets for developing therapeutics. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the long- term investigation to ultimately address the interplay between the kinase functions in multiple steps of eukaryotic gene expression and cell-division cycle, the fidelity of which is the central issue of cancer prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the educational objectives of the proposal are intertwined with the specific research aims to integrate the project into course-based investigation, to enhance students' understanding of the project themes, and to encourage women and underrepresented groups in science to participate in research. This project aims to provide crucial opportunities for student research experience in the areas relevant to public health, stimulate their interest in sciences, and diversify the next-generation of professionals working in health-related fields. Both the significance of the proposed research and the enhancement in investigative components of science education strengthen the research environment of the Keck Science Department and the Claremont Colleges."
"9462260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Moffitt PSOC Here we focus on two deeply interconnected physical science questions: How do we study, quantify, integrate, and model the complexity of cancer biology and treatment across multiple length and time scales that form the tumor ecology? and Can the evolutionary dynamics of therapeutic resistance be exploited through dynamic spatio-temporal models to optimize treatments and improve the lives of patients with cancer? We propose that cancer must be investigated and treated as a complex adaptive systems in which the underlying first principles are Darwinian. We view intratumoral evolution as a dynamical interaction between environmental selection forces and tumor adaptive strategies to maximize fitness. A critical property of cancer complex system is that it is open and thus can be perturbed by host response and iatrogenic interventions. Thus, the multi-scale (e.g. molecular, cellular and tissue scales) spatio-temporal variations within and between cancers (i.e. the ecology of cancer) is dependent in large part on the open components of the system such as alterations in blood flow that affect local environmental conditions and subsequent cellular adaptive strategies. Similarly, the Darwinian response to therapy will vary within each habitat within the tumor ecology and must be understood to design consistently effective therapies.  We approach these questions in two different ways: In project 1 we focus on fundamental principles - the cancer cell evolutionary dynamics and molecular mechanisms that permit adaptation to host-generated perturbations including blood flow and treatment strategies. Here the focus will be on sophisticated in-vitro and in-vivo experimental methods integrated with Darwinian-based mathematical models. A key deliverable from Project 1 is identification of novel therapeutic strategies that can exploit these evolutionary dynamics and molecular mechanism to improve clinical therapy. In Project 2 we will focus on developing computational models that use first principles and available clinical data to: 1. understand the patient-specific dynamics that govern response and resistance and 2. develop computational models that predict the outcomes of different therapies (e.g. multidrug chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy ) in individual patients. In the longer term our goal is to increase the scope of these models to permit design of patient-specific therapy to optimize overall survival. The deliverable from Project 2, therefore, include development of methods to extract maximum amounts of information from clinically available data and development of computational models to optimize clinical therapy using often sparse dynamic data. Both Projects will interact extensively with a core focused on developing computational models and applying sophisticated analytic methods to extract maximum knowledge from available molecular, pathological, and radiological clinical data."
"9263229","1. Project Summary/Abstract  The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks has surprised the world because of its rapid spread through the America and its association with birth defects such as microcephaly in the newborns and other neurologic dysfunctions in adults such as the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). However, we are currently challenged with the fact that we know very little about the ZIKV functionality, nor do we know why has ZIKV suddenly become so pathogenic. Attempts to rapidly assess the ZIKV functionality is further challenged by a wide range of host cells that ZIKV infects. Here, we propose a unique and combined research approach to meet these challenges. Specifically, we plan to use fission yeast as a surrogate system for the rapid functional analysis of the ZIKV genome followed by immediate translations in human neural cells and a ZIKV infection model.  Fission yeast is a simple and single cell eukaryote that has been used extensively as a model organism to study human cell biology and virology. It is a very well-tested model to study highly conserved cellular activities such as those described ZIKV cytopathic effects on cellular growth, cell cycle regulation, chromosomal biology, and cell death. Thus, study of these ZIKV effects in fission yeast is not only clinically relevant to the ZIKV diseases but we can also expedite the functional characterization of the ZIKV genome.  We are uniquely qualified for the proposed study because we have extensive experiences in functional analyses of viral genomes using fission yeast and in the associated mammalian studies on viral infections. In fact, we were the first to characterize the HIV-1 genome and to develop model systems in fission yeast to study HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) and proteases (PRs). Our study is further strengthen by the participation of a multidisciplinary team whose expertise covering the entire spectrum of the proposed study. Therefore, we should have a high likelihood of success in the proposed study.  We hypothesize that the ZIKV diseases such as microcephaly or GBS are caused by viral pathogenicity factors that are intrinsic to all ZIKVs. Alternatively, new ZIKV variants have emerged as the results of gene mutations that have led to the adaptation of high pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on two Specific Aims (SAs). The SA1 is to quickly phenotype the ZIKV genome for the identification of pathogenicity factor(s), which will be further compared against genetically distinctive ZIKV viral variants to answer the question of whether the observed ZIKV pathogenicity is an intrinsic viral property or the newly acquired viral function. The SA2 is to develop anti-ZIKV drug testing and screening systems against the viral pathogenicity factor and the ZIKV NS2B/NS3 protease, the latter has already been used as a therapeutic target for other flaviviruses.  The successful completion of the proposed experiments will 1) provide a genome-wide description of the ZIKV phenotypes, 2) identify viral pathogenic factors that are linked to individual ZIKV proteins, and 3) develop fission yeast cell-based systems for anti-ZIKV drug testing and screenings."
"9463313","Project Summary In the olfactory bulb, respiration gates windows of activation of mitral/tufted cells at a frequency (theta) similar to the respiration rate. These cells are thought to encode odor concentration through spike timing on a faster (gamma) timescale nested within the theta local field potential. This proposal is comprised of two Aims that seek to support the hypothesis that mitral cell theta phase precession encodes odor concentration. The first Aim employs an optetrode implanted in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb of mice in an odor concentration-driven go no-go task to test for respiration and theta phase coupling with gamma power in the olfactory bulb. Using the same preparation with variable optogenetic stimulus strength (accomplished with theta- and respiration-phase-specific photostimulation of olfactory sensory neurons), the second Aim will test the hypothesis that olfactory sensory neuron theta-activation phase changes perceived stimulus strength. Thus, these experiments seek to disambiguate the previously conflated low frequency oscillations of theta and respiration to determine the rhythm by which stimulus strength is encoded."
"9247581","Project Summary The purpose of each ENCODE Functional Characterization Center is ?to develop and apply generalizable approaches to characterize the role of candidate functional elements identified the ENCODE project in specific biological contexts?. Our proposed Center will focus on characterization of candidate enhancer elements. We will develop, refine and apply experimental methods for functional assays of enhancers. We will use two very different biological models chosen for their high potential to act as generalizable exemplars for the study of enhancers in the context of (i) inherited risk factors for disease, and (ii) somatic mutations involved in cancers. We will also develop and refine our experimental methods in ENCODE cell lines, and we will reserve 25% of our efforts for testing candidate genomic elements that will be studied in common across all of the ENCODE Functional Characterization Centers. Using STARR-seq, and variations thereof, we will test for sufficiency of candidate enhancer elements to modulate gene expression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 methods we will edit the human genome, testing for necessity of candidate enhancer elements in their endogenous context. We will utilize these methods to examine the effects of inherited DNA variation on enhancer function in models of coronary artery disease (CAD), and to examine the effects of acquired somatic DNA mutations on enhancer function in models of pancreatic cancer (Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ? PDAC). While our approach necessarily requires a bioinformatics component to utilize ENCODE and other existing data sets in order to define the best candidate enhancer elements for testing in the specific biological models we will assay, our Center will be focused on experimental characterization of enhancers, testing different combinations of approaches in order to create extensible and generalizable protocols for systematic and accurate characterization of enhancer function."
"9378269","ABSTRACT Tumorigenesis is associated with heterogeneous evolving changes of innate and adaptive immune effectors in the tumor microenvironment. Recording, identifying and quantifying these cellular and molecular changes could transform our understanding of tumorigenesis. We and others have shown that oncogenes, such as MYC co-opt and/or subvert these immune effectors, thereby evading immune detection and promoting a tumor microenvironment that fuels tumor growth; however, this appears to occur in a manner that necessarily and predictably leaves tumors highly vulnerable to acute oncogene inactivation, whereby immune effectors become activated, thereby resulting in dramatic tumor regression, a phenomenon called ?oncogene addiction?. Hence, we hypothesize that the identification?quantification and localization of these different host immune effectors in the tumor microenvironment during tumorigenesis and tumor regression will identify cellular biomarkers that will predict therapeutic response to oncogene inactivation. Our approach will be to employ the Tet system regulated model of MYC-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and MYC/Twist1-induced model of metastatic HCC. Then, to utilize: FACS/CyTOF, CODEX/MIBI, IVM/BLI, and Gene expression/CIBERSORT to identify cellular effectors and hallmark genes and metabolites. First, our transgenic mouse model of MYC- induced HCC has been widely utilized by us and many others. Employing the Tet System, our model exhibit precise reversible and titrable control of the gene expression of the MYC oncogene. Tumor formation occurs slowly over time, oncogene-dependency results in tumor regression that is highly dependent on the immune response. Further, recently we generated a not published mouse model dramatically illustrating that MYC- induced liver tumors rapidly metastasize through the blood stream when combined with transgenic Twist1 expression. Twist1 has previously been associated with metastasis. We have obtained preliminary results that show metastasis is associated with and appears to require recruitment of macrophages. Finally, we have found that we can use human TCGA data available to identify potential cellular effectors associated with the pathogenesis of human HCC. Thus, all stages of tumorigenesis appear to be dependent on the stromal and immune response (initial, progressed, metastatic, regressed) and represent a unique tool to assess tumor- microenvironment heterogeneity. We have three aims: first, to dissect the mechanism by which the adaptive and innate immune system facilitates HCC progression, metastasis, and regression; second, to determine the kinetics and localizations of the above identified cell populations using in vivo (IVM and BLI) imaging technologies with special emphasis on cell-cell interactions and, third, to assess the ability of these findings to make predictions regarding the clinical behavior and prognosis of human HCC."
"9344712","PROJECT SUMMARY HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent in the current era of combination antiretroviral therapy. Despite the persistence of HAND, the pathogenesis of neurocognitive impairment in HIV is poorly understood. Increasing attention has been paid to the role of cerebrovascular injury in HAND. We hypothesize that impaired cerebral endothelial function in the setting of cerebral small vessel disease is a contributing factor to the development of neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected individuals. In China, where the number of diagnosed cases of HIV infection is on the rise and the burden of cerebrovascular disease is high, understanding the association between cerebrovascular disease and HAND is particularly relevant. This planning grant brings together researchers from the United States and China to build sustainable capacity to conduct research on HAND in a resource-limited setting in China in order to reach our long-term goal of developing strategies to risk stratify, prevent and treat neurocognitive impairment in HIV. We will leverage an existing collaboration between the University of California, San Francisco Department of Neurology and the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, in addition to the research infrastructure of the China AIDS Clinical Trials Group, to implement a pilot study aimed at: (1) estimating the association of HIV infection with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD)-assessed cerebral endothelial function measured by cerebral vasoreactivity and (2) evaluating the correlation between cerebral vasoreactivity and markers of brain injury, including small vessel disease, on neuroimaging in a cross-section of treated, virally suppressed, older HIV-infected individuals and demographically-matched uninfected controls; (3) estimating the association of cerebral vasoreactivity with HAND and cognitive decline in a longitudinal cohort of treated, virally suppressed, older HIV-infected individuals and demographically-matched uninfected controls; and (4) developing human resources and infrastructure to conduct clinical research on HAND in Yunnan, China by training local staff in the performance of TCD and neuropsychological testing and in clinical research methods, developing and refining study procedures for participant recruitment, data collection and data management, and promoting rigorous research practices through use of standardized protocols and quality assurance. The data and experience generated from this pilot study will lay the foundation for a definitive R01-funded longitudinal cohort study investigating cerebrovascular mechanisms of HAND in China with the goal of identifying potential preclinical markers of disease, determining the correlation between cerebral endothelial function and disease severity and progression, and testing the efficacy of interventions that improve cerebral endothelial function on HAND for use in HIV populations in China, the US and worldwide."
"9468523","Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment; however, only 15%-20% of patients present with tumors that can be resected. Currently there is no consensus regarding standard of care in unresectable cases, and the use of radiation to treat such cases is controversial because of the possibility of severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxic effects caused by the proximity of the pancreatic head to the duodenum. These toxic effects are thought to be secondary to radiation-induced DNA damage and subsequent depletion of rapidly dividing cells in the intestinal epithelium. Protecting the intestine from the toxic effects of radiation may enable dose escalation that could achieve more effective local control of disease. Fasting has been studied in mice as a protector against the lethal toxic effects of high-dose chemotherapy. In the applicant's laboratory, use of this mouse model to address the mechanism of protection showed that 24-h fasting protected intestinal stem cells after the administration of a toxic dose of etoposide. Based on this finding, the hypothesis of this proposal is that fasting protects mice from GI toxic effects caused by a lethal dose of total abdominal irradiation and allows escalation of the radiation dose for efficient killing of pancreatic tumor cells. Three aims are proposed. In Aim 1, the population of small intestinal stem cell(s) protected from high dose radiation by fasting will be identified and examined for proliferation, apoptosis and DNA repair capacity. In addition, genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will be used to determine if fasting- mediated intestinal protection allows dose escalation and effective treatment of mice to increase survival and overall animal health. Histopathological analysis of malignant tissues will allow assessment of tumor response to radiation therapy after pre-treatment fasting. Experiments proposed in Aim 2 will identify epigenetic changes induced by fasting in small intestinal stem cells as well as associated gene expression changes. ChIP-Seq will be used to identify gene-specific changes in both activating and repressive marks that occur after 24 hours of fasting. Gene expression data will be used to determine which changes mediate increased DNA damage response gene expression changes in these cells. In Aim 3 the hypothesis that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) and beta hydroxybutryate (?OHB) can function as intestinal radioprotectors will be tested. Intestinal stem cell enriched 3D spheroid cultures will be used to screen ?OHB and a panel of HDACi for their ability to provide protection from high dose radiation. Agents shown to provide radioprotection will be further evaluated for their ability to protect against or enhance repair of DNA damage by performing comet assays as well as histological evaluation of DDR protein foci formation and resolution. In addition, ChIP Seq and RNASeq will be performed to determine if changes induced in vitro correlate with those identified in vivo in Aim 2. Finally, agents that are found to provide radioprotection in vitro will be tested in vivo. Identifying the mechanism by which fasting confers intestinal protection will allow targeting with drugs and translation of these discoveries into the clinic, potentially widening the treatment window of radiation therapy for abdominal malignancies, such as pancreatic cancer. The potential to treat pancreatic cancer with high doses of radiation will give clinicians a new tool for combatting this disease."

Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center of Excellence (Center) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) banks and characterizes postmortem brain tissue collected from clinically assessed Parkinson's disease (PD) patients without and with cognitive impairments (CI) or dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) patients followed in Core B as well as multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients in addition to age matched controls. It also collects DNA from these subjects. PD, PDD and DLB (referred to as Lewy body disorders or LBD) as well as MSA are a spectrum of synucleinopathies characterized by alpha- synuclein (a-syn) aggregates in neurons referred to as Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in PD/PDD/DLB or as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendrocytes of MSA. Recent findings suggest that progression of LBD could reflect the cell-to-cell spread of pathological a-syn strains in the nervous system followed by progressive neurodegeneration. Thus, this Udall Center renewal focuses on the progression of PD/PDD/DLB (Projects I/II) and mechanisms of CNS cell-to-cell spread of pathological a-syn (Projects III/ IV). Projects III and IV showed that MSA may result from a unique a-syn GCI strain that spreads among oligodendroglial cells and is distinct from those linked to LBs/LNs in neurons of LBD. Hence, these distinct strains of pathological a-syn will be analyzed in parallel in Projects III/IV. Core C supports the Udall Center goals by implementing postmortem diagnostic criteria for LBD and MSA while also assessing the utility of antemortem diagnostics including studies of potential genetic signatures. Core C works closely with all Cores/Projects to support the Center's mission by improving diagnostic methods, and providing samples of brain tissue and DNA to investigators within and beyond the Penn Udall Center."
"9341288","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the intestine, exposure to commensal microbes early in life is a key determinant in the development of mucosal immune tolerance and homeostasis. Dysfunction of tolerogenic and homeostatic immune pathways underlies a broad variety of chronic inflammatory disorders, including not just Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, but also allergy, and even colorectal cancer. The immune dysfunction associated with such disorders is complex and still incompletely understood, and further defining these mechanisms is of significant clinical relevance. In recent years the role of the microbiome in human health and disease has become an area of intense focus. Although sequence profiling of the human microbiome has characterized the microbial communities present at mucosal interfaces in health and disease, our understanding of the relationship between the human intestinal microbiome and human mucosal immune system remains incomplete. Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous polymorphisms that are associated with altered risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many of which are involved in host defense and may contribute to dysbiosis, a well-established hallmark of IBD. It is not known if dysbiosis is caused by these variants or is a result from underlying inflammation. Similarly, it is unknown whether alterations in the microbiome of IBD patients are sufficient to promote immune dysregulation. Experimental murine models have given some insight but disease signatures in murine models of inflammation often poorly correlate with human disease. Furthermore, it has been shown that development and maturation of the murine mucosal immune system requires host-specific gut microbiome necessitating novel experimental systems to investigate human immunobiology. My goal is to understand the cross-regulation between the human mucosal immune system and human microbiome. I have developed a novel humanized mouse strain that displays adaptive immune responses and can recapitulates a human immune disease when using HSCs with mutated FOXP3. I have re-derived this strain into germ-free conditions to permit defined colonization strategies to investigate human mucosal immune development/function and the dynamics of the human intestinal microbiome providing an opportunity to characterize the developing human mucosal immune system not previously achieved in experimental models. My hypothesis is that both genetic susceptibility and dysbiosis alter mucosal immune development and contributes to aberrant immune responses in the intestine and I will address this in three aims: 1) whether dysbiosis impacts human mucosal immune system 2) whether genetic susceptibility perturbs microbiome stability; 3) whether exogenous administration of microbial byproducts or metabolites potentiates human Treg development."
"9329347","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. Effective treatments for it have remained elusive, and this may be due in part to an incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis on the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. There is data suggesting that myelin and oligodendrocytes may play a role in promoting AD pathology. For example, neuroimaging studies have suggested that white matter lesions may presage Alzheimer's symptom onset by many years. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms through which dysregulated myelination and oligodendrocytes may play a role in Alzheimer's disease.  In order to address this question, we have previously performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis on gene expression data generated from postmortem brain tissue in Alzheimer's patients and non- demented controls. The subnetworks enriched for myelination functions and oligodendrocyte markers contain many genes that have been related to Alzheimer's through both GWAS and amyloid-related pathophysiology. We also found that gene expression across the myelination subnetworks is highly correlated with quantitative measures of Alzheimer's disease pathology (such as amyloid plaque burden and Braak score), and that there is a large loss of gene-gene correlation within the myelination subnetworks in Alzheimer's disease samples. Next, we identified key regulatory genes in the myelin subnetworks across brain regions, some of which have altered gene expression in Alzheimer's disease themselves.  These data take an unbiased approach to suggest that myelination and/or oligodendrocytes may play a crucial role in promoting Alzheimer's disease; however, it is necessary to further test the causality of this claim, as well as to characterize the molecular mechanisms at play that will be necessary to rationally design interventions. The goals of this project are to query the robustness of the Alzheimer's disease risk gene associations, to measure the Alzheimer's disease stage at which myelination subnetworks show the most dysregulation, and to use mouse models to identify downstream changes following perturbations of the key regulator genes that are relevant to Alzheimer's disease. In particular, we propose the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1. Develop robust and high-resolution network models of myelination dysregulation in AD using human postmortem brain data.  Aim 2. Implicate key drivers of the myelination subnetworks in AD pathways using mice models."
"9383213","PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is one of the nation?s most pressing public health concerns and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a significant contributor to adult and childhood obesity. To try to reduce SSB intake, bills have been introduced in U.S. states and cities to place health warning labels on SSB containers and/or advertisements. However, there is little empirical data on how such labels influence consumers. Research on tobacco and nutrition labels suggests labels can positively impact behavior, but the label design matters. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine, before wide-scale implementation, to what degree SSB warning labels increase consumers? knowledge about the potential health harms of SSBs and reduce SSB intake. The studies are designed to answer three additional questions: 1) Do some warning labels work better than others? 2) What is the effect of warning labels over time? 3) If warning labels influence behavior, is it because they increase knowledge or simply provide a salient reminder that some drinks are less healthy?  Our first study aim is to compare the effects of SSB warning labels on parents? SSB-related beliefs and purchase intentions. We will recruit a nationally representative sample of 1,000 racially and ethnically diverse parents of a child under 12 years old to participate in a randomized, controlled online experiment during which parents will shop in a virtual convenience store. Parents will be randomized to 1 of 4 different approaches to labeling: 1) calorie labels (control); 2) text warning labels (e.g. warning: drinking beverages with added sugars contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay); 3) graphic warning labels displaying amounts of sugar in beverages; or 4) graphic warning labels displaying negative health consequences associated with overconsumption of SSBs. The second aim is to test the effect of warning labels on total kilocalories purchased and consumed by parents and children. We will recruit 405 racially and ethnically diverse parent-child pairs to participate in a randomized, controlled lab-based eating behavior study that will capture beverage and snack purchases from a snack shop and measure how much participants consume while watching a television show. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) calorie labels (control); 2) text warning labels; or 3) graphic warning labels displaying either amounts of sugar or negative health consequences based on the most effective labeling strategy in study one. The third aim is to test the effect of repeated exposure to warning labels on total kilocalories purchased over time and assess whether knowledge or salience better explain label effects. In this study, we will recruit 450 racially and ethnically diverse parents to participate in a randomized, controlled experiment that involves buying snacks and beverages for six weeks via an online store that ships participants their purchases. Participants will be randomized to one of the same three label conditions described for the second study. Labels will be removed during the last two weeks to determine whether education or salience plays a greater role in driving behavior change."

Assigning the mechanism of action to botanicals and natural products (mixtures and pure compounds) is a rate limiting challenge for their use and development as supplements and therapeutics. Botanicals and dietary supplements are a particular challenge, as these are often complex mixtures that can change in the constituents and concentration of individual compounds. To prosecute our goal of the chemical and biological characterization of botanicals and natural products with appropriate speed, breadth and precision, we are employing high innovative orthogonal cell-based high content phenotypic screening approaches to return bioactive molecules of interest together with information about their molecular targets. These platforms, cytological profiling (Roger Linington) and FUSION (John MacMillan and Michael White) have been demonstrated to work with complex mixtures as well as pure compounds. While both of these are high-throughput platforms that provide unique biological insight in their own right, combining the output through novel bioinformatic methods will allow us to probe natural products in greater detail. Our deliverables will be a data and data analytics pipeline that will help define the mechanism(s) of action of botanicals and natural products, tools to study synergistic and additive relationships and cellular/molecular fingerprints of botanicals and natural products.

"9389061","Project Summary While the arsenal of approaches to selectively killing cancer cells is increasing, the majority of treatments rely on redox alterations of tumor cells and their microenvironment through chemotherapy, radiation, or some combination thereof. Effectively predicting response to these treatments remains a significant challenge in designing successful personalized therapeutic strategies and currently there are no biomarkers of response to chemo/radiation therapies in clinical use. We hypothesize that the response to redox-based chemotherapeutics can be predicted and enhanced by identifying specific metabolic network features contributing to the redox couple NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H and associated with the specific mechanism of action. We will integrate and expand the scope of our prior successful models of drug bioactivation networks and redox metabolic systems in a comprehensive systems-level approach to improve understanding and enhance prediction of phenotype-specific responses to chemotherapeutic strategies. We will investigate the NAD(P)H-driven mechanisms of response to the quinone-based chemotherapeutic, beta-lapachone (ß-lap), in laboratory models and clinical specimens of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC). We propose to 1) Develop and validate a predictive model to quantify ß-lap lethality in matched HNSCC cell lines with altered redox metabolism and response to treatment (SCC-61/rSCC-61); 2) Enhance predictive capabilities of computational model by accounting for metabolic diversity across HNSCC tumors in vitro and in vivo; and, 3) Test model-based predictions of therapeutic outcomes with HNSCC clinical specimens. We anticipate our study will advance precision medicine by accounting for the redox-dependent mechanisms of action for molecular or systemic chemotherapies."
"9367950","Project Summary Within the last decade, major progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Based on exome sequencing studies and microarray-based genotyping, it is recognized that the genetic architecture of ASD consists of rare mutations of large effect, including structural variants (SVs) and de novo point mutations that impact genes, as well as a significant contribution from common polygenic variation. However, a majority of the genetic risk for ASD remains unexplained. A proportion of the missing heritability of ASD could be attributable to genetic variation that remains inaccessible to today?s high throughput sequencing platforms including a majority of structural variants (SVs) and sequence variation that occurs within repetitive sequences in the genome. A systematic analysis of these novel classes of genetic variation could close a significant gap in our knowledge of ASD genetics. The development of new single- molecule sequencing platforms now enables direct sequencing of long DNA fragments (average read lengths >5,000 bp). These technologies have enable sequence assembly and variant calling within complex and repetitive regions of the genome and have dramatically increased the proportion of structural and tandem repeat (TR) variation that can be captured by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The application of long read WGS to ASD family samples could greatly expand knowledge of the genetic causes of autism. This study will investigate the contribution of complex genetic variants to risk for ASD using a combination of long-read and short-read technologies. (1) We will characterize global patterns of genetic variation in a primary sample of ASD families (N=373 cases, 127 sibling controls and their parents) by WGS using the Pacific Biosciences (SEQUEL) platform, and these data will be combined with an existing WGS dataset of Illumina short reads on the same samples. (2) We will investigate the genetic association of novel classes of SVs and TRs in genes and in regulatory elements that control gene expression, and novel findings will be replicated in Illumina WGS data on 2600 ASD families from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) (3) We will then investigate the influence of novel risk alleles on clinical phenotype in families and experimentally confirm the effects of mutations on gene function. Our proposed study will expand our knowledge of the genetic architecture of ASD and identify novel risk alleles and genetic mechanisms underlying disease risk."

"9356818","Patients with muco-obstructive lung diseases (CF, COPD, and asthma) suffer from reduced mucus clearability due to accumulation of sticky, adherent, mucus in their airways. In order to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is necessary to understand both the mechanisms that mediate efficient mucus clearance in health and how alterations in this system leads to failed mucus clearance in each of these disorders. Our overarching hypothesis is that reduced mucus clearance in disease is a result of multiple alterations in the composition and physical properties of the airway mucus. Based on our preliminary data, such changes in mucus properties come as a result of: 1) disease-related increases in mucus concentration, 2) alteration in the ratio of MUC5AC (the dominant asthma mucin) vs. MUC5B (the dominant CF/COPD mucin), and/or 3) oxidation of mucins resulting in additional cross-links. We hypothesize that such alterations in the mucus layer will produce a more ?sticky? (more viscous, adherent, tear-resistant) mucus that will be harder to be cleared by the action of cilia beating and coughing. There is currently a lack of knowledge of how such changes in the mucus alter the biophysics properties of the mucus and how such changes lead to reduced mucus clearance. To answer these questions, studies in Aim 1 are designed to test the effect of altering mucus concentration and MUC5AC:MUC5B ratio on mucus biophysical properties (rheology, adhesion and cohesion strength, and friction) and how such alterations affect the rate of mucus clearance by cough and cilia beating. Once it has been established how disease alters mucus clearance, our goal, in support of the tPPG clinical projects 3 & 4 is to determine how best to restore mucus clearance in patients with mucus obstructions. We hypothesize that there are two separate, but complementary, approaches to clear adherent mucus from the airways. The simplest is to reduce the mucus concentration, via hydration. The second is by breaking down the structure of mucus through reduction in mucin molecular weight using reducing agents. Importantly, we hypothesize that such approaches may be additive/synergistic. In Aim 2 we will test these hypotheses by correlating reducing agent-mediated changes in mucin molecular weight/size combined with hydration-mediated changes in mucus concentration on changes in mucus biophysical properties and assess the impact of these changes on stimulating both cilia- and cough-mediated mucus clearance. In Aim 3, we will assess the role of inflammation- mediated oxidation of mucus in the formation of a permeant, non-swellable, mucus gel, which can severely limit clearance from the airways. We will test the hypothesis that hydration method alone is not sufficient, but a combination of hydrator plus a reducing agent is required to restore the mucus clearance. Overall, the studies in Project 1 are expected to support other tPPG Projects by advancing our understanding of the mechanism(s) of defective mucus clearance in disease and identifying the most effective therapeutic combination of hydrating and reducing agents to maximally restore mucus clearance in patients with CF, COPD, and asthma."
"9558160","DESCRIPTION:   The Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome (KMC-IDG) at Mount Sinai will assemble, organize and visualize data collected from the under-studied druggable genome from the four families: protein kinases, nuclear receptor, ion channels and GPCRs. The KMC-IDG will also attempt linking such under-studied druggable targets for their potential applications in various diseases. To achieve this we will assemble and abstract data from four domains: proteins/genes/targets, drugs/perturbagens, diseases/phenotypes/side-effects, and data from individual patients. Various pipe-lines and workflow will be established to connect clusters of patients from various diseases to under-studied druggable targets. The Ma'ayan and Dudley Labs are well positioned to carry out successfully this project based on their prior track record of productivity, foundation of source code and data that is already collected and organized, and strong existing user base that can be directed to the newly developed portal. In addition, both labs have a strong track record of collaborations including the computational identification and experimental validation of at least one under-studied protein kinase as a potential important target for attenuating kidney fibrosis. One unique and innovative research component of this project is an investigation into the sources of the literature and experimental biases that exist in the molecular and cellular biology research domains."
"9285247","Project Summary/Abstract Bi-directional vesicular transport is vital in all eukaryotic cells to deliver proteins to secretory organelles and the cell surface, and for release from the cell. It is estimated that 30% of the mammalian proteomes must traffic the secretory pathway. GBF1 (Golgi localized Brefeldin A-sensitive Factor1) is a key regulator of retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER, and GBF1 activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the secretory pathway. GBF1 belongs to a family of large Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and is an enzyme that facilitates GDP/GTP exchange on the ARF subfamily of small Ras-like GTPases. GBF1-mediated ARF activation is required for the formation of retrograde COPI vesicles, and GBF1 represents an upstream regulator of COPI vesicle formation as it dictates the time and site of vesicle formation by restricting ARF activation. Yet, despite the critical importance of GBF1 in cellular homeostasis, we remain ignorant of how GBF1 itself is regulated in cells. Specifically, we do not know how cells signal to GBF1 to ?notify? it of a cellular need for retrograde traffic and what mechanisms ensure that GBF1 initiates COPI vesicle formation only at the right time and the right place. This proposal aims to illuminate this enigma. We will test the hypothesis that cells have mechanisms to inhibit GBF1 activity to prevent spurious ARF activation, but release such inhibition in a time and site-restricted manner in response to a signaling pathway that indicates retrograde traffic demand. Our goal is to define how cells translate their need for ARF activation and membrane transport into space- and time-restricted GBF1 function. We propose 3 specific aims to identify the processes and signaling pathways that regulate GBF1 function in an essential traffic routing in all cells, retrograde COPI traffic that is vital for the homeostasis of the secretory pathway. In Aim 1, we will identify the mechanisms that selectively target GBF1 to Golgi membranes by identifying the intrinsic targeting information within GBF1 and the membrane components that mark membrane sites for GBF1 recruitment. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms that regulate GBF1 catalytic activity at the membrane by assessing the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in regulating GBF1 catalytic activity. In Aim 3, we will determine the signaling pathways that coordinate GBF1 function with the need for COPI traffic by defining the role of KDEL-R activation and the PKA and SFK pathways on GBF1 membrane association and catalytic activity. GBF1 is ubiquitously expressed and critically important to cell and organismal health; GBF1 depletion from cultured cells causes death and a mouse or Drosophila knockout is embryonic lethal. GBF1 is also important in pathological contexts since it is essential for migration of glioblastoma cells and for replication of human pathogenic enteroviruses. Our studies will provide critical new knowledge of GBF1 regulation in basic cellular physiology and will inform strategies for the design of therapeutic intervention to control GBF1-mediated events in pathological contexts."
"9348425","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes pose significant and costly threats to public health in the United States. Food and beverage marketing has been identified as a major driver of obesity and diabetes, with the majority of advertisements promoting sugary beverages and energy-dense, nutrient-poor food products. Studies show children exposed to food advertisements are more likely to request the advertised food, express preference for the advertised food, and consume more food. Adolescents also represent a key target for marketers because of their buying power and influence over parent purchases. African American and Hispanic adolescents are especially highly targeted consumers because they are perceived by marketers to be cultural trendsetters. Adolescents are exposed to food and beverage advertisements through traditional forms of media, and increasingly, through digital media and social networking websites. To assess how exposure to racially-targeted food and beverage advertisements affects adolescents' food choices and perceptions of products, this study will examine adolescents' ratings of advertisements and featured products, and how exposure to advertisements affects dietary choices. Data collection will occur online through Survey Sampling International's database of participants (Aim 1 and 2, outcomes are ratings of advertisements and willingness to engage in marketing promotions) and through community organizations that serve adolescents (Aim 3, outcomes are advertising ratings and actual food choices). Subjects will be male and female adolescents ages 12-17 years who identify as African American, Hispanic, or White, and a subset of the participants will speak Spanish and English. These data will capture how racially-targeted advertisements affect adolescents' food and beverage choices and perceptions of food and beverage products."
"9395351","Project Summary  The epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that has affected the world's populations threatens to become this century's major public health problem. The enormous human and economic costs associated with the epidemic in the US (prevalence of ~28 million, incidence 1.4 million per year) are related primarily to the development of long-term complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy that cause more cases of blindness, renal failure, and amputations than any other disease. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased 2-5 fold in T2DM and is the leading cause of premature death. High quality clinical trials have established the importance of lowering glycemia to reduce long-term complications. Progression of T2DM usually requires addition of a second agent to metformin, the accepted first line treatment. With the development of numerous new classes of glucose-lowering drugs, evidence to guide the choice of the second agent is lacking, prompting the proliferation of conflicting guidelines that acknowledge this deficiency. Moreover, while these agents are typically used for many years, data on long-term use are non-existent. Comparative effectiveness research is a high priority to improve public health and maximize cost-effectiveness in the treatment of T2DM. In addition, efforts to individualize T2DM therapy and determine whether selected therapies work better in some patients than others are needed, as are studies to understand differential effects of various therapies on metabolism over time.  The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) Study will address these questions in a randomized, pragmatic clinical trial in ~5000 patients with recent-onset (<10 years duration) T2DM. GRADE will compare the metabolic effects of four common glucose-lowering medications, the sulfonylurea glimepiride, DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, GLP-1 agonist liraglutide, and basal insulin glargine, added to metformin, over a clinically meaningful duration, with a mean follow-up of approximately 4.8 (4-7.5) years. The primary outcome is the time to primary metabolic failure (hemoglobin A1c (A1C)>7%, subsequently confirmed).Other outcomes include mean A1C; time to a secondary metabolic outcome of A1C>7.5%, confirmed, after which basal insulin ?rescue? therapy will be added; and adverse effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia, effects on selected microvascular disease and CVD risk factors, tolerability and quality-of-life, and cost and cost-effectiveness. We will also examine the phenotypic characteristics and pathophysiologic factors associated with metabolic response to and/or failure of the drug combinations."

"9344657","Project Summary/Abstract HIV incidence rates during the postpartum period for South African women are among the highest in the world. Little is known, however, about the sexual behaviors that put women at risk of HIV infection postpartum and how these behaviors differ for younger and older women. Theoretical and empirical research on HIV risk outside of the postpartum period suggests relationship power is key to understanding risk, and that younger woman, and especially those with the fewest resources, may have less relationship power and greater risk due to their age. However, the role of relationship power in predicting women?s HIV risk during the postpartum period has not been studied. It is also unclear with regard to age whether it is women?s absolute age, where she is at in the life course (e.g., is she a first time parent), whether it is the age- disparity in her relationship, or whether it is age in conjunction with a lack of resources that influences her risk. Therefore, we propose new research to understand how age influences HIV risk (measured in this study through unsafe sexual behavior and STI incidence postpartum), and the extent to which the association between age and HIV risk may be explained by differences in relationship power among women with varying levels of resources. To test our hypotheses, we will conduct secondary data analysis with 945 HIV- women between the ages of 14-45 using SAHAPS data. SAHAPS was an intervention trial with 1,520 HIV+ and HIV- women designed to evaluate a model of psychosocial support. In SAHAPS, we assessed the efficacy of the intervention on STIs and inconsistent condom use postpartum but did not comprehensively describe sexual behavior or assess factors associated with HIV risk postpartum. Therefore, the specific aims of the proposed research are to (1a) Develop a classification system of women connected to developmental stage; (1b) Assess whether women?s age, developmental stage, and age relative to her partner (age-disparity) are each associated with STI incidence at 14 weeks postpartum and sexual behaviors at 14 weeks and 9 months postpartum; (2) Determine whether the association between age/developmental stage/age-disparity and STIs/sexual behavior is exacerbated for women with fewer resources and (3) Determine whether relationship power during pregnancy mediates the association between women?s age/developmental stage/age-disparity and STI incidence at 14 weeks postpartum and sexual behavior at 14 weeks postpartum and 9 months postpartum. The findings will help the Principal Investigator, an early stage investigator, move forward with her program of research to design developmentally appropriate interventions tailored to HIV- women seeking postpartum care."
"9279711","Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death and include the unintentional, accidental discharge of a firearm by a toddler with a playmate, the use of a firearm to self-inflict harm by a suicidal teen, and the escalation of bullying or dating violence to lethal means by an adolescent. Substantial disparities exist in firearm-related injuries, with African-American children disproportionally impacted by unintentional and assaultive firearm injury, and rural youth disproportionately dying of suicide by firearm. Childhood firearm injury rates have remained unchanged in the recent decades despite significant reductions in non-firearm fatal injuries due to an approach that includes improved epidemiologic data, behavior modifications, and technological solutions. In contrast, research funding and publications for firearm injury have lagged, leading to a current deficit of both established and developing researchers, as well as a lack of pilot work and literature needed to support large scale studies. A 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report detailed the urgent need for novel and innovative research to address this deficit, however, was primarily focused on adult populations. This proposal builds on these IOM recommendations and utilizes multidisciplinary research expertise across the U.S., as well as stakeholder partner groups of gun owners, to catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention with the overarching goal of reducing firearm injuries among children while also respecting gun ownership as an important part of the cultural fabric of US society. Our specific aims are: Aim #1: Create a multidisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholder partners to define a pediatric-specific firearm injury research agenda for the five workgroups; Aim #2: Stimulate novel firearm prevention research by having workgroups conduct pilot studies that address key research questions identified in Aim 1, to provide preliminary data that informs large-scale studies; Aim #3: Improve access to and use of national firearm data and ease future secondary analyses by: 1) Establishing a web-based searchable data archive for childhood firearm injury that is enabled with variable-level searching and cross-study comparisons; and, 2) Enhancing and improving pediatric firearm injury data collection in existing pediatric datasets such as the PECARN core data project and the PECARN registry database; Aim #4: Build a cadre of national research scholars with multidisciplinary training and expertise that will serve as an emerging pipeline for future research. Expected outcomes of this five-year grant will be to create six research resources: 1) consensus documents detailing the state of the science and key research questions for pediatric firearm injury prevention; 2) pilot data to support five large-scale research proposals; 3) a web-based data archive and searchable research repository on childhood firearm injury; 4) enhanced data collection opportunities on childhood firearm injuries through existing national networks (e.g., PECARN); 5) a cadre of new researchers (postdoctoral students) focused in this research area; and 6) a webinar series to inform researchers nationally in this topic area."

"9340177","Project Summary/Abstract Despite years of development, currently available continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) still lack good accuracy and reliability for short-term and particularly, long-term use in diabetes management. While insulin pumps work well, CGM remains the single largest hurdle to closing the loop of an artificial pancreas. The main obstacles to achieving a long-term, accurate CGM are instabilities in the sensing chemistry and the body?s immune response against the sensor ? specifically the foreign body response (FBR) ? leading to biofouling, inflammation, avascular fibrosis and sensing chemistry degradation. Additionally, current CGM systems in the market and under development are either bulky percutaneous probes or implantable devices encased in hard metals or plastics that become surrounded by an avascular tissue capsule over time or are taken up by immune cells (if nano-sized). In this Phase II SBIR, we propose to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of a minimally invasive, long-term, non-enzymatic glucose sensor produced using our novel, tissue-integrating ?smart? hydrogels that become part of the tissue they are sensing to overcome the FBR. The near infra-red (NIR) fluorescence of the ?smart? hydrogel modulates based on the glucose concentration and is detected non- invasively through the skin with an optical reader. The long-term, vascularizing nature of these hydrogel sensors provides exquisite capillary proximity to more than 1000 times greater sensor surface area compared to traditional electrochemical sensors, thereby overcoming the FBR and enhancing accuracy and longevity of glucose detection. The proposed CGM system contains no implanted electronics or hardware in the body. Profusa?s long-term goal is to develop a self-calibrating, injectable, soft hydrogel CGM with a minimum operational life of 3 months and a longer-term goal of 12 months with sufficient accuracy to enable an artificial pancreas. Moreover, because of the platform-nature of this technology, sensing moieties specific to other analytes (e.g. oxygen, lactate) can also be incorporated within the hydrogel matrix. Profusa?s tissue-integrating sensor platform has been demonstrated to be stable in the body for months to years and to provide superior sensing performance compared to solid, non-tissue integrating sensors. The overall focus of this proposal is to transition the 90 day in vitro success from Phase I to an in vivo pre-clinical model over 90 days. In addition to demonstrating safety and feasibility, we aim to improve human factors of our glucose sensors by engineering a significant reduction in sensor size (7/8 less volume to minimize materials placed in the body and injection needle size cut in half to minimize sensation upon injection). The ultimate objective is to achieve stable sensor response over 3 months with an error comparable to leading percutaneous continuous glucose monitors. Refinement of fluorescent tissue-intergrating sensors promises to open a whole new sensing modality for diabetes management and health monitoring."

We propose three primary ways in which we plan to develop, use, and extend the data exchange standards that make it easier for other bioinformaticians to both use our data and make their own data available in the Genome Browser. We plan to further develop our widely adopted track and assembly hub systems that group together genomics files in an organized fashion and label them for browser display, in particular by extending the representation of metadata (such as biosample sources and treatments) in hubs, and expanding our search capabilities. We will continue to work with ontology groups to incorporate their controlled vocabularies into relevant fields of our metadata. We will closely collaborate with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) project to ensure that their APIs are sufficiently flexible to express our data sets and to develop a JSON-based web services API to our databases. We plan to maintain and improve the quality of our software through the continued use of good engineering practices, including the appropriate use of functional programming approaches to minimize code side effects and maximize parallel processing potential. We will continue to employ incremental, object-oriented, modular programming techniques and unit tests to maintain code quality, as well as our weekly paired-review process that ensures a thorough review of new code and helps distribute knowledge of the code base throughout our organization. Augmenting our engineering practices, we will continue to maintain a separate quality assurance group that applies a combination of automated and manual testing to check the quality of the software and data released on our website. The Genome Browser production and development environments are supported by several mid-range server- grade computers and a variety of storage subsystems chosen with good price/performance ratios in mind. We plan to reconfigure our system to reduce single points of failure and increase parallelism, and will reduce our need for a large compute cluster by making increased use of the cloud for large bursts of computation, such as that associated with our multiple genome alignment pipeline."
"9557693","Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Studies of Methylphenidate Extended Release Products in  Pediatric Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (U01) Summary/Abstract We propose to conduct a prospective pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) study of long acting methylphenidate (MPH) formulations in pediatric ADHD patients to examine novel PK parameters beyond AUC and Cmax, traditionally used to determine generic equivalency. Long acting MPH formulations considered equivalent by PK (AUC and Cmax) were shown to be significantly different in PD for onset, midday effectiveness as well as offset. To address these limitations, we propose to test the PK/PD relationship of MPH in three distinct PK profiles (shapes): 1) gradual onset with ascending kinetics (OROS); 2) rapid onset with biphasic pulse delivery kinetics (two peaks and troughs; Ritalin LA); 3) rapid onset with one pulse delivery kinetics (one peak; Quillivant XR). In each model, we will separately assess the initial (onset), middle and terminal (offset) portions of the PK/PD relationship as assessed through an analogue laboratory classroom methodology. A disease?drug?trial model paradigm will be applied to the data to integrate MPH PK findings, covariates, time course of clinical outcomes, placebo effects, drug's pharmacologic effects, and trial execution characteristics. This approach will provide guidance for the evaluation of the impact of different concentration- time profiles on the PD effect of MPH extended release products (1). A population PK/PD model will be developed using individual observations collected in the target pediatric population to explain the drug response accounting for the placebo effect and for the time varying response of MPH (tachyphylaxis). A previously developed PK/PD model (2) was implemented using a meta-analytic approach using mean data extracted from published papers. This model was able to predict pediatric PD [both math tests (PERMP) and behavioral ratings (SKAMP)] from adult PK data. To improve upon limitations of this model, we propose to generalize the model by using pediatric PK instead of adult PK and, most importantly, to use individual PK and PD measurements rather than relying on mean observations as well as to separately address onset, midday and offset. Our overarching objective is to provide a validated model appropriate for predicting, with a known uncertainty level, the impact of a given PK profile on the therapeutic equivalence of MPH extended release products. The findings from this proposed novel PK/PD study will help establish scientific and regulatory standards for assuring therapeutic equivalence of generic methylphenidate extended release products."
"9461940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is a global scourge responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide and ~160,000 deaths in the USA this year alone. Despite the grim clinical picture, cancer genetics has revealed that lung cancers can be divided into genetically-defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical deployment of new first-line pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. However, to date, only a minority of such patients have benefitted from these advances such that treatment options for most patients remain poor and are limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to normal cells. The overarching, long-term goal of this research is to aid the deployment of rational, evidence-based therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer patients. However, the immediate objectives of this proposal are to mechanistically define how parallel pathways, such as WNT?ß-catenin?c-MYC or PI3'-kinase?PDK?AKT signaling, cooperate with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. To do so we will use: State-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer; Lung cancer- derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant genetic abnormalities; Pathway-targeted therapeutics, many of which are in cancer clinical trials and one of which is specifically being tested in lung cancer and; An innovative transposon mutagenesis system to simultaneously elicit lung cancer progression and identify its underlying genetic cause. Building on a solid foundation of studies published in the previous cycle of this grant, in Aim 1 we will identify the tumor cell autonomous mechanisms by which WNT?ß-catenin signaling cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms by which PI3'-kinase signaling promotes the proliferative expansion and maintenance of both early- and late-stage BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors remain uniformly benign unless cooperating genomic events unleash malignant progression. In Aim 3 document the use of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to promote progression of BRAFV600E- driven lung cancers. Genetic progression factors identified will be validated using lentivirus-mediated cDNA expression or by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing in the mouse lung. Moreover, we will mine the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma genome, RNA sequencing and RPPA databases to credential genes implicated in our SB screen in mice as being directly relevant to bona fide human lung cancer. Finally, although this proposal is focused primarily on studies of genetic cooperation in the genesis of lung cancer, we will test the anti-tumor effects of novel pathway-targeted inhibitors of BRAFV600E, WNT or PI3'- kinase signaling that are likely to have important translational implications for the design and evaluation of new pathway-targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease."
"9333368","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular organization of the organ of Corti is complex yet precise. Its mechanoreceptive hair cells are arranged such that three rows of outer hair cells and one row of inner hair cells are interdigitated by supporting cells. Disruption of this cellular network causes dysfunction of the organ and thus hearing loss. Multiple developmental pathways have been shown to play important roles during cochlear and hair cell development. The Wnt pathway has been shown to govern hair cell differentiation and patterning, however, the source and identity of secreted Wnts and how secretion are regulated remain incompletely understood. Briefly, a Wnt ligand-producing cell secretes a Wnt protein that is recognized by a Wnt-responsive cell, which expresses membrane bound Wnt receptors, leading to a cellular response. Prior to Wnt secretion, Wnt proteins are lipid modified and transported by the proteins Porcupine (Porcn) and Wntless (Wls), respectively. Here, we propose to ablate Porcn and Wls to characterize their roles during hair cell development. In preliminary experiments, we have observed distinct spatiotemporal expression of Porcn and Wls, and that deletion of these two genes in the Pax2-Cre expression domain leads to distinct phenotypes in the embryonic cochlea. Specifically, Porcn- deficient cochleae were short and contained disorganized hair cells. On the other hand, Wls-deficient inner ear displayed no discernible cochlea. Over three specific aims, we first propose to ablate these two genes using tissue-specific inducible Cre drivers to determine whether they are required for hair cell differentiation and patterning. In Aim 3, we will characterize the spatio-temporal expression pattern of individual Wnt ligands to identify members expressed in Porcn and Wls-expressing cells. At the completion of these aims, we will have gained a better understanding of the roles of Wnt pathway during embryonic cochlea development and potentially open new exploratory avenues to treat hearing loss."

"9557863","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Development and validation of a precision genome editing platform The development of a programmable way to achieve precision gene editing would represent both a powerful new research tool, as well as a potential new approach to gene editing-based human therapeutics. Current genome engineering tools suffer from modest gene editing efficiencies as well as unwanted gene alterations that can compete with the desired alteration. This proposal seeks to engineer fusion proteins with readily programmable, site specific C>T DNA editing capabilities. The fusions will take advantage of the Cas9 system, an effector complex comprised of a Cas protein that is targeted to a specific DNA sequence by an RNA molecule (termed sgRNA). Fusion complexes between Cas9 and cytidine deaminase enzymes will be engineered in order to direct their ability to deaminate cytidine to uridine to a specific site in genomic DNA. Both the enzymatic activities and selectivities of the various simple fusions will be characterized using a luciferase-based assay in vitro. These results will be thoroughly analyzed and examined, as they may provide fundamental information about the relationship between the structure of Cas9 and its ability to access its target DNA. If the engineered fusions display little to no activity, or significant off-target effects, phage-assited continuous evolution (PACE), a state-of-the-art protein evolution method, will then be used to optimize the activities and specificities of the fusions. This method has been successfully used in the past to evolve mutant polymerases starting from undetectable activities. The resulting fusion enzymes will then be validated by correcting the cancer relevant H1047R (A3140G) mutation in the PIK3CA gene in a human cancer cell line. The successful development of these fusion enzymes would represent the initial phase of the development of a tool that can be used to investigate various biological problems. This technology could be used to knock out proteins at will with high efficiencies and observe the outcomes, study the effect of site specific protein mutations on signaling pathways and cell function, and investigate cancer progression following correction of a mutated gene."
"9388791","PROJECT SUMMARY ? OVERALL If there is one issue that unites the diverse and vocal community of families affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is the frustration that despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent on autism research, there are so few treatment options available to decrease the disabilities of their loved ones. The overarching goal of our proposed Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder is to discover targets for effective treatments in groups of children with ASD with rigorously defined phenotypic characteristics. It has become abundantly clear that there are many causes and trajectories of ASD. Moreover, some of the most debilitating aspects of ASD are due to the serious co-morbid conditions such as anxiety, seizures and intellectual disability. Considering the broad range of clinical and behavioral features of ASD, it is unlikely that a single treatment will correct all of these problems. This proposal is based on the premise that identifying clinically meaningful subtypes of ASD will facilitate the analysis of etiologies and the development of more effective therapeutics. The Specific Aims for the Center include: Aim #1: To use enhanced clinical evaluations of children with ASD, particularly those with intellectual disability, to better characterize the sub-group that exhibits clinically significant anxiety. Proper diagnosis and effective treatment holds the promise of a much-improved quality of life for these children. Aim #2: To conduct a 16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and pill placebo in youth with ASD. Aim #3: To use fMRI to investigate neural predictors of treatment efficacy, markers of treatment-induced change, and signatures of anxiety sub-types defined in Aim 1. Aim #4: To carry out behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological analyses of a newly recruited group of children (2-3 1/2-years-old) with ASD and brains that are disproportionately enlarged relative to body size. The major goal of this aim is to increase our understanding of the cognitive functions and brain systems that are so impacted as to lead to a poorer prognosis for these children. This would inform the design of more targeted behavioral interventions. While there is no evidence that these children have less access to standard behavioral therapies, it has become clear that they constitute an ASD phenotype that benefits less from standard interventions. How to treat these children is not yet clear and the Center endeavors to fill this gap. Aim #5: To generate an iPSC patient resource from a subset of the children that are investigated in Aim #4. Lines of iPSCs for each subject will be differentiated into neural progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells to identify gray and white matter contributions to the development of enlarged brains. The cell lines will also be studied by RNA-sequencing to identify gene networks and signaling mechanisms that are altered. These studies may provide additional targets for pharmacological treatment of this form of ASD."
"9385866","ABSTRACT ? Project 2: Neural signatures, developmental precursors, and outcomes in young children with ASD and ADHD Although recognized as distinct diagnostic conditions, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid. The overlap in clinical presentation, risk factors, and co- heritability of ASD and ADHD has led some authors to propose that these disorders share underlying biological mechanisms and that ADHD is a milder, less severe subtype within the ASD syndrome. Moreover, the presence of co-occurring ADHD has significant clinical implications, where individuals with comorbid ASD and ADHD have substantially poorer outcomes. To date, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, we know relatively little about the extent to which ASD and ADHD represent distinct conditions or the impact of co-occurring ADHD symptoms on early behavioral patterns and brain mechanisms in ASD. In Project 2, we will study the neural signatures, biomarkers, developmental trajectories, and clinical outcomes associated with comorbid ASD and ADHD with the overarching goal of generating knowledge that will allow earlier detection of these overlapping conditions and more individualized treatment approaches that take into account the additive and interactive effects of both conditions. The primary goals of Project 2 are to (1) elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and biomarkers related to ASD vs. ADHD, (2) examine the functional and clinical impact of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children with ASD, and (3) identify early characteristics of infants and toddlers later diagnosed with ASD with and without elevated ADHD symptoms. To this end, in Project 2, we will recruit four groups of children between 36-72 months of age with the following clinical features: ASD only, ASD+ADHD, ADHD only, and typically-developing (TD) children. The specific aims to achieve our overall study goals are to (1) identify differences and commonalities in neural signatures and biomarkers based on neurophysiology and eye-gaze tracking across the four groups; (2) examine how these biomarkers are correlated with specific symptom profiles based on shared and distinct phenotypic characteristics of ASD and ADHD; (3) determine the clinical impact of ADHD in young children with ASD; and (4) explore the extent to which developmental precursors linked to diagnostic outcome can be detected during the infant-toddler period. The latter aim will be accomplished by analyzing home video recordings taken in the first and second year of life of children later diagnosed with ASD only, ADHD only, ASD+ADHD, vs. TD, based on observations made via automated computer vision analysis of movement and affect, as well as human coding of vocalizations/verbalizations, joint attention, gaze and orienting behavior, affect, and repetitive behaviors. Project 2 will provide a detailed, comprehensive understanding of unique developmental trajectories and impacts of co-occurring ADHD in children with ASD."
"9516400","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The oocytes of most sexually reproducing animals arrest in diplotene or diakinesis of meiotic prophase I. Human oocytes enter meiosis in the embryo and maintain prophase arrest for decades. Oocyte growth occurs during the period of prophase I arrest, which enables them to acquire competence to complete meiosis and to produce healthy progeny. Hormonal signaling and soma-germline interactions regulate meiotic resumption (oocyte meiotic maturation). Meiotic maturation is defined by the transition to metaphase I, and its hallmarks are nuclear envelope breakdown, rearrangement of the cortical cytoskeleton, and meiotic spindle assembly. A failure of oocytes to undergo meiotic maturation results in sterility, whereas improper execution of the meiotic divisions causes aneuploidy. The timing of meiotic maturation is crucial. If oocytes undergo meiotic maturation prematurely, their capacity to produce healthy offspring is diminished. The molecular mechanisms that control and coordinate oocyte growth and meiotic maturation are incompletely understood. This application seeks to fill this knowledge gap by studying conserved translational regulators that coordinate and control the meiotic maturation decision and the growth process. We address mechanistic questions about how intercellular signaling and translational regulation control meiotic resumption. Defects in oogenesis represent a major cause of human birth defects, miscarriage and infertility. Ethical and technical issues limit the mechanistic depth of human studies. Oocyte meiotic maturation is an ancient reproductive process and many of its defining features are deeply conserved in evolution. Model systems are thus indispensable to the analysis of female meiosis. Because the full-grown oocytes of most animals are transcriptionally quiescent, translational regulation is a major control point. Our understanding of how signaling controls translation to regulate oocyte growth and meiotic maturation is incomplete. We developed C. elegans as a genetic model for studying the control of meiotic maturation by hormonal signaling. Our work shows that C. elegans and mammals share remarkable similarities in the hormonal control of meiotic maturation. Our Aims are 1) Elucidate how translational regulators control oocyte growth and meiotic maturation; 2) Define how the SACY-1 DEAD-box RNA helicase regulates oocyte meiotic maturation; and 3) Determine how soma-germline gap junctions regulate meiotic maturation. The proposed experiments will provide mechanistic insights into how intercellular signaling and translational regulation control key cellular events of oocyte meiotic maturation. This basic research in a genetic model system will generate fundamental knowledge relevant for understanding human reproduction."
"9349361","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic reprogramming of cell fate and identity is a promising strategy for cell-based therapies and tissue regeneration. In particular, targeted manipulation of a few genes has been shown as a useful method for induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell derivation, stem cell differentiation, and T-cell reengineering. Though rapid progress has been made, current methods for targeted genome manipulation are very inefficient and require many accessory factors, limiting their utility for effective cell reprogramming to control different levels of regulation and to coordinate the kinetic expression of large numbers of genes. The major goal of the research is to develop a novel modular and programmable RNA-guided platform that can be used to target multiple genes in a genome for transcriptional or epigenetic regulation, and to exploit its applications for iPS cell reprogramming and potentially other cell-based therapeutic approaches. The proposed platform is built on my recently demonstrated CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference (CRISPRi) system derived from the bacterial immune pathway, which is an RNA-guided method for transcriptional silencing of arbitrary genes in diverse host cells. The method requires only a single modified Cas protein (catalytically inactive) and a designed small guide RNA with a 20-basepair complementary region to any gene of interest, without genetically altering the target locus. To further develop the system as a novel cell-reprogramming platform, I will first perform high-throughput characterization experiments in bacteria as a model to quantify the determinants of RNA-guided regulatory efficiency and specificity. Mathematical models will be developed and used for the rational design of large RNA libraries for efficient and specific genome targeting. Second, to develop a programmable platform for various regulatory functions, I will extend the CRISPRi system as a modular DNA-binding system for use in mammalian cells. The system will be combined with protein effectors for different types of genome-scale targeted regulations, including transcription activation, transcription silencing, and heritable histone modification. I will also introduce the ability to regulate these functions using light, through the use of optogenetically controlled protein interactions. Third, as a test bed, I ill focus on using the programmable CRISPRi platform as an alternative and perhaps easier way to generate iPS cells. I will create light-gated transcription circuits to precisely control the expression program of endogenous transcription factors that are known to be important for iPS cell reprogramming. I will also use the CRISPRi platform to target and modify epigenetic regulation of these factors, and study if regulating epigenetic marks could achieve more efficient, more stable, and safer reprogramming. Together, these aims will address a critical barrier for cell reprogramming by providing a novel RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific regulation of multiple genes for various types of regulation. Further, the application will providea novel technological basis for constructing gene circuits to coordinate multiple genes for iPS cell generation, which is also directly applicable to other cell reprogramming applications such as stem cell differentiation and T-cell engineering."
"9353956","OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Case GI SPORE renewal application provides for a cutting edged Specialized Program of Research Excellence in gastrointestinal malignancies with emphasis on colorectal cancers and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. This comprehensive program builds on the resources of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center to propose 4 translational Research Projects to bring new molecular advances to patients with GI Cancers. A series of 3 core resources support these projects and also establish a strong programmatic infrastructure for translational research in GI cancers. We have further developed a comprehensive infrastructure for identifying new Developmental Research Projects from basic science and clinical investigators from across the Case Cancer Center. Drawing on our strong track record of developing new faculty who emphasize translational research in GI cancers, we have also developed a targeted Career Enhancement Program to further advance and recruit to the translational research cadre of SPORE faculty. The 4 SPORE translational research projects constitute novel and cutting edge approaches to GI cancers and include studies of: i) Targeting the 15-PGDH colon cancer tumor suppressor pathway for prediction of cancer risk, prediction of response to chemoprevention with aspirin, and development of new colon cancer prevention and treatment strategies (Project 1, Drs. Markowitz, Li, and Berger); ii) Elucidating the basis for and the clinical significance of a mutational signature of African American colon cancer (Project 2, Drs. Willis, Li, and Wang); iii) Development of molecular markers of and non-endoscopic detection of Barrett's esophagus and early esophageal adenocarcinomas (Project 3, Drs. Chak, Guda, and Markowitz); and iv) Development of personalized treatment of PIK3CA mutant colon cancers using targeted inhibitors of glutamine metabolism (Project 4, Drs. Wang and Meropol). These projects are built on major advances from the SPORE's first funding period that include: i) publication in Science that 15-PGDH regulates colon crypt stem cells; ii) publication in Science Translational Medicine that individual's 15-PGDH levels regulate whether taking aspirin will or will not reduce their colon cancer risk; iii) publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of genes preferentially targeted for somatic mutations in colorectal cancers of African Americans; iv) publication on the cover of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention that testing for methylated vimentin DNA in esophageal brushings could detect over 90% of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinomas; v) publication in Nature Communications that PIK3CA mutant cancers are addicted to glutamine and sensitive to inhibitors of glutamine metabolism. These projects are advantaged by special populations and scientific resources developed for evaluation of GI cancer biomarkers, new drug discovery, Next-Generation sequencing of formalin fixed tumor samples, and studies of Barrett's esophagus. The strength of these investigators and the resources at their disposal will insure this program leads to significant important translational advances."
"9360070","PROJECT 1 SUMMARY Women with aggressive breast cancer who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative (?neoadjuvant?) therapy have excellent outcomes, despite presentation with stage II or III disease. In contrast, women with substantial residual cancer burden (?RCB 2/3?) after exposure to chemotherapy have poor outcomes, with event free survival below 60% at 3-5 years. Numerous studies and an FDA meta-analysis confirm the strong prognostic effect of pCR as a surrogate for long-term survival. The overarching goal of Project 1 is to exploit the pCR or RCB0 and RCB 2/3 surrogate to allow the successful I-SPY2 trial to evolve and test a new treatment paradigm where there are more opportunities for patients to reach a pCR. The I- SPY 2 TRIAL is already an innovative, adaptive clinical trial framework designed to accelerate new drug development tied to biomarkers of treatment response. To date, over 1000 patients (250 per year) have been randomized to one of 12 investigational treatment arms, 5 of which have successfully graduated from the trial. But we have observed that many women still fail to reach pCR, while others have excellent early response to therapy, and likely could be spared additional toxicity. We hypothesize that by utilizing an MRI-based tool to assess residual cancer burden (called the ?Integrated RCB, or iRCB) midway through the course of neoadjuvant therapy, we will be able to effectively redirect treatment in those with either exceptional or poor response sparing the former (in whom iRCB predicts early pCR) additional toxic therapy by allowing them to go to surgery sooner, while providing the latter (in whom iRCB predicts RCB 2/3) with alternative novel, ?personalized? therapies based upon their own tumor biology, in effect offering a `second chance' at achieving pCR. To optimize response, we will leverage insights into the mechanisms and markers of treatment resistance emerging from the I-SPY2 TRIAL, We have selected a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) model that permits us to incorporate these innovations within the I-SPY framework, ultimately enabling `serial' treatment modifications for women who continue to exhibit poor response. Project 1 will leverage knowledge and tools generated across all projects and cores: refinement of iRCB as the `trigger' for treatment re-direction (Project 2); an enhanced library of potential subsequent agents/combinations and probability of response based on the presence of tumor biomarkers, both known and newly identified (Projects 3, 4); and a clinical decision tool to assign substitute therapy based on the presence of multiple biomarkers of response. The end result will be the evolution of I-SPY 2 into I-SPY 2+.Our Admin core will oversee regulatory requirements as per our discussions with the FDA. Our Bioinformatics Core has leading expertise on the design of SMART and adaptive trials. This novel and innovative approach will evaluate both pathway and individualized treatment strategies critical to realizing the potential of precision medicine."
"9340296","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training programs in biomedical science were once directed towards careers in academic research. Now, innovative approaches to prepare for the current and ever-changing biomedical workforce must be considered. BU's BEST seeks to implement bold new initiatives to re-engineer the training pipeline. Using analysis of the job market as the driver of professional development programming, BU's BEST will enable trainees to fulfill the needs, not only of the current market, but also the future biomedical workforce. The strengths of the new training paradigm are its strategic institutional partnerships and those within private and non-profit sectors as well as the framework to catalyze institutional change. The aims are: Aim I: To re-engineer biomedical training whereby the job market informs curriculum development. Groundbreaking tools and resources will be implemented to analyze workforce data with input from key stakeholders to guide and evolve curriculum design. State-of-the-art software will identify biomedical workforce jobs, job trends and skills required for various career pathways. Our evidence-based approach will also be informed by strategic insights from BU's BEST team of consultants that includes an internal advisory committee comprised of BU faculty and staff, an external advisory committee of leaders in non-academic biomedically-related professions and BU alumni. Evaluation outcomes will be monitored and assessed annually and used to direct development of specific training resources and approaches. Aim 2: To develop a curriculum to prepare trainees for future careers. A framework will be implemented that provides doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers the opportunity to consider, explore and gain experience in achieving their individual goals. Importantly, exciting, new software will be developed in collaboration with our partners to enable trainees to identify and work toward their goals. With strong advising/mentoring, trainees will be exposed to a curriculum of foundational/professional skills and career options via coursework, workshops, career panels as well as hybrid online modules. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be able to enhance their interests through a wealth of options via existing and planned coursework, and participation in shadowing experiences with a network of faculty, administrators, alumni and industry partners. Finally, trainees will have opportunities to further develop their interests by participation in internships, teaching and/or formal academic training (certificate or MA/MS degrees). Aim 3: To advance a university culture that engages faculty in a new training paradigm. Developing a curriculum for trainees is of limited value if the institutiona culture is not supportive i.e. if the faculty does not support trainees who want to explore options An essential part of our plan is to use strategies that specifically target barriers to attaining ad sustaining success. Institutional strategies to support a culture shift and recognition of effectiv mentoring are presented. The BU's BEST plan is transformational and impactful in that program elements lend themselves to easy adaptation by other institutions."
"9352374","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale."
"9533912","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control neural crest development. Neural crest cells are vertebrate-specific, appear early in development, migrate extensively and differentiate into several derivatives, including: craniofacial components (muscle and cartilage amongst others), peripheral nervous system and melanocytes of the skin. Defects in neural crest development and homeostasis result in human pathologies known as neurocristopathies that include cleft lip/palate, Waardenburg syndrome, and melanoma, amongst others. Advancing our understanding of the biology of neural crest cells is fundamental to aid in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This project investigates early stages of neural crest formation, and focuses on the contributions made by signaling pathways. This work centers in two models - the avian embryo and a novel model of human neural crest development based on human embryonic stem cells. In the chick we utilize blastula embryos, while in the human stem cell model we address the earliest time points of differentiation. In both models, the role of Wnt and FGF signaling pathways will be scrutinized with particular focus on transcriptional effectors. Aim 1 is directed to elucidate the specific contributions made by distinct FGF-signaling branches during blastula and gastrula stages, and to establish differential responses and transcriptional effectors of the Pea3 sub-family. Aim 2 dissects the contributions made by the dominant canonical and alternative non- canonical Wnt pathways. Here emphasis will be directed to the transcriptional factors Tcf and Lef. Aim 3 will validate and eficcient model of human NC development, and establish the contributions made by these two signaling pathways (FGF, Wnt) to human neural crest development using an efficient and robust model based in human embryonic stem cells. This work will illuminate fundamental principles of neural crest formation in higher vertebrates (birds and mammals), and will invigorate human neural crest studies."
"9344623","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the research is to determine how early vision represents sensory information in a way that supports extraction of features and objects, and, ultimately, inferences about the visual world that guide action. The proposal will determine how complex, multidimensional perceptual spaces are represented at the algorithmic level and how these representations are used. Based on previous work, the perspective is that the representation of a perceptual space is tuned to operate efficiently, given the statistics of natural sensory inputs. The research will now determine how this is achieved within the constraints of neural hardware, in a manner than can be easily read out by later stages of processing. Among the many well-recognized perceptual spaces (for example, color, faces, and auditory textures), we choose to focus on simple form elements (e.g., lines, edges, corner), shading, shape, and motion signals (Fourier, non-Fourier, and others we recently discovered). Several reasons underlie these choices: (i) they are crucial to visual function, as extracting loca features, form, and motion is critical to scene analysis, object identification, and navigation (ii they are high-dimensional, and so are appropriate to probe mechanisms likely to underlie representations of other complex perceptual spaces, (iii) algorithms exist for construction of stimuli in all portions of the spaces, including - but not limited to-those that occur in the naturl environment, (iv) they can be investigated at the perceptual level in humans, yielding model predictions that can be tested at the neuronal level in non-human primates, and (v) the spaces are calibrated - that is, ideal observer performance can be calculated a priori, and this serves as a benchmark for the analysis of perceptual data. Aim 1 focuses on simple form elements. To constrain models at the algorithmic level, Aim 1A determines the global geometry of the perceptual space, and Aim 1B determines how the perceptual metric changes across the space. To test the hypothesis that the perceptual space serves as a common workspace for segmentation, discrimination, and visual working memory, Aim 1C will determine whether a single metric accounts for performance on all three kinds of tasks. Aim 2A (shading) and 2B (pattern and shape) seek to extend previous and anticipated findings to more complex aspects of form: do cues combine in a simple quadratic fashion? do efficient coding principles govern resource allocation? and does the perceptual geometry implied by threshold and suprathreshold judgments require a dual representation? To determine whether these principles further generalize to the temporal domain, Aim 3 extends the approach to analysis of local motion signals. Successful completion of this research will advance the understanding of the design principles and computations underlying sensory processing, and will thus support the rational design of advanced therapeutic modalities, such as neural prosthetics for loss of visual function."
"9238021","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death in the United States, is a heterogeneous syndrome. Comprehensive insight into COPD heterogeneity requires longitudinal data to elucidate the genetic, clinical, and radiographic determinants of disease progression. This proposal will extend the COPDGene Study by performing ten-year longitudinal follow-up visits on all available COPDGene subjects, with follow-up chest CT scans. The primary goals of COPDGene are: a) To identify new genetic loci that influence the development of COPD and COPD-related phenotypes; b) To reclassify COPD into subtypes that can ultimately be used to develop effective subtype-specific therapies; and c) To translate the findings in COPDGene to improve diagnostic and prognostic approaches to COPD in general clinical populations. The primary hypothesis for this renewal application is that extensive genetic and longitudinal phenotypic data in subjects with COPD or at risk for COPD will enable creation and validation of a new classification system for COPD with distinct diagnostic and prognostic implications. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate progression of COPD by completing a ten-year follow-up of all available subjects in the COPDGene cohort using clinical phenotyping and both quantitative and visual analysis of chest CT scans; 2) To use whole genome sequencing analysis on the COPDGene cohort to identify both rare and common genetic determinants of susceptibility and progression of disease in COPD subtypes and to create effective genetic risk scores for COPD; and 3) To translate COPDGene findings on COPD subtypes and genetics to general clinical populations by interaction with clinical Lung Cancer Screening Programs. It is anticipated that whole genome sequencing analysis will be completed on the entire COPDGene cohort through the TOPMed program. This data in combination with ten-year longitudinal clinical data and CT imaging data on the cohort is expected to enable identification of novel genetic associations for unique COPD subtypes. The long-term goal is to enable enhanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches for personalized therapy in COPD."
"9358728","Project Summary Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) admit ~450,000 babies every year in the U.S. The monitoring of arterial blood gases is essential for managing any sick infant, but especially important in vulnerable, extremely premature infants, for whom even a minimal delay in appropriate interventions can be the difference between life and death. Intermittent monitoring of blood gases, as is traditional, provides only a spot check of physio-pathological status; the results are often delayed from the actual event triggering blood gas analysis, and the procedure, besides predisposing to iatrogenic infections, in itself is painful and over time can result in significant blood loss. Continuous non-invasive blood gas monitoring is preferable, but current non-invasive continuous modalities have significant limitations. An accurate, precise, and intrinsically safe system that exploits routinely performed intravascular catheterization (such as umbilical artery catheterization ? the standard of care for sick neonates) to obtain blood gas measurements continuously would be an important advance in monitoring critically ill neonates in NICUs. To address this need, we are developing an integrated fiber optic sensor umbilical (ISUM) catheter for blood gas monitoring in neonates. The ISUM catheter will fill the technological gap in continuous blood analysis by addressing the deficiencies shown in classical intravascular sensor probes, and will take advantage of the fact that most critically sick newborns in NICUs receive at least one intravascular catheter, often an umbilical arterial catheter. The sensor and the catheter are designed as an integrated unit for this specific application, and have the following advantages over previously described intravascular probes: (1) novel large area gas sensors, eliminating probe placement or movement artifacts; (2) dual O2 sensor and data fusion, eliminating wall effect, and improving reliability; and (3) ready-to-use sensors, with little or no delay in data acquisition; and (4) reduced cost, since highly repeatable sensor elements can be produced in batches of hundreds. In Phase I, the first ISUM catheters were designed, fabricated, and tested in animal models, incorporating sensors for both pO2 and pCO2. Excellent correlation between sensor readings and the gold standard technique for blood gas analysis was observed. None of the erroneous readings associated with prior intravascular devices were observed (which highlights the potential of the novel sensors for use in both infants and adults), and the safety of the new catheter was demonstrated. In the proposed Phase II work, additional sensors will be integrated, and advanced catheters will be designed and validated in the laboratory and in neonatal animal models closer to humans, which will lead to initial validation in human subjects. As soon as the proposed milestones are achieved, we will move to commercialize the ISUM catheter by starting the process for an FDA 510 (k) submission, and negotiating with investors for clinical trials and commercialization."
"9360074","This Program Project comprises four individual projects, which will: implement evidence-based sequential multiple treatment assignment strategies for patients predicted to have insufficient response to their initial neoadjuvant targeted and/or chemotherapy, (Project 1); qualify non-invasive imaging methods as early markers of non-response (Project 2); characterize the biology of non-responders to inform treatment selection (Project 3); and develop a portfolio of agents and decision tools for treatment re-assignment matched to biology of non- responding tumors (Project 4). The overarching goal of the Information Technology (IT) and Systems Integration Core is to develop an informatics infrastructure for the storage, integration and dashboard visualization of clinical, molecular and imaging data collected within the proposed I-SPY 2+ Program Project framework. Specifically, we will review and leverage the existing I-SPY 2 data infrastructure to design and implement a functional user interface that will enable role-based access and integrated visualization of data within and across projects with the I-SPY 2+ Program Project framework. This dashboard visualization will be extensible and capable of providing relevant data summaries and reports in support of all Projects in the Program. In addition, the dashboard will provide flexible integration of algorithms from other environments such as R code generated by the Bioinformatics and Statistics Core for longitudinal modeling of non-response based on imaging (Project 2) and molecular biomarkers (Project 3), and will allow for visualization of predictive modeling results of breast cancer data within and across project teams within the I-SPY 2+ Program Project Framework via secure, role-based access. Integration of tools to report patient adverse event and quality of life will reduce the time spent extracting information manually from disparate sources, reduce errors, and potentially allow real-time monitoring. Collectively, the capabilities enabled by the data visualization dashboard will be a critical component towards achieving the overall Program Project goal of building and implementing robust, evidence-based decision algorithms to enable treatment to be adapted for individual women with high risk breast cancer."
"9482230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With their introduction into practice over the last two decades, electronic medical records (EMRs) have become increasingly recognized as platforms to not only improve delivery of care to the individual but also to understand variability in domain such as disease presentation and outcomes or quality assurance. Coupling dense genomic information to EMRs in eMERGE has provided tools for both discovery and initial implementation in genomic medicine, while raising new challenges and opportunities for using genomic data in healthcare. These include developing and mining the large datasets necessary to identify groups of patients with extreme phenotypes or rare genotypes; identifying clinically-relevant subsets of common diseases; and identifying actionable genomic variants and determining how best to deploy these in a learning healthcare system. Building on our experience and contributions to eMERGE-I and eMERGE-II, we propose here three specific aims to address these challenges. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand the network's phenotyping library by creating increasingly granular phenotype definitions that identify specific subsets of disease with predictable clinical courses or response to therapies. Genotype-phenotype relations will be studied by GWAS and advanced PheWAS methodology we have developed. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify rare variants with strong associations with human traits by resequencing 100 genes in 2,500 subjects at our center as part of the eMERGE-III 25,000 patient cohort. We propose studying genes with variants known to affect human health and drug responses, and variants that our preliminary PheWAS analysis implicates as robust markers of important human phenotypes. In Specific Aim 3, we will expand PREDICT, our pre-emptive pharmacogenomic implementation program, to develop a pipeline that will deliver actionable variants to patients and providers and to assess their response. We will collaborate across eMERGE to develop, implement, and assess tools to deliver new information, measuring impact to ensure optimal benefit to patients. By executing these discovery and implementation aims, our site and the eMERGE network will contribute importantly to advancing the vision of Genomic Medicine as a contributor to modern healthcare."

We propose to develop a VR?based Oral and Maxillofacial (OMF) surgical trainer for OMF surgeons and residents that can improve procedural knowledge and surgical proficiency. The work proposed will a) develop a highly realistic VR training system in order to recreate, as reliably as possible, the visual, haptic/tactile, ergonomic, procedural and functional aspects of OMS surgery and b) perform face, content, and construct validation of the OMF VR surgery training system. The proposed system will allow OMF surgeons to enhance their training in few targeted complex steps in sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) in a virtual environment and predict the outcome of interventional decisions before actual surgery without any risks to the patients. Practicing surgical techniques on-demand with direct quantitative feedback plays an essential part in developing the needed expertise to a) improve the quality of the outcomes for patients and b) improve efficiency in the surgical technique thereby reducing the operating time. Virtual simulation platforms provide risk-free training environment that has a huge potential to increase the efficiency of surgical training. Successful completion of this Phase I proposal will result in a Phase II SBIR proposal focused on the clinical validation of the effectiveness of this system as a training tool for OMF surgery residents to practice the complex steps in SSO."
"9349386","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Finding a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the greatest challenges of our generation. There is a consensus in the scientific community that the key to success in treating AD is to begin therapies as early as possible before significant brain damage occurs. Thus characterizing preclinical biomarkers and early detection paradigms, which is the focus of my work, is paramount. A distributed network of brain regions, including the hippocampus, adjacent cortical regions in the medial temporal lobe, and other brain regions sub-serve memory function. Paired associative memory tasks that rely on this network have been shown to be sensitive to subtle deficits in the preclinical stages of AD. I propose to build upon my previous research with autosomal dominant AD to establish conceptual frameworks and comparisons with late-onset sporadic AD with an emphasis on the analysis of memory network disruption as an early marker of preclinical AD. To this end, I will leverage my access to two extraordinarily rich preclinical AD groups, 1) the Colombian kindred with Presenilin 1 E280A (Glu280Ala) mutation, estimated to have 1,500 mutation carriers, and 2) a group of asymptomatic older individuals who are participants in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) at MGH and are considered at high risk (by molecular pathology imaging) to develop late- onset sporadic AD. The primary goals of this application are to: (i) investigate abnormalities of associative-memory processes as a possible cognitive marker of preclinical AD; (ii) investigate brain hyper-activity/hyper- connectivity as a marker of early AD pathology; and, (iii) examine the role of tau and amyloid aggregation in memory network dysfunction. The research proposed in this application will use cognitive measures, fMRI and PET imaging to examine the hypothesis that memory network dysfunction occurs in early preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. This research will provide insight into the interaction of cognitive and brain function biomarkers in preclinical AD. In particular, this work will provide new understanding of how amyloid and tau pathology impact memory function very early in the disease process, and their role in subsequent neuronal death and cognitive decline."
"9351801","Abstract:  Gliomas, with glioblastomas (GBM) in particular, are one of the most lethal human malignancies due to lack of success with current conventional treatments due to their invasive nature and heterogeneity. We will leverage expansion microscopy, a novel super-resolution microscopy method, as a platform to develop novel tools for highly multiplexed in situ analysis to generate comprehensive maps of GBM spatial heterogeneity and structure. We will use these tools to help understand the molecular and morphological phenotypes of GBM invasion and pathology, which we hope will guide future therapeutic interventions.  The proposed research will consist of three aims which seeks to develop novel in situ analysis tools driven by biological questions in GBM organization: (1) Comprehensively map cell types and states within GBM tumor tissue with high spatial resolution. To enable this, we will develop an innovative method for highly multiplexed readout of RNA in expanded tissues with tailored in situ gene expression panels based on single-cell RNA sequencing signatures. (2) Study the nanoscale interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment that are implicated GBM invasion. To accomplish this, we will develop an approach for multiplexed protein imaging with nanoscale resolution using DNA barcoded antibody libraries. (3) Develop a scalable analysis platform with automation and analysis software to integrate multiplexed RNA and protein imaging in the same sample. We will apply this platform to patient derived tumor samples to understand the molecular and morphological phenotypes of invading GBM tumor cells, as well as build a map of the spatial heterogeneity of GBM. These novel technologies to spatially map molecular information in complex tissues will not only be invaluable for understanding glioma and cancer, they will be broadly applicable to many other spatially complex biological processes."
"9353557","PROJECT 2: RESPONSE OF THE AGED THYMUS TO INJURY AND REJUVENATION ABSTRACT Even though the thymus is is exquisitely sensitive to acute injury such as that caused by infection, shock, or common cancer therapies such as cytoreductive chemo- or radiation therapy, it also has a remarkable capacity for endogenous repair. However, this capacity declines with age and is a major clinical hurdle in elderly patients who receive an immune insult such as that caused by common cancer cytoreductive therapies and the conditioning required for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The premise of this project is that the thymic regenerative response to acute injury is weakened with age and correlates with age-related thymic involution. We will compare and contrast what we know about the cellular and molecular pathways that underpin thymic regeneration in young animals, to the regenerative response in mice during normal thymic aging; and develop rational intervention strategies to improve regeneration in aged mice. In this project, we will comprehensively assess the endogenous regenerative response over lifespan (SA1), perform studies to better understand the underlying mechanisms governing endogenous thymic regeneration and their breakdown in aged mice (SA2), and test known and putative strategies to determine their effectiveness in promoting thymopoiesis in aged tissue that has undergone damage (SA3). Our project has multiple points of interaction with the other projects and cores of this P01, including providing the basis for exploring the role of endothelial cells (ECs) and BMP4 in thymic and SLO aging. Together, these aims support the overarching goal of the P01 to identify the mechanisms responsible for defects in thymic production of naïve T cells with age. The mechanistic and pre-clinical studies outlined have the potential to define important novel pathways underlying thymic regeneration, which could result in clinical approaches to enhance T cell immunity in patients whose thymus has been decimated due to age-related involution."
"9344653","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks continuation funding to develop and support a vast archive of large-scale micro-data drawn from over 100 censuses of 23 Latin American countries enumerated over the past half century. These data are a vital component of the Integrated Public Use Micro-data Series (IPUMS), one of the most intensively-used sources for population and health research. Latin America is the only region with surviving micro-data for virtually every country over multiple decades. The improved and expanded database will allow investigators to make comparisons across an entire hemisphere during five decades of transformative change, and will result in substantial new health-related research on the interrelationships of economic development, fertility and mortality decline, international migration, and family change. The Latin American micro-data archive represents a permanent and substantial contribution to the world's population research infrastructure. By making these data easily accessible to researchers and developing comprehensive and comprehensible documentation, the project is stimulating new research that transcends national boundaries and static interpretation. The project has four major goals: (1) Expand the database, adding data for four new countries, new 2010 round samples for countries currently in the database, and new higher-density versions of several existing samples. (2) Enhance data and metadata, including new geographic coding to better support consistent cross- national and cross-temporal analysis, a new internationally-comparable living standard index based on housing characteristics, and new variables to allow more precise variance estimation. (3) Improve data infrastructure and access by implementing a novel database structure, innovative new metadata tools, and multiple new capabilities to simplify data manipulation and reduce redundant effort by researchers. (4) Ensure dissemination and sustainability through user support, training, and outreach, and implementation of a new plan to ensure long-run preservation of the data and metadata. This infrastructure is a basic resource for health research and policy analysis. Models and descriptions of the past underlie both theories of past social change and projections into the future. Accordingly, the data series provides a unique laboratory for the study of health and demographic processes, and provides the empirical foundation we need for developing and testing social and economic models."
"9350375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Surface electromyogram (sEMG) controlled powered hand/wrist prostheses are used by upper limb amputees to return partial upper limb function. Conventional transradial prostheses can use surface EMG amplitudes from the residual forearm flexors and extensors to control hand closing and opening, respectively. Additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), e.g., wrist rotation, are not controlled simultaneously in conventional commercial systems. Rather, prostheses apply EMG-based or mechanical mode switching, so that the same EMG sites sequentially control the additional functions. This limitation is problematic, as many basic tasks- e.g., drinking from a cup, combing hair-require the simultaneous activation and control of two or more joints. It was reported that the ability to control ... coordinated motions of two joints at the same time was the second highest priority improvement desired by these users. The first priority was for a rotating wrist-a necessary prerequisite for two DoF control, and a device that is already commercially available.  A number of research studies have reported on the development of proportional, simultaneous and independent 2-DoF controllers, initially using upwards of 64 or more high-density electrodes (electrodes that were not intended for clinical use) and recently using as few as 7-8 commercial electrodes. For practical clinical use, however, fewer electrodes are necessary and a method is needed to determine where to locate them within the socket. The manual palpation and trial-and-error methods used to locate two myoelectrodes for existing 1-DoF systems is inadequate for 2-DoF electrode site selection.  In our Phase 1 work, we demonstrated the feasibility of a system for electrode site selection that controls two DoFs with only four commercial electrodes. A calibration procedure using a 16-channel EMG system without the prosthetic socket is used in the laboratory (or, in the prosthetist's office in commercial implementation) to select EMG sites and relate their electrical activity to 2 DoFs. In this Phase 2 application, we propose to transitin this method to a commercial product. Aim 1 will develop the necessary hardware/software to prototype the embedded commercial controller as well as the clinical fitting/training system. Aim 2 will refine the site selection and control algorithms. Our Phase 2 work will focus on utilizing only the affected limb (for a more direct control relationship) and on determining ways to rapidly calibrate a 2-DoF controller (in the laboratory and in the field). Aim 3 will evaluate the prototyp devices and algorithms developed in Aim 1 and 2 in a laboratory study and then in a pilot field study, facilitating commercialization."

"9348636","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity remains a substantial public health problem in the United States. Despite the initial effectiveness of behavioral treatments for weight loss, long-term maintenance of weight loss after the end of these treatments remains poor. Current interventions to improve long-term weight loss maintenance have statistically significant but only modest impact on weight regain, and none have been able to change the pattern of weight regain typically observed after treatment ends. These results suggest that new approaches to long-term weight loss maintenance are needed. Treatment approaches that adapt to participants' progress and that deliver targeted intervention components at times when participants are at high-risk for weight regain may be beneficial, and may help accommodate the substantial individual variability typically observed in response to intervention. The foundational evidence needed to develop these treatments, however, including when individuals regain weight and what factors predict this regain, is not available. We propose to conduct secondary analyses on a rich longitudinal dataset including data collected from a 3- month Internet-based behavioral weight loss intervention followed by a 9-month no-contact maintenance period. Seventy-five participants (mean age=50.8y, BMI=31.2, 69 percent Female, 84 percent Caucasian) provided daily weight measurements (using smart scales that sent weights directly to our research center via the cellular network) and weekly self-report of behavioral adherence (self-monitoring of weight, caloric intake, and physical activity) and psychological factors that have been hypothesized to affect weight loss maintenance (e.g., stress, hunger, boredom with goal-related eating and activity behaviors, competing priorities). During intervention, participant lost an average (±SD) of -6.26±4.88 percent of baseline weight, followed by a mean weight regain of 2.98±4.55 percent from Month 3 to 12 (51 percent met clinical cut-offs for significant weight regain at 12 months). Adherence to daily and weekly data collection was high. The weight dataset currently includes approximately 23,500 weight values representing 86 percent of potential dates measured. Average adherence to weekly self-report measures was 72 percent over the 52 weeks. These data provide a unique opportunity to identify when an individual's weight trajectory shifts from weight loss to regain (identified by an inflection poin) and to characterize the high-risk periods prior to these points (the pattern of weight change, behavioral adherence and psychological factors from the week prior that predict these inflection points), allowing us to develop algorithms to predict when an individual is approaching a high-risk time for weight regain. These results have clear treatment implications as they will provide the empirical foundation for a future adaptive intervention for weight loss maintenance, which could provide targeted, behavioral intervention strategies at times when individuals are at high risk for weight regain."
"9369217","Project Summary/Abstract This project addresses a critical gap in the understanding of sexual dimorphism in both infant and children?s health outcomes, where males are often at increased risk for disease. At the project?s core is the novel hypothesis that sexual epigenetic dimorphism in the placenta influence responses to perinatal stressors, and predict fetal growth restriction and neurodevelopment ND later in life. To address this, we use an ?-omics? and systems-wide approach to identify biomarkers of, and potential mechanisms for, adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal growth restriction and neurodevelopmental impairment in the offspring) in an existing cohort of children born extremely prematurely (i.e., before 28 weeks of gestation). The ?omics approaches include DNA CpG methylomics, transcriptomics to assess messenger RNA), and proteomics. A tremendous strength of this proposal is the unique and extensively characterized US-based cohort recruited for the Extremely Low Gestation Age Newborn (ELGAN) Study. Since its initiation in 2001, the broad goal of the ELGAN Study has been to evaluate the relationship between perinatal inflammation and neurodevelopmental impairments among individuals born extremely premature. In the proposed project, we build on the success of the ELGAN Study by: 1) evaluating ?-omics? biomarkers in archived specimens of placenta and neonatal blood and 2) integrating these data with existing outcome data about fetal growth restriction and neurodevelopmental impairments in the ELGAN cohort. In the first three years of the project, DNA CpG methylation, mRNA, and selected proteins will be assayed in archived specimens of placenta and neonatal blood. Data analyses will begin in year 2, with an initial focus on establishing the relationships among placental and blood biomarkers and both fetal growth restriction as well as neurodevelopmental impairment. We also will study relationships between prenatal factors associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (maternal obesity and placental bacteria) and placental and neonatal blood ?omics biomarkers. Furthermore, we will evaluate relationships between will placenta biomarkers and neonatal blood biomarkers. Innovative aspects of this project include its longitudinal perspective, consideration of placenta epigenetics as a mechanism linking prenatal exposures to childhood outcomes, and evaluation of CpG methylation marks in neonatal blood. With the potential for public health impact, this research may inform the development of therapies targeting epigenetic processes to prevent or ameliorate cognitive disability, thereby improving the quality of life for 16,000 individuals who survive extremely premature birth each year in the United States."
"9354463","Project Summary The activation and recruitment of brown adipose tissue has become an exciting target in the fight against obesity and its related metabolic diseases. Brown adipose tissue differs from white adipose tissue in its critical ability to burn energy as heat through UCP-1 driven adaptive thermogenesis. Expression of mitochondrial UCP-1 uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in accelerated substrate oxidation but low ATP production. The resulting dissipation of energy is associated with plasma triglyceride clearance, a key factor in weight loss. The brown adipose depot has long been known to exist in rodent models as well as in human infants. However, recent evidence has demonstrated the existence of active brown adipose tissue in adult humans. These findings prompted a resurgence of research focusing on both the activation of brown adipose tissue and the ?browning? of white adipose tissue, a phenomenon wherein UCP-1-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling is induced by stimuli. Multiple studies using rodent models have demonstrated that activation of brown fat or induction of browning can promote beneficial metabolic effects, and promising therapeutic targets have been identified. However, the therapeutic potential of these targets has not been confirmed due to the lack of a widely available human brown adipocyte model. Therefore, there is a pronounced need to validate existing therapeutic targets in the human system. ZenBio will address this need by providing a well characterized human brown adipocyte cell culture system to the research community and will utilize this tool to screen potential candidates for stimulation of human brown adipogenesis.  The overarching goal of this project is to generate and characterize an adult human brown adipocyte cell system. Aim 1 is intended to build on our successful establishment of a human fetal brown adipocyte system in Phase 1 and use molecular and functional characterization to generate a widely available adult human brown adipocyte system. This includes establishing conditionally immortalized adult brown preadipocyte lines for use in cell-number intense research and screening. The second Aim will expand the adult system to include donors from a wide range of demographics. This Aim will also establish a database of molecular and functional characterization from this donor set that will be available to the research community. Aim 3 will establish a robust, high content/high throughput screening platform capable of multiplexing molecular and function al assays in a 384 well format. This platform will be able to screen for brown fat modulators and activators, as well as validating therapeutic targets. The goal of these three Aims is to characterize and commercialize the adult human brown adipocyte system from donors of differing BMI, age, gender and diabetic state and validate their use to identify novel targets of brown adipocyte differentiation for the treatment of obesity. These studies will result in innovative targets for human brown adipocyte activation, a crucial step for anti-obesity therapeutics."
"9388804","PROJECT SUMMARY Identification of the earliest markers of risk for ASD holds tremendous clinical relevance, as it informs the implementation of early interventions that may attenuate symptoms and even prevent the development of ASD. Historically, infant siblings of children with ASD have constituted the primary focus of research in early markers. However, other high risk groups based on genetic diagnosis have been identified over the past several years. Studying infants at heightened genetic risk for ASD affords us a valuable opportunity to examine both distinct and shared neurobiological pathways to the core features that define autism symptoms. Such investigations not only shed light on mechanisms underlying atypical development in high-risk infants, but they can also clarify the ideal timing and target of early interventions that may modulate developmental trajectories. Here, we take a genetics-first approach and investigate biomarkers of risk for ASD and predictors of outcome in early infancy in three genetically defined groups with elevated risk: infants with an older sibling with ASD (familial risk), infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and infants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11). We select these groups both because of our unique ability to study these populations at UCLA and because they allow us to examine ASD as it emerges in the context of three genetic pathways: polygenic risk (familial risk), single gene mutations (TSC), and copy number variation (22q11.2 deletion). We combine electrophysiology (EEG) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine neurodevelopmental processes in the first year of life that may underlie the impairments that define ASD: (1) resting state/baseline neural synchrony and connectivity, (2) low level sensory processing and (3) brain activity and connectivity in language and salience networks. We study infants at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 months with MRI (1.5 and 9 months), EEG (3-12 months), and behavioral (3-12 months) assays and then perform standardized assessments of cognition and autism symptoms at 12, 24 and 36 months. The project has synergy with the other ACE projects. Infants demonstrating early signs of ASD in this project will be referred to the infant intervention study in Project II (PI: Kasari). With Project III (PI: Dapretto), we share leadership and employ common measures of brain activity and connectivity. This project also will rely on the Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core (PI: McCracken, Co-PI Gulsrud) for developmental and diagnostic testing. We also will integrate with the Biomarkers Core (PI: Geschwind, Co-PI Jeste), with data collection performed in the Jeste and Dapretto labs and imaging/EEG data combined with data from the other projects for larger scale analyses of heterogeneity from infancy to adolescence. Saliva samples for genetics will be gathered at baseline from all participants for analysis of CNV's and polygenic risk. Each aim of this project is grounded in the overarching hypotheses that we will: (1) identify distinct behavioral and brain based trajectories and areas of convergence across these risk groups in early development and (2) quantify predictive markers of atypical development and ASD across groups before age 12 months. !"
"9408801","Core 1: NMR Summary The NMR Core includes investigators at 6 institutions who are developing isotopically labeled ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTPs) reagents and RNA labeling methodologies (Dayie, Williamson), and NMR data acquisition/assignment methodologies (Al-Hashimi, Summers, Marchant, Tolbert, Dayie, Johnson, Bax), to facilitate NMR studies of large RNAs. The NMR Core also interacts extensively with the Case and Johnson labs of the Computational Core, and with the Chiu, Zheng, and Pornillos labs of the cryoEM Core, to facilitate development of hybrid methodologies and force fields that enable structural and dynamical studies of larger HIV RNAs. Hybrid NMR/SAXS methods are also being developed and evaluated (Tolbert, Case, Dayie). The NMR Core also provides screening services to assist CRNA members in the identification of viable new RNA targets for structural analysis, and to support efforts by Hargrove to identify RNA-targeting antivirals. Over the past four years, the NMR Core has contributed to several technical innovations and discoveries including: (1) development of a novel fragmentation/annealing-based approach (fr-RNA) for detection and signal assignment of long-range secondary structures; (2) development of improved nucleotide-specific partial deuteration strategies (2H-editing) for NMR signal assignment; (3) development of improved methods detecting and preventing self-templated run-on during T7 RNA polymerase dependent synthesis; (4) development of a novel NMR method for unambiguous identification of intermolecular base pairing in large RNAs; (5) development of a novel NMR/mutagenesis method for measuring the rate of formation of intermolecular base pairs; (6) development of new tools for predicting and validating 1H NMR signal assignments by analysis of depositions in the BioMagResBank database; (7) contributed to the development of a new software package for rapid NMR data processing, and semi-automated RNA signal assignment; (8) development of new pulse sequences for rapid collection of isotopically edited RNA NMR spectra; and for the measurement and characterization of micro-to-millisecond conformational exchange in RNA; (9) development of new 2H, 13C, and 15N-labeled reagents to facilitate structural and dynamical studies of large RNAs; and (10) conducted service work for members of the CRNA (Beemon, Bieniasz, Hargrove, Boris-Lawrie, Parent, Heng), as well as for other NIH funded centers (James Hurley, HARC, Berkeley), several of which led to new structural projects. The NMR Core will continue to push the size limits of NMR and will support studies of new protein and RNA targets identified by the CRNA and other NIH funded groups.

"9390141","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a significant public health problem affecting nearly 30,000 Americans annually and causing long-term functional impairments. Accounting for 25% of all stroke-related deaths, aSAH is a devastating injury that leaves an astounding 66% of survivors with a reduced quality of life and approximately 50% remaining fully dependent on caregivers. It is widely accepted that the poor functional outcomes following aSAH are due in large part to the development of secondary complications during the acute recovery phase including delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Unfortunately, the causes of DCI remain largely unknown and studies to develop therapeutic interventions are hindered by the inability to identify patients at high risk for DCI. Preclinical models have elucidated metabolic mechanisms that contribute to a unique type of cell death which is dependent upon intracellular iron and results in secondary ischemic brain injury (similar to DCI) in animals following aSAH. These studies also demonstrate that iron chelators effectively reduce neuronal cell death associated with this complication. Despite this evidence, iron homeostasis is not recognized as an important clinical pathway post-aSAH due to a dearth of research in humans. Based on evidence from our studies as well as the literature, we propose that the substantial variability in patient outcomes following aSAH largely centers on genetic/epigenetic variation in the iron homeostasis pathway; our overall goal is to gain a better understanding of these biological mechanisms. The specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) to characterize the relationship between changes in cerebrospinal fluid DNA methylation of candidate genes related to iron homeostasis and variability of acute and long-term outcomes following aSAH and 2) to examine the relationship between polymorphisms in candidate genes related to iron homeostasis and variability of acute and long-term outcomes following aSAH. Using biospecimens linked to extensive patient outcome phenotype data collected from a large, ongoing longitudinal study, the proposed research will use multiple logistic regression modeling, trajectory modeling, candidate gene association, and gene-gene interaction analyses to explore epigenetic and genetic variability of iron homeostasis pathway. The proposed study is in line with the mission of NINR in that it focuses on improving the health of individuals by deciphering the genetic influence on variability in symptoms and patient outcomes and specifically addresses many of the symptom science innovative questions included in the NINR strategic plan including elucidating the omic indicators related to the mechanisms and assessment of symptoms and the mechanistic pathways that can distinguish underlying symptom cluster trajectories. This novel study will lay the foundation for a line of research to identify clinically relevant biomarkers and evidence- based therapies for aSAH victims in order to improve patient outcomes and also represents a beginning step in the applicant's program of research."
"9344637","Biomedical engineering, particularly as it applies to neuroscience, has reached a stage of development at which further understanding of complex neural systems, such as the hippocampus and other cortical regions that underlie cognition and higher thought processes, will depend on mathematical modeling as a means to organize experimental data that is known, and to systematically explore the unknown. The research objectives of Core Project #4 are to further develop and apply methodologies based on principles of nonlinear systems theory for experimentally-based, mathematical modeling of neurons and neural systems. This approach leads to what are commonly termed non-parametric or input-output models, i.e., functional properties that emerge as a consequence of interactions among the internal components of the system - without necessarily describing the internal components themselves. In contrast, parametric models represent the mechanistic properties of the system, with parameters that can be interpreted directly with respect to those underlying mechanisms. We will explore parametric modeling of the hippocampus both in the context of a glutamatergic synaptic model (EONS) continued from previous work, and a new project: a large-scale, compartmental neuron model (10[6] neurons, 10[10] synapses) of hippocampus that incorporates much of the quantitative neuroanatomy, synaptic physiology, and topographic connectivity available for that structure. Ultimately our goal is to establish means for the synergistic use of non-parametric and parametric modeling methods, in the context of accelerating multi-scale modeling, to further our understanding of how global system dynamics underlying cognition, and specifically memory, derive from molecular and synaptic mechanisms."

In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, about 15 of which are visited each year. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. Findings from this survey are used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases. Information is used to assess nutritional status and its association with health promotion and disease prevention. NHANES findings are also the basis for national standards for such measurements as height, weight, and blood pressure.

TE activity accounts for most of the DNA that is unique to each mammal species, and is responsible for as much as 30% of structural genomic variation within the human population. However how this enormous source of genetic variation impacts the evolution and physiology of species remains poorly understood. This project is designed to yield transformative insights into the biological significance of TEs in evolution and disease. The central hypothesis tested in this proposal is that prefabricated regulatory and coding activities ancestrally encoded by TEs have been co-opted repeatedly during vertebrate evolution to promote the emergence of new cellular functions. At the regulatory level, we will deploy innovative computational and experimental approaches to test the hypothesis that polymorphic and lineage-specific TEs make a substantial contribution to transcriptomic and cis-regulatory variation within humans and across a diverse set of mammal species, including primates, rodents and bats, with an emphasis on the origin and turnover of long noncoding RNA repertoires. Furthermore, we will investigate the role of TEs in the regulatory evolution of a major component of the innate immune system, the interferon response. Experimental manipulations in cell lines, including genome editing and functional assays, will be used to validate the functional significance of TE-derived regulatory sequences. At the protein-coding level, we will combine evolutionary sequence analysis and functional assays to characterize several TE-derived genes co-opted for cellular function in the human genome. Notably we will test the hypothesis that envelope proteins derived from endogenous retroviruses are capable of protecting cells from retroviral infection. We will also investigate several domesticated transposases involved in brain function and development. Together the outcomes of this proposal are anticipated to shift the perception of TEs from inert molecular fossils to active contributors to the evolutionary plasticity of vertebrate genomes. In addition, our studies are bound to reveal crucial new insights into the role of mobile genetic elements in promoting disease states, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodevelopmental disorders."

"9325572","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are the major adult psychotic disorders; uncertainty about their relationship is a central issue in psychiatry. By discovering variants with a high impact on either or both disorders (or on their endophenotypes) we can transform our understanding of their biology. This multisite project, from investigators with a track record of successful collaboration, will leverage exceptional, extensively phenotyped pedigree and population samples and integrate a combination of bioinformatics and experimental genomics approaches to identify such variants and demonstrate their relationship to these diseases. We will proceed through three steps: (1) Detect novel variants by whole genome sequencing (WGS) of discovery samples from ethnically homogenous populations; (2) Prioritize genome regions for further studies of these variants, using bioinformatics and functional genomics analyses; (3) Identify disease related variants through (a) imputation-based association analyses in very large case/control samples from the same populations and (b) validation of associated and predicted-deleterious variants using novel high-throughput functional assays. The WGS discovery sample includes SCZ, BP, and control individuals from Finland (FIN) and the Netherlands (NL). We will analyze their variants using a pipeline already implemented by our group to analyze the completed WGS of BP pedigrees from recently bottlenecked Latin American founder populations. The majority of our WGS samples derive from such founder populations; as we have shown previously this creates a high probability of detecting deleterious variants in these samples. WGS will detect a huge number of variants, most of unknown functional significance. We will thus narrow our focus to regions (coding and non-coding) most likely relevant to SCZ and BP, using two approaches: (1) Bioinformatics to prioritize regions previously implicated in these disorders (e.g. GWAS or CNV loci, or variants highlighted in prior sequencing studies including that of our BP pedigrees) and candidate regulatory regions (through analyses of ENCODE or other reference data); (2) Sequencing-based assessments of transcriptomic and epigenomic variation that we will conduct in two unique samples relevant to our phenotypes: fibroblasts from affected and unaffected members of our BP pedigrees; and neuronal and neuronal progenitor cells from reference individuals. We will then leverage very large, genotyped case/control samples available from the same populations as our discovery samples (or closely related ones) to accurately impute the novel variants from our prioritized regions; this will enable us to identify associations with SCZ, BP, and/or endophenotypes. Finally, in an initial validation study, we will use a novel high-throughput sequence-based reporter assay to evaluate the function of putative regulatory variants highlighted by our bioinformatics pipeline or by our association analyses."

"9396120","Project Summary Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Mitochondria are vital organelles for heart function because they sustain contractility by providing the heart with energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Because of this, there is a strong correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and the development of heart failure. However, the mechanism(s) of origin and precise role in disease progression are not fully understood. The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1 (MCL-1) is widely recognized as an important factor in programmed cell death inhibition. Interestingly, it has also been shown to be essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cardiac function in the adult heart. MCL- 1 exists in two forms, one found in the outer mitochondrial membrane (MCL-1OM) and the other in the mitochondrial matrix (MCL-1Matrix). While studies have implicated MCL-1OM in regulating apoptosis, very little is known about the functional role of MCL-1Matrix. My preliminary data indicate that MCL-1Matrix can regulate mitochondrial morphology by promoting fusion of mitochondria. Furthermore, MCL-1Matrix protects mitochondria from degradation by autophagosomes in response to stress. However, the mechanism by MCL-1 exerts these functions and their functional roles in the myocardium are still unclear. The proposed project will examine the hypothesis that MCL-1Matrix promotes fusion of mitochondria to preserve bioenergetic capacity and protect them from mitophagy and necrosis during energy limiting conditions. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. The first aim will delineate how MCL-1Matrix regulates mitochondrial morphology and cell survival. The second aim will evaluate the functional role of MCL-1Matrix in regulating mitochondrial morphology and function in vivo. This aim will utilize WT and cardiac specific MCL-1Matrix transgenic mice to investigate how overexpression of MCL-1Matrix affects mitochondrial structure/function and responsiveness to fasting and myocardial infarction. These studies will provide important new insights into the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics, turnover and survival in the heart. A better understanding of how mitochondrial function is regulated in the heart under normal and disease conditions such as myocardial infarct will contribute towards future clinical management of heart disease."
"9350418","Project summary The choroid plexus is a highly vascularized, secretory tissue that protrudes into the brain ventricles, whose primary function is to produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF provides nutritional and metabolic support for brain development and mediates efficient waste removal. Choroid plexus consists of an apical monolayer of ciliated epithelial cells that surround a stromal core of capillaries and connective tissues. Choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) each forms one to two dozen cilia, which are microtubule-based organelles that project from the apical membrane. Emerging evidence has suggested the importance of cilia in choroid plexus development and function, as a connection has been established between a defective ciliogenesis in choroid plexus and the excessive CSF production in mice. Our preliminary studies identified a highly redundant miRNA family, miR-34/449 miRNAs, as the key regulators for CPEC ciliogenesis. The miR-34/449 family comprises six evolutionarily conserved, homologous miRNAs that are highly enriched in the ciliated CPECs. miR-34/449-deficient mice are characterized by reduced brain ventricle size, aberrant CPEC morphology and impaired brain development, suggesting a reduced CSF production due to defective choroid plexus functions. Interestingly, the earliest defect we can detect in miR-34/449-deficient choroid plexus is the aberrant ciliogenesis in CPECs, characterized by a significant increase of the cilium number per cell and a greater length of the axonemes. Given the functional importance of CPEC cilia in negatively regulating CSF production, we hypothesize that the miR-34/449 deficiency leads to excessive CPEC ciliogenesis, which represses CSF production and impairs brain development. Here, we propose to functionally characterize miR-34/449 miRNAs in CPEC ciliogenesis and CSF production, and to elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Using genetic mouse models, choroid plexus in vitro culture, cell biology and molecular biology approaches, we will characterize the cellular and molecular defects in miR-34/449-TKO choroid plexus, and investigate the functional connection between CPEC cilia and choroid plexus function. We will also identify the key miR-34/449 targets that mediate CPEC ciliogenesis and CSF production. Our studies will not only reveal a highly robust regulatory mechanism for CPEC ciliogenesis, but also provide important insights into the functional importance of CPEC cilia in choroid plexus function."
"9383861","Project Summary Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) adds O-linked fucose to Thrombospondin Type 1 Repeats (TSRs) with the appropriate consensus sequence. TSRs are small cysteine-rich protein motifs that typically occur in tandem repeats and function in a wide variety of biologically essential contexts including cell attachment, migration, division, and apoptosis. The O-linked fucose on TSRs can be extended by a ?3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT) to form a Glucose?1-3Fucose disaccharide. The biological importance of these glycan modifications is highlighted by the fact that mice lacking POFUT2 display severe gastrulation defects, and human mutations in B3GLCT cause Peters Plus Syndrome (PPS), a congenital disorder of glycosylation with multiple developmental defects, many of which overlap with single gene defects in POFUT2 targets. POFUT2 only modifies folded TSRs, suggesting it can differentiate between folded and unfolded structures. Loss of POFUT2 blocks secretion of a growing number of the 49 POFUT2 target proteins in cell culture, and the effect appears more significant for proteins with tandem TSRs than singles. Recent data suggest that POFUT2 and B3GLCT work together in a novel non-canonical ER quality control system necessary for folding and secretion of POFUT2 targets. Addition of POFUT2 and GDP-fucose to an in vitro TSR folding reaction accelerates TSR folding by shifting the folding equilibrium towards the folded state, and addition of glucose by B3GLCT has an additional stabilizing effect. These observations have led to our main hypothesis, that the O-fucose glycan on an individual TSR stabilizes the folded state through interactions with specific residues of that TSR, accelerating the folding of nascent TSR-containing proteins in a sequential manner from N- to C-terminus in the ER. We will test this hypothesis in three Aims: First, we will use a newly developed Pofut2 conditional allele to determine whether TSR O-fucosylation is required in vivo for secretion and function of POFUT2 targets in the myeloid lineage and the developing limb mesenchyme. In Aim 2, we will analyze how O-fucosylation facilitates the folding of a single TSR by using NMR analysis to identify TSR residues in contact with the O- fucose glycan, and then introduce mutations in those residues to evaluate their importance in the stabilizing effects of the glycans. In Aim 3 we will examine whether tandem TSRs are more dependent on POFUT2 than a single TSR for secretion using a recently developed quantitative POFUT2-dependent secretion assay. Using this approach, we will determine whether the increased dependence of tandem TSRs on POFUT2 is an additive effect of stabilizing individual TSRs or if the glycan on one TSR cooperatively stabilizes an adjacent TSR, and whether O-fucosylation of tandem TSRs occurs sequentially during folding. Successful accomplishment of these aims will provide crucial molecular and cellular details regarding this novel quality control pathway necessary for a clear understanding of TSR folding, which could be used in the future to design therapies for treatment of diseases resulting from defects in the folding or function of POFUT2 targets."
"9357892","This proposal describes plans to maintain and extend the UCSC Genome Browser at https://genome.ucsc.edu/ and its related web pages, databases, and computer programs. The web-based Genome Browser tool has been used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers who seek to understand the human genome and those of other animals, particularly vertebrates and model organisms. The browser aggregates the research results of hundreds of biomedical labs ? including a wide range of biochemical assays, genetic studies, curational efforts, sequencing projects, computer analyses, and text-mining of scientific literature ? into a series of tracks aligned to the underlying DNA sequence. The genome provides a natural integration framework for these diverse data sources, which the browser exploits to its fullest at a variety of display scales ranging from the single base to individual genes, entire chromosomes, and ultimately to the genome as a whole. The Genome Browser is implemented using robust, fast, high-quality software capable of handling over one million hits per day. This web software provides a window into an exceptionally detailed and well-documented database that can be queried computationally as well as browsed graphically. The database is loaded with a suite of programs, developed both at UCSC and elsewhere, capable of distilling huge genomics data sets into high-quality annotations of the genome. Significant engineering effort is invested to ensure the quality of the software and data sets, including those developed by external contributors. We aim to extend the software and database in significant ways. We plan to develop displays for personal, family, and tumor genomes that will help researchers separate significant mutations from the background of other genetic variation. We will make it possible to view regions together in a single window that are separate in the linear structure of the chromosome, but in close proximity in the higher-order three-dimensional structure, or that are related by biochemical pathways, homology, or other relationships. We plan to develop a version of the browser optimized for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. We will improve the search capabilities we offer, particularly of large remote datasets. We will continue to import genome assemblies for species of biomedical interest, and integrate a broad range of useful new genomic data from the scientific community, including the ENCODE project. We will collaborate in developing and deploying data exchange standards such as file formats, APIs, and controlled vocabularies that help other groups leverage our resource and extend the reach of the browser to any dataset in compliance with the APIs. We will support this work with effective scientific, project, and personnel management; a plan for broadly disseminating the software tools, libraries, source code and data; and well-established training and outreach mechanisms."
"9360075","SUMMARY CORE 2 This Program Project comprises four individual projects, which will: implement evidence-based sequential multiple treatment assignment strategies for patients predicted to have insufficient response to their initial neoadjuvant targeted and/or chemotherapy (Project 1); qualify non-invasive imaging methods as early markers of non-response (Project 2); characterize the biology of non-responders to inform treatment selection (Project 3); and develop a portfolio of agents and decision tools for treatment re-assignment matched to biology of non- responding tumors (Project 4). The Bioinformatics and Statistics Core will act as a centralized resource where the analytical goals of these projects converge - where we work closely with each of the project groups not only to provide project-specific analytical support, but also to build predictive models across multiple modalities (imaging, molecular profiles and their combination) and facilitate cross-project interactions towards the common goal of building robust decision algorithms to enable adaptation of treatment for individual women with poor response to their initial neoadjuvant targeted and/or chemotherapy. This undertaking will utilize substantial the archived and newly generated datasets from the I-SPY 1 and I-SPY 2 trials to develop and validate algorithms that will enable the transition to I-SPY 2+, where patients predicted as insufficient responders by an optimized, subtype-specific MRI-based predictor ?Virtual RCB? can be identified during the course of their initial therapy (after completion of their taxol +/- experimental agent and 2 cycles of AC) and offered alternative treatment strategies based on their tumor biology in order to mitigate recurrence and improve long term outcomes. The primary goal of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core is to provide biostatistics and bioinformatics support to individual projects and facilitate cross-project analyses and results sharing within the Program Project Framework. The specific aims are listed as follows: Specific Aim 1: To provide innovative bioinformatics and statistical modeling and analytical approaches needed by the projects to achieve their Specific Aims. Specific Aim 2: To develop SMART (sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial) methods for adaptive treatment of predicted non-responders within the I-SPY 2+ Program Project framework.

"9333355","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 500,000 people in United States have end stage renal disease (ESRD), and these individuals suffer from an extremely high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) death. Treatments that are effective in reducing CV mortality in the general population have been less successful in dialysis-dependent ESRD, and new therapies are sorely needed. Traditional CV risk factors are less important in the setting of advanced kidney failure, and the disappointing results with standard therapies appear to be attributable to important differences in the mechanisms underlying CV disease in individuals with ESRD. Sudden death accounts for the vast majority of CV deaths in individuals with ESRD, with a 5-folder higher frequency than atherosclerotic death or myocardial infarction which more commonly account for CV mortality in other settings. These considerations suggest that targeting ESRD-specific mechanisms for sudden CV death rather than mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction may be a particularly potent way to improve outcomes in ESRD. However, there are currently no well-established targets or therapies for this purpose. A wealth of data including studies by the applicants demonstrate that myocardial fibrosis and microvascular dropout are dramatically increased in the hearts of individuals with ESRD, and that non-invasive measures of myocardial fibrosis and microvascular disease are highly predictive of CV death, suggesting that fibrosis and microvascular disease are important determinants of sudden CV death. Additional studies show that abnormalities in the bioavailability of nitric oxide and aldosterone are critical and synergistic contributors to the progression of myocardial fibrosis and microvascular disease and that administration of spironolactone or L-arginine improve NO bioavailability, inhibit the effects of aldosterone, and are safe in ESRD. We therefore hypothesize that administration of L-arginine or the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone to patients with dialysis-dependent ESRD will inhibit myocardial fibrosis and microvascular dropout. We will test our 2 specific aims using a 9-month, randomized, placebo- controlled, 2x2 factorial clinical trial conducted at Partners Health Care and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Aim 1) To test the hypothesis that blockade of aldosterone using spironolactone improves myocardial fibrosis and microvascular supply in individuals with ESRD as measured using tissue Doppler Echocardiography (TDI) and myocardial perfusion imaging (PET) scans, respectively; Aim 2) To test the hypothesis that L-arginine, an agent which improves NO bioavailability, improves myocardial fibrosis and microvascular supply as measured by TDI and PET."
"9353656","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that allows for the mapping of the biological distribution of an injected radiotracer; depending on the type of radiotracer a range of topics may be studied, such as: mental and neurodegenerative disorders, various types of cancers, pulmonary embolisms, and heart disease. We are currently building a dual-headed SPECT system that uses double-sided strip, high-purity germanium (DSS HPGe) detectors. HPGe offers an energy resolution (FWHM < 1% at 140 keV) an order of magnitude better than conventional NaI gamma cameras, and its charge transport properties enable spatial resolutions similar to that of CdZnTe pixel detectors while using far fewer channels of readout electronics. The DSS configuration allows for sub-pixel positioning, however, multiple strip effects such as charge sharing, charge loss and Compton scattering within the detector can cause the events to be mis- positioned and/or uncounted. This decreases detection efficiency and overall sensitivity, possibly leading to artifacts in the reconstructed image. Alternative, advanced post-processing techniques have been shown to correct for these effects in limited cases (specific detector configurations and/or only small detector areas investigated). The goal of this proposed study is to investigate and implement the following post-processing techniques: waveform analysis, Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation, and charge loss correction across the whole detector. This will be done in three aims: Aim 1) Carefully measure the detector system response using the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory, Aim 2) Perform the position estimation techniques on the data obtained in aim 1. With these data sets (one for each technique) and knowledge of the beam position the three-dimensional position of each event may be determined using the ML estimation (note that one technique is to try the ML method without additional post-processing). Each technique will be evaluated by measuring: uniformity, energy and spatial resolution, and evaluation of a projected image (spatial resolution, signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio, modulation transfer function, etc), and Aim 3) Implement the new position estimation technique with the new SPECT system and evaluate the differences between the new reconstructed image compared to our current post-processing technique. We expect to obtain reconstructed SPECT images that have higher resolution, sensitivity, and contrast, as well as fewer artifacts, leading to better detectability."
"9205191","SUMMARY The primary objectives of the Bioinformatics and Data Management Core (BDMC) are to: (1) develop and implement standardized data acquisition and data analysis protocols across the NexGen AD Models Center (NG-ADMC), (2) acquire and integrate external data to inform AD animal models generated by the NG-ADMC, and (3) create and maintain a publicly available database to house research data generated by the NG-ADMC. The BDMC is led by faculty members with a long-standing history of directing bioinformatics, statistics, and data cores, with particular expertise in AD and neurology. The BDMC will be instrumental in the development and application of statistical models and bioinformatics methodologies as applied to the analysis of animal model discoveries. These analyses will be used for validation purposes as well as in the refinement of existing models. Specifically, faculty within the BDMC will build flexible predictive models using multiple clinical data sources in order to identify and prioritize LOAD risk alleles, and to analyze gene expression profiles, proteomics, and metabolomics data for implementation in animal models. They will also develop and apply efficient sequential testing designs for testing identified mouse models, and use robust post-hoc subgroup identification methods for assessing potential subpopulation heterogeneity in the effect of globally non- efficacious candidate therapies. The end result will allow the BDMC to identify and validate translatable biomarkers that can ultimately assist in clinico-pathological staging of an AD-like disease progression in AD animal models.  "
"9322863","Project Summary/Abstract  The Hedgehog (Hh) cell?cell signaling pathway plays key roles in embryonic development, in maintenance of adult stem cells, and, when improperly regulated, in various birth defects and cancers. In vertebrates, the prototypical activator of the Hh pathway is the secreted protein Sonic hedgehog (SHH), which must travel far from the cells that produce it (?sending cells?) to the cells to which it signals (?receiving cells?). Paradoxically, though, SHH is covalently attached to cholesterol, a modification that tethers it to the plasma membrane of sending cells. Recent studies discovered that the membrane protein Dispatched1 (DISP1) and the SCUBE family of secreted proteins are required for SHH release from sending cells. However, the precise mechanism through which SCUBE2 drives SHH release is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether SCUBE2 actively contributes to SHH delivery to receiving cells, where SHH must bind to its receptor, Patched1 (PTCH1), and at least one of three functionally redundant co-receptors, CDO, BOC, and GAS1.  My preliminary data demonstrates that: (1) SCUBE2 can release a heterologous cholesterol-modified protein, but less efficiently than it releases SHH; (2) SCUBE2 directly enhances SHH delivery to receiving cells; (3) SCUBE2 binds to CDO; and (4) different parts of SCUBE2 are involved in SHH release and SHH delivery. These data suggest that (1) SCUBE2 drives SHH release by first binding SHH protein on sending cells and subsequently binding its cholesterol anchor, and (2) SCUBE2 facilitates SHH delivery to receiving cells by directly binding SHH co-receptors.  The present proposal aims to: (1) determine how SCUBE2 recognizes the cholesterol anchor of SHH, and to test the function of cholesterol-binding in SHH release from cells, using photocrosslinking with novel photoreactive cholesterol analogs and mass spectrometry; (2) elucidate how SCUBE2 selectively releases SHH from cells, using live-cell fluorescence microscopy and release assays; and (3) elucidate the mechanism and function of interaction between SCUBE2 and SHH co-receptors in SHH delivery, using live-cell fluorescence microscopy and knockout and overexpression approaches in cell-based signaling assays.  These experiments will clarify how membrane-anchored SHH is released and delivered to distant cells, providing critical missing information in our understanding of Hh signaling. This information, in turn, will define novel molecular targets, at the level of ligand release and delivery, for blocking aberrant Hh signaling in cancer."

I currently serve as PI on one NIAAA R01 grant and one Foundation grant, and am Co-Investigator on 3 R01s (NIMH, NCCAM, NIDA) and 1 R21 (NIAAA). I mentor a growing group of junior investigators, including 3 mentees on K01 grants. I work in a rich environment for clinical research, which is ideal for training junior faculty in POR. However, I receive no institutional support for mentoring and will be required to curtail mentoring efforts to assume significant non-research responsibilities beginning in 2017. The K24 award will protect time that would permit an increase in intensive mentorship to junior investigators and attract researchers to POR. My immediate and long-term career objectives are to characterize neurobiological markers in addiction and psychiatric disorders, which will inform the development of new and effective treatments for alcohol use disorders and for patients with dual diagnoses, and to train the next generation of investigators to develop the skills they require to effectively conduct POR. I also remain committed to disseminating research findings (through publications, scientific lectures and public outreach) that will help prevention efforts and that will inform treatment interventions, to aid in the reduction of suffering due to alcohol use and abuse. The specific aims to be accomplished during the period of the award are to 1) provide substantive mentoring of junior investigators in POR (35%), 2) continue and extend involvement in my POR (10%), and 3) develop specific new content expertise in the areas of adolescent comorbid psychopathology, clinical approaches in adolescent treatment settings, and epigenetics (5%). I am committed to training a remarkable group of mentees, who are the future of addiction and psychiatry POR. Through intensive mentoring I will, in turn, enhance my POR by increasing my clinical perspectives, and by incorporating treatment and epigenetic components into new POR initiatives."
"9349380","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intellectual disability is common in the US (2% of school-aged children). Despite this, almost no treatment options are available for this heterogeneous group of disorders. In part, treatment development has been halted by the general notion that intellectual disability is not treatable. However, if one could find a subgroup of treatable causes of intellectual disability and demonstrate the ability to treat these in postnaal life, one would help break this general dogma. Preliminary data suggest that two Mendelian disorders of the histone machinery, Kabuki syndrome and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, might be treatable causes of intellectual disability in postnatal life. We have demonstrated that a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome has postnatal hippocampal memory defects and these deficiencies appear to improve when the mice are treated in postnatal life with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Here we propose to create a tetracycline responsive conditional mouse model of Kabuki syndrome. By altering Mll2 gene expression in postnatal life we will test the hypothesis that the hippocampal memory defects we observed in Mll2 (+/-) mice relate to an ongoing postnatal imbalance between the systems that remove and add H3K4 trimethylation. This model will allow us to test the hypothesis that treatments at different time points in postnatal life are equally effective at treating the hippocampal memory defect found in these syndromes. Together, these experiments would help establish Kabuki syndrome as an additional treatable cause of intellectual disability. Since Kabuki syndrome and Rubinstein-Taybi both have hippocampal memory deficiency caused by an abnormality of the histone modification systems that is associated with open chromatin, we hypothesize that they have a shared mechanism. We aim to test this hypothesis by: (a) determining whether both disorders have a deficiency of either biochemical marker of open chromatin (i.e. histone H3K4 trimethylation and histone acetylation); (b) exploring whether the double heterozygote state (Mll2+/- and Cbp+/-) increases the severity of the abnormalities found in Mll2 (+/-); (c) testing the hypothesis that the gene families found to be down-regulated in these two diseases cluster in several critical pathways shared by the two disorders. By understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders one might be able to identify additional treatable causes of intellectual disability, biomarkers of therapeutc efficiency, and novel therapeutic targets. In an effort to expand the repertoire of agents for treatment of these two disorders we have developed two reporter alleles that encode proteins that inform the activity of a particular histone modification systems: one that fluoresces in response to activity of the H3K4 trimethylation system (deficient in Kabuki syndrome), and one that fluoresces in response to activity of the histone acetylation system (deficient in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome). We intend to use these alleles for the development of assays for high-throughput discovery of therapeutic agents using both patient cells and/or mouse embryonic stem cells from our mice."

"9371097","Project Summary Work capacity is an important predictor of declining health or physical function, and of mortality, and is commonly measured as peak oxygen consumption. Peak oxygen consumption is very low in individuals with Down syndrome, the most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability. Previous research suggests individuals with Down syndrome may experience a double disadvantage when they are exercising: they may not be able to increase cardiac output sufficiently and they may not be able to allocate adequate blood flow to the working muscles. The overall aim of this research proposal is therefore to determine the impact of limitations in central and peripheral regulation of blood flow on work capacity in individuals with DS. We aim to examine both acute and chronic exercise responses to better understand the underlying mechanisms and the potential to improve health by using this knowledge in interventions. The candidate, Dr. Thessa Hilgenkamp, has a strong background in epidemiological research on health in individuals with intellectual disabilities including Down syndrome. Her research focuses on the benefits of physical activity and exercise in this population, and she has shown great potential to become a successful independent researcher in this field. Recently she has developed expertise in measuring autonomic regulation during exercise with Dr. Bo Fernhall in the Integrative Physiology Laboratory of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her long-term goal is to improve the health of individuals with Down syndrome across the life span, by fully understanding autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular regulation of the response to exercise and implementing this knowledge in physical activity and exercise interventions. Her short-term career goals are first to become a skilled, knowledgeable expert on cardiovascular exercise physiology and autonomic function in individuals with Down syndrome, and second to become a high-potential researcher in this specific field, both from the perspective of academia and from the perspective of clinical practice and the Down syndrome support networks in the community. This Career Development Award will allow her to receive additional training in technical knowledge and skills that will be in line with and complementary to the research proposal, to conduct research projects in collaboration with clinical practice and the Down syndrome support networks in the community, and to develop transferable skills necessary to become a successful independent researcher, such as grant writing, lab management and mentoring. Her mentor is Dr. Bo Fernhall, a world-renowned expert on cardiovascular exercise physiology and Down syndrome, and she will also be supported by Dr. Tracy Baynard and Dr. Philip Clifford of the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition of the University of Illinois at Chicago. This Department is committed to Dr. Hilgenkamp's academic development and provides her with all the facilities she needs, including the equipment in the Integrative Physiology Laboratory that she needs. She also has the support of parent networks and the Special Olympics Illinois to conduct this research."
"9360624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Computer users increasingly have multiple devices, including desktops, phones, tablets, and laptops, and often use applications designed for different operating systems (OSes).  For instance, a Mac user may access a cloud-based Windows remote desktop to run an application required for her job.  The trend toward multiple devices and OSes creates a burden for users with visual impairments:  these users' productivity depends on features of a speci?c screen reader, and these readers are tied to a speci?c OS.  The only current option is to run a different screen reader on each platform-harming productivity incurring additional expense.  The goal of the proposed work is to decouple unmodi?ed, binary screen readers from the original OS platform, giving users with visual impairments a seamless experience when accessing assorted applications running on any platform and any device without having to switch their preferred screen reader.  This proposal is built around the insight that this point of similarity is the semantics of application User In- terfaces (UIs); applications on every OS consist of similar widgets such as buttons, drop-down menus, and text ?elds.  The primary obstacle to porting screen readers across platforms are the degree to which accessibility APIs are idiosyncratic, cumbersome, and varied across platforms.  The novel concept is semantics-preserving virtualization, which is designed around a simple model of application UIs that is both minimal and suf?ciently expressive to represent any application's UI.  This generic UI model is used to drive cross-platform translations, from, say Windows' UI model into the generic model, and then to the Mac UI model such that Apple's native screen reader, VoiceOver, can read a Windows application as if it were running on the Mac.  We will integrate these translations into both remote desktop clients and OS emulators to decouple screen readers from the OS.  The speci?c aims of this project include:  1) Developing a computing systems framework to virtualize user interfaces at the semantic level, 2) Developing multiple proof-of-concept implementations where a screen reader designed for one OS is used to make applications running on a different OS accessible, 4) Exploring a simple programming model for writing customizations and extensions to assistive technologies, and 3) Validating the usability of the system with end-user case studies.  This project will empower users with visual impairments to use any device without a disproportionate loss of productivity-ultimately allowing them to lead more independent lives with improved employment prospects.  Thus, this project advances the vision of Universal Accessibility, that anyone should be able to reap the bene?ts of the information age with any computing device, unconstrained by any disability.  In addition to the practical impact for users, the project will have a research impacton the ?eld of Computer Accessibility and Operating Systems by developing a novel model for application user interfaces and removing systems-level obstacles that needlessly delay advances in accessibility software."
"9335807","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award facilitates the attainment of the Candidate's long-term goal of contributing to the science base that will inform future regulatory policy on nicotine content in cigarettes, particularly as this policy affects adolescents. The activities outlined in this application afford the Candidate excellent training in youth smoking, human behavioral pharmacology and advanced statistical methods; and the Candidate proposes applying this knowledge to an innovative research plan focused on evaluating very low nicotine content cigarettes in adolescent smokers. Reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to a non-addictive level - a strategy made possible by the 2009 passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) - could dramatically reduce smoking rates in the US (Benowitz & Henningfield, 1994). The legislation has the potential to impact the pattern of cigarette smoking over the lifetime, making cigarettes less reinforcing for young people, and thus decreasing the number of teen chippers who go on to be lifelong smokers (Sofuoglu & LeSage, 2012). However, little is known about the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes in adolescents. The optimal dose of nicotine for reducing cigarette demand, effects on smoking topography, acceptability of these cigarettes and adolescents' perceptions of the relative risks of these cigarettes are all open questions. While an FDA-mandated reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes has the potential to dramatically reduce smoking rates in the population, reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes could have unintended negative consequences in adolescents if these smokers engage in compensatory smoking or perceive VLNC cigarettes as being low in harm. Therefore, evaluating the positive and negative consequences of VLNC cigarette use among adolescent smokers is critical for evaluating the viability of this policy. We propose to examine the effects of VLNC cigarettes using two studies, one completed in the laboratory and one in the natural environment. In Study 1, we will compare the effects of cigarettes varying in nicotine content (normal nicotine content,  0.83], reduced nicotine content [0.28, 0.10] and VLNC [0.06] mg yield) on abstinence-induced craving and withdrawal, affect, perceptions of risk, product acceptability and demand for usual-brand cigarettes in adolescent smokers across four laboratory sessions (n=78). In Study 2 we will randomize adolescent daily smokers (n = 90) to either receive VLNC cigarettes or normal-nicotine content (NNC; 0.83 mg) study cigarettes for three weeks. Participants will be instructed to smoke only those cigarettes. We will conduct daily assessments of total cigarette use (both study cigarette and non-compliant use of usual brand cigarettes; these daily data will be monitored closely for evidence of compensatory smoking), craving, and withdrawal, weekly assessments of breath CO levels, cigarette acceptability, risk perceptions of VLNC and NNC cigarettes and demand for usual-brand cigarettes, and pre- vs. post-use measures of nicotine and toxicant exposure (cotinine and NNAL). Overall, the project will help determine how VLNC cigarettes may affect real-world smoking behavior in adolescents, and illuminate the potential mechanisms through which these products may effect such changes. Such knowledge will contribute to the science base that may inform future policy decisions, and the future grant applications that will be generated from this line of research will ensure that the Candidate experiences a successful transition to becoming an independent researcher. Overall, the research and training activities outlined in this K01 award contribute both to an important area of scientific inquiry, and to the development of a productive and independent research career for the Candidate."
"9461360","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a transition from a P30 Core Center of Excellence in Hematology (DK056465-16) to an NIDDK-sponsored U54 Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC). This transition will facilitate collaborations, training, and resource sharing on a national level. The goal of this CHSCC is to advance research in stem cell and transplantation biology and thereby accelerate the development of new therapies. This requires resources that anticipate and meet the needs of an ever evolving research base. Our past experience has shown that new investigators can be recruited into this area of research if critical cells, technologies, and expertise can be accessed  at reasonable cost. To address these needs we are proposing to provide an Administrative Core and five biomedical research cores. These include Cell Procurement and Processing, to provide large quantities of purified normal hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and stromal populations harvested from adult blood and marrow as well as cord blood and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); Vector Production to provide lenti, retro, foamy and adeno-associated virus vectors for gene transduction, marking, and editing; Specialized Mouse Services including in vivo xenogeneic transplantation assays and the generation of custom transgenic models; the Canine Large Animal Model for preclinical studies including protocol development and IACUC approval; and Molecular Library Development and Screening, that provides access to CRISPR genome editing and shRNA libraries. The services provided by these cores will enable individual investigators to: 1) isolate and characterize stem/progenitor cells, 2) genetically mark, edit or otherwise alter their gene expression, 3) accurately detect and quantitate their progeny in vitro and in vivo, and 4) determine the effects of these manipulations on hematopoiesis at the molecular, cellular, and whole animal levels. The Administrative Core provides budgetary and scientific oversight of all CHSCC activities, and manages a charge back system to generate program income. Program income is used to enhance and expand Core operations as well as support the Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) and Enrichment programs designed for trainees and young investigators in the CHSCC network. Finally, the Administrative Core will work with Sage Bionetworks to create a publicly searchable data archive linking investigators to annotated data, techniques, and protocols generated through the CHSCC programs. The 30 member research base of this CHSCC receives more than 29 million/year direct costs in non-malignant Hematology-related research, 3.8 million comes directly from the NIDDK."

The ultimate goal is to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of hematologic disease."
"9349394","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the major challenges in the treatment of cancer is the large variety of oncogenic alterations within the cancer genome affecting many different cellular processes. As such, effective therapy will likely be based on the specific genetic alterations present in each patient's tumor rather than a single generalized therapy regimen. I recently discovered frequent inactivating mutations of genes including STAG2 that encode the multi- protein cohesin complex in several tumors including glioblastoma, urothelial carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which define molecular subgroups of these tumors with distinct clinical outcomes. The cohesin complex is responsible for sister chromatid cohesion following DNA replication and helps ensure faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, but has also been implicated in additional cellular processes such as regulation of chromatin architecture and gene transcription. My studies in glioblastoma demonstrated that STAG2 mutations were a direct cause of chromosomal instability and aneuploidy; however, cohesin gene alterations in urothelial carcinoma and AML have been identified primarily in near-diploid tumors, suggesting alternative mechanisms by which cohesin inactivation drives oncogenesis. Using a newly generated conditional STAG2 knockout mouse and previously generated isogenic sets of STAG2 proficient and deficient cancer cell lines, I have designed a series of experiments to determine the function of STAG2 during mouse development and tumorigenesis and identify therapeutic methods to selectively target cancer cells harboring cohesin gene mutations. In the first aim, I will determine the impact on murine development of inducing STAG2 knockout starting in embryogenesis using both histologic and cellular characterization. In the second aim, I will determine the function of STAG2 in urothelial carcinogenesis and gliomagenesis by inducing specific knockout of STAG2 within the epithelium of the urinary tract and glial cells of the central nervous system. The proposed studies will prove if STAG2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene, identify cooperating genetic alterations, and determine whether chromosomal instability is a driving oncogenic mechanism. In the third aim, I will determine possible alternative mechanisms by which STAG2 inactivation contributes to tumor development. I will perform experiments to assess the hypothesis that cohesin localizes to regulatory regions of genes that control cellular differentiation and that STAG2 inactivation disrupts cohesin- mediated regulation of these genes controlling differentiation. In the final aim,I will use isogenic sets of STAG2 proficient and deficient cells to determine the role of cohesin in DNA damage repair and the response to radiation and specific DNA damaging agents, as well as perform a CRISPRi-based negative selection screen in order to identify gene products that are required (i.e. synthetically lethal) in the presence STAG2 inactivation. Together, these experiments will determine the function of STAG2 in mouse development and tumorigenesis and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in the many cancers harboring cohesin gene alterations."
"9396366","Project Summary  Mutations in DNA are the source of heritable genetic variation in all organisms. However, non-heritable mutations in transcripts can also occur during the process of transcription. In bacteria, such errors occur approximately 10,000-fold more frequently than mutations to DNA and are therefore pervasive across the transcriptome. An error that occurs within a transcript will be translated up to 40 times; thereby amplifying the effects of a single transcription error. Because such errors can be detrimental, bacteria have evolved multiple quality control mechanisms to minimize the amount of transcription errors that do occur.  For decades, information about the fidelity of transcription was restricted to in vitro transcription assays or in vivo measurements of single reporter genes. A problem with trying to measure error rates over the entire transcriptome is that errors are introduced by sequencing technologies, complicating the differentiation of true vs. artefactual errors. We have recently applied a new RNA-sequencing technology (termed CirSeq) that can distinguish between errors arising from these two sources, allowing us, for the first time, to measure errors at every transcribed site in a genome. The proposed research will investigate multiple transcription quality control mechanisms.  In Aim 1, we will investigate if mutations in sites that alter the structure of the RNAP at the RNA:DNA hybrid affect transcription fidelity. This Aim will measure the effects of these mutations on both base misincorporations and slippage across the transcriptome. In Aim 2, we will implement CirSeq to determine the contributions of the GreA, GreB, and DksA fidelity proteins to the improvement of transcriptional fidelity. In Aim 3, we will investigate if the physical coupling between transcription and translation acts to improve the fidelity of transcription. Upon completion of these aims, we will have uncovered how effective the known transcription quality control mechanisms are at increasing the accuracy of transcription. Additionally, we will investigate a potential new mechanism of improving transcriptional fidelity in protein-coding genes. Ultimately, these aims will lead to a better understanding of this fundamental cellular process that, if disrupted, can have implications in cellular aging, stress survival, and persistence to antibiotic treatment."
"9391947","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: There is a fundamental need to understand how transcription factors function together with their co-regulators to redefine a cell?s developmental potential through cell fate transitions. Our current understanding is limited to a small number of examples often based on simple linear pathways with a transcription factor upstream of its co-regulators either activating or repressing an enhancer, which in turn regulates its cognate gene in time and space. However, without a better understanding of the mutual dependencies between transcription factors and their co-regulators including epigenetic enzymes and collaborative DNA binding factors, it will be impossible to predict how manipulation of either will influence cell fate and developmental potential. The long-term goal of the lab is to understand all levels of molecular control of cell fate transitions in order to efficiently reprogram cells to desired phenotypes. The objective here is to focus on a transcription factor, Foxd3, which is essential to maintain the developmental potential of various stem cells. The central hypothesis is that Foxd3 is used iteratively in stem cells to redefine the cell?s development potential by establishing poised enhancers in association with its co-regulators and collaborative cell specific transcription factors. This hypothesis derives from preliminary data establishing a dual functional role for Foxd3 as a simultaneous activator and repressor through its interaction with and regulation of multiple epigenetic factors. As such it poises genes and redefines the developmental potential of different stem cell populations by moving to new enhancer sites. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the epistatic relationship between Foxd3, H3K4 methylation, nucleosome depletion, and H3K27 acetylation, 2) Uncover the mechanistic basis for Foxd3 movements during the embryonic stem to epiblast cell transition, 3) Identify role of Foxd3 in cohesin recruitment and enhancer- promoter looping during developmental gene activation. In aim 1, epistasis and structure-function analyses will be performed using mutants of the Foxd3 and its coregulators to determine the interdependencies between the factors in establishing a dual-functional complex at bound sites. In aim 2, post-translational modifications and collaboration with other transcription factors will be evaluated to dissect the mechanistic basis of Foxd3 movements. In aim 3, Foxd3?s role in cohesin recruitment and enhancer-promoter looping will be evaluated using time-course and epistasis experiments. The proposal is highly significant as it will provide novel paradigms of gene control central to a cell?s developmental potential. These paradigms are unlikely to be specific to Foxd3, but rather reflect general strategies used by stemness transcription factors to retain or induce a stem cell?s full potential. Such knowledge will allow for better-designed strategies for cell manipulation and improved ability to predict effects of therapeutics aimed at the epigenetic co-regulators."
"9388741","SUMMARY The Administrative Core supports the work of the five Projects and three Cores in terms of administrative planning, oversight, and management of the Yale ACE. It will also monitor utilization of the other Core resources and integration of the projects within the Center as well as coordinate, as appropriate, activities with other grants within the Yale Autism Program, as well as with NIH and central data repositories such as the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and the OpenfMRI database. Allocation of resources and general oversight of the entire program project are central functions of this Core. The overall concerns of the Administrative Core are to maintain efficiency, to ensure compliance with university and HIC regulations, and to maintain smooth and efficient functioning of the research program as well as optimal utilization of Core resources. The work outlined in the five Project areas is thematically connected through links in scientific constructs, subject cohorts, methods, and data sharing, thus, this multidisciplinary Center requires a highly integrated system of communication and coordination from the Administrative Core. An internal Executive Committee (EC) will be convened, comprising all Project Directors (Dr. Chawarska, Dr. Constable, Dr. Ment, and Dr. Vaccarino) and Core Leads (Dr. Powell, Dr. McPartland, Dr. Volkmar, Dr. Macari, and Dr. Chang). The EC will oversee the entire Center, meeting on a monthly basis to set policies, engage in fiscal planning, review progress in the specific project areas and budgets, foster integration and communication across projects and Cores, manage data sharing across the Center, and supervise the publication plan. We will also establish an Internal Advisory Committee, who will receive quarterly updates and meet annually with the EC to discuss progress and provide quality control. In addition, a Center Advisory Committee will be established, including external scientific members as well as lay members. A key effort of the Administrative Core will be to make certain that the abundant resources of the Yale Autism Program, the Child Study Center, and the Medical School are streamlined in support of this endeavor. A web-based collaborative work-space will be created and a communications tool will be implemented, both of which will enhance collaboration and communication. Coordination of the work of the Administrative Core with that of the Clinical Characterization and Statistical Analysis Cores will be a key objective, in order to monitor use of resources, ensure compliance with NIH and IRB regulations, and engage in overall strategic planning. Similarly, efforts to ensure effective dissemination of research findings, community outreach, and recruitment enhancement by the Dissemination and Outreach Core will be supported by this Core to maximize the impact of the program project. This effort will use the expertise and experience of Drs. Chawarska and Constable in coordination of research activities involving various investigators and disciplines."

"9388680","Project Summary This application is a competing continuation of an Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Network grant now entitled, `A Longitudinal Brain and Behavior Study of Autism from Infancy through School Age`. Prior funding has supported a prospective, longitudinal study that has collected high quality brain imaging and behavior assessments in children at high- and low- familial risk (HR, LR) for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), at 2-4 time points (including 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24 months) with 36 month diagnostic re-assessment for autism. This project has been successful in producing 50 manuscripts either published/in press (#35) or under review (#15); and generated 21 external funding opportunities, leveraging this network and expanding the scope of this work. The overarching goal of this ACE Network competing continuation is to continue to follow a unique cohort of 300 HR and 100 LR children into school age (7-10 years) with detailed brain and behavior assessments. School age is a time when academic and social functioning are critically important for future success and a time when HR children are prone to manifest comorbid psychiatric disorders, difficulties with peer relationships, and learning problems which can be assessed more extensively and with greater detail than at earlier ages. Work from this network has revealed that: (1) early brain imaging features are detectable by 6 months of age, well before ASD diagnosis is possible, in those who go on to have an ASD diagnosis at 24 months; (2) autism-specific brain and behavior features change substantially from 6-24 months of age, as autism unfolds; and, (3) brain features in the first year of life are associated with later ASD behaviors and accurately predict individual ASD diagnosis at 24 months. The proposed work extends this solid foundation. In this proposal we aim to: (1) characterize school- age clinical outcomes of HR children and determine early predictors of those clinical outcomes from brain imaging and behavioral features we have already identified from 3-36 months; (2) characterize brain and brain- behavior trajectories in HR-ASD from infancy through school-age and identify the timing of ASD-related brain changes; and (3) empirically derive and validate novel subgroups within the HR group based on brain and behavior trajectories from infancy through school age, incorporating data from molecular genetics and environmental exposures. The potential impact of this study includes: (1) early identification (< 3 years) of children who are more likely to develop school-age (7-10 years) clinical problems, increasing the potential for early intervention; (2) informing intervention studies by identifying age-specific brain targets, biomarkers of treatment efficacy, and targets for pre-clinical, cross-species studies to inform drug development; and,(3) identifying empirically-derived and biologically-meaningful subgroups, based on brain and behavior trajectories from infancy to school age, that could be used to support development of individualized interventions."
"9354393","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This competing renewal application will build on the PI's 15-year prospective study, the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women (CHLEW) (K01 AA00266 & R01 AA013328-09), which focuses on understanding the mechanisms linking minority sexual orientation and hazardous drinking (HD). HD is operationalized as an index that includes heavy episodic drinking, intoxication, adverse drinking consequences and symptoms of potential alcohol dependence. Participants in the previous phase (W3) of the CHLEW study were 354 sexual minority women (SMW: lesbian, bisexual) from the 3-wave longitudinal sample (79% retention at 10-year follow-up) and 373 new participants including younger (age 18-25), and additional Black, Latina, and bisexual SMW (total N=727). The study has collected rich data on individual and interpersonal (micro-level) risk and protective factors for heavy/hazardous alcohol use and alcohol-related problems and has to date produced more than 50 journal articles and book chapters and 6 completed doctoral dissertations.  Building on minority stress theory we propose to expand on our previous work by examining social- contextual (structural-level) risk and protective factors for HD and drinking-related health consequences among SMW. Specifically, we will capitalize on 2 historic opportunities to: 1) conduct a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of the June 1, 2014, Illinois Marriage Fairness Act on SMW's drinking and health; and 2) take advantage of a unique longitudinal dataset-that will include data on SMW's drinking spanning nearly 20 years-to examine the associations of long-term drinking trajectories with SMW's health. We expect that this supportive policy change will have beneficial effects for all SMW and that SMW who choose to marry will demonstrate many of the health benefits of marriage observed among women in the general population. Thus, we plan to use 3 waves of existing data (2000-01, 2004-05, 2010-12) and 2 proposed new waves (2016-17, 2017-18) to (1) examine the overall effect of legal recognition of same-sex marriage on drinking outcomes (volume of alcohol consumption and HD) and potential mediators of such changes among SMW; (2) examine potential moderators of the relationship between legal recognition of same-sex marriage and drinking outcomes; (3) compare drinking outcomes among SMW who marry their same-sex partner and those of SMW in other same-sex relationships (civil unions, cohabiting, committed/not living together); and (4) identify associations between long-term trajectories of alcohol consumption and HD and SMW's physical and mental health, as well as moderators of these associations.  The CHLEW is the longest running and most comprehensive study of SMW's drinking and health in the US or elsewhere. Its large subsamples of women under 25 and over 50, and of Black, Latina, and bisexual women, add to its value by providing a rare opportunity to examine age, race/ethnicity and sexual identity differences in the relationships between marriage recognition and drinking, and between drinking and health."

"9542611","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that sequentially progresses through several stages from its earliest asymptomatic origins characterized by autoantibodies alone through to a fully established and chronic destructive arthritis. Established RA is also characterized by several phenotypic subgroups that vary by genotype, autoantibodies, and environmental exposures. The central hypothesis of this Clinical and Technology Research Site (CTRS) proposal is that RA can be deconstructed such that novel disease stage- and cell lineage-specific therapeutic targets can be identified through the comprehensive evaluation of the linked adaptive and effector arms of the immune system. Reflecting this focus over the full spectrum of disease, the study is designated EMORA (Evolving Mechanisms of Rheumatoid Arthritis). In aggregate, the EMORA clinical and technology site investigators have several existing cohorts and decades of successful collaborations, and together constitute an integrated network of sites with clinical studies expertise, advanced technologies to identify and characterize antigen-specific lymphocytes, and capabilities to process and study synovium using many innovative technologies. EMORA will utilize a core strategy wherein paired peripheral blood and synovial samples are obtained and studied in a highly coordinated manner, and populations of T and B lymphocytes, fibroblast like synoviocytes and monocytic osteoclast precursors will be evaluated as single cells and small homogeneous populations. Using these approaches, EMORA investigators will test three primary hypotheses: 1) Novel mechanisms of disease and distinct therapeutic targets in RA can be discovered that will vary by the stage of development of disease, ranging from subjects at extraordinarily high risk for incipient clinical disease onset through to those with established RA under treatment, 2) Therapeutic targets will be identifiable in both antigen-specific circulating and tissue infiltrating B and T cells that react with RA- related autoantigens, necessitating paire studies of both peripheral blood and synovium, and 3) Exploration of networks of synovial effector cells including fibroblast-like synoviocytes and monocytic osteoclast precursors, identified in both peripheral blood and synovium, will identify novel pathways and related disease targets that drive inflammation, cartilage destruction and bone loss.

Epidemiological data have illustrated that otherwise healthy women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are at a significantly (2-4 times) greater risk for the development of cardiovascular disease; however the mechanism(s) responsible for this association are unclear. One immerging hypothesis for this association is irreversible endothelial damage sustained during the preeclamptic pregnancy. Healthy women with a history of preeclamptic pregnancy demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and reduced endothelium- dependent vasodilation compared to women with a history of uncomplicated pregnancy, yet few, if any, human studies have sought to investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for this persistent vessel dysfunction. Rodent models of preeclampsia point to mechanistic roles for angiotensin II (ang II) and endothelin-1(ET-1) in the vessel dysfunction associated with preeclamptic pregnancy. These data suggest that changes in ang II and ET-1 signaling may lead to a pro-constrictor milieu in which attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability result in exaggerated constriction and persistent vessel dysfunction following preeclamptic pregnancy. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the mechanisms - both augmented constriction and attenuated endothelium-dependent dilation - by which ang II and ET-1 may contribute to this vessel dysfunction. We propose to utilize the human cutaneous circulation, a representative microvascular bed, to investigate microvascular signaling mechanisms in vivo in postpartum women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy and postpartum control women who have had a normal pregnancy. In specific aim 1 we hypothesize that women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy will have an attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation response to local skin heating (physiological stimulus) and exogenous acetylcholine (pharmacological stimulus) compared to women who have had a healthy pregnancy. In specific aim 2 we hypothesize that women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy will have a greater vasoconstrictor response to exogenous ang II and ET-1 administration. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these alterations will be mediated by decreased NO bioavailability downstream of changes in ang II sensitivity and ET-1 receptor signaling. Intradermal microdialysis for the delivery of pharmacological agents directly to the cutaneous vascular bed, coupled with laser-Doppler flux for the measurement of cutaneous blood flow, will be used to pharmacodissect the proposed cellular mechanisms contributing to microvascular dysfunction in this population. This comprehensive assessment of the mechanisms that mediate the persistent microvascular dysfunction following preeclampsia directly translates the functional and molecular findings of cell and animal studies to a clinical population and will lend insight into the management of chronic elevated CVD risk in women who have suffered a preeclamptic pregnancy."
"9336635","PROJECT SUMMARY: PLANNING UNIT With the long-term goal of establishing a Caribbean Regional Center for Research Excellence (CRCRE), our plan is to first develop a Center for Research Excellence (CRE) in Jamaica, ultimately to be rolled out to the rest of the Caribbean. The Center will facilitate robust collaborative research between Caribbean countries as well as international partners. The Aims of the Planning Unit are: Aim 1. Perform a needs assessment including researchers, laboratory personnel and the community; and use the results to plan for a high-quality research program that focuses on multidisciplinary NCD research priorities (in collaboration with the coordinating unit). Aim 2. Establish sustainable regional research enhancement activities for scientists and public health professionals based in Jamaica, to enable them to address heath issues related to NCDs (focused on cancer and cardiometabolic diseases) and conduct a pilot study in this area.. Aim 3. Enhance existing facilities and services to promote regional linkages for robust research, educational and community outreach efforts between Jamaica, the Caribbean region and other international partners. We will achieve this in three phases, the first two during the planning award period. (1) In Phase 1, we will conduct a scientific retreat in Jamaica to introduce the CRCRE plan and initiate a research/laboratory needs assessment to identify priorities, gaps in training and resources for research conduct. This will include researchers, laboratory personnel and the community, in collaboration with the coordinating unit. Results will be used to plan a high quality research program focusing on multidisciplinary research priorities (prostate cancer, CVD and diabetes). (2) Phase 2 includes research enhancement activities for the Jamaica CRE guided by the needs assessments; and planning for the research program and Shared Core Facilities. Although research enhancement activities will be focused in Jamaica, in preparation for the CRCRE (post-award), these activities will be made accessible to the wider Caribbean through web-based communication methods. Research enhancement activities will also be augmented by lab-based training and a mentor-mentee matching program, which will help to strengthen research project concepts and promote development of future pilot research. (3) Planning for Phase 3 (post-award phase) includes development of a research program strategy for sustainability as well as inclusion of additional partners with a U54 application for funding of the Center. Throughout Phases 1 and 2, the aim is to enhance existing facilities and services to promote regional linkages for robust research, educational and community outreach efforts between Jamaica and the Caribbean region, so that by the end of the planning award period and start of Phase 3, preparation for the transition to the CRCRE is complete."
"9521466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation of specific synaptic connections by local interneurons is critical for the processing of neuronal information. However, little is known about the factors that regulate interneuronal connectivity in the central nervous system. Our long-term goal is to understand the genetic mechanisms that control interneuronal circuit formation. The objective of the proposed experiments is to describe how a cell-intrinsic factor and its downstream effectors determine GABAergic interneuronal identity and circuit connectivity. We focus our analysis on an identified and molecularly characterized subclass of spinal GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that form direct axo-axonic contacts on sensory afferent terminals, thereby inhibiting them presynaptically. We will test the hypothesis that the transcription factor Ptf1a controls synaptic targeting and differentiation of a class of spinal GABAergic interneurons, and that a transcriptional target of Ptf1a, NrCAM, contributes with Contactin-5 and Caspr4 to an adhesive signaling complex that directs specific synaptic connectivity. We test our hypothesis with the following three aims: #1) Characterize distinct GABAergic interneuron subtypes based on the timing of Ptf1a expression in neuronal precursors; #2) Define the role of Ptf1a in directing connectivity of GABApre interneurons; and #3) Assess the role of the Ptf1a effector gene NrCAM and the potential NrCAM receptor complex Contactin-5/CASPR4 in specifying GABApre target selection. In the first aim, we use timed tamoxifen injections to label and characterize single Ptf1a-expressing interneurons. In the second aim, we use mouse genetics to assess whether Ptf1a is necessary and sufficient for the targeting and differentiation of GABApre synapses. In the third aim, we use mouse genetics to perturb cell adhesion signaling and we analyze the consequences of this both micro-anatomically and functionally, via a novel electrophysiological assay of presynaptic inhibition. Taken together, the proposed experiments will determine which aspects of spinal GABAergic interneuronal identity and connectivity are directed by Ptf1a, and will suggest a downstream molecular mechanism by which specific synaptic connectivity is conferred. Our proposed research is innovative both technically and conceptually. Technically, we will combine new mouse lines with novel in vivo molecular genetics and electrophysiological analyses to manipulate and functionally characterize spinal GABAergic circuits in an otherwise intact network in vivo. Conceptually, we will explore the necessity and sufficiency of an intrinsic transcription factor signal (Ptf1a) for determining specific GABAergic identity and connectivity. Our proposed work is significant in that we will demonstrate - for the first time - a transcriptionl mechanism mediating synaptic specificity of inhibitory central circuits in vivo, and a novel role for cell adhesion-based signaling in directing specific interneuronal connectivity. Our analysis will contribute to a basic scientific understanding of neuronal circuit formation and will provide  foundation for regenerative therapies aimed at rebuilding GABAergic circuitry disrupted by human disease."
"9545289","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicant exposures early in life adversely affect health outcomes in both animals and humans, in part due to epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. DNA methylation). Studies also indicate that exposures' impact on the epigenome can be tissue and even cell specific. Yet, epigenetic epidemiology analysis of toxicants is often limited to biologically available or surrogate (e.g. blood, saliva) samples, which serve as proxies for epigenetic status in tissues targeted by exposures. While methylation of peripheral DNA may not mirror that of all tissues, it has been used as a biomarker associated with both disease and exposures. Using bisphenol A and phthalates (e.g. DEHP) as representative toxicants, our overall objective is to utilize mouse models to evaluate tissue- and cell-specific epigenetic alterations associated with perinatal exposures and disease outcomes, including tissues not feasibly assessed in humans. We leverage resources by utilizing tissues funded as part of the Michigan NIEHS/EPA-funded Children's Environmental Health P01 Center in which epigenetic analysis in target tissues focuses on candidate metastable epialleles and imprinted genes, two sets of loci most vulnerable to environmental changes. Within TaRGET II U01, we will extend analysis genome- wide to 11 tissue and cell types to map DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC), and gene expression in an effort to inform epigenetic epidemiology studies with an environmental focus. We use sample sizes powered to detect sex differences and conduct methylome and transcriptome analyses immediately following perinatal exposure at post-natal day 22 in target tissues from the three germ layers (brain & breast from ectoderm, kidney from mesoderm, & liver from endoderm) and in surrogate tissues of human relevance (hair, peripheral blood leukocytes, & stool), as well as longitudinally at 8 months of age to identify exposure- dependent epigenetic changes that persist into adulthood. Capitalizing on our team's expertise in cell-specific epigenetics, we also include 4 purified cell populations to furthr compare target cells to surrogates. Ultimately, we seek to identify a subset of tissue-independent labile genes, which represent regions of the epigenome vulnerable early in life, and may be interrogated, with the use of surrogate tissues."
"9340295","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division (BSD) has a traditional culture of academic research with training and exposure focused predominantly on research career paths in the academy. Yet ten years post-graduation, less than one-quarter (~21%) of our trainees become faculty members in a research-intensive institution. When surveyed, 86% of our trainee respondents supported a more concerted effort to prepare them for jobs outside academia and over 90% of faculty respondents believed their mentees should be provided exposure to a range of career options that use their training. A few enterprising pre- and postdocs have begun to capitalize on expanding translational and education-training programming outside the BSD. Major collaborators in these programs include our Booth School of Business (regularly ranked #1 in the world), its Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship, and our Center for Technology Development & Ventures (UChicagoTech). The University's new Center for Teaching Excellence has also attracted growing participation. These efforts reflect a culture shifting significantly towards broader engagement with innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration, fueled by trainee demand and the reality of fewer faculty job opportunities. With solid support of the President, Provost, and Deans of the University, we propose a program, Chicago Options-In-Careers Empowerment (my- CHOICE), to systematically provide a BSD on-ramp to link to, legitimize, leverage, and help grow these pro- grams, expanding career exposure offerings to our pre- and postdoctoral trainees. We are partnering with UChicagoTech, Polsky and a vast network of internal and external individuals we call Mentors from career areas including biotech, entrepreneurship, medicine, science policy and law, science communication, teaching, and administration to develop and implement this program. We will greatly expand existing Postdoc and Bio- tech Association seminar series to provide broad career path EXPOSURE, create a range of mini-courses for more in-depth EDUCATION in career domains, and guide trainees to a growing set of opportunities for deeper EXPERIENCE in areas of focus. We will use existing infrastructure, and add no extension to training time. We will also hold a portion of the myCHOICE programming in a new facility, the Chicago Innovation Exchange, an accelerator/incubator/event space, to locate myCHOICE events alongside many exemplars of PhDs pursuing non-academic careers. We have developed an innovative evaluation plan to test the hypotheses that more extensive participation in myCHOICE predicts greater trainee career choice empowerment, satisfaction with chosen career, and improved correlation between the FASEB myIDPCareer Fit assessment and career selection. We seek also to quantify the change in academic cost (the salary/lifestyles trainees would sacrifice to be an academic) as they progress through myCHOICE. We will establish strong bidirectional dissemination mecha- nisms, within and outside the University, to share and learn from other BEST programs. Our proposal enjoys extremely strong institutional support and commitment to sustainability beyond the funding period."

"9304872","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the resubmission of a highly successful training grant funded for 30 years from the Department of Dermatology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (UCAMC). This program began as an Immunodermatology training vehicle, but has greatly changed in the past 15 years as the research focus in this Department has broadened. The remarkable expansion of the research program in the Department of Dermatology at UCAMC provides a perfect opportunity to restructure the scope and focus of this training grant, which has been unfunded since 2012. Dennis Roop, the new PI, will lead an impressive multidisciplinary team of trainers and mentors, 16 of 24 of the current training faculty are new. This team of trainers and mentors will provide a 2 year training program for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. The focus of this training grant will be similar to tha of our NIAMS-funded P30 UCAMC-SDRC entitled Molecular Analysis, Modeling and Correction of Skin Diseases. This SDRC emphasizes understanding the molecular basis of human autoimmune, inflammatory, developmental, metabolic and genetic skin diseases and development of genetically engineered mouse models which mimic these disorders at both the genetic and phenotypic levels. Further, preclinical models (including mouse models) will be utilized to assess the feasibility of stem cell approaches to therapy.  Historically, this has beena highly successful training grant, preparing clinical scientists for academic careers, stimulating extensive research collaborations between scientists in Dermatology and other departments, and supporting a highly productive research program in the Department of Dermatology. Of the 24 trainees who have completed a 2 year research fellowship between 1984 and 2006, 14 (58%) initially obtained academic appointments, two have continued research in other settings, and 8 have entered private practice. Six have current faculty positions at UCAMC. Of the 7 trainees since 2007, 6 are in other research positions after completing training. One of these is an assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology and has obtained K01 funding, as well as funding from 3 other local and national sources.  The overall objective of this program is to prepare trainees for a successful academic career in cutaneous biology research at academic institutions. Our program will primarily train postdoctoral fellows (PhD, MD and MD/PhD) to prepare them for successful transitions into independent research funding and eventually independent research careers.  This training grant will support 2 pre-doctoral and 4 postdoctoral training positions per year. Research training in preceptor's labs will be supplemented with a substantial program of enrichment including research seminars, research in progress, didactic lectures on relevant topics, and training in ethics. Recruitment of candidates for this program wil be managed by a well-organized administrative structure and will include a robust plan to attract underserved minorities."
"9326327","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results  across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research  program of this Center provides an innovative model for a systems approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs."
"9354522","PROJECT SUMMARY Trypanosoma brucei is a causative agent of both human and animal African trypanosomiasis, devastating diseases affecting sub-Saharan Africa. A dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat covers this extracellular parasite and effectively masks all other antigens on the cell surface. T. brucei evades elimination by the mammalian host's immune system through antigenic variation of its VSG coat: it ?switches? the expressed VSG, taking advantage of a genomic repertoire of ~2000 VSG-encoding genes. However, parasite populations in vivo express a diverse set of VSG-encoding genes. The number of expressed VSGs over 30 days of infection can approach one-third of the functional VSG repertoire within the parasite genome, which highlights an interesting question: if the existing genomic repertoire can be used up in a matter of months, how can an infection be sustained for years in the field? The goal of this application is to investigate the mechanisms by which T. brucei diversifies its genomic VSG repertoire in order to sustain infection. Preliminary data suggest that extravascular spaces may provide an important area for T. brucei to diversify its VSG archive in the absence of immune pressure. In the first aim of this proposal, the role of this extravascular niche in VSG diversification will be investigated. The second aim will take advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology combined with a novel high-throughput sequencing method to investigate the segmental gene conversion events resulting in novel ?mosaic? VSGs. In the third aim, the mutation of individual VSGs will be studied, in order to understand the mechanisms that govern the evolution of the VSG archive within the parasite genome over the course of infection. These studies will begin to elucidate the mechanisms by which T. brucei sustains a long- term infection in its host, which will be important for the development of new strategies for treatment of this neglected tropical disease. Three aims are proposed to accomplish these goals: 1) To elucidate the role of extravascular spaces in VSG diversification; 2) To identify the mechanisms responsible for the segmental gene conversion events that generate mosaic VSGs; 3) To quantify the rate of hypermutation of VSGs.  "
"9384094","PROJECT SUMMARY  The establishment of productive, stable surface interactions is an important process for bacteria, that can lead to formation of the adherent communities known as biofilms. These assemblages are challenges in agricultural, industrial and medical settings, and are intrinsically tolerant to many antimicrobial therapies. For a number of bacteria in the large and diverse Alphaproteobacteria (APB) group, attachment to surfaces and to other cells requires production of a structure comprised of polysaccharide localized to a single cellular pole. In the model pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens this structure is called the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). Polar adhesins similar to the UPP are widespread among the APB, including other pathogens and symbionts, and the A. tumefaciens UPP is therefore a representative model for these diverse bacteria. Among these, the stalked bacterium Caulobacter crescentus produces a similar structure called the holdfast at the stalk tip, and although it has been well studied, remains poorly understood and is less broadly representative than the UPP. These polar polysaccharides can drive stable surface attachment and host interactions. In A. tumefaciens the UPP is comprised of at least two distinct polysaccharide species, and the genes required for synthesis suggest that there may be overlapping biosynthesis pathways. We aim to determine how A. tumefaciens coordinates and regulates production of these polysaccharides during surface colonization, including dynamic localization of the biosynthetic complexes. Production of the A. tumefaciens UPP is strictly regulated by contact with the surface, and cells rarely if ever produce the UPP when free-swimming. The proposed studies will dramatically improve our current understanding of UPP properties and biosynthesis, and will elucidate its regulation via a network of intracellular signal cascades, its surface-dependent polar localization, and other environmental signals that affect its production, and thereby attachment. At the core of this control network is the ubiquitous bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate, which regulates UPP production. Among the primary UPP regulatory mechanisms are a novel signaling pathway involving small metabolites called pterins, and the response to low pH. The project utilizes an extensive collection of genetic mutants and variants, quantitative microscopic imaging approaches, genomic technology, and sophisticated biochemical approaches to illuminate the cellular processes that promote attachment via the UPP. The findings generated will contribute to the understanding of the motile to sessile transition and initiation of biofilm formation. We will characterize the biosynthesis of a novel biological adhesive(s) and a potential antimicrobial target, and will reveal how bacterial cells control production of these important products to promote surface interactions that lead to biofilm formation. Our findings will provide fundamental information about these polar adhesins, identifying new targets for anti-bacterial approaches and facilitating development of new biomaterials."
"9469101","Project Summary.  The cycloaddition between a small-ring donor-acceptor compound and a dipolarophile produces stereochemically rich heterocyclic and carbocyclic building blocks that are useful in the construction of bioactive small molecules. Improved access to these building blocks will facilitate the construction of a wide range of useful molecular scaffolds that could act as tool compounds to probe biological systems or as drug candidates to treat disease. Current methods for these cycloadditions employ either Lewis acid or transition metal catalysts to partially stabilize the zwitterionic transition state. This proposal aims to leverage a bifunctional catalyst system that will more effectively stabilize both charge components of the transition state, removing the requirement for strong anion and cation stabilizing groups on the substrate, thereby increasing the substrate scope of this transformation. Specifically, current methods stabilize only one of the two charged functional groups in the zwitterionic transition state of the donor-acceptor ring, relying on substrate functionality to stabilize the opposing charge. In contrast, employing a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD)/cation-? catalyst system will stabilize both charge components using optimized catalyst-substrate interactions. The anionic component will be stabilized through a hydrogen-bond interaction between an HBD donor on the catalyst and an enolate on the substrate, while the cationic component will be stabilized through a cation-? interaction between an aryl ring on the catalyst and the cation of the zwitterionic intermediate. The use of multiple noncovalent interactions with a chiral catalyst should produce a well-defined catalyst-substrate construct, allowing for effective differentiation of enantiotopic transition states leading to enantioenriched products.  Successful realization of this strategy will broaden the substrate scope of these reactions, increasing the chemical space accessible using this type of chemistry. Ideally, this method will become a universal tool for diverse carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks, simplifying disconnections for biologically relevant molecules. A variety of useful heterocycles and carbocycles can be generated from simple starting materials with the proposed catalyst system, including furans, pyrans, substituted cyclopentane rings, and amino acid derivatives. Many of these products are common structural motifs found in bioactive natural products such as polyketides, terpenes, and nonribosomal peptides, and this method would facilitate access to these useful molecules."

Our goal for all trainees in biomedical science is that they are not only highly skilled in their discipline, but flexible and well prepare to thrive in face an ever-changing biomedical workplace. The NIH BEST mechanism affords a valuable opportunity to formalize and improve our professional graduate/postdoctoral training programs, with benefits for all parties involved: graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, the university and science. It is imperative that those who that are trained are better prepared for the opportunities that are real in today's world. MSU BEST will integrate key components that are new to MSU [formal IDP, professional externships, Spheres of Success (SoS) workshops, team building, communication] and leverage existing resources and programs that support training in transferrable skills (Career Success; Wellness) and parallel mentoring]. The highly engaged BEST scholar will participate in these key components. We propose a comparison of outcomes between highly engaged BEST Scholars (test group) and trainees not engaged in BEST (control group) to determine if our input has causes discernable changes. We propose use of strong interventions such that outcomes are measurable and comparable, and our measures include both summative and formative outcomes. Our ultimate goal is that the practices employed by the MSU BEST program become accepted and integrated into all biomedical training programs such that training for and consideration of non-academic careers becomes natural, seamless and accepted."
"9450719","ABSTRACT Adolescence is a period of marked cognitive development, reflected by improvements in the ability the effectively and consistently engage brain networks associated with cognitive control. However, while a wealth of behavioral and functional imaging studies have provided detailed insight into mean patterns of adolescent development, methodological challenges have limited our understanding of individual age-dependent trajectories. This has impeded the characterization of a template of ?typical? development, undermining our ability to link atypical development to the emergence of psychopathology. This difficulty arises due to cross-sectional and longitudinal studies with few follow-up assessments that track subjects over only a small window of their development, and is exacerbated by evolving technologies and research protocols that limit the ability to track true developmental change. Finally, the specificity of cognitive tasks used has led to disparate results, limiting our ability to understand development of cognitive control as a construct. We propose a novel analysis of an existing 10-year longitudinal data set that includes yearly task fMRI collected on a scanner with no hardware and minimal software upgrades, and behavioral assessments using a broad battery of cognitive tasks. The parent grant has produced a growing literature charting changes in task-related cognitive brain function and behavior, and related changes in white matter integrity. However, this study began prior to the establishment of resting state fMRI for characterizing functional brain networks, and thus this was not an aim, nor were continuous periods of rest included. Nevertheless, the study used a block design paradigm that allows for the assessment of resting state connectivity within ?off? periods, as previously described in the literature, which we demonstrate offers a viable means for assessing functional brain networks in developmental populations. In addition, an extensive cognitive assessment was gathered, and specific aspects of cognitive control (e.g., working memory, inhibitory control) have been extensively analyzed. However, recent approaches allow core mechanisms shared across cognitive tasks to be estimated as a ?domain-general cognitive control? component that can better characterize development of the overarching processes of cognitive control. We propose to mine this longitudinal data in an innovative manner not envisioned in the parent grant to characterize individual developmental trajectories of functional connectivity and their associations to a domain general component of cognitive control. We will identify connectivity patterns showing developmental change through adolescence associated with increases in domain-general measures of cognitive control. Finally, we will characterize individual age- dependent trajectories for both connectivity and behavior to identify variation in patterns of maturation, their early-adolescent predictors, and their relationship to adult outcomes. These results will inform the range of changes in adolescent brain architecture and how these are related to cognitive control normatively, which is critical for setting a template from which to understand aberrant maturation such as in psychopathology."
"9360236","PROJECT SUMMARY (Protein Production Core) The Protein Production Core (PPC) serves as research support for the Oklahoma COBRE in Structural Biology (OCSB). It is a state-of the art facility for the expression and purification of protein for OCSB-supported researchers and the wider structural biology community. The PPC produces high quality proteins in a reliable and efficient manner on a fee-for-service basis and provides hands-on-training and expert advice in all aspects of protein expression and purification available in the facility. The PPC staff consists of a Director, Dr. Philip Bourne and a Graduate Student training position. The graduate student typically assists in the PPC for a semester. They are trained by the PPC director to use all of the equipment in the facility and assist in the day- to-day activities of the PPC. The PPC is guided by an advisory committee comprised of one junior and two senior faculty researchers. The PPC facility was established using OCSB Phase I funding. Milestones achieved during this period included: (i) renovation of laboratory space to create a stand-alone secure core facility, (ii) establishing the facility with modern instrumentation for protein expression and purification, and (iii) development of a user base. The user base has grown to twenty two research groups, including over 65 individual PPC users. Progress has been demonstrated by evidence of increased productivity of the user base i.e., publications and grant support. The PPC works closely with the investigators and the OCSB-supported Macromolecular Crystallography Laboratory (MCL) to produce homogeneous, highly purified protein for crystallization trials. The PPC is equipped with instrumentation and expertise frequently not found within individual research laboratories. Equipment housed in the PPC includes two refrigerated medium pressure chromatography systems and a large selection of columns for different purification techniques (affinity, hydrophobic, ion-exchange, and size exclusion). Other core equipment includes: an Emulsiflex-C3 homogenizer for lysis of yeast and bacterial cells; a high performance Avanti centrifuge, two freezers (-80 °C and -20 °C), and a BioRad ChemiDoc imager that detects UV, white and chemiluminescence. During the proposed Phase II of the OCSB, planned expansion of the PPC includes the addition of a low pressure chromatography system to ease the burden on the two medium pressure systems and expand the protein purification throughput of the facility. The addition of a small self-contained Dynamic Light Scattering instrument will allow for assessing the quality of samples prior to crystallization trials. This addition is ideal for a multi-user facility where a quick assessment of sample quality prior to crystallization experiments would be extremely useful. The increased protein production capacity and the expanded biophysical characterization will meet the existing demand and will help expand the user base. The larger user base will lead to more income from user fees and this will move the facility closer to self-sufficiency."
"9350415","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about the specific neural pathway(s) responsible for therapeutic benefit. Direct stimulation of either the hyperdirect pathway and/or the subthalamopallidal pathway represents two of the most likely candidates as the target. Therefore, the goal of this project is to combine patient-specific 7T imaging and neurostimulation models together to enable probabilistic identification of the stimulation pathways linked to changes in clinical outcome measures recorded from subthalamic DBS patients. This study will rely on tractography-activation models (TAMs) to guide clinical testing on a cohort of 30 subthalamic DBS patients. Our multi-disciplinary approach will integrate the latest advances in neuroimaging, neurostimulation modeling, and quantitative clinical outcome measures to customize DBS to these patients. The first aim will acquire high- resolution 7T MRI data prior to their implant surgery. These images will provide unparalleled anatomical characterization of each patient. The second aim will create patient-specific TAMs for each subject. These models will enable us to define theoretically optimal settings for focused activation of either the hyperdirect pathway or the subthalamopallidal pathway. The third aim will quantify the clinical outcomes achieved with stimulation parameters defined by either the TAM or traditional clinical practice. These clinical results will be coupled with the TAM predictions to create a probabilistic tractography-activation atlas (PTAA) for the subthalamic region. The results of this study will help identify optimal implantation locations for DBS electrodes, and enable theoretical prediction of stimulation parameter settings that focus activation on the targeted pathways and/or avoid side-effect pathways."
"9252298","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to genetically modify specific neural subsets is essential in elucidating their contributions to brain computation and disease. Recently, we developed a novel strategy for targeting transgene expression to neuronal subtypes by exploiting endogenous microRNA (miRNA) regulation, which we call miRNA-guided neuron tags (mAGNETs). miRNAs are small (~20 nt), non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression by hybridizing to complementary recognition sites within mRNA transcripts. Because different miRNAs are upregulated in specific cell types, we are able to target gene expression by including signature miRNA recognition sites at the end of mAGNET transcripts. Exploiting miRNA regulation to target gene expression is an attractive technique for brain research due to the small footprint of miRNA sites (which facilitates viral packaging), the potential to engineer combinations of miRNA sites to tune selectivity, and the possibility to target and classify novel neuron subtypes based upon physiological function. As a proof of principle demonstration, we designed mAGNETs to target EGFP expression to cortical inhibitory (GABA) neurons in the mouse brain, and achieved up to 91% targeting specificity. The goal of this proposal is to overcome some of the viral gene targeting challenges in basic neuroscience research and human gene therapy by further developing and testing the application of this promising, novel neurotechnology platform. First, I aim to build upon our previous work and develop a mAGNET to selectively target transgene expression to an even more specific subset of inhibitory neurons, parvalbumin (PV+) cells. Second, because miRNAs are inhibitory, our gene targeting designs have relied upon recognition sites for signature miRNAs strongly upregulated in off-target cells, therefore to improve the ease of mAGNET design and use, I aim to test a repressor system that would allow mAGNETs to employ signature miRNAs positively correlated to target cell populations. Finally, I aim to demonstrate how mAGNETs can be used to classify novel neural subsets by applying simple mAGNETs to characterize a potential subset of functionally distinct CamKII neurons relevant for Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.This work could provide a new method of gene delivery for neuroscience research and human gene therapy."

"9384200","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers."
"9322373","Glomerulonephritis (GN) caused by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) is the most common form of aggressive glomerulonephritis, especially in adults. Earlier cycles of this P01 titled ?ANCA Glomerulonephritis: from Molecules to Man? have produced compelling evidence that ANCA GN is caused by ANCA, and have provided an understanding of pathogenic mechanisms that have influenced diagnosis, prognostication and treatment of ANCA GN. One of the most impactful accomplishments has been the development and effective use of the first animal model of ANCA GN, which is induced in mice by ANCA with specificity for mouse myeloperoxidase (MPO). The current proposed project titled ?Modulation of both the adaptive and innate immune responses influence the risk, severity and clinicopathologic phenotype of ANCA glomerulonephritis? will use this animal model to build on this strong foundation of knowledge.  Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that not all ANCA are equally pathogenic because of differences in epitope specificity as well as differences in the structure and function of Fc regions and Fc receptors. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that genetically determined and acquired modulation of innate immunity determines the severity and clinicopathologic phenotype of ANCA GN. These aims will include studies of the pathogenic importance of IgG epitope specificity and Fc glycosylation, the role of complement regulation and kinins, and modulation of disease actiity by leukocyte gene expression. In additon to elucidating basic autoimmune pathogenic mechanisms, the knowledge gained from these aims is likely to identify biomarkers that could provide more accurate and sensitive diagnosis, more useful monitoring of disease activity and response to therapy, and possible novel targets for more effective treament.  In some patients, ANCA GN is accompanied by a destructive extravascular inflammatory process called granulomatosis. Specific Aim 3 tests the innovative hypothesis that ANCA IgG-induced neutrophil and monocyte activation (in the absence of antigen-specific T cells) mediates the necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of ANCA GN. To our knowledge, our animal model of ANCA granulomatosis will be the first ever reported, and will provide new understanding of the pathogenesis of ANCA granulomatosis that could facilitate design of effective preventive or treatment strategies for this destructive process that complicates the care of patients with ANCA GN."
"9356814","Abstract ? Core A The Program Management and Biostatistics Core is designed to function as a drug development Project Team decision-making body. Thus, it will oversee all aspects of the drug development paradigm. This activity will involve two integrated and overlapping functions: (1) Oversight/Assessment of new directions of the scientific topics that form the basis of the tPPG target/drug development paradigm; and (2) Oversight of the drug development process. The oversight of scientific paradigms will focus on delineation of the ideal profile for mucolytics, need for mucus hydrating agents for co-formulation with mucolytics, selection of mucolytic clinical candidates, and identification and validation of biomarkers for use throughout the tPPG development program. Oversight of the drug development process will include oversight of the composition of the DSMB and DSMB Charter, flow of data to the DSMB, and the role of DSMB in clinical development decision making. Core A will also provide biostatistical assistance to the pre-clinical projects and extensive services for the clinical projects in the context of the creation of REDCap databases for clinical data collection, oversight of clinical database management , and creation of tables and listings for analyses of all studies. Note, an external biostatistician will be named by Core A for overall final review of safety and efficacy data. The external statistician will also be part of the External Advisory Board. Finally, Core A will provide administrative functions to the tPPG, including budgetary and programmatic support, oversight of human subjects, protocols, and oversight of conflict of interest reviews. These activities should provide for an effective Project Management in Biostatistics Core support function for the tPPG."
"9554179","ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify ?cariogenic profiles,? in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6."
"9408716","Project Summary Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) pose significant harm to neonates. HAIs are associated with increased risk of death and longer hospital stays for the infant as well as poor neurological developmental and physical growth in the early childhood years. According to a 2011 CDC report, there were an estimated 722,000 HAIs in U.S acute care hospitals, resulting in 75,000 deaths and up to $20 billion in healthcare costs, yearly. In hospitals and other clinical environments, transfer of pathogens on the hands of healthcare workers is considered an important mechanism for passing pathogenic organisms to unsuspecting patients. The importance of good hand hygiene in clinical environments is well established and handwashing or the use of alcohol-containing rubs are methods that generally work, but each has significant limitations including: the amount of time required is prohibitive; alcohol rubs do not have activity against Clostridium difficile spores or non-enveloped viruses like norovirus; current hand hygiene methods are subject to significant variability. The primary objective of this project is to generate the efficacy and safety data needed to apply hypochlorous acid solutions in a novel automated hand sanitization system that will be fast (3-5s), will leave hands dry, and will be located near the patient, especially infants, to significantly improve the frequency and quality of hand hygiene procedures. Previously LivOnyx demonstrated feasibility of the thinSpray fluid dispensing system using a minute volume of various antiseptic spray to quickly inactivate clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens, such as susceptible Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to vancomycin resistant E. faecium, ampicillin resistant E. coli, multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin resistant S. aureus. LivOnyx proposes to investigate the following specific aims to expand on previous work. Specific Aim 1 Quantification of hypochlorous acid antiseptic efficacy against clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens. This phase of the project uses a large volume assay to determine minimum antiseptic concentrations and contact times required to achieve defined reductions of bacteria deposited onto porous surfaces. Specific Aim 2: Evaluation of a cultured human skin model for irritation and toxicity following exposure to aqueous hypochlorous acid solutions. This phase of the project is based on use of the MatTek Epiderm? product to predict key aspects of the response of human skin to hypochlorous acid solutions. Initial assessments of aqueous hypochlorous acid solutions will be conducted according to MatTek's In Vitro EpiDerm? Skin Irritation Test protocol.Specific Aim 3: Development of an engineering test-bed that can spray a minute thickness film of hypochlorous acid, uniformly across mock hand features to enable quantification of the reduction of bacteria on 3-d surfaces. Although we have seen promising results using our current test-bed to spray antiseptic reagent on small flat surfaces, an eventual hand-sanitizing product must achieve efficacy on significantly larger 3-d surfaces with curvature. The successful completion of this proposal will position the company to continue development of innovative, better hand hygiene products for the neonatal and broader hospital markets."
"9431644","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  This is a K23 application for Dr. Vanessa H. Bal, an Assistant Professor in Psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco. Dr. Bal is establishing herself as a clinician-scientist who conducts interdisciplinary, patient-oriented research aimed at advancing understanding of the biological bases of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms. This K23 will provide Dr. Bal with essential support to accomplish the following goals: 1) develop expertise in the theoretical basis of affective science; 2) gain methodological proficiency (collection and analysis of psychophysiological and facial behavior data) to conduct future emotion studies in children with ASD across the range of ability (e.g., minimally verbal); 3) gain familiarity with the neural systems mediating emotion processes; 4) obtain the knowledge necessary to use laboratory-based findings to understand mechanisms underlying clinical measures of socioemotional impairments; 5) learn to translate clinical phenotypes to animal model and treatment development studies; 6) acquire knowledge needed to conduct longitudinal research with neurodevelopmental populations; and 7) develop an independent interdisciplinary research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Bal has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team including a primary mentor: Dr. Howard Rosen (a neurologist with expertise in psychophysiology and the organization of emotional systems in the brain); four co-mentors: Drs. Virginia Sturm (a neuropsychologist with expertise in laboratory assessment of emotion and social behavior in patients), Stephen Hinshaw (a psychologist with expertise in developmental psychopathology and longitudinal studies of neurodevelopmental disorders), and Matthew State (a psychiatrist and geneticist with expertise in interdisciplinary ASD research); and a statistical advisor, Dr. Kevin Delucchi (a biostatistician with expertise in psychiatric research).  The proposed project explores the relationship between emotional processes (reactivity and regulation) and socioemotional dysfunction in ASD. Dr. Bal will use laboratory-based paradigms to measure physiological (cardiac, respiratory, electrodermal) and behavioral (facial muscles) emotional reactivity and regulation in child- ren with ASD and typically development (Aims 1 & 2). She will then integrate laboratory findings with clinical measures of socioemotional functioning and ASD symptoms to determine the real-world impact of emotional impairments (Aim 3). The goal of Dr. Bal's research is to identify mechanisms underlying socioemotional impairments that can be used to delineate associations between genetic risk factors and clinical outcomes. This project is innovative because it explores the potential role of emotion processing in ASD symptoms, using well-established, translational methods from affective science that have clarified mechanisms underlying clinical impairments in other patient groups. Results will significantly contribute to our understanding of the biological basis of ASD symptoms. Dr. Bal's K23 training will prepare her to conduct cutting-edge studies of aberrant socioemotional development across the lifespan that will inform clinical and basic ASD research."

"9353485","The broad goal of this proposal is to strengthen the capacity for injury control research in academic institutions in Ghana and West Africa, building a cadre of qualified researchers, with growing collaborations among West African countries. The project will increase capacity to generate evidence that will be translated into effective activities and implementable policy across the spectrum of injury control. The specific aims are:  1. Develop and implement high-quality short, intermediate, and long-term training opportunities in injury  control within Ghana and West Africa, to train future academic leaders in the field. We will provide 7 MPH  and 3 PhD degrees and will conduct 15 short (1-2 day) courses that reach over 500 participants.  2. Engage junior researchers in innovative, mentored research to generate evidence to strengthen the  policy and practice of injury control in Ghana and in West Africa and low- and middle-income countries  more generally.  3. Increase the capacity for injury control research at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and  Technology (KNUST), and in other academic institutions, government agencies, and non-government  organizations in Ghana and West Africa. The number of KNUST departments that have at least one  faculty member with MPH/PhD training with a focus on injury, with related publications, who are involved  with international injury research networks, and who head experienced, accomplished research teams will  increase from 3 currently to 6. The number of such departments at University of Cape Coast and  University of Development Studies will increase from 0 departments currently to 2 each. Training and research activities will address the multi-disciplinary spectrum of injury control (surveillance, prevention, prehospital and hospital trauma care). This program builds on a 20 year collaboration for injury research among KNUST, other institutions in Ghana, and the University of Washington. The past 10 years have been under the auspices of the Fogarty TRAUMA program. KNUST?s capacity for injury research has now grown to the point where further growth of the program at KNUST, as well as expansion to other Ghanaian and West African institutions, would be best served by having KNUST be the primary recipient of the next 5 year cycle. This would create greater equity, sustainability, efficiency, and the best return on investment. At the end of the project period, this program will have strengthened collaborations throughout the region. Scholars will have competed successfully for research funding, contributed to a growing base of policy-relevant research, and taken up faculty positions at academic institutions throughout Ghana and West Africa."
"9277824","Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive sense strand RNA virus within the Flaviviridae family of viruses that is currently on the brink of a global epidemic. ZIKV infection has been highly associated with the induction of neurological disorders, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Yet, very little is known about the ZIKV-host interactions that regulate the outcome of infection. Recently, we demonstrated that infection of HIV is regulated by the dynamic, post-transcriptional RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A). Importantly, m6A is a potent regulator of RNA function in humans and viruses. This project aims to determine how m6A affects the replication of ZIKV, both at the level of the viral RNA genome and at the level of the host mRNA. Our central hypothesis is that m6A acts directly on the ZIKV RNA genome and on a specific set of mRNAs to regulate ZIKV replication. The rationale for the proposed research is that by understanding how m6A regulates ZIKV replication, we can manipulate and target m6A-targeted processes to design new approaches for the prevention and treatment of ZIKV infection. Guided by our preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing these two specific aims: 1) Identify the sites of m6A within the ZIKV RNA genome at single nucleotide resolution, and 2) define the ZIKV infection-induced m6A profile on host mRNAs in the context of other Flaviviruses. In the first aim, we will define the life-cycle kinetics and sites of adenosine methylation on the ZIKV RNA genome at single nucleotide resolution by using m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation and direct RNA sequencing. For the second aim, we will perform a comparative analysis of virally-induced m6A changes in the host transcriptome following infection by Flaviviridae viruses, including ZIKV, hepatitis C, yellow fever, and dengue virus. This aim will define the conserved and unique host transcriptome and epitranscriptome responses to each viral infection. Taken together, these experiments will identify targets that define how m6A regulates ZIKV infection and disease, which represents a completely unknown molecular feature of this newly emerging virus. Ultimately, a detailed understanding of ZIKV biology, including how m6A affects ZIKV infection, will uncover novel strategies to develop antiviral therapies to target this RNA regulatory control that is exploited by RNA viruses for their replication."
"9464262","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of well- defined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures t inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. B- SNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis Biotypes based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend B- SNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a 'Psychosis Biomarker Database' (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboratin with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different taxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologically- derived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."
"9440302","Liberia, a resource rich but economically poor country, continues to struggle with growth and recovery following its 14-year civil war that destroyed its infrastructure. During the recent Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic, Liberia had fewer than 100 physicians and needed help from the international community for its control. The assistance Liberia received largely improved physical resources (e.g., laboratory equipment and containment facilities), but did not significantly increase human resources. Today, the healthcare workforce has only ~25% of the nurses, midwives, and pharmacists, and 9% of the physicians the country needs. For Liberia to develop sustainable research capacity for early identification and control of emerging viral diseases with the potential for regional and global pandemics, Liberia needs a mechanism to garner students? interest, and a continuous supply of university-educated students graduating with current knowledge on viruses, epidemiology and how to conduct research. The University of Liberia (UL) is the largest government supported institution in Liberia, and its College of Science and Technology awards Bachelor of Science degrees to students who wish to enter the health professions. Also, UL?s College of Medicine and Tubman Institute of Medicinal Arts train physicians and nurses, respectively. In 2015, UL conducted a needs assessment and developed a strategic academic plan. In response to this plan, faculty in the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, University of Hawai?i (UH), and the University of Yaoundé 1 (UY) propose to partner with faculty at UL to establish a creative training program with the goal of garnering interest and improving teaching and student learning experience in biomedical sciences at UL, and providing training in the conduct of research on emerging viral epidemics. The planning process has 12 steps: 1) devise a career development plan for faculty; 2) determine how to strengthen the curriculum in virology, emerging epidemic diseases, and research; 3) assess feasibility of long-distance learning between UL and UH; 4) evaluate the possibility of introducing a laboratory-based course entitled ?Research on Emerging Epidemic Viruses,? into the curriculum; 5) identify opportunities for students to participate in in-country mentored research projects; 6) investigate other activities for inclusion in a training grant; 7) explore training of Liberian students in Hawai?i; 8) establish south-south academic and research collaboration; 9) identify a method for selecting students for training; 10) assess needs for specific skilled personnel in the Liberian healthcare workforce; 11) identify individuals with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to serve on a Training Advisory Group; and 12) write a D43 application. The ten-person planning committee consists of UL, UH and UY faculty who are teacher-scholars, and their D71 planning efforts are supported by a larger group of faculty with experience in virology, epidemiology and global health research. Strengthening the research capacity at the UL is the only way to guarantee a sustainable cadre of health professionals with research expertise to identify and control future emerging viral epidemics in Liberia."

We proposed three aims to address the specific needs enumericated in the RFA-DK-15-004. Urinary stone disease (USD) is major health issue causing pain and suffering to both adults and children. It is also one of the most prevalent and the most expensive urologic conditions to treat. Nearly 50% of patients experience at least one recurrence over 5 years? time. Although increasing fluid intake is generally recommended for stone formers, a Cochrane review found only one study for secondary prevention (to reduce recurrence). Patients? adherence to fluid protocol is generally poor. Ureteral stenting after stone surgeries caused significant pain and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Studies are urgently needed to identify risk factors that predict the severity and persistence of stent-related pain and LUTS, and to mitigate the suffering. There is also a lack of national biorepository devoted to urinary stone translational research. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of adult and pediatric urologists, nephrologists, pain researcher, clinical trial specialist, behavioral scientist, radiologists, and emergency department researchers to address the critical research needs of urinary stone disease. We propose the following three specific aims: Aim 1: To perform a multi-center, prospective randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial to study the impact of increased fluid intake on stone recurrence using individualized water prescriptions AIM 2: To identify risk factors that predict the severity of stent-related pain and lower urinary symptoms with the stent in situ, and the persistence of pain and symptoms after stent removal AIM 3: Establish a biorepository for future translational research studies of urinary stone disease Collectively these projects are responsive to RFA DK-15-004 as they address defined scientific priorities.

"9361837","Project Summary Large-scale national and international cancer sequencing programs are generating a compendium of tumor- associated genomic alterations to prioritize the most promising therapeutic targets for drug development. These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic ?driver? mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize ?persistor? populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers. The foundational platform implemented in our CTD2 Center will provide a validated pipeline for the rapid characterization of gain-of-function aberrations that can be industrialized across tumor lineages to guide clinical management of cancer patients."
"9542455","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anorexia nervosa (AN), a psychiatric disorder characterized by extreme weight dysregulation commonly presents with comorbid anxiety. Therapeutic renourishment in AN is based primarily on clinical opinion and guidelines, with a weak evidence base. Compelling data implicate the intestinal microbiota in the regulation of adiposity and behavior, providing a strong rationale for exploring the role of this complex microbial community in the emergence and maintenance of, and recovery from AN. Our overarching goal is to understand the precise mechanism(s) by which intestinal bacteria contribute to dysregulation of adiposity, BMI, anxiety, and stress in patients with AN. We hypothesize that intestinal microbiotas that arise from prolonged starvation contribute to increases in adiposity upon refeeding and to persistently elevated anxiety and stress in individuals with AN. To test our hypothesis we propose 3 specific aims. In aim 1, we will identify the enteric bacterial groups associated with adiposity, BMI, anxiety, and stress in AN patients. We will characterize the intestinal microbiota in acutely low weight AN patients (T1), in the same patients following weight restoration (T2), and in healthy controls (HC) via high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We will compare the abundances of specific enteric taxa with adiposity, BMI and behavior (anxiety and stress) in this study population. In aim 2, we will characterize the functional impact of the intestinal microbiota of AN patients on adiposity and BMI when transplanted into germ free (GF) mice. We will transplant uncultured microbiotas from AN patients (at T1 and T2) and HC into GF mice and assess the impact of enteric microbes on adiposity. In aim 3, we will characterize the functional impact of the intestinal microbiota of AN patients on anxiety and stress, and molecular biomarkers of these behaviors, when transplanted into GF mice. We will transplant uncultured microbiotas from T1 AN patients and HC into GF mice and assess the impact of enteric microbes on anxiety and stress. GF mice gavaged with sterile phosphate buffer saline will be used as controls in aims 2 and 3. The proposed science is significant in pioneering the combination of large scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based studies of intestinal microbiotas in AN with exploration of their functional influence on adiposity and behavioral traits associated with AN. Our results will provide direction on how best to test adjunct interventions for AN with pre-, pro-, anti-, or syn-biotics to enhance current approaches to therapeutic weight restoration and improve treatment outcome. The science is highly innovative as it will investigate an entirely novel factor in AN, the intestinal microbiota, and us a novel approach to identify enteric microbes that impact adiposity and behavior in this devastating illness. Additionally, we will investigate an entirely novel factor (namely, the intestinal microbiota) as a contributor to the underlying pathophysiology of AN."
"9322578","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) and the Chronic Care Model (CCM) are complementary clinical intervention frameworks that are commonly invoked to support better type 2 diabetes (T2DM) outcomes in primary care. Self-management Support (SMS) is a core component of both the PCMH and CCM, and focuses on the central role of patients in managing their illness by engaging with and adopting healthy behaviors that promote optimal clinical outcomes. Despite its recognized importance, SMS programs for diabetes continue to demonstrate limited effectiveness in the real-world of primary care. SMS is comprised of two complementary and interactive components: (1) patient engagement (e.g., the process of eliciting and responding to patients emotions and motivations related to health behaviors), and (2) behavioral change tools (e.g., selecting specific goals, creating action plans). While several sophisticated SMS programs have been developed for T2DM, the vast majority are designed with a narrow focus on behavioral change tools, largely ignoring unique aspects of the patient context that drive and maintain health behavior. Considerable clinical research suggests that the addition of a structured, evidenced-based program of patient engagement can maximize the effectiveness of SMS programs for patients with T2DM in primary care. To date, however, there has been no systematic study of the degree to which fully integrating enhanced patient engagement as part of SMS will increase the initiation and maintenance of behavior change over time, and for which kinds of patients enhanced patient engagement is essential. To address this gap, we propose to compare a state-of-the-art, evidence-based SMS behavior change tool program, called Connection to Health (CTH), with an enhanced CTH program that includes a practical, time-efficient patient engagement protocol, to create a program with an integrated and comprehensive approach to SMS, which we call Enhanced Engagement CTH (EE-CTH). The current study will directly test the added benefit of EE-CTH to CTH with regard to self-management behaviors and glycemic control in resource-limited community health centers, where vast numbers of patients with T2DM from ethnically diverse and medically vulnerable populations receive their care. We will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, employing the RE-AIM framework to test these two SMS programs for T2DM. This will provide critical information that will support dissemination and implementation of effective SMS programs in resource-limited primary care settings, serving diverse and medically vulnerable populations with much to gain from improved SMS."
"9324035","ABSTRACT Development of the central nervous system requires orchestrated interactions among several regulatory elements that determine the fate, properties, and functions of cells at any given time, ultimately leading to complex neural networks that control our most basic behaviors and complex cognitive processes. As an intermediate regulatory domain between DNA sequences and gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms can exert considerable influence on brain development on a scale that we are only beginning to appreciate. One major advance in the field of epigenetics in recent years is the discovery of novel modifications of genomic DNA, such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and molecular pathways to install, remove, and interpret these modifications, which are highly enriched in the nervous system and are dynamically regulated by neuronal activity under physiological and pathological conditions. The overarching goal of this P01 is to take a systematic approach to understand how global and specific changes in the epigenome and transcriptome regulate stem cell behavior, neuronal development and neuronal integration using hippocampal neurogenesis as a model system.  Hippocampal neurogenesis is a constitutive phenomenon in the adult mammalian brain and is a well- established model for neural development that is comprised of defined stages, which originate with neural stem cell activation and result in the maturation and integration of a single neuronal subtype in an anatomically restricted region of the brain. This phenomenon also represents striking structural plasticity and has been shown to contribute to critical brain functions, whereas its dysregulation has been implicated in various neurological and degenerative disorders. Characterization of neurogenic processes in hippocampus may eventually inform cell transplantation-based therapeutic strategies to repair the central nervous system after stroke, injury or neurological disorders.  Integrating results from adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents with human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models will allow for the identification of fundamental epigenetic principles governing neural development at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. Our team includes experts in epigenetics, hippocampal neurogenesis, rodent stem cell biology, human iPSCs, chemical biology, high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, electrophysiology and transplantation. Successful completion of the research projects will guide future investigations into the role of dysregulated DNA modifications in neurodevelopmental disorders and facilitate the development of new technological approaches to identify epigenetic marks with high resolution."
"9334201","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies in both community-based and high-risk populations show that chronic kidney disease (CKD) (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/m2 or albuminuria) confers at least a two-fold increase in cardiovascular risk. Approximately 10% of the $200 billion 2008 United States Medicare budget was devoted to managing patients with concomitant CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite this enormous public health impact, we still know relatively little about the predictors and mediators of the association between CKD and CVD. Clinicians lack a viable cardiovascular risk prediction model for patients with CKD, and there are few effective cardiovascular therapies for this high-risk population. While traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes in these patients, non-traditional risk factors involved in inflammation and deranged bone/mineral metabolism are also thought to play an important role. However, these risk factors do not fully explain the excess risk of CVD among CKD patients, nor, when incorporated into risk prediction models, acceptably predict CVD risk in this population. Furthermore, many of these risk factors are not pharmacologically modifiable (e.g. age, sex, race). In this application, our overall goal is to accelerate the search for novel protei biomarkers of CVD in CKD. We hope to facilitate more accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and discover potentially modifiable protein mediators of CVD in CKD that may become targets for novel pharmacologic therapies. We will leverage large-scale proteomics with modified aptamers (SOMAscan, SomaLogic, Boulder CO), a transformative method in the field of proteomics, that allows for rapid quantification of over 1100 plasma proteins in a small blood sample, making proteomics feasible in large cohort studies. We will carry out our investigation in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC), a multi-center cohort of 3939 racially and ethnically diverse individuals between the ages of 21 to 74 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 20 and 70 ml/min/1.73m2. Proteomic analyses will be carried out in 2571 CRIC participants without baseline CVD who will have 11 years of adjudicated atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, heart failure and cardiovascular mortality at the time of the proposed analyses. We will assay concentrations of 1130 plasma proteins in order to complete the following Specific Aims: 1a) to discover > 100 novel protein biomarkers associated with incident CVD and cardiovascular mortality in the CRIC cohort; 1b) to elucidate causal pathways of cardiovascular disease in CKD by applying pathway analysis to discovered proteins under 1a); 2) to devise a parsimonious cardiovascular risk prediction model utilizing proteins that are associated with cardiovascular risk; and 3) to compare the proteomic cardiovascular risk model to traditional, Framingham factor-based clinical risk models in the CRIC cohort."
"9348445","Quantitative characterization of tissue structure and function is one of the most challenging problems in Medical Imaging. Optical methods can potentially provide a single platform for imaging biological tissues with resolution and depth sensitivity from microns to centimeters, limited by fundamental light-tissue interactions. Under NIAMS Phase II SBIR funding, we have built a platform wide-field optical imaging system capable of measuring circulatory compromise in tissue. Our underlying technology is based on Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) non-contact multi-spectral imaging method to measure tissue oxygenation, edema, and scattering. After a series of pilot studies, we believe that our device is well- suited for wound applications. As an example, 25% of the 29M diabetic population forms a preventable lower limb ulcer in their lifetime and resulting in $13 billion in annual expenditures. Under the new Commercial Readiness Program (CRP), we propose necessary technical preparation to advance our technology from a device that measures circulatory compromise to a device that provides actionable information for wound applications - a critical step for adoption in medical practice. To achieve these goals, we propose regulatory strategy work and preparation to support 510(k) applications in wound care. We also propose design transfer work to migrate production to contract manufacturing. Third, we will work with consultants to navigate the reimbursement landscape for insertion into the health care system. Finally, we will use all this to support and plan for independent clinical studies that achieve our regulatory and reimbursement goals. At the conclusion of the CRP, we anticipate that our company will be ideal candidate for external investment due to our work in reducing risk. We anticipate raising external funds to ramp up sales/marketing for entry into the wound market and full commercialization of our technology in health care."
"9357408","Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently been declared a new global threat and an emerging pathogen in the USA. Common features of ZIKV infection include little to no symptoms for the majority of infected adults, but debilitating neurological symptoms such as Guillain-Barré syndrome for a few infected patients. While cause-and-effect has not been proven, there is a startling and troubling correlation between ZIKV infection in pregnant mothers and microcephaly in their newborn infants. There is currently no pharmacological protection for humans against mosquito-borne flaviviral diseases. The major goal of this proposal is to develop the mechanistic understanding of the ZIKV pathology in the fetus brain. This understanding can ultimately be developed into drugs to treat ZIKV disease. It becomes now obvious that there is complex, well-balanced mutualism between the human cells and the virus, which reciprocally affect each other through multiple, albeit insufficiently understood, molecular, cellular and biochemical mechanisms. It is exceedingly difficult, if ever possible, to understand these mechanisms by using the irrelevant cell types. In contrast with many others, our study is focused on neural precursors, the cell type infected by ZIKV in the fetus brain. A major strength of our application lies in the highly relevant expertise of our team of biochemists, bioinformaticians, neurobiologists, and virologists from the laboratories of Drs. Terskikh, Cieplak and Strongin (SBP Discovery), together with Dr. Shresta (LJI). There are two overarching hypotheses that direct our research: (1) the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) cleaves and inactivates Sox2, the key neural precursor transcription factor, and (2) ZIKV exploits multiple cellular genes to support its propagation in neural precursors. These events, especially when combined, cause neural stem/precursor cell apoptosis and reduce neurogenic capacity of surviving cells, ultimately leading to microcephaly in the fetus brain. Our interconnected and sharply focused Specific Aims are as follows: (1) Determine the physiological significance of NS2B-NS3pro-mediated proteolysis of Sox2 in the infected human neural stem/precursor cells, and (2) Identify cellular genes and major regulatory pathways that may lead to microcephaly in the infected newborns. To accomplish this aim, we will employ a plethora of the relevant cell-based assays, animal models and the advanced proteomics- transcriptomics-bioinformatics methodologies. The major outputs will be a body of knowledge that will be made publicly available and facilitate the next steps to disease eradication. Finally, it is worth reiterating that many flaviviruses cause serious neurological syndromes, and that our approach should be readily adaptable to other members of the extensive flaviviral family."
"9349384","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a central role in regulation of cell response during development and homeostasis, and dysregulation contributes to diseases such as cancer. RTK-targeted therapies have been applied successfully in cancer treatment though with limited effectiveness as activity of non-targeted RTKs can enable cells to become resistant. While redundant signaling is now appreciated as a common mechanism of acquired and innate resistance, the exact signaling that is essential to resistance, and whether it is conserved or varies across cancer contexts, has not been addressed. RTKs lead to a common set of downstream signals, but in vastly different quantitative combinations, and differ in their ability to confer resistance in a context-dependent manner. A fundamental, rigorous understanding of resistance is necessary if we are to develop better therapies to overcome this redundancy. TAM receptors (Tyro3, AXL, MerTK) are a family of RTKs that have attracted interest for their widespread roles in tumor resistance and metastasis. However, while the ligands for these receptors have been identified, we lack even a basic understanding of the contexts that lead to activation of these receptors. RTKs work by auto- and trans-phosphorylation, recruiting adapter proteins, and then phosphorylating those adapters and other associated proteins. Systems biology has concentrated on easily measurable factors such as phosphorylation, but comparisons of signaling between receptors are not easily accomplished, as phosphosites between receptors do not readily equate. The amount of receptor-bound adapter molecules is one quantity that should be directly comparable however. Thus, I plan to develop techniques to measure RTK interaction quantitatively and across the multiple potential interactions within a cell simultaneously with the intention of more completely capturing signaling from these receptors. I will use these techniques combined with quantitative modeling to examine interactions during receptor activation and understand how different RTKs can provide redundant signaling leading to targeted cancer treatment resistance. These resistance and interaction models will then be applied to more specifically understand resistance conferred by the TAM family of RTKs. Through development of mechanistic models for ligand-dependent and independent signaling, linked to adapter interaction, downstream signaling, and tumor cell resistance, I plan to develop an integrative understanding of resistance. This will provide necessary information to develop therapies bypassing this problem."
"9257035","Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 114 million surgical and procedure-based wounds occur annually worldwide, including 36 million from surgery in the U.S. Damages to delicate soft tissues, such as lung, liver, land blood vessels, are particularly challenging to repair. When these tissues are punched for biopsy or injured during procedures, they must be reconnected surgically using sutures, staples, or implantation of surgical meshes. Despite their common use in clinics, these mechanical methods are associated with inevitable tissue damages caused by deep piercing and ischemia. These methods are also time-consuming, demand surgeon's skills during the surgeries, and might cause post-surgical complications such as infection. To resolve these issues, various types of surgical materials have been used for sealing, reconnecting tissues, or attaching devices to tissues. Despite the emergence of several surgical sealants, the biomaterials used as sealants/adhesives often have some drawbacks that limit their applications, such as low mechanical properties, toxicity effects or toxic degradation products, and poor adhesive strength; therefore none of them meet all the necessary needs to replace sutures and staples. An ideal surgical sealant is required to be flexible to be able to adapt with dynamic movement of native tissues, have excellent biocompatibility and controlled biodegradability, and provide high adhesive strength and burst pressure particularly in the presence of body fluids. In this proposal, we aim to engineer a novel and highly adhesive surgical sealant with tunable adhesion strength from a light-activated naturally derived hydrogel, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), for surgical applications (e.g. lung surgery). We will chemically modify the engineered GelMA hydrogels with catechol to form gelatin methacryloyl-catechol (GelMAC) with enhanced adhesion to the native tissues. We will then evaluate the function of the engineered surgical material as a lung sealant in both small and large animal models. Our preliminary data suggests that this material is superior to the existing products in the market and may generate a paradigm-shifting surgical material that may not require sutures due to its superior mechanical and adhesive properties. The engineered highly adhesive surgical sealant can be potentially used to stop air leakages after lung surgery and also support new tissue formation to repair the defected sites. Due to its high adhesion to the native tissues and biocompatibility, the engineered adhesives in this proposal have potential to be used in various procedures such as anastomoses, cardiovascular surgeries, and wound closure."
"9393139","ABSTRACT Hypertension is a complex condition that affects 40% of persons over the age of 25 years. Reduction in blood pressure has been associated with a significant decrease in both coronary heart disease and stroke. Our long term goal is to develop novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension in the context of the cytochrome P450 system. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A11 is an ?-hydroxylase that catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). 20-HETE can be pro-hypertensive by constricting microvasculature or anti-hypertensive by inhibiting salt reabsorption in the kidney. Thus, 20-HETE and CYP4A11 have important roles in blood pressure regulation. In humans, a genetic variant of CYP4A11 (rs1126742 T8590C allele) encodes for a protein (CYP4A11-F434S) with reduced ?-hydroxylation activity that has been associated with high blood pressure and resistance to the anti-hypertensive effects of some diuretics. This apparent deregulation, in conjunction with decreased 20-HETE activity in the F434S variant, suggests that other unknown factors may contribute to the pro- and anti-hypertensive effects of CYP4A11. The central hypothesis is that expression and/or posttranslational modification differentially effects genetic variants of CYP4A11 with regard to 20-HETE synthesis and, ultimately, blood pressure control. CYP4A11 regulation and/or enzymatic activity will be tested for effects on 20-HETE levels and for influences by reactive oxygen species (ROS). A combination of biochemical, analytical, and enzymological tools will be used to further elucidate the differences between the CYP4A11 Phe-434 and Ser-434 variants in substrate selection, activity, and protein level. First, the use of chemoselective probes will determine the role of redox status in the posttranslational regulation in CYP4A11. Next, the relationship between CYP4A11 variant protein concentration and arachidonic acid metabolizing activity will be investigated in human microsomes and a transgenic mouse model. These experiments aim to further elucidate the role CYP4A11 variants play in hypertension. 20-HETE is an important component in hypertension. Genetic variations that alter its production cause significant changes in hypertension susceptibility and therapeutic response. Understanding the mechanisms related to the phenotypic variation in CYP4A11 will help to gain a more in-depth understanding of hypertension in different individuals and reshape how these specific persons are treated for blood pressure reduction."
"9404101","Abstract This proposal focuses on the rational design of antigens for serodiagnosis of Zika virus (ZIKV) with minimal cross-reactivity to other human pathogenic flaviviruses. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause miscarriage, microcephaly, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. A specific serodiagnosis of ZIKV infection is urgently needed to track the spread of ZIKV infection and to diagnose individuals exposed to ZIKV in scenarios such as prenatal diagnosis and neonatal monitoring, blood donor screening, screening of travelers returning from Zika-endemic regions. ZIKV serodiagnosis is highly challenging because of extensive cross-reactivity with dengue and other flaviviruses that co-circulate with ZIKV. Our previous and ongoing work defining the human serotype specific antibody responses to dengue envelope (E) protein place us in a unique position to define similar regions in ZIKV E and produce candidate diagnostic antigens for serodiagnostics. Fortified with detailed structural information, we will rationally design and produce substructures of Zika E protein bearing unique antigenic sites for specific and sensitive serological detection of ZIKV infections in flavivirus naïve, flavivirus pre-immune or flavivirus-vaccinated populations. For aim 1, we will produce ZIKV candidate antigens and measure their antibody binding response across a reference panel of immune sera from people exposed to primary or secondary flavivirus infections, including ZIKV and DENV. In Aim 2, we will use protein engineering approaches to redesign most efficacious candidate antigens to change cross-reactive antigenic sites, while preserving Zika specific sites, to improve the diagnostic potential of antigens for differential serodiagnosis of Zika infection. We will compare and contrast one or a combination of surface redesigned Zika antigens for serological detection of recent and prior exposure to ZIKV. In follow up studies, we will partner with reference laboratories and commercial partners to use recombinant protein antigens to develop simple assays for use at the point of care and in surveillance programs."
"9353554","ABSTRACT Using innovative forward-thinking mouse models and approaches, the Projects in this comprehensive discovery-based Thymus Rejuvenation PPG seek to (i) identify mechanisms behind reduced thymic production and impaired peripheral maintenance of T cells with aging and stress, and (ii) develop combined strategies to ameliorate these defects and improve immune defense against infection and cancer in the elderly. Critical to the translation potential of project-identified mechanisms, pathways and therapeutic targets in future programs, is proof-of-concept verification of applicability of mouse targets/pathways to human thymus aging, and centralized assessment of thymic function (i. e. sjTREC). To meet this need a central Human Target Verification and Thymic Function Core (Core C) has been integrated into this Program Project. At the center of the Core is the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI) Human Thymus Tissue Biobank, which contains more than 900 healthy-donor human thymus tissues (ages 1 day to 80 years). The Thymus Biobank consists of FFPE tissue blocks, snap-frozen frozen tissue chunks, and DMSO-cryopreserved thymocytes and T cell depleted stroma. The Biobank has been maintained by the Core leader, Dr. Greg Sempowski, for 15+ years and has been extensively characterized by Dr. Sempowski and Core co-investigator/pathologist, Dr. Laura Hale. Dr. Hale's immunohistochemical analysis and Dr. Sempowski's molecular analysis (i. e. gene expression and TCR rearrangement) of tissues from the Biobank laid the foundation for our modern understanding of changes in human thymus architecture and function across the lifespan. Core C will accelerate proof-of-concept verification of project-identified mouse therapeutic targets/pathways in human thymus aging/rejuvenation and independently monitor thymic output with three focused specific aims: (SA1) Define and characterize age, sex and phenotypically applicable human thymus tissues panels to meet project- specific translation verification needs. Provide central histologic and molecular analyses on tissue panels; (SA2) provide centralized expert board-certified pathology support for human and mouse tissue staining, scoring and analysis; and (SA3) provide standardized, quality-controlled assay support for mouse sjTREC assays. Successful delivery of Core C services to Projects 1-4 and Core D will: (i) add considerable value to this overall program, (ii) be a key component of overall program synergy, and most importantly, (iii) provide critical proof-of-concept verification of applicability of mouse targets/pathways to human thymus aging/rejuvenation to ameliorate age-associated immune deficiencies and improve immune defense against infection and cancer in the elderly."
"9464858","Project Summary/Abstract I propose to investigate the regulation of morphogenesis using the Caenorahbditis elegans embryo as a model. Defects in morphogenesis lead to developmental abnormalities in humans, and morphogenetic models have provided insight into wound closure and human diseases, including cancer. The tenant of morphogenesis is that small cell shape changes and movements structure tissues to provide shape. The cytoskeleton and cell adhesion are instrumental to cell shape changes and movement, but their regulation is only partially understood. The Bowerman lab has generated a large collection of ~1000 temperature-sensitive, embryonic lethal (TS-EL) mutants that provide a rich resource for investigating embryonic morphogenesis. TS-EL mutants are useful because earlier essential requirements for a gene can be bypassed by growth at the permissive temperature, and upshifts to the restrictive temperature simultaneously reduce both maternal and zygotic gene function. Therefore, I will perform the first systematic and large-scale forward genetic screen for TS-EL, morphogenesis-defective mutants and characterize the morphogenetic requirements for the genes I identify. In aim 1, I will complete my classification of terminally differentiated mutant phenotypes, genetically characterize the mutations that result in early and penetrant morphogenesis defects, and identify the genes affected by these mutations. Thus far, I have identified mutations in 9 conserved genes and have chosen six for further analysis based on their conservation in humans and because their roles in morphogenesis are not known. In a collaboration with Dr. Zhirong Bao at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we are using a semi-automated approach to determine the cell fates produced during embryogenesis in these and other mutants. I will focus further effort on those mutants with normal cell fate patterning that are therefore specifically defective in morphogenesis. In aim 2, I will use fluorescent epidermal membrane markers to identify and sort into shared trait groups those mutants with defects in epidermal cell shape changes and movements that mediate early embryonic morphogenesis. For mutants with defects in these morphogenetic processes, I will determine where the wild-type genes are expressed by making fluorescent protein fusions at endogenous loci using CRISPR/Cas9. Our lineage analysis already has shown our TS-EL mutation in HLH-1, the body wall muscle master regulator, specifically affects only body wall muscle cell fate and positioning, suggesting a previously unknown influence of body wall muscle cells on the overlying epidermal cell dynamics that mediate morphogenesis. To further explore this intriguing result, I will use fluorescent fusion proteins and live imaging to determine if muscle cell fate or positioning defects correlate with defects in epidermal cell shape and position during early morphogenesis. My goal is to advance our understanding of the genetic pathways that regulate morphogenesis and in the longer term explore in more depth the requirements for individual genes that we identify and prioritize."
"9397064","Project Summary:  First synthesized in the 1950s, benzodiazepines (BZDs) are widely prescribed drugs that exert their anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, sedative, and anticonvulsant actions by binding to GABA-A receptors (GABAARs), the main inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel in the brain. Since their synthesis, many scientists have theorized that there exists an endogenous BZD, or endozepine, in the brain. In 1983, a candidate polypeptide that displaced BZDs in a GABAAR binding assay was isolated from brain homogenates . However, proof that this  1 peptide called diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) had functional effects in the brain was lacking.  Recently, using DBI knock-down experiments it was demonstrated in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles that DBI and one of its peptide fragments, ODN, inhibit GABA-induced currents and promote neurogenesis , indicating that DBI and ODN work as negative allosteric modulators of GABAARs in vivo.  2 However, in the thalamic reticular nucleus (a nucleus that plays an important role in controlling epileptic seizures), DBI and/or a DBI-derived peptide was found to enhance GABAAR currents and suppress epileptic activity . Thus, depending on the brain region, DBI can potentiate or inhibit GABAAR activity. Little, however, is  3 known about how DBI exerts these actions.  How do products from a single protein elicit positive versus negative effects on GABAAR currents? Do DBI- derived peptides such as ODN elicit the same functional effects as DBI? Do different cell types make and process distinct DBI peptide(s)? Is DBI modified post-translationally (e.g. phosphorylated, acylated) and can these modifications alter DBI's physiological effects? The proposed experiments will address these fundamental questions and will 1) determine if specific GABAAR subunit combinations mediate the positive and negative actions of DBI and ODN; 2) determine if astrocytes and neurons release different DBI peptides and/or post-translationally process DBI differently, which impact its functional effects and 3) determine if astrocytes and neurons express different DBI transcript variants. Successful completion of these experiments will validate DBI's role as an endogenous BZD and will lay the foundation for understanding how DBI regulates GABA- mediated inhibition in the brain."
"9341939","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The human -type globin genes are expressed exclusively in erythroid cells and regulated by a locus control region (LCR) that is located far upstream of the genes. Mutations in the -globin locus are among the most common disease-causing mutations in the human population. These mutations lead to thalassemias, characterized by reduced or absent adult -globin gene expression, or sickle cell anemia. A possible therapy for these hemoglobinopathies is the reactivation of the normally repressed -globin genes in adult erythroid cells. We propose to continue our efforts to understand how the LCR regulates globin gene expression during development and differentiation and will develop new methodology for changing expression patterns in the - globin gene locus. We established a novel procedure utilizing small synthetic DNA binding domains to analyze and neutralize specific cis-regulatory DNA elements in the -globin gene locus. We will target these synthetic DNA binding domains to known repressor binding sites in the -globin gene promoters and to activator binding sites in the gene encoding for the -globin repressor Bcl11A. Targeting these sites with synthetic DNA binding proteins is expected to increase -globin expression in adult erythroid cells. We and others have shown previously that the LCR recruits transcription complexes which produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Transcription factors NF-E2 and USF have been implicated in transcription complex recruitment to the LCR. We will utilize the synthetic DNA binding domains to analyze the contribution of cis-regulatory elements in the LCR that interact with transcription factors NF-E2 and USF. Furthermore, we will examine if LCR associated transcripts or the process of transcription contributes to LCR mediated activation of globin gene expression. The four aims of this proposal will focus on optimizing the DNA binding specificity and delivery methods for synthetic DNA binding proteins (aim 1), to use synthetic DNA binding proteins to analyze cis-regulatory elements in the -globin locus and to reactivate -globin expression in adult erythroid cells (aim 2), to identify all proteins associated with the human LCR in erythroid cells of transgenic mice (aim 3), and to analyze the mechanism(s) by which the LCR and LCR associated non-coding transcription activates the globin genes (aim 4)."
"9546225","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The endocytic adaptor molecule disabled-2 (Dab2) has been assigned the label of tumor suppressor because its expression level in many tumors and tumor-derived cell lines is aberrantly low, and its re-expression in these lines results in cel cycle arrest and a decreased rate of proliferation. In addition, Dab2 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in cellular differentiation and lineage commitment. Its function is essential during not only megakaryocytic differentiation and differentiation of embryonic stem cells into primitive endoderm4, but also during TGFß-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). The molecular basis for this apparent tumor suppressor and differentiation function of Dab2 is unknown. We hypothesize that Dab2 mediates its growth suppressor and differentiation effects by mediating cross-talk between the TGFß and Wnt signaling pathways. It is our contention (supported by our published and preliminary data) that in undifferentiated cells, the expression of Dab2 is low and cells are responsive to Wnt, and upon differentiation and induction of Dab2, cells become refractory to Wnt signaling. Thus, in differentiated cells, we propose that Dab2 maintains the differentiated state and restrains proliferation through its negative regulation of Wnt signaling. Loss of Dab2, as observed in many tumor cel lines or in epithelial cells having undergone the mesenchymal transition, leads to sustained Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the molecular basis for Dab2's inhibitory effects on Wnt signaling, specifically effects on LRP6 receptor internalization, and to investigate the molecular mechanism leading to downregulation of Dab2 that occurs following EMT and acquisition of the mesenchymal state."
"9322367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) glomerulonephritis (GN) is the most common form of rapidly progressive glomerular disease. The objective of this competitive renewal is to understand the pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis of ANCA GN and to translate the discoveries into optimal patient care, and a number of exciting avenues of investigation will be explored in four distinct yet highly synergistic projects that are efficiently supported by two Cores. Project 1 continues to unravel the molecular underpinning of ANCA GN by elucidating genetic variation and epigenetic regulation of transcription, and by clarifying transcriptional profiles of cells, which will drive investigation and discovery of targeted therapies, including repurposing of FDA-approved drugs. Project 2 explores how modulating adaptive and innate immune responses influences the risk and severity of human ANCA GN. Investigations will address specific questions about the nature of immunodominant epitopes, how ANCA glycovariants affect dendritic cells and B cells, will seek clues as to why certain T cells proliferate and are not suppressible, and will determine the function of CD33+ myeloid cells in ANCA GN. Project 3 will use murine models to advance the understanding of alterations in adaptive and innate immune responses and how these alterations influence risk and severity of murine ANCA GN. In parallel with Project 2, Project 3 will explore epitopes and ANCA glycosylation to confirm findings from human studies regarding pathogenicity. The role of innate immunity will be probed from a number of perspectives, including how complement induces disease. Most interestingly, a model of granulomatous inflammation analogous to that seen in human pathology has been produced in these murine models. Project 4 translates what has been learned in Projects 1, 2 and 3 into clinical investigations focusing on biomarkers that distinguish patients who are in remission and no longer require therapy and help determine the duration of immunotherapy. Project 4 will evaluate a prophylactic approach aimed at preventing morbidity and mortality from infections as a consequence of continued immunotherapy. The Administrative Core provides day-to-day logistical support, while the Clinical Core is strategically situated at the center of human investigations. DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, T cells, and B cells are collected through the Clinical Core from patients at disease onset, upon relapse, and at the time of remission, and the proposed studies will have access to a collection of over 20,000 biological samples from 868 ANCA GN patients followed from disease diagnosis until death in an inception cohort started almost three decades ago. The simultaneous collection of biological material permits comprehensive analysis of genetic and epigenetic influences, and the role of adaptive and innate immune responses. Synergistic, hypothesis-driven studies in humans and animals, emanating from multiple perspectives, pave the way toward the ultimate goal of translating discoveries into methods for improving the lives of patients with ANCA GN. These investigations will have the added value of shedding insight into the nature of autoimmunity and autoimmune disease in general."
"9341982","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive lesion that comprises approximately 20% of new breast cancer diagnoses each year. Because pathological evaluation of DCIS typically relies on histologic criteria that offer little value in predicting which lesions will progress to invasive breast cancer (IBC), many patients receive unnecessary surgical and adjuvant interventions that often lead to therapy-related complications. To date, most clinical studies examining protein expression of DCIS in breast cancer biopsies have employed immune-peroxidase staining using a single primary antibody, such that each protein is visualized in separate serial biopsy sections. Consequently, despite numerous studies implicating a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBC, multiplexed, quantitative single cell profiles relating the phenotype of breast tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment have not been described. With this in mind, the work proposed here focuses on using a novel imaging platform that I recently developed, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), to define new disease models for mapping progressive perturbations in protein expression and tissue histology that correlate with developing DCIS and IBC. Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is capable of analyzing up to 100 targets simultaneously and is compatible with standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, and the most common sample type in clinical repositories worldwide. I will first expand upon recent work to create an antibody panel for characterizing fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelium in human breast tissue. This panel will be used to interrogate previously constructed tissue microarrays comprised of clinically annotated biopsies of normal breast, DCIS, and IBC. These experiments will, for the first time, simultaneously characterize phenotypic and histologic features of epithelal and stromal components of normal and neoplastic human breast tissue at the subcellular level. These features will then be analyzed in aggregate to construct predictive clinical classifiers that can be used to select optimal therapeutic regimens that prevent progression to IBC while also minimizing treatment-related morbidity. More generally, this work will also establish a novel platform for gaining an unprecedented view into disease pathogenesis that could be easily adapted in future work to risk stratify other pre-invasive lesions."
"9353318","The recent demonstration that the histone methyltransferase, D0T1L and the acetylysine binding protein  BRD4 are required for continued proliferation and survival for subsets of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  cells points to epigenetic mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets in this disease. Small molecule  inhibitors of D0T1L and BRD4 have been developed and show remarkable antiproliferative activity against  AML cells providing further rationale for deeper characterization of these processes. The central hypothesis  for this project is that small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic mechanisms will effectively target AML cells. We  will assess this hypothesis through the use novel small molecules, chemical biological approaches,  epigenomic analyses genetically engineered mouse models and genetic screens. In specific Aim 1 we will  define the mechanisms by which bromodomains inhibitors suppress Myc and E2F driven gene expression  programs. In specific Aim 11 we will define mechanisms of acquired resistance to small molecule  bromodomain inhibitors. These studies will inform as to possible mechanisms of clinical resistance to such  therapies, and illuminate the cellular pathways through which these molecules suppress proliferation and  induce apoptosis. In specific aim 3 we will assess compelling combinations of small molecule inhibitors of  epigenetic pathways including the combination of DOTI L inhibitors and BET inhibitors. Given our access to  newly developed small molecule inhibitors, the proposed studies have the potential to bring new, more  efficacious, less toxic therapies to children and adults diagnosed with AML."
"9540260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) was created in 2005 to evaluate the clinical course of perinatally acquired HIV infection among adolescents and pre-adolescents and the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to HIV and antiretroviral chemotherapy among a representative cohort of children in the United States. PHACS is comprised of a Scientific Leadership Group (SLG), which is overseen by a Coordinating Center, a Data and Operations Center (DOC), and 22 clinical units (CU). The Department of Epidemiology and the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at the Harvard School of Public Health, Westat, and the Frontier Science Foundation form the PHACS DOC. The DOC collaborates with the SLG to define the PHACS research agenda; provides methodological leadership for the development of all PHACS analytic projects; maintains CU subcontracts and trains and monitors sites in proper procedures for PHACS research; plans and conducts all leadership and full PHACS network meetings; develops HIV- and health- related educational materials and opportunities for the PHACS community; and, supports an active Community Advisory Board. The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP), a cohort of 450 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and preadolescents age 7-16 at enrollment, was established to investigate the impact of HIV and ART on organ systems, growth and development, sexual maturation, pubertal development, cognition, emotional development, and socialization; AMP Up was subsequently designed to extend follow-up of AMP participants and other HIV-infected young adults who have reached 18 years of age using a streamlined, mobile-friendly protocol. A drug toxicity surveillance system, Surveillance Monitoring for Anti-Retroviral Toxicities (SMART), has enrolled 3,506 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected children to evaluate long-term effects of in-utero ART exposure. In PHACS III, the DOC will continue to carry out the PHACS scientific agenda in an increasing efficient manner, enrolling and following an additional 1,000 newborns into SMARTT and an additional 525 HIV-infected and HIV-exposed, uninfected young adults into AMP Up. Together, HSPH, Westat and Frontier Science bring a long and successful history of providing the scientific and operational leadership required by PHACS, as well as innovative methods to enhance and maximize the efficiency of the PHACS study design, conduct, and analyses. Given our prior experience we are uniquely positioned to continue to provide the scientific/epidemiologic and operational leadership essential to the continued success of PHACS."
"9395688","Project Summary/Abstract The ability of cells to robustly enter and exit quiescence is essential for tissue homeostasis, and defects in the transition between proliferation and quiescence lead to diseases of excess proliferation (cancer) or cell loss (aging and degeneration). Critical to this transition are gene expression changes regulated by well understood signaling pathways. In addition to transcriptional changes, chromatin modification and accessibility is regulated between quiescent and proliferating cells, and the functions of chromatin modifiers have been shown to disrupt these transitions. However, the mechanisms by which chromatin affects the ability of cells to transition between quiescence and proliferation are unknown. The goal of this proposal is to characterize global and gene-specific chromatin modification and accessibility changes, and define how chromatin regulation affects the ability of cells to transition in and out of quiescence. The central hypothesis is that distinct chromatin modifications regulate the entry, exit, and maintenance of quiescence through control of both chromatin accessibility and site-specific transcriptional control of critical cell cycle genes. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) Define the functional role of global changes in chromatin modifications in proliferating and quiescent cells. (2) Identify and induce site-specific chromatin modification changes at the promoters of critical cell cycle regulated genes. (3) Determine changes in chromatin accessibility in quiescent and proliferating cells. Global and site-specific chromatin modifications changes will be identified in quiescent and proliferating human epithelial cells. The role of these changes in cell cycle regulation will be determined by disrupting the chromatin regulators responsible for the deposition and removal of the modifications of interest, and using time lapse microscopy to image live-cell sensors for activities critical to cell cycle progression. This quantitative method will identify aspects of the cell cycle, which are perturbed by changes in chromatin modification, including probability of quiescence and time to cell cycle re-entry. Moreover, changes in chromatin accessibility in this critical transition will be identified, and the role of modifications in regulating chromatin accessibility will be evaluated. This work will contribute to the field by defining a novel pathway, chromatin dynamics, which functions to regulate cell cycle entry and exit. Furthermore, the proposed work will advance the understanding of the mechanisms by which chromatin modifiers control the establishment and maintenance of chromatin marks. Finally, the proposed work will offer new targets for therapeutic treatment of diseases of tissue homeostasis, including cancer."

"9329386","PROJECT SUMMARY There is a timely and urgent need to understand and leverage the context of lung cancer screening to deliver smoking cessation treatment and promote cessation among individuals at high risk for lung and other smoking- related diseases. The long-term goal is to maximize the public health benefits of lung cancer screening by providing a blueprint of best practices for integrating and sustaining tobacco treatment delivery in lung cancer screening settings. The current project will make a vital contribution by identifying superior and scalable tobacco treatment components with relevance for current smokers seeking screening that can be cost- effectively delivered with high implementation fidelity by heterogeneous lung cancer screening sites. The proposed research will use an innovative methodological framework, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), to design an optimized, scalable evidence-based tobacco treatment package that can be readily integrated within lung cancer screening sites. MOST involves highly efficient, randomized experimentation to precisely quantify the effects of individual treatment components and identify synergistic effects by combining them into an effective tobacco treatment package. This information then guides assembly of an optimized treatment package that achieves target outcomes with minimal resource consumption and staff burden. The rationale for the proposed research is that once an optimized tobacco treatment package is established, future comparative effectiveness trials can examine strategies for wider implementation and dissemination in LDCT- LCS settings. In partnership with the Lung Cancer Alliance and their National Framework for Excellence in Lung Cancer Screening, we will identify 18 heterogeneous lung cancer screening sites across the United States that will serve as demonstration field sites. Sixty current smokers will be recruited from each of the 18 participating screening sites (n=1,080). The findings will guide assembly of an optimized and scalable cessation treatment package that achieves superior cessation outcomes with attention to minimizing burden in lung cancer screening sites. This study will apply MOST to achieve the following aims: Aim 1: To use a highly efficient MOST to identify which of four evidence-based tobacco treatment components under consideration contribute to superior cessation endpoints. The four tobacco treatment components to be tested are: (1) Motivational Interviewing (MI) (Yes vs. No); (2) NRT Patch (Yes vs. No); 3) NRT Lozenge (Yes vs No); and 4) Message Framing (Gain vs Loss); Aim 2: To estimate the cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of evidence- based tobacco treatment components, delivered alone and in combination; Aim 3: Guided by well-established evaluation and conceptual implementation science frameworks, we will conduct a robust, mixed methods evaluation of the implementation process and assess factors that may influence implementation and sustainability for delivering and disseminating effective models for smoking cessation treatment in lung cancer screening settings."
"9553936","Abstract We propose a rigorous randomized trial to evaluate an innovative stepped care for suicide prevention intervention for adolescents and young adults, compared to a ZS program initiated by a health system. An effective ZS strategy for this age group is critically needed because this is a developmental period when: 1) suicide is the second leading cause of death, accounting for more deaths than any medical illness; 2) suicidal tendencies and behaviors often first occur in this age span; 3) rates of suicide and suicide attempts (SAs) increase dramatically; and 4) effective intervention can reduce risk, suffering, and costs over lifetimes.  The project combines a partnership with a health system that has strong infrastructure and commitment to quality improvement for ZS with a research team that has successfully implemented collaborative stepped care interventions in health systems and has expertise in clinical, health services, economics, and policy research and dissemination. We will identify and enroll 300 youths ages 12-24 with elevated suicide and SA risk using a multi-stage screening process. Eligible youths will be randomized to: 1) zero suicide best practices, which emphasizes health system quality improvement using the zero suicide toolkit (ZSBP, www.sprc.org); or 2) ZSBP+ stepped care for suicide prevention, which integrates evidence-based suicide prevention with primary care and emergency services. Prior research demonstrates the value of similar integrated medical- behavioral health interventions for improving patient outcomes, rates of care, and continuity of care- a critical issue for ZS efforts, as many youths discontinue care prematurely despite continuing risk. The ZSBP+ approach uses: 1) risk assessments to triage youths to appropriate care levels; 2) Care Managers to deliver CBT and DBT skills training and support primary care and emergency clinicians with patient evaluation and treatment; 3) internet eCBT and therapeutic DBT skills video plus access to coaching support (24/7) for lower risk youths, with stepped up in-person group and/or individual treatment added for higher risk youths; and 4) regular monitoring of patient outcomes, with real-time feedback to clinicians to facilitate decision-making and use of the stepped care algorithms. The intervention period is 12 months: 6 months of acute treatment; and 6 months of continuation treatment. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12-month follow-ups. We hypothesize that, compared to youths in ZSBP, youths randomized to ZSBP+ will have significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal SAs over time (primary outcome) and will show improvements on secondary outcomes (suicide events over time, self-harm episodes, depressive symptoms). We will also conduct cost effectiveness analyses. Results will provide critical information for health systems and science regarding the potential to achieve ZS goals by integrating state of the art science with practice quality improvement. ZSBP+ stepped care for suicide prevention has potential for broader sustained adoption within the health system and national dissemination, enhancing our capacity to meet the ZS challenge."
"9349371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Faced with myriad external insults, like temperature changes and osmolarity imbalances, cells must adjust their biochemical activities to meet ever-shifting demands. To counteract environmental challenges, or stresses, cells have evolved a collection of stress response pathways that work as corrective feedback loops to restore homeostasis when the cell is thrown out of equilibrium. Stress responses are ancient and the core pathways are conserved in all eukaryotes. Defects in these pathways - failures to restore homeostasis - can have deleterious effects, as in disease states like diabetes. Moreover, pathogens and cancers can selectively modulate and exploit stress response pathways to harness their cytoprotective functions. While decades of genetics, biochemistry and expression profiling have identified the pathways, worked out the basic activation mechanisms and revealed the target genes our current understanding of stress response pathways lacks both depth and breadth. It lacks depth in that we do not know the mechanisms that control the pathways in real-time to ensure sufficient activation upon stress and efficient deactivation once homeostasis is restored. Our understanding lacks breadth in that the pathways have generally been studied independently, neglecting potential interconnections. A quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how these pathways are regulated to restore homeostasis and knowledge of how the different stress responses operate as an interconnected network are prerequisites to effectively modulating these pathways for therapeutic purposes. In this context, I propose three specific aims to increase the depth of our understanding of the quantitative regulatory mechanisms that control stress response pathways and the breadth of our understanding of the interconnections between these responses. In the first two aims I will focus on the heat shock response, the elemental and and prototypical stress response, to reveal how phosphorylation and chaperone protein binding dynamics quantitatively regulate the activity of the transcription factor, Hsf1. In the third aim, I will focus on the interconnections between stres response pathways by building a panel of stress reporter strains that will allow simultaneous measurement of all stress responses following any genetic or environmental perturbation. The proposed research is significant because it will provide depth and breadth to our understanding of stress responses. Such understanding is a prerequisite to effectively harnessing these vital pathways for therapeutic benefit. Finally, I expect that the mechanistic systems biology approach described here will serve as a model for the quantitative investigation of pathways and networks in increasingly complex systems."
"9552402","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am broadly interested in gene regulation and cellular processes that are instructive for embryonic development. As a graduate student, I made several discoveries relating to the specification, patterning, and morphogenesis of embryonic neural and cardiac progenitors in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis. Recognizing the largely untapped potential of Ciona and other tunicates as model organisms for developmental genetics, I have continued my postdoctoral research working on these invertebrate chordates. During my post-doc, I have developed additional tools for the study of gene function in Ciona and established myself as a young leader of the tunicate research community. The K99/R00 award will allow me to complete my formal training and begin my transition to a role as an independent investigator, at the helm of a research group studying cellular morphogenesis in tunicate embryonic development.  For this project, I propose to study gene function in regulation of migration and polarization of two distinct cell types in the Ciona embryo, the Trunk Ventral Cells (TVCs) and the Bipolar Tail Neurons (BTNs). In the K99 mentored phase, I will first investigate gene function by CRISPR/Cas9- mediated mutagenesis in the TVCs, which undergo stereotyped directed migration and polarity orientation. I will then profile the transcriptome of te BTNs, identifying Candidate genes that may regulate stereotyped directed migration and orientation of polarity. The completion of these aims will prepare me for pursuing my third aim, to be performed in the R00 mentored phase, of testing the requirement for those Candidate genes in the BTNs, allowing for direct comparisons between the molecular control of migration and polarity in different cell types in different niches of the same embryo.  The mentored phase fits the research interests of both my mentor, Dr. Christiaen, and I. We both aim to understand how cell behavior is regulated, and how deficiencies in this regulatory control may result in developmental syndromes and human disease. Where I hope to distinguish myself from my mentor during the independent phase and beyond is in my particular interest in neural development and neuronal differentiation, in contrast to Dr. Christiaen's focus on cardiac development.  The K99 award will allow me to complete my postdoctoral training, by learning and meaningfully applying FACS, RNA-seq, and automated imaging techniques. The K99 will also enable me to generate preliminary data that I can take with me as the foundation for an independent research program."

"9329363","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The metazoan has evolved various defensive mechanisms to protect itself against the detrimental consequences of stress. Many of the stress responsive mechanisms require altering the composition of their proteomes, a remodeling that may either become lost or exacerbated during the course of aging. This remodeling often includes enhancing the networks of stress responsive proteins and chaperones, many of which are targeted for specific subcellular compartments or organelles, including mitochondria. Though possessing an isolated genome, mitochondria have a proteome that is predominantly composed of proteins encoded in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm. A mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) is required on the majority of mitochondrial proteins to drive their import into mitochondria. The decision as to whether a protein becomes translocated or not is often contained within the targeting sequence of the protein itself. Surprisingly, a large percentage of proteins that contain an MTS sequence are predicted as dually localized in other subcellular compartments as well. Notably, a number of dually localized proteins are actually mitochondrial stress responsive proteins or chaperones. We hypothesize that 1) the dual localization of a subset of mitochondrial proteins allows for an adaptive plasticity in the composition of the mitochondrial proteome, and 2) the specific MTS of a stress-responsive protein will bias the efficiency of its import toward populations of aged mitochondria. In this project, the nematode C. elegans will be used to investigate these hypotheses. In this proposal, we will undertake a series of methods to both understand how dually targeted proteins fluctuate between subcellular compartments across the lifespan of an organism, and how the targeting signal serves as an active mechanism by which the import and localization of these proteins are regulated."
"9390004","Achieving cancer cure, or even control, continues to be a major unanswered challenge in health care despite the remarkable technological advances of the 21st century. Advances in multi-modal noninvasive molecular and functional imaging are providing unique opportunities to expand our understanding of cancer, an understanding that is critical to developing effective and cancer specific treatments. In this resubmission I have chosen three interactive focus areas within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the tumor macroenvironment (TMacE), and Theranostics, that will be pursued in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) human tumor xenografts and syngeneic tumors in immune competent mice. In the TME focus, we will use imaging to expand our understanding of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mechanotransduction pathway in the metastatic cascade that will include developing PET imaging probes to detect FAK noninvasively. FAK also plays a role in tumor immune suppression. In the TMacE focus we will expand our efforts in understanding PDAC induced cachexia that results in a wide range of symptoms affecting the function of organs such as muscle, liver, brain, and heart, causing significant morbidity. The tumor secretome holds the key to this syndrome by influencing the `macroenvironment'. We will focus on characterizing the tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) in preclinical PDAC xenograft models to develop biomarkers of cachexia and identify potential metabolic targets that will be pursued through the Theranostic focus. In the Theranostic focus we will direct our efforts and expertise in imaging and NP technology to improve the outcome of checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC and PDAC. Lack of effector T-cell tumor infiltration has been identified as a major cause of the poor response to these inhibitors. We will use FDA approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) PLGA to create cancer cell membrane (CCM) coated `immunosome' NPs embedded with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to increase effector T cell tumor infiltration, and apply molecular imaging to detect the biodistribution of the NPs and the changes in T cell infiltration. Ultimately we want to use the patients own cancer cells to synthesize the NPs for personalized medicine. Since FAP-? expressing cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to create an immune suppressive TME, we will use anti-FAP-? antibody conjugated to the near infrared (NIR) dye IR700 to detect CAFS with NIR imaging and eliminate them selectively in the tumor with PIT. If PIT of FAP-? expressing CAFs results in increased cytotoxic T cells in tumors, this may have significant applications in combination with checkpoint inhibitor treatment. We will use siRNA delivery with dextran based biocompatible NPs to downregulate FAK, and metabolic targets identified in the TMacE focus. I have built a strong network of collaborators that include clinical oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and surgeons that will ensure the rapid translation of the research conducted through the R35 award to benefit cancer detection and treatment."
"9272014","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cdc25A is an instrumental protein phosphatase in cell cycle progression that is overexpressed in many types of human cancer. However, the role of Cdc25A in cancer metabolism is unclear, and although its role in the regulation of Cdk dephosphorylation is well established, Cdc25A may contain other important cellular substrates. We revealed that EGF stimulation induces PKM2 phosphorylation in the cytosol, which is essential for the nuclear translocation of PKM2. In the nucleus, PKM2 is dephosphorylated by interacting with Cdc25A, which is required for EGF-induced ß-catenin transactivation. We hypothesize that Cdc25A regulates cancer metabolism and tumor progression by dephosphorylating nuclear PKM2. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cdc25A-dependent PKM2 dephosphorylation and the subsequent activation of ß-catenin; (2) To determine the role of Cdc25A-dependent PKM2 dephosphorylation in the Warburg effect, tumor cell proliferation, and brain tumorigenesis; and (3) To determine the clinical significance of Cdc25A-dependent PKM2 dephosphorylation in human glioma. The proposed research is significant because it could lead to pharmaceutical approaches to interrupt cancer metabolism by blocking the function of Cdc25A; this would, in turn, improve the efficacy of human cancer treatment."

We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice."
"9551789","Summary  Amyloids are complex proteins with a conserved beta sheet structure. Bacteria use amyloids to decorate the extracellular matrix of their biofilms, highly structured multicellular communities. Curli are amyloids expressed by enteric bacteria, including Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Our group has shown that curli amyloid fibers are recognized by TLR2/1 as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome. This finding is of broad relevance, because detection of amyloids by the innate immune system drives the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and prion diseases.  A recent study demonstrated that an artificially formed amyloid protein can bind DNA in vitro and this complex elicits an autoimmune response in mice. Since the biofilm extracellular matrix naturally harbors amyloids and DNA, we explored the interactions between these two molecules and determined that bacterial DNA released during biofilm formation was irreversibly incorporated into curli fibers. Bacteria expressing curli or purified curli/DNA complex triggered autoimmune responses in vivo.  The primary objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanism by which bacterial amyloids are recognized by the immune system, leading to their pathogenic effects in the host. Our central hypothesis is that bacterial amyloid/DNA complexes are pathogenic molecules that act by accessing multiple cellular compartments and engaging several Pattern Recognition Receptors, including, TLR2, TLR9 and NLRP3 resulting in inflammation and autoimmune responses. It is our expectation that successful completion of the proposed studies will identify bacterial amyloids as a novel powerful Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) that is recognized by the immune system via multiple receptors and establish a new paradigm that infections with amyloid-expressing bacteria are major environmental triggers not only for SLE but also for several other complex human diseases."

"9540174","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastomas rank among the most lethal of human cancers despite aggressive multimodal therapy. Most cancers kill their hosts through metastases but glioblastomas are nearly universally deadly in the absence of spread beyond the neuraxis due to spread into normal brain and resistance to conventional therapies. The lifespan and quality-of-life for glioblastoma patients has improved with better surgical resection, refined radiation administration and the addition of the oral methylator, temozolomide, during radiation, but median survival remains less than two years. The explanation for the failure of current therapy to extend patient survival has many causes, but one contributing force may be the presence of complex intratumoral heterogeneity derived from heterogeneous expression of oncogenic drivers as well as cellular hierarchies that phenocopy the normal brain hierarchy, albeit with aberrant control. Glioblastomas, like all cancers, can be considered a complex ecosystem that effectively responds to anti-tumor defenses of the body and additional cytotoxic therapy through the collective action of the neoplastic compartment in concert with infiltrating immune cells, vasculature, and reactive astrocytes that can act both as tumor suppressor and enhancer. Normal tissue specific stem cells pose danger due to their ability to undergo sustained proliferation. In response, stem cells reside in specific niches from which their derive maintenance cues but are also constrained in proliferation and undergo differentiation upon exiting the niche. Cancer stem cells share some cell autonomous regulatory pathways with the stem cells in the organs from which they were derived but also recreate elements of a niche. The stem cell niche is a structural construct but also is associated with regional variation in oxygen, pH, and nutrient availability. Thus, it is almost certain that the metabolic reprogramming that occurs within the context of oncogenesis represents an element of the cancer stem cell niche that requires control of metabolic stress responses. Aberrant metabolic control is required for tumor initiation and maintenance. Genetic derangements hardwire self-renewal into tumors but the cellular hierarchy is maintained through the interplay between core stem cell intrinsic transcriptional regulation, metabolism, and niche cues. We recently demonstrated that brain tumor stem cells coopt a high affinity glucose transporter (GLUT3) expressed in neurons to withstand metabolic stress. As mitochondrial morphology is linked to lineage specification, we investigated another mechanism critical to brain metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics. In preliminary studies, we found that brain tumor stem cells displayed molecular regulation distinct from non-stem tumor cells and neural progenitor cells. As targeting mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to neural protection in degenerative disease, these results suggest that targeting mitochondrial dynamics may represent a selective point of fragility for brain tumor stem cells. In the proposed studies we will investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic control in the maintenance of brain tumor stem cells, regulation of the epigenetic stem cell state, and as a therapeutic modality. Collectively, successful completion of the proposed studies will provide an enhanced model of glioma hierarchy and inform the development of novel clinical trials."
"9353961","PROEJCT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African Americans (AAs) continue to have the highest incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer among all racial and ethnicity groups. To what extent differences in tumor biology contribute to the striking racial disparities remain largely unknown. Our team has recently completed the first genome-wide analysis of the mutational landscape of colorectal cancers specifically arising in AAs. This landmark study has identified a novel 15-gene mutation signature showing an over 3-fold increased mutation rate in AA colorectal cancers, and shown that 41% of AA colorectal cancers have somatic mutations in at least one of the 15 genes, which is significantly different from colorectal cancers derived from Caucasians. Furthermore, 14% of AA colorectal cancers harbor mutations seen exclusively in AAs, most prominently including the ephrin type A receptor 6 gene [EPHA6]. We further identified that these mutations convey a poor prognostic outcome in AA colorectal cancer patients. Building upon these discoveries, the current proposal tests our central hypothesis that inherent biological differences may in part be responsible for the disparate burden of colorectal cancer in AAs. In particular, we propose to: (Aim 1) validate and establish a novel mutation subtype of colorectal cancer arising from African ancestry genome and define the role of these mutations in AA colorectal cancer progression; (Aim 2) elucidate the clinical and etiological significance of the mutation signature in AA colorectal cancer; and (Aim 3) to define the functionality of AA colorectal cancer-derived EPHA6 mutations. The highly translational aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished by re-sequencing the 15-gene mutations in a large independent set of AA colorectal cancer patients (in comparison with Caucasian patients) who have annotated clinical and epidemiological information. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 and cutting-edge organoid technologies in aim 3 to define the functional significance of EPHA6 mutations derived from AA colorectal cancers. Our study will generate novel insight into the biological basis for racial disparities in colorectal cancer and inform tailored prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in AA population."
"9345896","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in females with cancer. In 2013 approximately 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed, where an estimate of 39,620 was expected to succumb to their disease. It is estimated that one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Breast cancer is classified into subtypes based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The presence or absence of these molecular markers has been used to estimate clinical prognosis and to determine treatment response to current breast cancer therapies targeting these pathways. Despite these therapeutic advances, breast cancer patients that have undetectable ER, PR and HER2, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cannot benefit from these targeted treatments. Cytotoxic chemotherapy continues to be the primary treatment option for TNBC patients, which typically have poor prognosis and significantly lower overall survival when compared to patients that are ER and/or PR positive. Thus, there is a major unmet medical need to develop effective long-term therapies for resistant breast cancers, including TNBC.  Resistant tumors are able to survive and thrive in the hostile tumor microenvironment with low nutrients and oxygen by adapting to such toxic milieu through various survival mechanisms, such as sustained unfolded protein response (UPR) or persistent endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and autophagy. The hallmark of ERS is the enhanced expression of chaperone proteins that facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins, and as a result they promote anti-apoptotic mechanisms and enhance cancer cell survival. The overexpression of these chaperone proteins can also confer resistance towards cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, it is not surprising that tumor cells with chronic low level of ERS are able to survive and even thrive in inhospitable environments, including cytotoxic chemotherapy. This project is supported by our findings that even a small increase in the ER stress levels in tumor cells can surpass a certain threshold where it triggers apoptotic cell death specifically in tumor cells.  Based on our investigations of this novel concept, we identified a lead compound, which was shown to have efficacy and safety profile suitable to advance for human evaluation. This small molecule was found to be active in a wide range of cancers including, lung, brain, breast, and colon cancers, and was shown to be active alone and in combination with conventional chemotherapy in TNBCs.  This project will support the advancement of our lead compound towards clinical development. This will be accomplished by establishing the optimal dosage and frequency when used alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and by determining its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These efforts will set the stage for completing the preclinical studies of this promising compound, and will help advance it towards clinical studies for resistant breast cancers, including TNBC."
"9483080","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a K23 Mentored Career Development Award describes a program of training and research that will prepare the applicant, Marisa Toups MD, for a career as an independent investigator developing gene expression based biomarkers of immune dysfunction that advance personalized care for depression. The applicant's background in basic immunology research, clinical training, and record of successful productivity particularly suits this proposal to address the need for clinicia scientists working to understand and advance treatment of mood disorders. For successful career development, a comprehensive plan of training and research has been created - the Gene Expression to Expand Knowledge of Inflammatory Depression (GEEK-ID) project - with Dr. Madhukar Trivedi MD and Dr. Robert Danzter DVM, PhD, who serve as the primary mentors for the application. The training component of the GEEK-ID project has two primary aims. Aim 1 is to develop skills needed of an independent investigator performing successful clinical validation of biomarkers for personalized care. This aim builds hands-on skills and training will focus on genome wide gene expression as an experimental method. Training for Aim 1 covers three areas: 1) selection of appropriate study design and statistics for biomarkers trials 2) successful management of clinical operations and data collection, and 3) appropriate collection, processing, storage, and choice of assays for high quality biological data. Aim 2 is to gain knowledge of the functional role of the immune system in mood disorders and how it manifests in immune gene expression. Training will provide the foundational knowledge on which to base skills learned in aim 1. This training involves three areas of understanding: 1) mechanisms of innate immunity 2) mechanisms of communication between the brain and immune system and 3) knowledge of regulation of gene expression in the immune system. The proposed research is designed to identify and characterize a mechanistically distinct subtype of depression featuring innate immune activation. In a cross sectional design, 100 adults with MDD will be clinically phenotyped, and blood RNA sequencing will compare high C Reactive Protein (CRP) and low CRP subjects. It is hypothesized that the CRP associated gene expression pattern will match that of animal and human models of innate immune activation, stress response, and disordered mood. Pathways involved are Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, transcription factors Nuclear Factor- ?ß (Nf- ?ß) and CyclicAMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB), tryptophan metabolism, decreased glucocorticoid signaling and transcription and several others. It is hypothesized that subjects who show innate immune activation will display a depression symptom profile from RDoC domains related to mechanisms identified by the same models. This subgroup should display deficits in Approach Motivation, and Declarative (Hippocampal) Memory, and abnormalities in Circadian Rhythms and Sleep/Wake constructs within the domain of arousal."

"9353962","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased more than 6-fold in the past three decades while the prognosis has remained poor. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor of EAC. Endoscopy (EGD) is the current method to diagnose BE but because EGD is expensive and screening is not recommended very few EACs are detected in patients with pre-diagnosed BE. To make an impact on the prevention and early detection of EAC the challenge is to first develop an alternative method for identifying BE that is less costly and safer than EGD while being acceptable and accessible. The second step is to discover biomarkers that can effectively identify high grade dysplasia and early cancer. We have demonstrated that methylated Vimentin and other methylated biomarkers can detect BE in esophageal brushings. In addition, we have developed a panel of biomarkers (TP53 mutations, 4 methylated markers, and 2 linc-RNA markers) that sensitively and specifically identify EAC. Furthermore, the linc-RNAs in our marker panel also play a role in BE carcinogenesis. Thus, our aim is to ? 1) diagnose BE using methylated Vimentin (plus other biomarkers) testing with a novel esophageal sampling device; 2) validate our marker panel for detecting high grade dysplasia and cancer; and 3) determine the mechanism by which linc-RNAs promote the progression of BE to EAC. The results of this study will lead to an early detection strategy for EAC and improve our understanding of esophageal carcinogenesis."

"9208974","PROJECT SUMMARY: The amphibian embryo and in particular the frog Xenopus laevis is an outstanding model used by embryologist and cell biologist worldwide. This model system has led the discovery of axis formation (antero/posterior and dorso/ventral), tissue induction and nuclear reprograming among others. Advances in genome sequencing, proteomics and gene silencing have rejuvenated this model. In its most recent White Paper, the Xenopus community has identified a lack of adequate resource of antibody to study Xenopus proteins and proposed the production of such resources a priority. We propose to produce at least a hundred fully characterized monoclonal antibodies to transcription factors, cell surface proteins including signaling receptors and ligands as well as tissue specific markers. To achieve this goal we will immunize mice with both selected recombinant proteins expressed in mammalian cells and complex protein extracts isolated from Xenopus embryos. The recombinant protein targets will be selected by a steering committee composed of Xenopus investigators based on the importance of the proteins in developmental and diseases processes and the absence of cross-reactive commercial antibodies. From these immunizations we will produce and archive more than 10,000 clonal IgG-expressing hyrbidomas that will be screened by immunofluor- escence, whole mount immunostaining and immunoprecipitation to identify monoclonal anti-bodies to native proteins. Final characterization of monoclonal antibodies produced against the complex embryonic extracts will be performed by mass spectrometry followed by immuno-fluorescence on the recombinant putative target(s). These monoclonal antibodies, together with the characterization data will be freely distributed to the community via the developmental hybridoma study bank and Xenbase."
"9349486","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dysregulation of the immune system underlies many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In concert with the human genome, the intestinal microbiota regulate development and function of the immune system, modulating the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. A considerable body of evidence based on preclinical and clinical research suggests that gut microbes play a critical role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a family of idiopathic intestinal disorders with increasing prevalence and limited treatment options. Concordance rates of 30-40% among monozygotic twins implicate gene-environment interactions. Genome wide association studies have implicated roughly 200 susceptibility loci that are significantly associated with IBD. Many variants encode for genes involved in microbial recognition and immunity, suggesting host-microbe interactions may regulate the balance between immune health and inflammatory disease. Polymorphisms in genes of the autophagy pathway (e.g., ATG16L1), and in pattern recognition receptors that are associated with autophagy (e.g., NOD2), represent some of the most significant effect sizes in IBD susceptibility. Further, considerable research has focused on investigating the function of Atg16L1 and NOD2 in mouse models and human cells, and identified a role for both gene products in sensing and killing pathogenic microbes. Current understanding therefore suggest that IBD may be caused by mutations that impair immunity to pathogenic bacteria, leading to chronic exposure to microbial products that activates uncontrolled inflammation. Herein, I present new findings that beneficial gut bacteria such a Bacteroides fragilis require Atg16L1 and NOD2 to promote anti-inflammatory responses in mouse and human cells, and mice deleted in these genes are not protected from colitis by B. fragilis. I propose a novel, non-redundant role for genes previously implicated in recognition and killing of pathogenic bacteria?namely, mutations in genetic pathways linked to IBD result in defective recognition of beneficial molecules from the microbiome. My hypothesis is that genetic defects in Atg16L1 may lead to IBD by not `sensing' and responding to the protective signals of beneficial gut bacteria. I will test my hypothesis in three Specific Aims, which include: 1) defining the cellular pathway(s) required for immune regulation by B. fragilis; 2) Determining Atg16L1 mechanism of action during regulatory T cell induction by B. fragilis; 3) Establishing whether NOD2 is required for mediating the beneficial effects of B. fragilis in mouse and human systems. In other words, the absence of sensing and responding to anti-inflammatory bacterial signals may be a risk factor for chronic intestinal inflammation. The training (K99) phase of this award will be mentored by Dr. Sarkis Mazmanian, and will facilitate the transition of my research program towards an independent investigator (R00)."
"9237883","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death in the United States, is a heterogeneous syndrome. Comprehensive insight into COPD heterogeneity requires longitudinal data to elucidate the genetic, clinical, and radiographic determinants of disease progression. This proposal will extend the COPDGene Study by performing ten-year longitudinal follow-up visits on all available COPDGene subjects, with follow-up chest CT scans. The primary goals of COPDGene are: a) To identify new genetic loci that influence the development of COPD and COPD-related phenotypes; b) To reclassify COPD into subtypes that can ultimately be used to develop effective subtype-specific therapies; and c) To translate the findings in COPDGene to improve diagnostic and prognostic approaches to COPD in general clinical populations. The primary hypothesis for this renewal application is that extensive genetic and longitudinal phenotypic data in subjects with COPD or at risk for COPD will enable creation and validation of a new classification system for COPD with distinct diagnostic and prognostic implications. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate progression of COPD by completing a ten-year follow-up of all available subjects in the COPDGene cohort using clinical phenotyping and both quantitative and visual analysis of chest CT scans; 2) To use whole genome sequencing analysis on the COPDGene cohort to identify both rare and common genetic determinants of susceptibility and progression of disease in COPD subtypes and to create effective genetic risk scores for COPD; and 3) To translate COPDGene findings on COPD subtypes and genetics to general clinical populations by interaction with clinical Lung Cancer Screening Programs. It is anticipated that whole genome sequencing analysis will be completed on the entire COPDGene cohort through the TOPMed program. This data in combination with ten-year longitudinal clinical data and CT imaging data on the cohort is expected to enable identification of novel genetic associations for unique COPD subtypes. The long-term goal is to enable enhanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches for personalized therapy in COPD."
"9304532","Project summary / abstract: The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms of differential signaling among receptors important for the development of cancer, and to use this knowledge to design strategies to suppress malignant disease. Cancers often highjack the signaling logic of embryonic development for growth and metastasis and bypass natural regulatory controls. This allows receptors on cancer cells to remain in a perpetual ?on-state?. Current therapeutic approaches therefore attempt to prevent receptor activation by promoting non-signaling competent receptor ?off-states?. This, however, produces an enormous selective pressure that drives the rapid outgrowth of resistance. Recent findings suggest that receptors important for oncogenesis actually allow for diverse signaling outputs rather than just discrete on/off states ? functioning more like a rheostat than a digital convertor. This newly discovered property opens the possibility of actively `tuning' tumor signaling away from metastasis. This proposal investigates the mechanisms that control receptor signal bias in developmental and disease models using an array of techniques that span the relevant length and time scales necessary to reveal receptor and cellular signaling dynamics. My approach incorporates cutting-edge biophysical technologies (including cryo-EM and interferometry) that will help decipher the `logic' governing signal bias among oncogenic receptors. A quantitative and high-resolution view of the differential signaling process will provide important fundamental insight into cancer receptor biology and should open new avenues for the design of modulatory therapeutics that limit disease progression."

"9325029","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 25% of cytoplasmic tRNAs in eukaryotic organisms experience U34 modification at C5, and the modification is thought to be unique to the eukaryotic organisms. Lack of tRNA U34 modification has a disproportionately detrimental effect on translation of several important proteins, due to the encoding genes of which use biased codons that require the modified U34 in tRNAs for efficient translation. Genetic studies indicated that the Elongator complex is responsible for the early stages of the modification. The Elongator complex was initially isolated as part of hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. It has been shown to be involved in a variety of different cellular activities. Defects in the Elongator complex have been linked to several neurological diseases, such as familial dysautonomia (FD), rolandic epilepsy (RE), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although the Elongator complex also has been shown to possess histone acetylation activity, accumulating evidence in the literature indicates that tRNA U34 modification at C5 plays a major role in its cellular functions. The Elongator complex is a large macromolecular complex consisting of six subunits of the Elongator proteins, Elp1-6. The third subunit Elp3 is generally regarded as the catalytic subunit, but the mechanism how the Elongator complex carries out tRNA U34 modification at C5 is unknown. Through bioinformatic analysis, we found that the catalytic subunit Elp3, but not other subunits of the eukaryotic Elongator complex, is present in most archaea, a small number of bacteria, and two viruses. Based on this and other bioinformatic analyses, we propose that, unlike tRNA U34 modification in eukaryotic organisms that requires all six subunits of the Elongator complex, Elp3 alone is sufficient for the same modification reaction in archaea and bacteria. Therefore, archaeal or bacterial Elp3 provides us a simplified platform for the study of the mechanism of tRNA U34 modification at C5. In this application, we will utilize expertise from four laboratories to carry out research with three specific aims. First, we will provide the evidence that Elp3 is involved in tRNA U34 modification at C5 in archaea and bacteria by characterizing the modified U34 in tRNAs isolated from these species. Second, we will perform in vitro reconstitution of tRNA U34 modification at C5 using the recombinant archaeal Elp3 and the Elongator complex isolated from yeast cells. Third, we will carry out structural studies of Elp3 alone as well as in complex with tRNA. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the structure and function of the eukaryotic Elongator complex, which, while maintaining the main and evolutionarily ancient function of tRNA U34 modification at C5, may have acquired additional biochemical functions over the course of evolution by recruiting Elp1-2 and Elp4-6."

Our application is responsive to the 2012 NICHD Scientific Vision report, which identified population dynamics as one of seven priority research areas and argued that advances in knowledge in this area starts with understanding the rapid and profound changes shaping families in the United States and around the world. This includes understanding how biological, social, and other environmental factors, in concert with population dynamics, influence the health and well-being of mothers, fathers, children, families, communities, and societies (p. 19). The proposal builds on a 21 year tradition of annual symposia that have been co-organized by faculty members from the departments of Sociology and Human Development and Family Studies, and with financial support from Penn State's Population Research Institute and Social Science Research Institute as well as numerous other Penn State departments and centers, as relevant for particular symposium topics, and the NICHD. Aims of this application are: (1) to promote dialogue that stimulates and advances novel interdisciplinary and translational research on family issues; (2) to promote scholarly excellence in basic and translational research on families; and (3) to identify and address significant, emerging issues in the field of family studies that have not yet received substantial attention by scholars or been the focus of other conferences and meetings and wherein knowledge can be advanced by interdisciplinary and translational research. To address these aims, the symposium series is designed to foster discussion among scholars whose work ranges from more basic to more applied and who might not otherwise find opportunities for exchange, to produce a book series for broad dissemination of the symposium's knowledge contributions, and to engage junior scholars--the next generation of family researchers."
"9407964","ABSTRACT Significance: With overall prevalence of ~1:5-7000 live births, lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) as a class are one of the most common childhood diseases. LSD are caused by lysosomal dysfunction, mainly due to lysosomal enzyme mutations, and are usually fatal in the first two decades of life. CNS pathology is present in ~75% of LSD, however, currently marketed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is not effective for LSD with significant CNS pathology because negligible enzyme levels are achieved in brain at therapeutic serum concentrations of enzyme. Inefficient enzyme uptake in somatic tissues, neutralizing antibody development, poor cost-effectiveness, and weekly IV infusions are other suboptimal attributes. Hunter Syndrome, caused by X-linked iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) mutations in 1:100,000 male births, is associated with severe neuropathology and broad somatic tissue pathology. Elaprase®, human recombinant I2S, does not address CNS pathology yet is offered to all patients and has sales approaching $600M yearly. Intrathecal I2S is currently in development. Innovation: NeuroNano Pharma proposes to develop an innovative polymer- based nanoparticle formulation of I2S which will be delivered subcutaneously to achieve therapeutic brain levels of I2S. This product will have a transformative impact on Hunter Syndrome patients and, by extension, holds promise for application of the technology to other LSD caused by enzyme mutations. Approach: Preliminary data from Dr. Alexander Kabanov?s laboratory with PICs containing enzymes shows that brain delivery, protection from antibody response, and negligible toxicity can be achieved with these formulations. After expression and purification at the UNC Center for Structural Biology, I2S will be incorporated into nanoscale core-shell polyion complexes (PICs) which form spontaneously in aqueous conditions via electrostatic interactions upon mixing of the anionic enzyme with a copolymer consisting of a cationic block and a hydrophilic nonionic block. Dr. Kabanov and Dr. Judy Riffle, experts in this field, will serve as consultants. I2S PIC formulations will be characterized with respect to physicochemical properties, enzyme activity, cytotoxicity, lysosome localization and brain levels. Two formulations will be selected for full pharmacokinetic characterization by Dr. William Banks (VA Puget Sound Health Care System), a blood brain barrier expert. In addition to its own laboratory facilities, NNP has access to all necessary equipment through the UNC Nanomedicines Characterization Core Facility. Expected Results: An optimized I2S PIC will be identified that will achieve at least a five-fold increase of I2S in brain parenchyma and lysosomes compared to free I2S and at least 50% serum bioavailability after SC injection. Extended serum t1/2 and broad somatic tissue uptake compared to free I2S is also desirable. In phase II, the I2S PIC will be tested in I2S knockout mice to demonstrate enhanced enzyme activity in the brain, efficacy against neuropathology, and protection from immune response. An optimized I2S PIC will be scaled up and tested in pre-IND GLP toxicology."
"9512017","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Most membrane fusion reactions in eukaryotic cells are executed by membrane-bridging SNARE complexes. The formation of these complexes generally requires that four different SNARE proteins, anchored in two different membranes, undergo a coupled folding and assembly reaction during which the SNARE motifs zipper up into a parallel four-helix bundle. This complicated process is inefficient in vitro, and is certain to be even more challenging in vivo, where it must compete with the formation of various non-cognate and off-pathway SNARE complexes. Consequently, we hypothesize that most SNARE complex assembly reactions in the cell are orchestrated by a set of `topologically aware' chaperones called multisubunit tethering complexes (MTCs). These highly-conserved nanomachines interact directly with virtually all of the proteins (including the SNAREs) implicated in membrane tethering and fusion. We furthermore propose that the key task of catalyzing four-helix bundle formation falls to the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, working together with ? and sometimes as integral subunits of ? the MTCs. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to achieve an improved structural and mechanistic understanding of MTC and SM function in the assembly of fusogenic SNARE complexes. In Aim 1, we will conduct structural studies of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, a well-studied MTC required for fusion at late endosomes and lysosomes/vacuoles. High-resolution cryo- electron microscopy will be used to elucidate the structure of the HOPS complex. In order to elucidate how HOPS organizes SNAREs for assembly, we will also determine crystal structures of complexes between HOPS subunits and SNARE N-terminal regulatory domains. These structures will then serve as blueprints for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the detailed mechanism by which a subunit of the HOPS complex, the SM protein Vps33, catalyzes SNARE assembly. These studies will encompass fluorescence-based biochemical assays, crystal structures of SNARE assembly intermediates, reconstituted proteoliposome-based fusion assays, and single-molecule optical tweezers experiments. In Aim 3, we will expand these studies to other SM proteins, using the same suite of experimental approaches to test the generality of our Vps33-derived mechanistic model. These experiments will also afford us an opportunity to evaluate the extent to which the catalytic activity of SM proteins is under regulatory control. Finally, in Aim 4, we will turn our attention to the simplest known MTC, the Dsl1 complex. Using X-ray crystallography and in vivo imaging, we will rigorously test the role of the Dsl1 complex in vesicle tethering and tethering-triggered vesicle uncoating."
"9528082","Project Summary / Abstract Major trends in health and healthcare make a significant investment in training public and population health informatics (PHI) researchers particularly compelling. These trends include (1) the increasing realization of the importance of social, environmental, and behavioral factors as determinants of human health; (2) the requirement to train experts who can support local, state, and federal health agencies with informatics research and development; and (3) the urgent need to help the healthcare system develop capacity in community and population health management, as well as data analytics, to help it transition to a model emphasizing prevention and wellness rather than intervention. Therefore we propose a multi-disciplinary training program in PHI. Through access to unparalleled population-level data, education in population health and informatics methods, and experiences working on a broad range of innovative PHI research projects, we will help trainees become independent scientists capable of designing, developing, implementing and evaluating advanced information systems in clinical and public health settings. Our program will incrementally grow from an initial set of 12 trainees (6 predoctoral, 6 postdoctoral) to 17 total trainees (9 predoctoral, 8 postdoctoral) in the fifth year. Predoctoral trainees will complete a doctoral degree in either Epidemiology or Health Policy & Management, with a concentration in PHI. Postdoctoral trainees will complete their MPH with a concentration in PHI. Furthermore, expert faculty will actively mentor trainees in hands-on research in areas such as health information exchange (HIE), detection of notifiable diseases from HIE data streams, rapid identification and notification of emerging health threats (syndromic surveillance), HIE- based computer-based decision support to improve primary care, and informatics methods to help improve chronic pain care and prevent prescription drug abuse. Research experiences will include both retrospective, observational studies involving health data from multiple health systems, as well as prospective experiences involving a local health system partner. Trainees will also complete a broad set of workshops and seminars that will equip them with knowledge and skills essential to BMI research, such as the responsible conduct of research, team science, and research ethics. Building upon a strong legacy of research and educational collaborations, we will successfully train a cadre of researchers capable of leading the design, development and evaluation of next generation PHI systems. Collectively our faculty and trainees will work on research that can be translated to public health agencies and health care delivery systems to transform care delivery as well as outcomes."
"9397672","Project summary Meniscus injuries are extremely common with approximately one million patients undergoing treatment annually in the U.S. alone. Importantly, meniscal disorders inevitably lead to osteoarthritis (OA), which is the leading cause of disability in this country. As a multiphase fibrocartilage, the outer third of meniscus is a vascularized and collagen-rich fibrous tissue with fibroblast-like cells, whereas the inner third is avascular cartilaginous tissue with rounded chondrocyte-like cells. The middle zone is intermediate fibrocartilaginous tissue with a mixture of fibroblast-like cells and chondrocyte-like cells. Upon injury or defect, the outer zone of meniscus can reliably be repaired and expected to functionally heal. However, tears in the inner avascular region are hard to heal due to poor intrinsic healing capacity based on its highly differentiated cell type, specialized extracellular matrix and lack of blood supply. Despite many attempts to induce functional healing of avascular meniscus, no therapy currently exists that reliably results in seamless healing of inner-zone meniscus tears. Although delivery of stem/progenitor cells showed promise for improved avascular meniscus repair, cell delivery-based approaches have suffered from several translational barriers. Our preliminary study produced novel data showing that meniscus tears in the avascular zone can be healed by timely controlled recruitment and step-wise fibrochondrogenic differentiation of synovial mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs). The recruitment and step-wise differentiation was successfully regulated by a single injection of CTGF-loaded bio-glue mixed with PLGA µS-encapsulating TGF?3. Accordingly, the overall objective of the proposed projects is to establish a novel and efficient clinically relevant strategy for seamless healing of avascular meniscus tears by recruiting endogenous stem/progenitor cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that temporal control of stem cell recruitment into bio-glue and step-wise fibrocartilaginous differentiation leads to seamless healing of avascular meniscus tears. We here propose 1) to determine effective compositions of an injectable and adhesive hydrogel to guide avascular meniscus healing, 2) to determine effective doses and release rates of growth factors to enhance avascular meniscus healing in vitro, and 3) to enhance avascular meniscus healing by endogenous stem/progenitor cells in vivo. The expected outcome of the proposed studies will serve as an important foundation to develop a translational tool to improve treatment for avascular meniscus tears and defects, thus benefiting millions of patients with meniscus injuries and in turn lowering the incidence of osteoarthritis."

"9386596","Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc."
"9396357","Project Abstract Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, oxidative cell death pathway implicated in tumor suppression and pathological cell death. This process is biochemically distinct from apoptosis, classic necrosis and iron overload-induced cell death. How ferroptosis is regulated at the molecular level is poorly understood. Guided by preliminary data, this research will test the hypotheses that ferroptosis is regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and neutral lipid synthesis. Moreover, imaging studies using existing and newly discovered antioxidant inhibitors of ferroptosis will pinpoint the cellular sites of lethal iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during ferroptosis and examine how this accumulation is affected by mTOR signaling and neutral lipid synthesis. These studies will be performed in human cells with the aid of a novel time-lapse cell death imaging system and techniques drawn from chemical biology, genetics and biochemistry. This research will advance the understanding of ferroptosis at the molecular and cellular levels and lay the foundation for future in vivo studies of this poorly understood cell death process."
"9334295","PROJECT SUMMARY The Community Engagement (CE) Core's overarching goal is to close the gap between HIV prevention science and practice, domestically and internationally, in order to support the mission of CAPS, further the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and meet the objectives outlined in UNAIDS 90-90-90. Recent innovations in HIV prevention have not yet reached their full potential to help end the HIV epidemic, especially among disproportionately burdened populations. A key factor to closing the gap between research and practice is community engagement. The CE process allows scientists to share HIV prevention research with the community and communities to share their own wisdom and experiences to help guide the science. CE practices may especially influence the ability to reduce disparities in HIV, as they can help build trust with communities and enhance communication between researchers and community members?especially with communities that have been historically distrustful of research. The aims of the Core are to (1) facilitate domestic and international communities' access to and use of CAPS' HIV prevention research; (2) support CAPS scientists' use of community expertise; and (3) support domestic and international community-engaged research that is participatory, cooperative, collaborative, sustainable, and equitable. The CE core will facilitate the Center's mission to end the HIV epidemic and associated health and social disparities by bringing community voices and perspectives into HIV prevention research and improving the dissemination of HIV prevention science into the community?especially into communities disproportionately impacted by HIV. The core will support the effective translation of research into practice and will facilitate linkages and connection between the community and CAPS scientists. The core will continue to innovate and build on its strong record of support for community-engaged research, reflecting its commitment to bidirectional approaches involving exchange between CAPS and communities, while also expanding its focus on enhanced and innovative approaches to promote the new treatment and prevention technologies that have been developed and need to be implemented."
"9486382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen substantial discoveries of genetic determinants of disease risk and drug response, along with staggering technological advances in genotyping, leading to the expectation that an individual's personal genome will eventually be part of their medical record, to guide care decisions across their lifespan. However, despite these advances, there has been minimal translation of this information to clinical practice. We recently launched a genomic medicine program at the University of Florida and Shands Hospital (the UF&Shands Personalized Medicine Program (PMP)), which seeks to advance the clinical utilization of genomic information to optimize patient care. Our program is built on three guiding principles. 1) There is a regulatory body that evaluates the literature to determine when the level of evidence is sufficient to warrant clinical implementation, and when this occurs, develops specific recommendations regarding use of the genetic information; 2) the most efficient manner of implementation is through a broad, pre-emptive genotyping chip, such that information can be generated once, and used across the patient's lifespan; 3) the program must be supported through specific informatics clinical decision support within the electronic medical record so the clinician receives clear recommendations to guide use of the genetic information. The UF&Shands PMP is currently focused on a pharmacogenetic example, but we have built the program for wider translation of pharmacogenetics and genetics findings into clinical practice. During the past year we established the institutional infrastructure necessary t support the PMP, and are now poised to expand the program, and use our experiences to implement similar programs in large, private health systems, and community healthcare settings. Our specific aims are to: Specific Aim 1. Expand and assess the impact of the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic information to guide treatment decisions at UF&Shands through expansion to broader patient populations and to additional drug-genotype combinations on which clinical decisions are based. Specific Aim 2. Implement and assess the PMP at diverse institutions outside the UF&Shands Health System, including a) the Orlando Health Heart Institute, a private cardiology group practice that is part Orlando Health, a large, private health system, and, b) a small community hospital through the Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine practice network. Specific Aim 3. To insure appropriate levels of knowledge about genomic medicine, develop and implement innovative genomic medicine educational programs for: 3a. physicians and other health-care providers; 3b. health professions students; and 3c. patients. Implementation of genomic medicine into patient care has the potential to substantially improve outcomes of patients. Achieving these goals requires development and implementation of successful approaches for incorporation of genomic information into existing, complex healthcare systems, and documenting benefit of genomic medicine, each of which are addressed by our proposed aims."
"9356589","Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus. Outbreaks across Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific have been reported over the past 10 years and case reports of associated Guillain-Barré syndrome have suggested that these virus strains may have pathological effects on neural tissue. The most recent migration of Zika into South and Central America has rapidly expanded the area of virus transmission. In addition, more than 400 cases have been reported in the US since late 2015, a number that continues to increase. This rise in transmission is of critical concern since infection with ZIKV during pregnancy is thought to lead to microcephaly and ocular abnormalities. It is still unknown how prenatal ZIKV brain infection leads to morphological abnormalities in the developing brain. Here we propose a multidisciplinary study using imaging, genetic fate mapping and in vivo neurodevelopmental approaches to study development of the murine neocortex in a precise and quantitative fashion. Our recent studies demonstrate that these techniques robustly measure critical cellular and molecular processes of fetal brain growth and function. We will leverage this expertise in collaboration with virus experts to determine the consequences of ZIKV infection on the developing brain in a model of known ZIKV susceptibility. We will determine which cells are most vulnerable to ZIKV and how infection of these cells translates to abnormal brain growth and intellectual disability."
"9342903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide, over 285 million people are visually impaired, and 39 million of those are blind. Visual impairments (blindness and low vision) severely and negatively impact the quality of life. New sight-restoration treatments have arrived for some blinding diseases. An electronic retinal prosthesis is approved for sight restoration in advanced retinitis pigmentosa. Gene therapy trials have shown promise for Leber's congenital amaurosis. Stem cell treatments for age-related macular degeneration are starting clinical trials. In some cases, remarkable results have been demonstrated, suggesting that at least partial vision restoration is possible after prolonged blindness. However, psychophysical data from clinical trials often show large variance in outcomes.  Preconditions in brain structure and function associated with the central visual pathway (CVP) may underlie some of the variance. The effect of complete blindness upon the brain is well studied, but most ophthalmologic disease produces effects that vary from point-to-point across the retina. How does the precise topography of eye disease map onto changes in brain? Is acquired retinal damage related to local effects upon the structure and function of the CVP? Are any of these effects of vision loss on the CVP reversible? We propose to answer these questions, which we believe are crucial to the on-going efforts in developing sight- restoration treatments, by combining advanced retinal imaging with the brain-mapping techniques developed in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), using novel yet robust analytical methods. We will reveal the relationships between retinal pathology and their downstream impact on the CVP in unprecedented detail over the natural courses of blinding diseases and their treatments.  We will make available to the research community the raw and processed data on retinal pathology for a range of blinding diseases, along with neuroimaging data collected with the HCP protocol. We will provide the computer codes used to extract relevant features from the retinal and neural datasets and the statistical models that relate the two. The extensive datasets and the associated data-analysis tools will form a transformative foundation for studies of neural plasticity associated with visual impairments and sight restoration."
"9542942","Emerging evidence suggests a central role for dendritic cells (DCs) in inducing immune tolerance. Our recent research has provided critical new insights into the molecular mechanisms that ?program? DCs to induce tolerogenic responses. In particular, we have observed an unappreciated intersection between the ancient nutrient-sensing pathway, involving the amino acid sensing molecule GCN2, and control of inflammation in the gut. Given the central role of GCN2 as a sensor of amino acid starvation, we explored its? potential role in the intestine, and observed its remarkable effects on modulating the functions of intestinal DCs and epithelial cells to control inflammation in the gut. In this context the goal of the research proposed here is to determine the mechanisms by which GCN2 and this stress response pathway regulate gut inflammation. Aim 1: To determine the mechanism by which the GCN2-eIF2? pathway regulates intestinal immunity and inflammation. Our preliminary data demonstrates that GCN2-/- mice display enhanced susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and strikingly enhanced Th17 responses. Here we will explore the effects of conditional ablation of GCN2 expression in DCs versus intestinal epithelial cells, and whether these effects are dependent on down the downstream kinase eIF2?. Aim 2: To determine the cause and consequence of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in GCN2 deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that GCN2-/- mice have enhanced intestinal inflammation and elevated levels of ROS in gut DCs and epithelial cells. In this aim we propose to determine the cause and consequence of excess ROS production in the GCN2-/- mice. Aim 3: To determine the mechanism by which GCN2 suppresses inflammasome activation. Finally, our preliminary data demonstrates increased inflammasome activation in gut DCs and epithelial cells in GCN2-/- mice. In this aim, we will determine whether this inflammasome activation is essential for enhanced intestinal inflammation and Th17 responses. The successful completion of these aims will provide new mechanistic insights into how this stress response pathway controls intestinal inflammation, and provide new therapeutic strategies against autoimmunity."

"9322372","Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are clearly the basis of ANCA glomerulonephritis (GN); however, the fundamental immune defects that lead to pathologic ANCA production are still incompletely understood. This project seeks to understand how dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune response promotes human ANCA glomerulonephritis. Understanding these fundamental mechanisms underlying the development of ANCA will allow for the development of mechanism-based therapies and potentially antigen- specific tolerance regimens to avert disease onset (prevention) and relapse. This project will take advantage of a longitudinal ANCA disease cohort, as well as the Department of Defense repository which includes sera obtained before disease onset, to define these pathogenic mechanisms. Aim 1 will utilize mass spectrometry methods to decipher the epitope specificity of patients' autoantibodies before disease onset, during disease remission and relapse, with the ultimate goal of defining the inciting, or at least immunodominant, epitope of disease onset and relapse. Knowledge and understanding of such epitopes will provide a basis for antigen- specific prevention of disease. Aim 2 builds upon the recent identification of a distinct population of T cells that is pro-inflammatory and resistant to regulation in ANCA GN patients. These studies will fully interrogate these cells' transcriptomic profile, autoreactive nature and genetic underpinnings. The potential for targeting this population with antibody-based therapies will also be determined. In Aim 3, a population of CD33+ myeloid cells with potential capacity for T cell immunoregulation will be explored. This cell population is unexpectedly expanded in ANCA GN, have a ?granulocytic? phenotype, and express ANCA antigens (MPO and PR3). Is it possible that ANCA bind CD33+ myeloid cells and subvert their suppressive potential? These objectives, when taken together, begin to answer one of the most common questions pertaining to autoimmune diseases: What causes or incites the disease? Results from the proposed objectives can inform; 1) inciting autoantigenic epitopes?are they a consequence of environmental exposures or infections?; 2) what is the phenotype of autoreactive T cells?can these cells be removed from circulation?; 3) what is the underlying genetic and transcriptomic profile of a specific pro-inflammatory T cell population?; 4) how does altered glycation of autoantibodies affect binding to downstream immunologic targets?; and 5) how do ANCA functionally alter the CD33+ myeloid population? Answers to these questions will provide the needed insight and tools to enforce immune tolerance, to provide biomarkers for disease activity and to inform predisposing factors related to disease development. Not only can these studies alter the current knowledge and treatment of ANCA glomerulonephritis, but have far-reaching impacts to numerous other autoimmune diseases."
"9343079","Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a complex entity from a research and training perspective. The disorder affects a wide variety of neurological systems including cognitive, emotional, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and lower motor neuron systems. The complex nature of FTLD requires that clinical researchers be familiar with techniques from many areas of clinical neuroscience, including the assessment of semantic processing and socioemotional function using measures like personality inventories and emotion knowledge tests, the assessment of unusual movement disorders including subtle changes in control of eye movement and the assessment of motor neuron function. In addition, imaging techniques relevant to FTLD include PET scanning using several ligands and multiple types of MRI sequences including Tl-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion MRI and functional MRI. Also mutations are relatively frequent as a cause for FTLD. Because of this, FTLD clinical researchers need to understand the complex ethical issues surrounding genetic testing, and how this affects the ability of family members to participate in research and the well-being of research participants. The FTLDCRC will provide an excellent opportunity for trainees to explore these issues in the context of a large multicenter network doing longitudinal assessment of FTLD in a manner similar to clinical trials. The FTLDCRC investigators have a wealth of experience in employing these techniques and in training emerging researchers to use them. They have been leaders in developing methods for diagnosing FTLD and tracking progression of FTLD in clinical trials.

"9536991","Project Abstract Disorders involving social behaviors such as autism spectrum disorder are increasingly prevalent, yet the pathophysiological bases for these conditions elude researchers and current treatments are woefully inadequate. The insular cortex and the neuropeptide oxytocin are highly implicated in both normal and pathological social affective processes such as empathy. Importantly, the oxytocin receptor is concentrated in the insular cortex, providing a link between these neural systems. Using a simple test of social affect in rat, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to determine the contribution and interaction of these systems in primitive, empathy-like processes. We hypothesize that social affective behavior in rodents involves axonal release of oxytocin acting at insular cortex oxytocin receptors and communication between the insula and other nodes in the social emotional circuit, namely the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We seek to test this hypothesis in a number of ways. First, we will determine if insular cortex oxytocin receptors are necessary to social affective behavior using behavioral pharmacology and chemogenetics, quantify socially evoked oxytocin release within insula using in vivo microdialysis, identify the consequences of OT on the intrinsic excitability of prefrontal cortex-projecting insular pyramidal neurons and a generate a functional map of neuronal activation resulting from social affect using immunohistochemistry. Next we will chemogenetically manipulate the oxytocinergic input to the insula to determine if axonal release of oxytocin is sufficient to modulate social behaviors. Finally, we will utilize a multi-site, pathway specific chemogenetic strategy to dissect the contribution of insular cortex outputs to the prefrontal cortex in social affect, and their dependency on oxytocin. The expected contribution of this work will be to link release of oxytocin and action at insular cortex oxytocin receptors to social affective behaviors, via modulation of the insular cortex output to the prefrontal cortex. This work can have a transformative impact on our understanding of fundamental social behaviors, inform the development of new treatments of social disorders, and provide mechanistic support for theoretical models of the social brain."
"9349362","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technologies over the past decade have transformed scientists' ability to read the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of all living organisms, illuminating the genetic architecture and dynamics of biological systems. Establishing causal linkages between observed genetic changes to cellular function, however, requires the ability to control or modulate endogenous genetic sequences or epigenetic states. DNA engineering technologies enable researchers to dissect the function of specific genetic elements or correct disease-causing mutations. However, simple and scalable tools to study and manipulate RNA lag significantly behind their DNA counterparts. The proposed work will focus on developing a heterologous RNA-binding system in eukaryotic cells for the direct and specific perturbation of endogenous transcripts. Analogous to programmable DNA-binding systems such as TAL effectors or CRISPR-Cas9, such RNA targeting technologies would enable diverse applications in addition to RNA knockdown, from translational regulation and allele discrimination, to transcript splicing, trafficking, and visualization. Cas9 nucleases from type II CRISPR systems have been recently implicated in non-canonical gene regulatory functions beyond their prototypical role in adaptive immunity as DNA nucleases. Cas9 is typically guided to specific locations within the complex mammalian genome by a short RNA search string that has direct complementarity to a DNA target. However, some CRISPR-associated small RNAs have been demonstrated to serve as alternative guide RNAs that target endogenous transcripts instead of DNA. During the initial stage of the proposed work, the interactions of an RNA-regulating Cas9 complex with its endogenous target mRNA will be studied through biochemical reconstitution and characterization. Following heterologous expression in mammalian cells, computational modeling and systematic mutagenesis will be applied to understand the binding rules dictating ribonucleoprotein complex formation. This will inform reprogramming of the transcript targeting specificity. To exemplify the utility of these tools, the technology will be applied to study the rle of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of melanoma drug resistance. lncRNAs have diverse roles in regulating gene expression and have been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of cancer, yet little is known about their function in cancer drug resistance. To facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for combination melanoma therapy, a systematic pooled screen will be conducted to discover lncRNAs involved in melanoma resistance to BRAF-inhibitor therapy. The proposed platform technology development and high-throughput screening approach will enable the systematic discovery and functional interrogation of lncRNA-mediated biological processes, and can be generalized to study the biological mechanisms of transcriptional networks and therapeutic applications thereof."
"9346666","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural circuits form the basis of all interactions with the outside world as well as internal thoughts. Specifically, the neural circuits used in sensory processing are critical for perception and understanding of the external environment. This research seeks to determine the synaptic and cellular underpinnings of multisensory processing, commonly referred to as multisensory integration, and to understand the development of the neural circuits involved in multisensory integration. Much is already known about the behavioral outcomes and the psychophysical properties of multisensory tasks and the underlying neuronal activity, but a detailed cellular description of this process is lacking. This research will fill a wide gap in our understanding of the synaptic and circuit level mechanisms underlying the development of neural circuits mediating multisensory processing in the vertebrate brain.  Multisensory integration may underlie several brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and sensory processing disorders. This research will provide baseline information on the synaptic, cellular and neural network events underlying development of sensory integration and lay the foundation for future work that is disorder-specific. The tadpole preparation allows easy access to the developing larvae, which provides simple and robust disorder-relevant manipulations. Since this research will further our understanding of the neural circuitry, future research will build upon this work to understand the underlying synaptic and cellular mechanisms of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.  The model organism used in this proposal, Xenopus laevis tadpoles, provides a few unique advantages over other species. First, the experimental preparation contains the intact neural circuitry for multisensory integration, including the sensory organs, allowing the examination of a complete circuit with multiple techniques. Second, the small size and ease of breeding provides the resources to analyze a phenomenon at multiple levels, including single cell electrophysiology, network calcium imaging, behavioral assays, environmental manipulations, and computational modeling.  This proposal has two specific aims that will address the questions underlying the development of the neural circuitry underlying multisensory integration. Aim 1. Assessment of cellular properties of multisensory integration. These experiments will focus on the roles of NMDA type glutamate receptors and dendritic integration on multisensory processing, as well as plasticity at different developmental stages. Aim 2. Understand the functional development of multisensory integration. These experiments will assess multisensory plasticity using long term multisensory experience manipulation and network calcium imaging."
"9476732","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of death in the United States. Ischemic preconditioning is one of the most beneficial interventions to protect the heart from MI, though a precise target and therefore a specific therapeutic approach to produce preconditioning and prevent MI are not known. To address these gaps in knowledge, our prior grant application hypothesized that IPC-mediated modulation of caveolin, a scaffolding protein found in lipid raft membrane microdomains (caveolae), is critical for coupling the sarcolemma to mitochondria and the regulation of mitochondrial function and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Caveolin can protect the heart from ischemic damage: IPC-induced transfer of caveolin to mitochondria leads to stabilization of mitochondrial structure and function. We find that this mechanism is a general one: it occurs in C. elegans and cancer. Specific targeting of caveolin to mitochondria replicates this IPC-like effect but mice that lack cardiac caveolin cannot be preconditioned. Such data strongly implicate the importance of caveolin in plasma membrane-mitochondria communication and in IPC. However, the precise mechanisms by which caveolin stabilizes the ischemic myocardium are not known. Cellular membranes are dynamic entities that create barriers between two environments by their composition of proteins and lipids. In addition to the plasma membrane, the function of intracellular structures such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus and Golgi complex, derives in part from their membranes. I/R injury damages sarcolemmal membranes. Key benefits of IPC include its stabilization of sarcolemmal ultrastructure, preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced generation of ROS. Our finding that IPC can transfer plasma membrane caveolin to mitochondria suggests that caveolin regulates membrane function in these two compartments, and its increase in expression in mitochondria may be a critical mechanism for cellular adaptation to stress. We hypothesize that: The accumulation of caveolin in sarcolemmal and mitochondrial membranes following ischemic stress and in response to IPC increases membrane repair to limit injury and stabilize cellular function. Thus, enhancing caveolin expression and interaction with reparative processes will provide a therapeutic approach to treat ischemia-reperfusion injury. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis: Aim 1: Define the role of caveolin in sarcolemmal membrane repair during I/R injury.

The previous FDA Cooperative Agreement ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accreditation for State Food Testing Laboratories provided the opportunity for states to lay the foundation for the integrated system. Indiana responded by becoming one of the first non-accredited labs to achieve accreditation during the funding period. Continued funding through this FOA is critical to Indiana?s sustained growth towards participation in an integrated national food safety system. Through this funding ISDH Laboratories will continue to improve our QMS, share these improvements with our peers, and maintain our ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. It is the goal of the ISDH Laboratories to use this funding opportunity to enhance our accreditation to cover analysis of additional FDA regulated items and non-routine methods requested during foodborne outbreaks. These enhancements along with product expansion of the current Sample Collection and Analysis Project will provide a broad base of support for multiple programs and agencies within the State. Communication from these partners to their agency policymakers about the importance of having laboratory findings supported by ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for regulatory actions, will drive the changes necessary to incorporate funding for accreditation at the State level."
"9358363","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this highly-integrated and multi-disciplinary Center without Walls entitled ?Identifying genes and pathways that modulate tau toxicity in FTD?, we seek to discover novel genetic modifiers of tauopathy to provide unique insight into disease mechanisms, as well as support the development and validation of an innovative approach to measure tau burden in patients using plasma samples. Taking advantage of the genome sequencing data available from PSP patients, Project 1 will identify genetic variants that influence disease risk, and in collaboration with the Human Biology Validation Core determine how key variants are associated with tau burden. As a complementary but alternative approach to identify genetic modifiers, Project 2 will utilize the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mouse strains developed at Jax Labs to uncover genetic variants that determine sensitivity or resistance to AAV-induced tauopathy. Project 3 will investigate the hypothesis that assessment of plasma tau levels following the administration of anti-tau antibodies provides a sensitive and specific biomarker for tau aggregation in the brain, employing samples from both murine models of tauopathy as well as patients enrolled in ARTFL and LEFFTDS. Project 4 will construct a disease signature for FTD-tau and mine public databases and systems analyses to predict pharmacologic and/or genetic interventions to reverse the signature, as well as elucidate how genetic modifiers identified in Projects 1 and 2 impact tau metabolism and secretion. The four research projects will be supported by the Administrative Core (Core A), the Viral Production and Cloning Core (Core B), the Human Biology Validation Core (Core C), and the Data Coordination Core (Core D). We envision that at the conclusion of the funding period, we will have: (i) identified key genes that determine either sensitivity or resistance to tau-mediated neurodegeneration; (ii) developed a sensitive and specific blood-based biomarker for tau deposition in the brain; (iii) discovered novel therapeutic targets predicted to reverse the transcriptional signature that defines tau mutation carriers; and (iv) determined how tau mutations and genetic modifiers of tauopathy impact tau metabolism, protein homeostasis and cell viability. Therefore, our Center is uniquely poised to enable the identification of patient populations at risk, while simultaneously enhancing diagnostic capabilities and expanding therapeutic possibilities."
"9326587","Project Summary/Abstract  Environmental DNA damaging agents including natural radioisotopes in the soil, UV radiation from the sun, and chemical byproducts present in exhaust fumes constantly threaten the genomic integrity of a cell. Humans are regularly exposed to these environmental factors, and such exposure leads to various forms of DNA damage. When classical DNA repair mechanisms fail, regions of damaged DNA will persist in the genome. These lesions pose a major problem for replication machinery. The replication fork will stall at sites of DNA damage, putting the cell at risk for chromosomal rearrangements and double stranded breaks that often result in cell death. To prevent such catastrophic outcomes, the cell utilizes damage-bypass pathways that allow for continued DNA replication through regions of damage. This research focuses on one such pathway, error-free template switching.  Error-free template switching relies upon the activity of the Rad5 protein. Unlike other damage- tolerance pathways, Rad5 rearranges DNA in such a way that regions of damaged DNA are not used as a template during the replication process. As a result, while other damage-bypass pathways inaccurately add nucleotides across from sites of DNA damage (thus introducing disease-causing mutations), error-free template switching always leads to the incorporation of the intended nucleotide, thereby preventing the introduction of mutations.  The goal of this research is to understand the mechanism of Rad5 mediated DNA rearrangement in error-free template switching from biochemical and structural perspectives. First, the structure of the Rad5- DNA complex will be investigated. X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) will be used to study the structure of Rad5. The placement of Rad5 on DNA substrates will be investigated through a nuclease protection footprinting assay. Next, the rate of DNA unwinding, the step size, and processivity of Rad5 will be determined through kinetics assays. Finally, error-free template switching will be reconstituted in vitro, allowing the isolation of a key intermediate in this pathway. Overall, Rad5's role in error-free template switching will be clarified, providing insight into the way cells cope with harmful environmental agents."

"9341954","Project Summary  In 1984, we described two patients with Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis,  and Stroke-like Episodes.1 We proposed the acronym MELAS for this newly described distinctive  clinical entity, and speculated about maternal non-Mendelian inheritance, and a mitochondrial DNA  (mtDNA) mutation disturbing synthesis of proteins embedded in the respiratory chain. Six years later, Goto  and colleagues identified a point mutation in mtDNA (m.3243A>G) of MELAS patients.2 This mutation now  accounts for 80% of MELAS cases (commonly referred to as MELAS/3243). For two decades, our team  has conducted a long-term longitudinal study of MELAS/3243 patients, establishing a strong foundation in  terms of natural history, outcome measures, and biomarkers. However, since there are no clearly validated  biomarkers for predicting the risk of conversion, prodromal and mildly symptomatic family relatives  continue to live with the uncertainty of converting to the severe MELAS phenotype. This reality emphasizes  the need to expand our nascent observations about the natural history of MELAS and the predictive value  of brain biomarkers. Our strategies are based on (Specific Aim #1) the need to replicate, using 1H MRSI,  our highly promising, preliminary observations of abnormal levels of lactate, NAA, tCr and tCho, in 100  mutation carriers and 30 group-matched healthy control subjects, first at baseline and then again at 2-year  follow-up; (Specific Aim #2) the need to measure, using 31P MRSI in synchrony with 1H MRSI, brain  levels of (a) phosphocreatine (PCr) to complement and corroborate tCr levels, measured by 1H MRSI, as a  marker of cell energetics; b) ATP, to complement and corroborate the 1H MRSI measures of NAA and  lactate as indices of mitochondrial dysfunction; c) phosphomonoesters (PME) and phosphodiesters (PDE),  to complement and corroborate tCho levels, measured by 1H MRSI, as indices of membrane biosynthesis  and turnover, and (d) inorganic phosphate (Pi) as an index of intracellular pH; and (Specific Aim #3) the  need to measure temporally concordant levels of metabolite biomarkers in the plasma and urine  samples collected from all 130 participants. These three Aims will strengthen our earlier findings of  predictive neuroimaging biomarkers, inform us of brain mechanisms underlying metabolic and clinical  disturbances, and provide complementary plasma and urine metabolites that, if correlated with the brain  biomarkers, will serve as less expensive and more accessible biomarkers predicting risk of conversion to  the severe MELAS phenotype."
"9339320","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California at Los Angeles - Boston University Molecular Characterization Laboratory (UCLA- BU MCL) is a multidisciplinary, translational research program designed to enhance our understanding of the molecular, cellular and imaging features distinguishing indolent from aggressive lung cancers in screen- detected and non-screen-detected clinical settings. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has provided compelling evidence of the efficacy of lung cancer screening using low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) to reduce lung cancer mortality. The benefits of screening, however, must be reconciled with its potential harms, including high false positive rates and the potential for overdiagnosis. Our broad goal is to distinguish indolent from aggressive lesions by interrogating the molecular, microenvironment and imaging features that are associated with clinical outcomes. This global approach brings all aspects of these investigations to bear on our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of early stage lung cancer. These results will be translated to the clinical management of screen-detected lung cancer. Understanding the factors underlying tumor indolence or aggression that result in heterogeneous clinical outcomes will facilitate clinical decision making in the context of lung cancer screening, increase screening effectiveness and ultimately drive care pathways. We hypothesize that the pathways underlying heterogeneity in screen-detected lung cancers will be revealed by analysis of molecular (whole exome and mRNA sequencing), microenvironment (immune and inflammatory mediators) and imaging characteristics (semantic and quantitative features) of screen- detected lesions. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify molecular, cellular and imaging profiles that distinguish screen-detected from non-screen- detected lung cancers. Aim 2: Identify molecular, cellular and imaging profiles that distinguish screen-detected lung cancers with indolent versus aggressive clinical courses from the NLST. Aim 3: Confirm and refine molecular, cellular and imaging profiles that distinguish screen-detected lung cancers with indolent versus aggressive clinical courses from a prospectively collected screening cohort. Cases will derive from the NLST biorepository, DECAMP cohorts and a University of California (UC) state-wide initiative involving the five UC academic medical centers that are establishing a common screening policy and platform that involves the collection and archiving of clinical, imaging, and tissue specimens."
"9456911","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalent birth defects, affecting up to 1% of live births. While a genetic etiology is indicated by the finding of various syndromic forms of CHD, the genetic causes of CHD is still not well understood. As the genetic variability of the human population confounds human genetic analysis, we recently pursued a large scale ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in inbred C57BL6 mice to recover recessive mutations causing CHD. Phenotyping was conducted using noninvasive fetal echocardiography, an imaging modality used clinically for CHD diagnosis. From ultrasound scanning 100,000 fetuses, we recovered >250 CHD mutant mouse lines with a wide spectrum of CHD. We recovered 150 CHD causing mutations in 94 genes using whole exome sequencing analysis. Surprisingly, 50% of the CHD genes are cilia related, indicating a central role for cilia in CHD pathogenesis. Also unexpected was the recovery of many cilia related CHD genes encoding proteins known to physically interact, suggesting the hypothesis that CHD pathogenesis may occur via epistasis in the context of a CHD interactome network. This could contribute to the complex genetics associated with human CHD. To test this hypothesis, we plan to conduct a novel sensitized screen for the first systematic interrogation of the mouse genome for semi-dominant CHD mutations. The screen will be conducted using a driver mutation in Cep290, a cilia-CHD gene recovered in our recessive screen that is also clinically well described to exert genetic modifier effects, both in various human ciliopathies and in mutant mouse models. Our screen will entail ultrasound scanning G2 fetuses for CHD derived from females heterozygous for the Cep290 mutation mated to a G1 male heterozygous for ENU induced mutations. The resulting G2 offspring can only be double heterozygous for the Cep290 and ENU induced mutations (except when the ENU mutation is also in Cep290). Thus any CHD observed would reflect the effects of epistasis. Using this strategy, we expect to screen ~54,000 fetuses from 1800 G1 pedigrees, providing a systems approach to interrogate the role of cilia in the complex genetics of CHD not possible with a recessive screen. Mutation recovery will be carried out using whole mouse exome sequencing followed by genotyping analysis, and further linkage analysis conducted within and across multiple pedigrees. For validation of causal mutations identified in the screen, transgenic mouse models will be generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, followed by intercrosses with the Cep290 mutation to examine for evidence of epistasis. Overall, this novel sensitized screen will provide the first systematic interrogation of the mouse genome for semi-dominant mutations causing CHD. By using mutation in Cep290 as driver for this sensitized screen, we can further elucidate role of cilia in CHD pathogenesis. The mutations and animal models recovered in this sensitized screen will better model the complex genetics of human CHD and better inform future clinical studies interrogating the genetics etiology of CHD in the human population."
"9502591","?     DESCRIPTION, OVERALL (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CSIBD) is to promote and facilitate research that will yield insight into the causes and pathogenesis of IBD and lead to improved therapeutic approaches. This overarching objective remains unchanged since the inception of the CSIBD in 1991 and has guided the Center through substantial growth and expansion. The research base is made up of 111 scientists with $48.7 million in digestive disease-related research support. Organizing these investigators by areas of focus, we divide the CSIBD into six central themes. Our goal of understanding human IBD is accomplished using six entry points: (1) genetics, (2) microbial interactions, (3) barrier function and epithelial cell biology, (4) innate and adaptive immunity, (5) therapeutics, and (6) systems biology and signal transduction. Clinicians, scientists, and engineers are embedded in each theme. A central priority of the CSIBD is to bring together researchers from these various approaches and to provide an intellectual nexus for these individuals to find common interests in understanding and treating IBD. This is accomplished through several routes. First, the five biomedical cores offer state-of-the-art resources and expertise from leaders in (1) Human Genetics and Microbiome, (2) Immunology, (3) Morphology, and (4) Genetic Animal Models. In addition to offering guidance and access to technologies, core directors serve as connection points between investigators, facilitating collaborations. Similarly, the (5) Clinical Core aids the community through access to thousands of patient samples while serving as a hub for interactions between clinicians and basic researchers. Operating independently of these cores, the close relationship between the CSIBD and the Broad Institute allows further access to cutting-edge technologies. The overall specific aims of the CSIBD are to (1) promote research in basic science areas relevant to better understanding of mucosal immune function and epithelial biology in IBD; (2) advance our understanding of gut pathophysiology by examining the gut as a circuit: studying the core components of gut intra- and inter-cellular interactions that determine health and disease; (3) promote the study of the pathogenesis of IBD; (4) promote interactions among scientists exploring diverse fields that share relevance to IBD; (5) promote translational IBD research; (6) attract basic investigators to the study of IBD and mucosal immunology; and (7) provide an environment and mechanism to foster development of young investigators focused on IBD. A comprehensive Enrichment Program introduces new members to the IBD community and encourages face-to-face interactions between investigators from a range of fields. Attracting new members to the CSIBD and IBD research is also greatly facilitated through Pilot and Feasibility Program support, the success of which is reflected by 79% of recipients achieving external funding."
"9243375","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT: The overarching goal of this research is to develop an effective walking- based intervention that reduces disability and also maintains joint structure for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Walking disability leads to an increased risk of early death in people with knee OA. Furthermore, people with knee OA walk with movement patterns that overload the cartilage and may lead to rapid OA progression. Current gait retraining interventions use expensive devices, target a single joint, or focus on only reducing the knee adduction moment. Furthermore, these interventions may not address adherence, dissemination, and scalability, and may not utilize the ubiquity of mobile technology. This project proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative community based intervention (?Mind Your Walk?) that incorporates whole-body movement retraining based on biomechanical principles, along with mindful body-awareness skills, for people with knee OA. The goal is to use the results from this project to support the design of a larger randomized trial comparing this intervention with standard exercise programs. To achieve this goal, this project will focus on - 1) demonstrating feasibility of recruitment, adherence, and retention with the Mind Your Walk intervention, 2) quantifying the variability of biomechanical and functional outcomes, and 3) usability testing of a mobile health (mHealth) application for monitoring adherence and maintaining engagement for Mind Your Walk intervention. Subjects with radiographic and symptomatic knee OA (n=62) will participate in the feasibility study. Another group (n=10) will participate in usability testing of the mHealth application. The intervention will be delivered using community-based group sessions over 6-months. After that the subjects will practice on their own for another 6-months. The attention-matched control group will receive education on OA. In addition to feasibility data, knee loading during walking will be quantified using an EMG-Driven knee model and gait analyses at baseline and 6-months. Daily physical activity using accelerometers and self-reported pain will be recorded at baseline and every 3-months for a period of 1-year.  The principal investigator (PI) has expertise in rehabilitation, biomechanics, and applications of quantitative imaging. The PI's long-term goal is to lead an inter-disciplinary translational musculoskeletal research program in OA; that is focused on unraveling the biomechanical pathways underlying OA, and using this knowledge to develop targeted interventions. This award will enable the applicant to gain additional training in all aspects of clinical trials and use of mHealth technologies in knee OA. Additional training will focus on advanced biostatistics for clinical trials and longitudinal data, and on leadership and team science. The mentoring team comprises of established senior scientists in rheumatology, clinical trials, mobile health technologies, and biostatistics. The PI has strong Institutional support, and this project will accelerate the PI's transition to an independent investigator, and enable collection of critical data for design of the clinical trial."
"9336904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost all aspects of decisions made or actions performed are typically stochastic. There are five components to the planning of an action based on sensory information. First, the subject has prior information about the state of the environment, which can be summarized as a probability distribution across possible world states reflecting knowledge of where things are and what scenes one is likely to encounter. Second, the subject has sensory input about the current state of the environment, which is uncertain due to physical and neural noise. Third, these two sources of information are combined to decide on an intended action (button press, arm or eye movement, or a complex plan that includes responses to potential subsequent sensory inputs). Fourth, the resulting action can differ from the intended one due to motor noise. Finally, the interaction of the resulting action with the current environment leads to a consequence (a loss or gain), and this consequence may be uncertain as well. As a result of all these stochastic components, visual tasks and movement planning require calculations that are equivalent to decision-making under risk. In our recent work, we have demonstrated that humans are often nearly optimal in visuomotor tasks in that they maximize expected gain, although we have found other circumstances in which human behavior is suboptimal.  The tasks we perform every day are often new, never confronted before, or change from one attempt to the next, and thus require us to adapt to new circumstances. The aims of this proposal are unified by the study of learning in making decisions or actions under risk. We propose experiments to better understand the nature of human behavior in visual and visuomotor tasks, concentrating on how humans adapt to an uncertain and dynamic environment. We often use tasks with an experimenter-specified reward/penalty structure; this novel approach allows us to compare behavior with the optimal strategy that maximizes expected gain. We ask the following questions and propose experiments to address each. (1) How do observers select and adjust their decision criterion in tasks in which the statistics of the items to be discriminated are uncertain and possibly change over time? (2) When time is costly, how do observers decide when it is time to make a sensory decision, and when do they instead choose to gather more evidence before making that decision? (3) How do humans recalibrate and plan visually guided movement when those movements may be planned or may require recalibration in multiple encodings of the target of the movement? In all three aims we use patterns of performance (while performing a reach or making a perceptual decision) to learn about the underlying encoding of visual stimuli, uncertainty, and visually guided movement. These studies will shed light on the way in which visual stimuli and movements are encoded, perceptual decisions are made, and on how vision is used to guide action in an ever-changing world."
"9329486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Paternal age is a risk factor of interest in psychiatry: offspring of fathers 40 years of age and older are at two- to three-fold increased risk for schizophrenia (SCZ) and for autism-spectrum disorders (ASD), a heterogeneous group of disorders which now affects as many 1 in 88 children born in the United States. Although paternal age is known to be positively associated with mutation rate at certain Mendelian disease genes, paternal age has not yet been demonstrated to increase mutation rate genome-wide. Meanwhile a rapidly-growing body of literature links spontaneous changes in gene copy number (de novo copy-number variants, CNVs) to both ASD and SCZ. Furthermore, paternal age has recently been shown to be associated with altered epigenetic marks at key genes expressed in brain tissue. Taken together, these observations hold out the enticing possibility that advancing paternal age, by increasing germline mutation and epi-mutation rate, may explain some portion of the contemporary increase in ASD incidence in the industrialized West. Studying the effect of paternal age in human populations is quite difficult, but laboratory mice provide an ideal system in which to estimate both the magnitude and inter-individual variability of the effects of age on the fidelity of genetic transmission through males. The objective of this Kirschstein-NRSA individual (F30) fellowship proposal is to quantify the paternal-age effect (PAE) on genome stability in the germline of male mice, thus providing insight both on fundamental biological processes and an important and timely question in psychiatry. Using a mouse model, we will characterize the PAE at three levels: whole chromosomes, DNA sequence, and chromatin modifications. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows:  (1) Characterize the effect of age on the rate and distribution of meiotic recombination - the process by  which many CNVs arise - in the male germline.  (2) Use next-generation sequencing to precisely quantify the PAE on mutation rate for one specific  class of mutations, CNVs, known to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.  (3) Characterize the PAE on the landscape of one specific class of epigenetic marks, methylation. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms by which the stability of the genome is maintained with age in male germ cells, as well as advance understanding of the etiology of a group of common neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9431634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the enduring debilitation and poor quality of life in ME/CFS, this study proposes to identify important activity patterns (e.g., push-crash), negative life events and autonomic dysfunction that may be associated with non-improvement. This will be accomplished with weekly online diaries, objective measures (actigraphy, heart rate monitors) and semi-structured phone interviews. Non-improvement is a rarely studied, but commonly reported outcome in this illness. For both naturalistic studies and behavioral intervention trials, roughly 50% of ME/CFS patients report worsening or unchanged illness. Also, the patient's self-management efforts may (paradoxically) produce symptom worsening and contribute to illness non-improvement.  Non-improvement may also have biological relevance because activity limitations and sleep disruption in ME/CFS have both been associated with autonomic dysregulation (reduced heart rate variability). This (R01) prospective observational six month study of both daily and weekly in vivo assessments would be the first to look at non-improvement in relation to ongoing patient activities and autonomic function. Specific Aim 1: To assess the relation between non-improvement and prospectively assessed activity patterns and life events. Hypothesis 1: Non-improvement will be significantly associated with these dimensional variables: (a) illness-exacerbating activity patterns (e.g., push-crash) reported on home web diaries; (b) daily hassles assessed in web diaries; and (c) negative life events reported in phone interviews. Specific Aim 2: To assess the relation between improvement and prospectively assessed activity patterns and life events. Hypothesis 2: Improvement will be significantly associated with: (a) illness-moderating activity patterns (e.g., healthy pacing) reported on home web diaries; (b) daily uplifts assessed in web diaries; and (c) positive life events assessed in phone interviews. Specific Aim 3: To assess the relation between activity patterns and symptoms. Hypothesis 3: (a) the push- crash pattern will predict greater actigraphy variability and symptom variability; (b) the limiting activity pattern will be associated with very low actigraphy counts and high symptom severity; and (c) a healthier pacing pattern will be associated with moderate variability of actigraphy and symptoms.  Our secondary aim hypothesizes that autonomic dysregulation (reduced heart rate variability) will be characteristic of both non-improvers and patients with a limiting activity pattern as compared to improvers and those with a healthy pacing pattern. The long-range goal is to develop a new self-management protocol that more clearly identifies non-improvement activities and how they can be changed. An important aspect of this new self-management protocol would be to identify early signals of impending relapse, particularly HRV status, via home-use portable devices that could be utilized by patients and their doctors as a warning to modify non- improvement activities, e.g., excessive activity or exercise, to prevent behavioral collapse into inactivity."

"9398238","A major barrier to improving cure rates in locally advanced cancers is our inability to make progress beyond what chemoradiation (CRT) can currently deliver. Combination strategies using molecular targeted therapies with CRT hold promise for improving outcomes further. While many drugs could enhance the effects of radiation alone, we have discovered that the effects are quite unpredictable when drugs are combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The successful translation of adding molecular targeted agents to CRT would require an understanding of the molecular pathways that enable the cancer cell to survive under conditions of CRT. Inhibiting these pathways with molecular targeted drugs will be synergistic with CRT in the cancer-specific context. Using a set of molecular targeted drugs from the CTEP portfolio as an initial starting point, we will investigate two hard-to-treat cancer types treated with CRT, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We will identify drugs that could synergize with radiation and CRT using a high throughput clonogenic survival screen that we have developed on validated cancer lines and then test the most clinically promising combinations of agents to multiple cell lines with varying genetic backgrounds, first in vitro and then further validated using 2 in vivo models: a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and orthotopic tumor models using syngeneic tumors, all done in combination with clinically-relevant chemotherapies. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs with chemotherapy in animals and tumors will be assessed in order to determine the optimal sequencing approach with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Since we have discovered that chemotherapy significantly alters the response of cancer cells to radiation and targeted drugs, we will also evaluate the molecular mechanisms that explain the response to CRT, and identify potential factors that may influence this response using 4 major approaches. In the first more classic approach, we will assess DNA damage repair pathways and reactive oxygen species generation when targeted agents are combined with radiation or CRT. Second, we will use reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) to assess the functional proteome to determine pathways that may be altered with molecular targeted drugs in the setting of RT or CRT. In the third approach, we will use Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids (SILAC) to assess global proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes that occur with radiation and CRT treatment, and how these pathways could be altered with specific molecular targeted therapies. Lastly, we will use Imaging Mass Spectrometry to analyze drug distribution within the various tumor models and assess how the pharmacodynamic heterogeneity impacts CRT responsiveness. Our proposal will not only identify the most promising drugs that could best be combined with CRT in NSCLC and PDAC, but we will have identified molecular and tumor factors that confer drug resistance which will enable future development of novel targeted strategies to enhance CRT or appropriately select patient for personalized therapy. Our approach will generate the high quality preclinical data and novel insights to fulfill the overall FOA objective, which is ?to accelerate the pace at which combined modality treatments with greater efficacy are identified and incorporated into standard practices for treatments?."
"9368206","Project Summary  Comparative effectiveness research (CER) relies fundamentally on accurate and timely assessment of the benefits and risks of different treatment options. Empirical evidence suggests that a median of 35% of efficacy and 50% of safety outcomes per parallel group trials were incompletely reported, and statistically significant outcomes had a higher likelihood of being fully reported compared to non-significant outcomes, both for efficacy and safety. Such a bias is referred to as outcome reporting bias (ORB), i.e., ?the selective reporting of some outcomes but not others, depending on the nature and direction of the results (i.e., missing certain outcomes).? Selective reporting can invalidate results from meta-analyses. As acknowledged in the Cochrane handbook ?Statistical methods to detect within-study selective reporting (i.e., outcome-reporting bias) are, as yet, not well developed? (chapter 8.14.2, version 5.0.2), there is a critical need to develop methods specifically accounting for ORB.  In response to PA-16-160, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop, test and evaluate new statistical methods and user-friendly software to account for ORB in multivariate and network meta-analyses. In this proposal, we will focus on: (1) To propose and evaluate new methods for quantifying the evidence of ORB, to adjusting for ORB, and to develop a procedure of sensitivity analysis under ORB in multivariate meta-analysis. (2) To generalize the methods in Aim 1 to network meta-analyses (where more than 2 treatments are compared simultaneously), and to propose methods to evaluate the evidence consistency. And (3) To develop publicly available, user-friendly and well-documented software and apply the proposed methods to research data sets. We will use carefully designed simulation studies to investigate the performance of the proposed methods, apply the proposed methods to multiple existing databases, and develop statistical software for wider research communities.  We propose to perform empirical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods through carefully designed simulation studies and, more importantly, applications to (network) meta-analyses of clinical trials with multivariate outcomes. Completion of these three aims in this proposal will directly benefit the CER program by providing state-of-the art methods implemented in user-friendly R package that will be made freely available to the public. This has the potential to catalyze the development of many new methods, amplifying the impact of our project."
"9320641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to exact a severe toll on Black men in the U.S. Although they represent just 14% of the male population, Black men accounted for 47% of HIV cases among men in 2009. The association between disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS in Black communities and social-structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood instability, and incarceration are well documented. Despite increasing advocacy for more social-structural approaches to HIV prevention however, considerable gaps in knowledge exist about how social structural stressors at the population-level and sociodemographic stressors at the individual-level (e.g., individual socioeconomic status, perceptions of racial discrimination) are associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. There is also a dearth of knowledge about how resilience at both the neighborhood and individual-level may protect against Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. We propose a 5-year cross-sectional multiphase mixed methods study in Philadelphia, PA, in which we use geospatial analysis, qualitative methods, and multilevel quantitative modeling to refine and test a conceptual model of neighborhood-level social-structural stressors, individual-level sociodemographic stressors, psychological risk factors, neighborhood-level and individual-level resilience, and Black men's sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors. The study has 3 phases. Phase I includes focus groups to explore neighborhood-level social- structural stressors and resilience and to inform spatial data analyses of social-structural stressors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, neighborhood instability, crime) that may be associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. Phase II involves the multilevel modeling of social-structural and sociodemographic stressors (e.g., individual SES), psychological risk factors, resilience, and sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors with a probability sample of 700 Black men between the ages of 18 and 44, of all sexual orientations, recruited from 100 Census block-groups. Phase III involves the integration of the study's results with spatial data visualization and culturally grounded explanations based on interviews with 30 Black men, followed by focus groups to confirm the study's interpretations. The expected outcome of this innovative study is that it will guide the development of structural interventions to reduce HIV incidence in Black men and their sexual partners regardless of the partners' gender. The overall positive impact of the research is that it will advance empirical knowledge about the multilevel social-structural stressors and resilience of Black men's lives with implications for reducing HIV incidence and other health disparities prevalent among Black men. The proposed study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women."
"9342691","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer epidemiology cohorts (CECs) uniquely contribute to cancer research and will play an even larger role in the future as new discoveries, especially in the area of genomics, continue to advance science and improve health. A CEC's infrastructure should enable it to maximize the value of its data and biospecimens, but many common components of current CEC infrastructure-such as how data are collected, managed, analyzed, integrated, and shared-need to improve if CECs are to remain sustainable and productive as the growing opportunities and challenges of Big Data transform biomedical research. In the California Teachers Study (CTS), an ongoing prospective CEC of 133,479 female public school professionals, our novel biobanking project proves that an established CEC can successfully leverage existing cloud computing and integrated mobile technology to collect thousands of high-quality annotated biospecimens more quickly, securely, and cost-effectively. The objectives of this application are to a) extend our innovative approaches to all other CTS infrastructure activities and b) document the efficiency gains of this approach to create a practical blueprint that other studies could consider. This project has four specific aims 1) We will create a comprehensive, secure, cloud data management and analysis system that integrates all CTS data in one cloud-based dedicated Data Mart that gives CTS investigators on-demand access to all existing and future CTS data, analyses, and study information in real-time. This will modernize CTS data management to markedly improve how we store, use, and share the extensive CTS data. 2) We will implement a new data collection model that sends participants personalized questionnaires in the format they choose-web, tablet, smartphone, or paper-and receives clean, analysis-ready data in real-time. This will make it easier for participants to provide data and for us to collect more and better data. 3) We will establish secure portals that permit participants to update their data, view study information, and communicate with their peers and the CTS team. This will transform how the CTS interacts with our participants. 4) We will openly and broadly share our progress with other CECs that are considering adopting similar approaches for their unique infrastructures. During this 5-year project, we will replace our previous data infrastructure with this new, connected environment; we will continue to collect new exposure and endpoint data from CTS participants but do so in better ways; and we will complete a series of proof-of-concept analytic projects that demonstrate the advantages of this novel approach. Key parts of the research enterprise, such as large-scale genomics and complex claims data, are increasingly cloud-based, and forward-looking CECs should position themselves to connect with and operate in those environments. The CTS is one of the first large-scale CECs to successfully adopt cloud computing and mobile. This application describes our detailed, data-driven, and practical plan to extend our novel achievements to improve CTS core infrastructure and serve as a model for other CECs that wish to adopt similarly innovative infrastructure."
"9482615","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem. Although previous environmental approaches to obesity prevention show some promise, most studies have not shown excess weight gain reductions. Moreover, few childhood obesity prevention studies significantly engage parents or focus on the home environment, which is essential to promote healthy behaviors at home. Children in rural communities are particularly vulnerable regarding increased risk for obesity; thus, successful programs that engage families in rural communities to prevent excess weight gain are critical. The proposed research project, New Ulm-Healthy Home Environments via the Mealtime Environment (NU-HOME), is a unique collaboration between leaders in a rural community and successful academic obesity researchers. New Ulm, Minnesota is a rural community with obesity prevalence rates that far exceed national rates. Moreover, they are poised for and are requesting interventions to promote healthful behavior change, particularly for youth. In conjunction with our many community stakeholder groups, the objective of the proposed research is to test the effectiveness of the NU-HOME program, a 7-month, family-based health promotion intervention to prevent excess weight gain (assessed via BMI z-score) among 7-10 year old children (n=120) in the New Ulm rural community. The intervention program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and a socio-ecological framework and will focus on novel health promotion components to prevent childhood obesity, including: 1) promoting regular meals in which family members cook and eat together (i.e., family meals), 2) promoting nutritionally-sound and appropriately-portioned snacks and meals, 3) reducing sedentary behavior, particularly screen time in the home setting, and 4) promoting physical activity through collaboration with community partners. The NU-HOME study is designed in four stages, including substantial formative work between the academic and community partners, a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; intervention and wait-list control), and two activities to facilitate sustainability (delayed intervention delivry for control group participants and dissemination). A community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach will be used to adapt an existing program that was piloted (HOME pilot: 2006-2008, NIH R21- DK0072997) and shown to be effective (HOME Plus: 2010-2015, NIH R01-DK084000) in urban communities. The NU-HOME program has high translation potential and is likely to be immediately useful to rural families of school-age children because it will be tested n a real-world setting in collaboration with engaged, knowledgeable and influential community partners."
"9513867","Project Summary In recent years, it has been become clear that modulating the peripheral nervous system has great potential for treating diseases. To realize this potential, a new neuromodulation modality is needed that is safe, highly specific, and rapidly reversible. We have recently shown that infrared neuromodulation (IRN) when applied to peripheral structures such as the nodose ganglion induces unique patterns of physiological responses that cannot be elicited by electrical current or drugs. The nodose ganglion plays an important role in regulating many critical autonomic functions, and IRN application has unmasked a functional organization for different sub-regions of the ganglion that has not been previously described. These results suggest that IRN has enormous potential for mapping the topology of functional responses in ganglia, decoding ganglionic circuitry, and as a clinical neuroceutical device. IRN stimulates neural activity by inducing a brief spatiotemporal temperature gradient or inhibits activity by increasing the baseline temperature. We propose to advance IRN and imaging technology in the following ways. First, we will to create new devices to efficiently and precisely deliver IR light to nerves and ganglia in animals. New devices include flexible polymer waveguides that can deliver light to multiple locations while conforming and moving freely with the target tissue, a ganglia tracking system that can identify the orientation of the nodose ganglion and precisely control IR illumination patterns on the ganglia for mapping function, and advanced calcium imaging systems that can do volumetric imaging of ganglionic activity and imaging in living animals. Second, we will assess the safety, selectivity, and repeatability of IRN. Third, we will develop a deep understanding of how IRN works by conducting mechanistic studies that include creating sophisticated models of IRN?s effect on electrophysiology and experiments to test our hypotheses. Fourth, because IRN has unmasked a spatial organization to ganglionic function, we will be able to map this organization in detail and provide an unprecedented understanding of ganglionic function. The tools and knowledge gained in this grant will not only help determine the potential of IRN, but be beneficial to a host of future neuromodulation and other applications."
"9358365","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Neurodegenerative tauopathies are among the most common causes of dementia and parkinsonism in middle to late adult life. Diagnostic accuracy for tauopathies is reasonably good (over 75%) for some of these disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but poor (<50%) for others, such as corticobasal degeneration. Developing better biomarkers for these disorders would be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and future clinical trials. The genetic, cell modeling and immunoassays proposed by investigators in this CWOW address these important research objectives. The discovery of genetic variants that modulate risk and severity of tauopathy could provide significant insight into disease pathogenesis, as well as illuminate key pathways to target for potential therapeutics. Three genomic loci were reported in 2011 for the GWAS of PSP, including STX6, EIF2AK3, and MOBP, but the mechanisms by which each polymorphism impact disease risk remain unknown. Discovery of genetic factors that mediate sensitivity or resistance to tauopathy in Projects 1 and 2 will potentially necessitate development of novel resources to elucidate how each gene is functionally linked to tau deposition and toxicity in disease. Core C will generate new research tools to provide the Center with the means to uncover the underlying mechanisms for risk of disease mediated by the genetic variants, as well as identifying common pathways that potentially include multiple genetic modifiers and would thus represent ideal pathways to target therapeutically. In this Center, Core C plays an essential role through its large collection of pathologically-confirmed tauopathies and for provision of services to the research projects. In particular, we will provide biologic material from human tauopathy brains, as well as assist with the neuropathologic characterization and quantitation of tau burden in humans and mice. We will also validate the relationship between tau pathology and key discoveries by project investigators. Finally, we will establish novel assays to provide mechanistic insight into the link between genetic modifiers and disease."
"9372631","The proposed research is designed to foster development of new pharmacological therapies for Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe and currently untreatable neurodevelopmental disorder with autistic features. RTT is a complex disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 female births and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)1,2, a transcriptional regulatory protein3. This proposal builds upon the recent discovery by Tonks and colleagues that PTPN1, the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), is a transcriptional target of MeCP2 and is upregulated in RTT patients and Mecp2 mouse models. PTP1B is a critical enzyme that regulates multiple signaling pathways disrupted in RTT, including the protein tyrosine kinase TrkB, the high-affinity receptor for Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)4. Studies by Katz and colleagues demonstrated that deficits in TrkB signaling are associated with neurologic dysfunction in RTT mouse models and that phosphorylation (activation) of TrkB is associated with symptom recovery5-7. Consistent with these results, the Tonks lab demonstrated that inhibition of PTP1B, using clinical stage molecules developed for other indications, is associated with increased activation of TrkB and other substrates, as well as improved neurological and metabolic function in RTT mice4. Together, these findings highlight PTP1B as a highly attractive target for the treatment of RTT. Therefore, the proposed studies are designed to evaluate the ability of two structurally and mechanistically distinct PTP1B inhibitors to improve neurologic function and structural synaptic defects in RTT mouse models. These studies will employ clinically relevant behavioral endpoints to enhance the translational potential of our findings and will be replicated in 2 different strains of Mecp2 mutant mice in two different laboratories to enhance the rigor and significance of our results. We will also identify downstream targets impacted by abnormal PTP1B signaling in RTT mice, not only to understand mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of PTP1B inhibitors but to also identify potential new therapeutic targets. These studies are designed to provide new insight into the therapeutic potential of PTP1B inhibitors for the treatment of RTT. Moreover, given the role of abnormal cell signaling in some genetic subgroups of autism, including abnormal phosphatase signaling (i.e., PTEN), it is hoped these studies will contribute to the development of effective treatments for other disorders on the autism spectrum as well."
"9370330","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The objective of this K12 application, entitled IMPACT (IMPlementation to Achieve Clinical Transformation) and centered at the University of Colorado School of Medicine Adult and Child Consortium for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (ACCORDS), is to prepare a diverse group of scholars for careers in T4 translational research with an emphasis on heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders. Our multifaceted, transdisciplinary center is ideal for training T4 implementation science researchers due to its level of faculty expertise in implementation science and outcomes research, our strong record of postgraduate training, and the excellent, diverse set of real world partner training sites in a variety of adult and child settings addressing HLBS issues. The program will train eight scholars over the funding period, both MD and PhD scholars, recruited from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds. The mixture of didactic and experiential training will allow iterative research-to-practice and practice-to-research experiences. An innovative curriculum of courses, seminars, work in progress research meetings, and workshops will provide scholars with solid training in both basic T4 and health services research competencies (e.g., pragmatic trials and CER, T4 frameworks, stakeholder engagement, designs and outcomes for implementation science) and cutting edge T4 methods and approaches (e.g., designing for sustainability, adaptations to evidence based programs, practical tools and iterative assessment for community and clinical settings). In particular, IMPACT scholars will receive in depth training in application of T4 frameworks and methods including CFIR, RE-AIM, the 5Rs for relevant research, the Evidence Integration Triangle, Dynamic Sustainability Framework, and interactive dissemination and implementation (D&I) tools. Scholars will emerge from the program having received both strong general training and in-depth T4 research experience relevant to HLBS subject areas and with translational research experience in multiple diverse clinical settings."
"9453302","?    DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):  Tobacco use behavior is complex and changing, with electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) increasing in use. In the face of these changes, we need to know more about the behavioral phenomenon of e-cigarette use and its association with other factors, such as continued combustible tobacco use (conventional cigarettes), nicotine dependence, or changes in patterns of tobacco product use, including reductions or cessation of conventional cigarettes and uptake of e-cigarettes. Understanding e-cigarettes, as they are actually used, will help guide the FDA in their regulatory decisions. This project will use Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) to gather real-time reports of dual product (both conventional and e-cigarette) users' daily experiences and tobacco use to examine how the immediate context of tobacco use, along with the individual's subjective reactions to those experiences, varies by product and individual characteristics, and influences future patterns of conventional and e-cigarette use. We address several FDA research priorities: 1) the diversity of tobacco use behavior and associated attitudes, perceptions, and subjective experiences; 2) how subjective experiences associated with the use of diverse tobacco products are associated with tobacco dependence and changes in dependence; and 3) how awareness of e-cigarette messages is associated with expectancies and experiences surrounding e-cigarette use. We will recruit 450 adult cigarette smokers who also use or who are at high risk for using e-cigarettes and conduct two longitudinal waves of EMA. Our aims include: 1) examining the micro-contexts of tobacco use and how they vary by product and individual differences (e.g., demographics, tobacco history, dependence) in order to understand better the functional value of e-cigarettes; 2) examining real-time withdrawal, cravings, and satisfaction with tobacco products and how these affect transitions in tobacco use; and 3) examining how proximal tobacco cues relate to tobacco use experiences, contexts, and patterns of use. Our in-depth examination of the real-time reactions to the use of e-cigarettes directly addresses FDA questions of interest."
"9388745","Converging data suggest that autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by deficits in attention, communication and social interaction, represents a disorder of connectivity, in which the environment may interact with the genome. Recent studies address both microstructural and functional connectivity in ASD populations ranging from preschool through young adulthood and demonstrate both increases and reductions in connectivity in ASD subjects compared to age- matched controls. The frontal, temporal and parietal regions are most affected, and longitudinal studies suggest that ASD alters the trajectory of neural networks in the developing brain, but the systems involved and the timing of these changes are just beginning to be explored.  The recent explosive growth in high-resolution imaging now makes the entirety of the developing human fetal brain accessible at the functional level at serial key developmental milestones during gestation, all non-invasively and safe to mother and fetus. Our overarching goal is to identify early MR imaging biomarkers of the impact of high familial risk for ASD on the dynamic functional development of the human fetal brain. Our strategy is to employ advanced static and longitudinal regression and growth curve analyses to identify stress- related changes in sophisticated MRI signals across the 3rd trimester of gestation and associate specific ASD risk-related fetal brain changes to early neurobehavioral signs in neonates. These findings will inform specific targets and timing of future neuroprotective strategies, advance clinical practices, and improve neurobehavioral outcomes."
"9348456","Project Summary: Enabling High Yield Engineered T Cell Production by Quantitative Separation using Parallel Magnetic Ratcheting Personalized cancer treatments are a growing area of research in the fight against cancer. One promising approach has been the use of engineered T cells to trigger the body?s immune system to directly attack the cancer. Recent research into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has shown efficacy in treating B-cell malignancy and several other types of cancers. However, CAR-T cell production faces inherent challenges with transduction heterogeneity, leading to large variations in performance of engineered T cells. Research suggests that CAR-T cell therapies can be improved by separating only therapeutically optimal cells. Unfortunately, traditional methods of cell separation and analysis, including magnetic assisted cell separation (MACS) and fluorescence assisted cell separation (FACS), have inherent limitations in manufacture of CAR-T cell therapies. MACS techniques are Boolean in nature and cannot be used to enrich sub-populations based on expression of a surface marker. Alternatively, FACS techniques are highly quantitative, but cannot be practically scaled to meet an acceptable manufacturing throughput. Ferrologix aims to address the limitations in current CAR-T production methods by developing a commercial product based on a magnetic micromanipulation technique, known as magnetic ratcheting, developed at UCLA by the PI. This innovative technology imparts FACS? quantitative analysis and separation capabilities to magnetic cell separation, enabling magnetically labeled cells to be separated based on the number of particles bound to their surface. Ferrologix aims to implement this quantitative magnetic separation technology into a cell separation instrument with disposable cartridges capable of quantitatively enriching therapeutically optimal CAR-T cells at industrial scale throughputs. If received, the phase I funds will be used to develop a prototype system to quantitatively separate CAR-T cells at a 105 cell/s throughput based on surface expression and will serve as validation for a cell manufacturing technology to improve the effectiveness of emerging cellular immunotherapies."
"9553093","Project Summary/Abstract Background: Transcriptional mechanisms that regulate epidermal homeostasis have been well established but recently we have discovered that post-transcriptional mechanisms play prominent roles in maintaining epidermal self-renewal. We have shown that the RNA helicase DDX6 is necessary to maintain epidermal self-renewal through the mRNA degradation and translation pathway. By associating with specific members of the translation pathway DDX6 binds to and mediates the translation of self- renewal and proliferation transcripts to maintain self-renewal. DDX6 also associates with mRNA degradation proteins to bind differentiation-inducing transcripts to promote their degradation to prevent premature differentiation. Objective/hypothesis: This proposal seeks to understand the regulation of epidermal stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation through post- transcriptional mechanisms. We previously identified proteins associated with DDX6 by mass spectrometry and our objective is to characterize the role of each protein in regulating epidermal growth and differentiation as well as the mechanisms of action. Furthermore we seek to determine the specific transcripts that DDX6 and its associated complexes bind. Specific Aims: (1) To determine the role of DDX6 associated proteins on epidermal homeostasis and (2) to identify and characterize the transcripts associated with DDX6 complexes. Study Design: To study epidermal homeostasis in a more clinically relevant setting, we generate 3-dimensionally intact human skin, containing human epidermal cells (that have been permanently knocked down for either DDX6 or its associated proteins) in the context of human dermal stroma and basement membrane, regenerated on immune compromised mice. By using this model, we can perform loss of function experiments on DDX6 and its associated proteins in regenerated human skin to characterize their role in epidermal growth and differentiation. We will also use RNA immunoprecipitations followed by next generation sequencing to determine the RNAs associated with DDX6 complexes."
"9469362","PROJECT SUMMARY The formation of bone in the mandible requires that neural crest mesenchyme (NCM) undergoes an inductive interaction with adjacent epithelium. This interaction relies on a number of yet to be identified signals that permit the NCM to differentiate into bone. Thus, identifying molecular signals mediating this epithelial-mesenchymal interaction (EMI) would allow us to discover proteins that regulate mandibular osteogenesis, and which potentially could be used therapeutically to generate bone in cases of disease and injury. One signaling molecule currently known to participate in these EMI and promote osteogenesis in the jaw is BMP4. However, BMP4 alone is not sufficient to generate bone in mandibular mesenchyme cultured without adjacent epithelium. The overall goal of this project is to identify other osteoinductive signals and test if they can be used in combination with BMP4 to function in place of the epithelium that normally induces bone in the jaw. An RNA-seq experiment and preliminary data reveal that spatiotemporal changes in several candidate genes including members of the WNT and CXC signaling pathways are present at the right time, place, and levels to mediate the osteogenic EMI in the mandible. This project will investigate the role of these genes and test the extent to which they govern the EMI required for bone formation in the mandible. The strategy employs a unique avian chimeric system and involves transplanting NCM, which generates all of the osteogenic precursor cells in the mandible between quail and duck embryos. Aim 1 will characterize the spatiotemporal expression of these genes qualitatively and quantitatively on the mRNA and protein levels, and test if their expression is mediated by NCM. Aim 2 will use in vitro organ culture and tissue recombinations to test if expression of these genes in mandibular mesenchyme requires epithelial signaling. Aim 3 will employ gain- and loss-of-function approaches to identify the role of these genes and test if these genes regulate the timing of mandibular osteogenesis and if can they induce bone when administered either alone or in various combinations with BMP4 in the absence of mandibular epithelium. This project will lead to the discovery of in vivo mechanisms through which NCM controls bone formation in the jaw skeleton and has clinical relevance by testing the efficacy of specific molecules that could ultimately be used therapeutically to benefit human patients. Completion of this fellowship will provide the scientific and technical training necessary for advancing the career of a dentist-scientist studying craniofacial development."
"9479531","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this project are to support the goals of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program by creating a sequencing core facility to provide exome and genome sequencing for the network. The extramural opportunity Clinical Sites for an Undiagnosed Diseases Network will create a consortium of institutions that will build common protocols to improve patient access to state-of-the-art diagnostic methods, and to promote discovery and innovation in diagnosing and treating these patients. Important to this coordinated effort is the use of common diagnostic modalities such that data can be readily shared among the sites. Therefore the designation of a single sequencing core facility that will provide state-o-the-art exome and genome sequencing for the network has been proposed. The Baylor Whole Genome Laboratory (WGL) is a collaborative effort of the Human Genome Sequencing Center and the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor, which merges the specific expertise of both areas. The WGL is a CAP and CLIA certified laboratory that developed exome sequencing as its first test. Since the beginning of the clinical exome sequencing service in October 2011, the WGL has sequenced, analyzed, and provided final clinical reports of exome sequencing for over 2000 patients with approximately 26% of cases receiving a molecular diagnosis. Therefore, the Baylor WGL is well suited to join the network by expanding our program to serve as the sequencing core. In response to the directives of the RFA, we will perform exome sequencing for probands and family members and deliver raw sequence reads and quality control metrics to the network within a two week period. Recognizing that the needs and experience of the various clinical sites may differ, we propose alternatives for additional sequence analysis and downstream interpretation of sequence results. These options include mitochondrial DNA sequencing; a first tier automated clinical interpretation with prioritization of variants, and an option for a full clinical interpretation in a consultative fashion with our ABMG-certified Whole Genome laboratory directors. In addition, we propose the option of whole genome sequencing. These options can be weighed by the Steering Committee to provide the most efficient and cost effective pathway to a molecular diagnosis for patients enrolled in this program."
"9349387","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of cancer-related deaths and predicting the location of these secondary tumor sites remains an elusive goal. Studies have demonstrated that more than approximately two-thirds of cancer metastatic sites could be explained by the blood flow pattern between the primary and secondary sites. Development of a precise understanding of cell movement through the vascular system and the likelihood of penetration of the vessel wall is likely critical to achievin the ultimate goal of reliably predicting the vascular regions most likely to incur secondary tumor sites on a per-patient basis. A patient-specific method to predict these patterns will assist in cancer staging, enable identification of unknown primary sites, and inform next-generation treatment therapies that target cancer cells in circulation. We have developed a multiscale computational fluid dynamics model for assessing hemodynamics in image-based arterial geometries, and demonstrated its ability to accurately predict macroscopic quantities related to disease localization and progression. Based on this preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) cell deformability impacts movement through the vasculature. (2) In vitro measurements can both quantify the range of cell-specific parameters and physiological states that should be used in assessing likely metastatic patterns and validate the computational models. (3) Case-specific simulations can predict likely secondary tumor sites. We propose three specific aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1. Examine influence of cell deformability on the accurate models of CTC movement, and identify whether the method can be applied at the scale of the full-body. Aim 2. Validate large-scale computational models and predict in vitro measurements of values metastatic sites. Aim 3. Determine the ability of cell-specific computational models of the full-body to predict metastatic patterns observed in vivo. The goal of this application is to develop a method of predicting likely cancer metastasis sites through the use of massively parallel hemodynamic simulations at an unprecedented scale."
"9346675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to define molecular mechanisms by which long-distance signals are conveyed in axons. Retrograde signals from distal axons to neuronal nuclei are critical to activate transcriptional programs both during neurodevelopment and following nerve injury. These retrograde signals involve physical protein transport, but several retrograde signaling proteins are predicted to be soluble and diffusible and it is unclear how they convey long distance directional signals. This project seeks to test the novel hypothesis that the protein-lipid modification palmitoylation allows otherwise soluble signaling proteins to 'hitchhike' on trafficking vesicles and thus convey retrograde signals. Our preliminary studies support this hypothesis and suggest that direct palmitoylation is essential for retrograde signaling by Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK) in response to injury. Aim 1 of this proposal will define the cellular and molecular basis for this finding, in particularby testing the novel hypothesis that palmitoylation is a unique 'dual control' mechanism that regulates both DLK localization and kinase activity. We will then define the importance of palmitoylation for DLK's 'downstream' functional roles in axonal regeneration post-injury. Aim 2 addresses how palmitoylation regulates signaling by a second pathway involving Janus Kinase (JAK) and JAK's substrate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3). Importantly, JAK-STAT3 signaling requires dynamic relocalization of these proteins from their steady-state locations in response to extracellular stimuli. This Aim will thus determine whether palmitoylation is broadly required for retrograde signaling and will also define the importance of stimulus-dependent palmitoylation for dynamic retrograde trafficking. Aim 3 seeks to identify the palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) that control palmitoylation of retrograde signaling proteins, focusing on whether the axonally-enriched PATs DHHC5 and DHHC8 are key regulators of JAK/STAT3's 'upstream' receptor gp130. The overall impact of this proposal will be to define a novel molecular mechanism that is critical to convey axonal retrograde signals. The focus of this work on responses to axonal injury could lead to new therapies to improve regenerative growth, while the discoveries made should also enhance our broader understanding of axon development and of neuropathological conditions linked to impaired axonal trafficking."
"9408808","Summary The goal of this Project is to understand the structural basis and mechanism of HIV-1 genome recognition and cytoplasmic trafficking, and the role of the genome in nucleating virus assembly. The Project brings together several highly collaborative groups with a broad range of expertise, and is tightly integrated with the NMR, cryoEM, X-ray crystallography, and Computational Cores. Pornillos has contributed significantly to our understanding of how the highly conserved SP1 domain of Gag, which bridges the capsid and nucleocapsid (NC) domains, and forms a hexameric coiled-coil that helps drive particle formation. Summers and Telesnitsky have recently determined the structure of the RNA element that is responsible for RNA packaging (?CES) and shown how transcriptional start site heterogeneity contributes to genome packaging. These investigators will combine efforts to determine how Gag recognizes and assembles on the RNA packaging signal. Exciting preliminary studies reveal that hexameric Gag constructs that minimally include the SP1 and NC domains bind with sub-nM affinity to the dimeric packaging signal [?CES]2 with 6:2 protein:RNA stoichiometry, and that binding is selective for the dimeric (rather than monomeric) RNA. Thus, a single Gag hexamer binds with high affinity to the dimeric RNA that contains two core encapsidation elements, an unexpected finding! This stoichiometry is consistent with confocal imaging studies in living, transfected cells by Simon, which show that the genome is anchored to the plasma membrane by a small number of (fewer than a dozen) Gag proteins. With Ganser-Pornillos of the CHEETAH Center, cryoEM studies will be conducted with complexes formed between [?CES]2 and Gag constructs containing SP1-NC. Mechanistic hypotheses will be tested by packaging and assembly experiments conducted by Telesnitsky. In addition, Simon has developed a new imaging system with which he has observed RNA dimers in the nucleus and found that most genomes arrive at the plasma membrane as dimers. Both of these preliminary findings challenge current dogma and point to additional studies. The stage is now set to (1) determine the primary site(s) of genome dimerization and Gag binding in infected cells, (2) monitor the pathway(s) that the genome follows from the time it is synthesized in the nucleus until it buds from the plasma membrane, (3) understand the molecular mechanisms that drive Gag:RNA assembly, and (4) determine the 3D structure of the ribonucleoprotein complex that anchors the dimeric genome to the plasma membrane and nucleates virus assembly."

Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions."
"9349389","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central question in cell biology concerns how cells destroy their own proteins. Protein misfolding represents a universal threat to cells, and has numerous causes including heat, errors in translation, DNA damage, heavy metals and metalloids, inherited mutation, oxidation, and aging. Protein misfolding is also associated with most neurodegenerative disease and some cancer types. The ubiquitin-proteasome system, by virtue of its ability to destroy proteins, responds to the threat of protein misfolding, sometimes termed proteotoxicity. We have identified a novel arm of this stress response pathway that specifically protects cells from misfolded proteins induced by trivalent metalloids like arsenic, bt not other causes of protein misfolding. The key mediators of this response pathway are Cuz1, and the related but largely uncharacterized protein, Tmc1. We showed that Cuz1 functions as a novel zinc-dependent ubiquitin binding protein that interacts with the proteasome and the multifunctional chaperone Cdc48/p97. These data suggest a model in which Cuz1 protects cells from trivalent metalloids by recognizing misfolded proteins and delivering them to the proteasome for destruction. The long-term goal of my work is to provide a better understanding of how intracellular protein degradation occurs. In this application, I use a combination of biochemical, genetic, cell biologic, proteomic, and structural approaches to understand the stress response pathway mediated by Cuz1 and Tmc1. First, I will characterize the ubiquitin binding function of Cuz1. My data indicate a potentially novel evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin recognition motif within Cuz1. If verified, Cuz1 might represent the founding member of a new class of ubiquitin binding proteins. Second, I will utilize proteomics approaches to identify specific substrates of Cuz1. Because Cuz1 is remarkably specific in protecting cells from metalloid-induced proteotoxicity, these studies may provide insight into one of the most important questions in protein degradation, which relates to how specificity is generated and maintained. Third, we will undertake the first significant characterization of Tmc1, a zinc finger protein with sequence and phenotypic similarity to Cuz1. I will determine how Cuz1 and Tmc1 function in coordinating their protective stress response. Together, these aims will provide insight into a fundamental aspect of cell biology, regulated protein degradation, and in so doing will inform the many diseases associated with misfolded proteins."
"9477892","Project Summary/Abstract The Laboratory will maintain accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 and enhance the chemical and microbiological accreditation scopes. The Laboratory?s accreditation currently includes 11 microbiological methods for food testing, 18 chemical methods for food testing, and flexible/technology-based accreditation for pesticide residues in food by GC and LC instruments with a variety of detectors. The Laboratory intends to expand its accreditation scope by adding heavy metals testing (arsenic and lead in candy, rice, rice products; metals in bottled water), additional microanalytical filth analyses, allergen testing, and Staphylococcus enterotoxin testing. The addition of heavy metals and allergen testing will increase the Laboratory?s capacity as these are tests not currently performed at NCDA&CS. The Laboratory and NC Food Program have a strong collaborative relationship since they are housed within the same Division of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Laboratory and Food Program will continue to strengthen their partnership by collaborating on the Sample Collection and Analysis Project included in this cooperative agreement. As the primary servicing laboratory for the Food Program, enhancing the Laboratory?s scope offers increased support to the Food Program?s ability to take regulatory action. Page 1 of 1"

"9344634","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regenerative medicine encompasses both tissue engineering and self-healing, and the discipline has emerged as a hugely valuable one with immense ramifications for improving human health. While the Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM) has had resounding success in its short existence, we lack an integrated mechanism to support training of the pre-doctoral students that represent the next generation of regenerative medicine researchers. Thus, we seek support for a new T32-training program to meet this need.  The proposed program is a logical extension of the ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration of investigators at  WFIRM, all located  in  a  new  state-of-the-at  building  on the  downtown  campus  of Wake Forest  School of  Medicine. WFIRM has a unique infrastructure that provides facilities and expertise for translational studies, from basic preclincal findings all the way through Phase 2 clinical trials. Training will include traditional didactic course work, a variety of WFIRM-wide training activities, participation in cutting-edge research projects, grant writing, and scientific presentations, and exposure to ethical issues in regenerative medicine. There will be 6 areas of research focus: 1) urological~ 2) cardiovascular~ 3) musculoskeletal~ 4) endocrine tissue~ 5) stem cells~ & 6) biomaterials/enabling technologies.  Each  area  of  focus  contains  at  least  five  faculty  members  with  complementary  expertise,  who  will  participate  in  the  training  and  supervision  of  graduate  students  as  co- mentors. Students will be selected from 3 Tracks within the newly configured structure of the WFU Graduate  School:  Molecular  and  Cellular  Biosciences,  Biomedical  Engineering,  or  Integrative  Physiology  and  Pharmacology. After a common 1st year curriculum (that is unique to each track), students will identify one of our 10 primary mentors (of the 19 total program faculty), take two additional regenerative medicine-based courses, and choose a graduate committee that will guide the student through their thesis work. The Program Director, Dr. George Christ, has ultimate responsibility for the administration of the Training program, assisted by Dr. Anthony Attala (the Associate Director) and an Executive Committee composed of senior experienced trainers.  A  novel  aspect  of the proposed mentoring  structure is  the  inclusion  of  seasoned faculty (Primary  Mentors~ 10), young rising faculty (Mentors in Training~ 5), and senior faculty that have career-long mentoring  experience (Emeritus Mentors~ 4). The training program will be reviewed and evaluated annually by an Internal  Advisory  Committee  and  by  an  External  Advisory  Committee,  whose  members  have  extensive  experience  managing  training  programs  as  well  as  nationally  renowned  research  programs  in  regenerative  medicine.  Given  the  world-class  stature  of  WFIRM,  our  extensive  national  and  international  collaborations,  and  the  restructuring of our graduate program to reflect the need for multi-disciplinary training, this application provides  a unique training opportunity. As such, this proposal is timely, thoughtfully planned, and specifically designed to meet the burgeoning need for well-trained investigators in the many facets of regenerative medicine."

"9483392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishment of cell polarity is critical for a variety of cellular processes including proliferation and cell movement, as seen in developing embryos, wound healing, and bud formation during yeast growth. Loss of cell polarity is, therefore, implicated in several disease processes, for example, in epithelial tumors. The Cdc42 GTPase is a central regulator of cell polarity in both yeast and animals and is also a critical regulator f metastasis. Although cell polarization occurs along a single axis that is generally determined by a spatial cue, a large number of recent studies have focused on the mechanisms of polarity establishment in the absence of spatial cues. Thus, how a specific direction of cell polarization is determined and how the process is regulated in a spatial and temporal manner are largely unknown. The proposed work capitalizes on the tractable yeast system to elucidate the mechanisms underlying spatial cue-directed cell polarization. Cells of the budding yeast undergo polarized growth in two spatially programmed patterns. We recently discovered that Cdc42 is activated in two temporal steps in the G1 phase. The first step depends on Bud3, a cortical protein marking the cell division site in haploids, while subsequent activation depends on Cdc24, which has heretofore been the sole GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42. This finding led us to hypothesize that sequential activation of Cdc42 in the G1 phase is fundamental to appropriate recognition and readout of cell polarity cues in haploid budding yeast. Aim 1 seeks to investigate how spatial landmarks and the Rsr1 GTPase module regulate activation of Cdc42 in early G1. Our genetic and biochemical data suggest an unexpected role of Cdc42 in establishment of a proper bud site. Thus, Aim 2 seeks the mechanism of action of Cdc42 and its regulators in establishment of cell polarity at a proper bud site. Finally, Aim 3 explores the molecular basis of the cell-type-specific budding pattern and investigates the assembly of the cortical markers that determines the orientation of the polarity axis. This research plan will employ biochemical methods and quantitative microscopy, as well as computational modeling. This study is expected to establish how sequential activation of Cdc42 governs recognition of spatial landmarks and execution of polarity establishment. Given the ubiquitous importance of Cdc42 in cell polarity events from yeast to humans, findings from this work will be relevant to spatial cue-directed cell polarization in higher eukaryotes, including mammals."
"9315003","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects ~ 50% of men aged 40 to 70 and has a high impact on men's health and quality of life. Current treatments are ineffective in the difficult to treat prostatectomy (16-82%) and diabetic (56-59%) patients due to injury to the cavernous nerve (CN), which provides innervation to the penis. With denervation the critical smooth muscle (SM) undergoes apoptosis and the penis becomes fibrotic, with increased collagen and a change in subtypes, thus altering the architecture of the corpora cavernosa. This application is significant because we propose a novel integrative approach that targets the 3 main morphological changes that underlie ED, which are CN degeneration, SM apoptosis, and penile fibrosis.  The sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is critical for the response of the penis to denervation. CN injury decreases SHH in the penis, which causes SM apoptosis and ED. CN injury also decreases SHH in the CN (70%), which causes demyelination and axonal degeneration of CN fibers. We are developing two novel and innovative peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofiber hydrogels for delivery of SHH protein to the CN and to the penis to promote regeneration and prevent penile apoptosis. Our preliminary results show accelerated CN regeneration, ~60% improved erectile function (6 weeks) and suppressed penile apoptosis in response to SHH PA treatment of the CN. When a second type of PA for SHH was injected into the penis of CN injured rats, apoptosis was suppressed 25%. These innovative studies are highly promising that optimization of PA methodology, SHH concentration and delivery (Aim 1 and 2), will even further enhance regeneration of CN and penile morphology and function. The SHH PA is highly translatable for treatment of prostatectomy and diabetic patients by substituting human SHH protein for rat.  SM/endothelial interaction is critical to maintain penile architecture and only one factor has been identified in both, which is hedgehog interacting protein (HIP, SHH target). Hip is synthesized in SM and HIP protein is localized in SM and endothelium, suggesting that HIP plays a role in communication between the cell types. HIP is also synthesized in pelvic ganglia (PG) neurons, and is the only protein known to undergo anterograde transport by the CN. HIP transport has not been found in any other organ. Since HIP inhibition causes more profound axonal degeneration than SHH, it has significant regenerative potential and offers a unique opportunity to study the nerve/SM/endothelial interface that is not possible in other organs (Aim 3).  As SM is lost, increased collagen occurs in prostatectomy patients by a largely unknown mechanism. SHH has been suggested to play a role in renal and pulmonary fibrosis and altered collagen production. We show that SHH suppresses collagen induction in response to CN injury and propose that SHH is a regulator of collagen in the penis (Aim 4). This is an innovative idea with significant potential for interventin and suggests that the SHH pathway sits at the nexus of several key pathways which regulate erectile function."
"9549233","Project summary Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) and associated neuropathic pain is the most common and serious adverse effect experienced by cancer patients accepted paclitaxel infusion, which adversely affects daily activities and thereby quality of life, and sometimes forces the suspension of treatment, negatively impacting survival. However, mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PIPN are uncertain, which hinders the development of effective therapies for this comorbidity. The proposed studies attempt to identify molecular mechanisms underlying PIPN, as well as a potential therapeutic target to prevent the development of PIPN and neuropathic pain. Excessive neuronal excitation is a primary source of PIPN. Our preliminary data indicate that the hyperexcitability of primary sensory neurons might result from paclitaxel-induced inhibition of KCNQ/Kv7 channels, which are abundant in sensory neurons and axons. Retigabine, an FDA-approved drug that opens KCNQ/Kv7 channels, could be a plausible treatment to reduce paclitaxel-induced pathology and symptoms. We hypothesize that paclitaxel induces peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain by inhibiting KCNQ/Kv7 channels and exciting primary sensory neurons, activating KCNQ/Kv7 channels during chemotherapeutic agent infusion may thus prevent the development of PIPN. In this project, we will produce PIPN in adult, tumor-free rats or mice, and utilize techniques of immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and behavioral testing to test three important predictions: 1) Paclitaxel excites primary sensory neurons by inhibiting KCNQ/Kv7 channels. Paclitaxel-induced effects on KCNQ currents in CHO cell lines in which KCNQ2/3 are overexpressed, as well as its effects (KCNQ currents and membrane potential) on DRG neurons from naïve rats, Kcnq2fl/fl//Pax3-Cre, Kcnq3-/-, and their littermate control mice will be assessed electrophysiologically (in vitro recording); 2) Paclitaxel induces peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain by inhibiting KCNQ/Kv7 channels. XE-991, a selective KCNQ/Kv7 channel blocker, will be delivered to naïve rats to see whether XE-991 can simulate PIPN and chronic pain. The role of KCNQ/Kv7 channels in PIPN will then be evaluated by exposing of Kcnq2fl/fl//Pax3-Cre, Kcnq3-/-, and their littermate control mice to paclitaxel. Pain-related behavior, morphological alterations (gliosis in the spinal cord, IENF in the skin, ROS in DRG neurons, mitochondria and microtubules in nerve sections), and neuronal excitability will be assessed; 3) Combining retigabine with paclitaxel can prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain. Retigabine will be given to rats during the exposure to paclitaxel. The excitability of DRG neurons, gliosis in spinal cord, IENF in the epidermis, and pain-related behaviors will be measured. Finally, the chemosensitivity of a breast cancer tumor to paclitaxel will be assessed in the presence of retigabine. These studies may lead both to a better understanding of the causes of PIPN as well as delineate novel targets for therapeutic development."
"9341344","DESCRIPTION: Alexander disease is a rare and typically fatal neurodegenerative disease of childhood that results from heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the type III intermediate filament protein GFAP. The pathological signature of the disorder is the Rosenthal fiber, a cytoplasmic inclusion containing intermediate filaments and small heat shock proteins that accumulates in astrocytes throughout the CNS. Prior investigations by our group have let to the acceptance of GFAP mutations as the cause for nearly all cases of Alexander disease, and the rapid translation of this information to clinical practice as the standard for diagnosis. However, the mechanisms by which GFAP mutations cause astrocyte dysfunction and disease remain unclear. The goals of this Program Project are to develop novel model systems of human astrocytes, investigate the impact of mutant GFAP and GFAP excess in astrocytes on neuronal development, viability, and function, and study the pathways by which mis-folded proteins are cleared from the brain. In addition, we will identify and characterize genetic modifiers of disease phenotype and test potential strategies for treatment. Our studies span genetic, biochemical, cellular, physiological, and morphological approaches to these questions, and include model systems ranging from invertebrate through human. The Program will link four laboratories, one using human induced pluripotent stem cells, one using Drosophila, and two using mouse models. An administrative core will coordinate financial reporting, monitor IACUC approvals, and support communication between the groups as well as with the internal and external advisory committees. The Program will promote a focused effort on the role of GFAP in disease, by fostering sharing of reagents, animals, and results among the four labs, through cross-fertilization of ideas, and by regular communication and meetings among laboratory members. These studies promise novel insights into the consequences of GFAP toxicity and the role of astrocytes in brain function and disease. Our hope is that such studies will ultimately lea to strategies for mitigating the devastating effects of astrocyte dysfunction."
"9465345","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  While biological models of mental illness once emphasized ?chemical imbalances,? modern perspectives increasingly incorporate a more nuanced understanding of genetics and epigenetics, neurotransmitters and neuroplasticity, and the functional dynamics of neural circuits. Yet despite extraordinary advances in neuroscience that have dramatically enhanced our understanding of the brain and of the neurobiological basis of psychiatric illness, the field of psychiatry has been slow to integrate a robust neuroscience perspective into clinical practice. Most practicing psychiatrists trained in an era before the advent of modern neuroscience, and residency programs lack resources to create curricula on their own.  This Fast-Track SBIR will leverage the resources and experience of the National Neuroscience Curriculum Initiative (NNCI) to create and test NNCI Synapse: Where Learning Takes Place, a beautifully designed, intuitive mobile application that promotes self-directed learning for mental health professionals to initiate, customize, and complete innovative courses of self-study in clinical neuroscience. NNCI Synapse will re- imagine the NNCI learning experience with the added utility, user experience, and convenience of a mobile platform. Content will include animated videos, audio podcasts, and case studies, with a strong focus on the use of narrative storytelling, and users will be awarded continuing education credits for learning activities.  In Phase I, a pilot study will be conducted with psychiatrists (n=40) and will achieve the following aims: 1) develop a prototype of NNCI Synapse; and, 2) assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the product for a fully powered Phase II clinical trial. During this mixed methods pilot study, a pre-post study design will be used to explore changes in knowledge, skills, and attitudes and semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on feasibility and acceptability of NNCI Synapse for neuroscience education.  Phase II will employ a randomized non-blinded prospective lagged start single crossover design with psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses (n=100) and will achieve the following aims: 1) refine, expand, and finalize NNCI Synapse based on Phase I findings; 2) assess the effectiveness of NNCI Synapse in improving mental health professionals' attitudes toward clinical neuroscience, understanding of core content, and ability to apply this content to clinical scenarios; and 3) determine whether improvements in outcomes are related to individuals' patterns of use of NNCI Synapse.  The research team is confident that users of NNCI Synapse will increase understanding of the biological underpinnings of psychiatric illnesses and their relevance to clinical work and will be better equipped with the knowledge and skills to communicate with patients about cutting edge discoveries in neuroscience. These gains will offer practitioners the opportunity to create a new dialogue with patients, their families, and other health care professionals about the cause and meaning of psychiatric symptoms."

"9383109","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a frequently recurring disorder that is the second leading cause of disability worldwide and a significant risk factor for suicide. Despite better recognition and increased treatment, the prevalence of MDD and the overall rates of suicide remain unchanged. Although a wide variety of treatments are available, their overall efficacy remains modest, and only a third of treated patients show full remission. Novel treatments are urgently needed, yet the development of new types of antidepressants has been hindered by our limited understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD. In this proposal, we seek to perform the largest and most comprehensive molecular study of MDD in post-mortem brains to date. We will use the substantial post-mortem brain collection of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development to comprehensively study genome-wide expression and epigenetic signatures that are associated with MDD and suicide in the three brains regions of the corticolimbic circuit, consisting of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), the Amygdala, and the Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). We propose to perform RNA sequencing, DNA-methylation and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) assays in the ACC and Amygdala of 400 post- mortem brain samples and to combine these results with of the DLPFC from Brainseq project. Our aims will then be to: (1) conduct case-control analyses of these two brain regions along with RNA-seq of the DLPFC to identify molecular signatures associated with MDD and integrate our findings across molecular profiles to provide additional mechanistic insights into the causes of MDD; (2) to take advantage of recent identification of genome-wide significant findings from GWAS studies in MDD and its closely related trait, neuroticism, to fine- map associated loci and identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and changes in methylation and/or chromatin that may mediate the association between genetic marker and expression; (3) to perform a case- only analysis of the cases with MDD who died by suicide compared with cases with MDD who died by natural causes to identify molecular signatures and mechanisms associated with suicide; and, finally (4) to perform a replication of the main findings in an independent sample of 50 cases and 50 controls. In order to ensure the success of this proposal, we have assembled a strong interdisciplinary investigative team from the Johns Hopkins Mood Disorder research group and the Lieber Instituted for Brain development, with expertise in mood disorders, genomics, post-mortem brain studies, and statistical genetics. By investigating the functional genomics and epigenomics of MDD in a large and well characterized post-mortem brain collection, our study has strong potential to identify genes and networks that could be novel targets for a new generation of treatments."
"9481052","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Domoic acid (DA), the cause of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, is a naturally occurring marine excitotoxin that can contaminate shellfish and finfish living in marine waters. Produced by toxic algae, elevated levels of DA are becoming more frequent and human exposure has become a significant public health concern for populations who consume high levels of shellfish. Acute high-dose symptomology in humans includes vomiting, cramping, coma and death. Experimental animal studies and human neuropsychological/autopsy medical reports have collectively shown that DA exposure primarily affects the hippocampal regions of the brain and is associated with seizures and the disruption of cognitive processes (e.g. hallucinations, confusion and both transient and permanent memory loss). The route of DA exposure is important and influences the severity of effects. While some information on developmental exposure is known, studies are few, limited to rodent models and have not used oral exposure, the route most relevant to human health concerns. Domoic Acid readily crosses the placenta and enters the fetal brain. Domoic acid is not associated with congenital dysmorphia in exposed offspring but is linked to persistent neurobehavioral changes such as hyperreactivity, hyperactivity, reduced social contact, increased withdrawal and emotionality and deficits in spatial learning and memory. The functional losses associated with developmental DA can be persistent and injuries to the CNS after a single exposure can be progressive and severe. We propose the first study using a nonhuman primate model to study maternal and infant effects associated with chronic, low-level oral exposure to DA during pregnancy. Our experimental approach includes studies of maternal-fetal toxicokinetics, neurobehavioral assessments of infants and offspring imaging studies to evaluate DA-induced changes in the developing brain. Our nonhuman primate model provides an unmatched opportunity to study this emerging excitotoxin at subtoxic levels in a controlled laboratory setting. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize the maternal-fetal transfer and disposition of DA during pregnancy 2) determine the offspring postnatal neurobehavioral effects of maternal DA exposure prior to and during pregnancy with special emphasis on evaluation of behavioral reactivity, emotionality, physical activity, social behavior and spatial memory and 3) characterize the relationship between the offspring neurobehavioral effects and structural and functional changes in the CNS with measures of brain electrophysiology (EEG) and state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. Results will fill significant data gaps in our knowledge of this marine compound and the danger that low-level maternal exposure may pose to the developing fetus for high shellfish consumers."
"9383851","Abstract A fundamentally important question in biology is how individual cells within multicellular organisms cooperate to form tissues, organs and a complete organism. One approach to address this complex question is to use simple model systems that exhibit many of the traits found in tissues. Myxococcus xanthus is one such system where, for instance, in response to starvation thousands of cells aggregate, move rhythmically and build fruiting bodies in which vegetative cells differentiate into spores. In M. xanthus we discovered a novel platform that mediates social interactions. This behavior involves kin recognition in which cells identify clonemates and exchange outer membranes (OM) proteins and lipids. Recognition in outer membrane exchange (OME) is mediated by a polymorphic cell surface receptor called TraA and its partner protein TraB. Only cells that bear identical or very similar alleles of traA will recognize one another for OME. Depending of conditions the exchange of OM content leads to beneficial or harmful outcomes. In genetic models we showed that OME can result in cooperative repair of damaged cells. Here, healthy cells replenish mutant cells with missing components that restores their fitness. In other examples, OME leads to antagonisms when polymorphic toxins are transferred and the recipient cells do not contain cognate immunity proteins. Although OME involves the apparent transfer of hundreds of different cellular components with complex social consequences, this system is amendable to powerful approaches that can be applied to bacterial research. This proposal addresses three goals. In Aim 1 we will investigate OM fusion as the mechanism for exchange by using microscopy, genetic and biochemical methods to define the dynamic functions of TraA and TraB. Aim 2 will also use a combination of approaches to define the molecular basis of TraA kin recognition and how it interacts with TraB. Aim 3 will investigate a second pathway that allows toxins delivered by OME to enter the cytoplasm. Our preliminary data suggests that this kin discrimination system impacts strain diversification and population structures found in natural soil habitats. This hypothesis will be tested by genetic and bioinformatic experiments. Last, the ability of OME to repair damage that is inflicted on stressed cells will be tested. These studies will lead to a molecular understanding of the mechanisms of kin recognition and OME, as well as a deeper insights into how a socially sophisticated bacterium transitions from individuals into a cooperative multicellular tissue."
"9386846","Eastern Africa Network for Bioinformatics Training - (EANBiT) PROGRAM SUMMARY Developing sufficient mass of research leaders requires a large starting pool of high quality trainees at the early stage of the training pipeline and support to enhance their progression up the pipeline. As such Masters training, being the first stage of specialized research training is, strong determinant of the quality of PhD students in the region. Unfortunately, many universities in eastern Africa do not offer bioinformatics training at Master level and those that do often lack sufficient teaching faculty and active research environments where the students can be exposed to high quality data and emerging bioinformatics techniques. Consequently, universities and research centres in the region struggle to recruit good quality bioinformatics research assistants and PhD students. Therefore, while EANBiT?s long-term goal is to develop bioinformatics research leaders, the focus over the period of this grant will be on enhancing bioinformatics training at Masters level in the eastern African region to increase the size and quality of the pool of potential PhD students. OBJECTIVES Our core objective is to measurably strengthen the application of bioinformatics in biomedical research, through individual training, research mentorship and enhancing institutional capacity in East and Central Africa. Specific objectives  1. To develop a collaborative platform for promoting and strengthening bioinformatics  training and career development in universities and research institutes in eastern Africa.  2. Develop a harmonized bioinformatics curriculum at Masters level and support its  adoption in partner universities.  3. Generate a cohort of highly trained bioinformatics Masters graduates who can lead  analysis of data generated by H3Africa and other projects. EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT: We expect to progressively develop highly qualified bioinformaticians with the knowledge and skills to contribute analysis of genomic, genetic and environmental data that are relevant to health in eastern Africa, and to have equitable collaborations with peers in Africa and elsewhere. We plan to train 12 participants each year at the level of Masters. The institutions involved will include International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Pwani University, Makerere University, Uganda Virus Research Institute, KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme and University of Dar es Salaam. Our expectation is that graduates from this program will lead research, and take part in analysis of complex datasets, and train the next generation of bioinformaticians."

"9351196","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Established guidelines for assessing response of solid tumors to therapy are based on conventional imaging indices, such as tumor size and vascularity, and were intended to facilitate a uniform assessment of response to systemically administered chemotherapeutics that target proliferating cells in a well-perfused microenvironment. An emerging imaging phenotype of tumor recurrence indicates that a complete radiographic response may be followed by variable periods of latency without perceptible growth in poorly perfused microenvironments. This imaging phenotype highlights the capability of cancer cells to adapt their growth program to their microenvironment and effect tumor dormancy. The development of functional measures of this altered tumor metabolism is critical to effective preclinical and clinical imaging of response. Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) provides a compelling clinical correlate to this imaging deficiency. TACE exploits the vascular biology of HCC to deprive tumors of nutrients, leading to necrosis; however, only 44% of large treated lesions demonstrate extensive necrosis on pathology, underscoring the adaptive response of HCC cells to nutrient deprivation. This adaptive response is reflected by the presence of viable tumor cells adjacent to regions of necrosis on histopathology, and is consistent with the rapid recurrence following a period of latency that is often discovered on follow-up imaging. Thus, TACE provides a useful model for identifying the mechanisms mobilized by cancer cells to survive severe ischemia. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that TACE-like severe ischemia induces quiescence in surviving cells and that these cells activate a metabolic stress response (MSR) including hypoxia-inducible factors, the unfolded protein response and autophagy, which reprogram metabolism to enable survival under ischemic conditions. The recent development of Dynamic Hyperpolarized Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging (DNP-13C-NMRS) has yielded promising results in studies of metabolism in hepatocellular disease. This technology represents a unique resource to translate advances in our understanding of the MSR into a non-invasive, clinically applicable imaging paradigm to identify dormant cancer cells surviving ischemia. The conventional post-TACE imaging phenotype of sustained survival without proliferation under metabolic stress will be examined using targeted metabolomics, proteomic and epigenetic profiling of HCC cells to develop a DNP-13C-NMRS based imaging approach. The primary objectives of this application are to: a) characterize the nutrient microenvironment as well as the epigenetic and proteomic alterations underlying MSR-induced metabolic adaptation in cells surviving ischemic stress, b) develop a DNP- 13C-NMRS based metabolic imaging approach to enable the non-invasive detection of cells surviving ischemic stress in vitro, and c) translate this approach to characterize cells surviving trans-arterial embolization in vivo."
"9349396","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hibernating mammals, including bears, bats, rodents, and at least one primate, undergo a period of rapid pre-hibernation weight gain, which allows them to build the fat reserves needed to survive up to 6 months of hibernation. During hibernation, the animals neither eat nor drink, but significantly suppresses its metabolic rate while using stored fat as the primary fuel source. A mechanistic understanding of hibernation could have an important impact on human medicine. Some of the adaptive metabolic states found in hibernators, such as pre-hibernation insulin resistance and fat accumulation, are similar to the maladaptive metabolic syndrome seen in humans, and an ability to create a hibernation-like state in humans could have a significant impact on emergency medicine, surgery or organ storage. However, the mechanisms underlying hibernation phenotypes remain largely unknown, and previous research efforts have been limited by the lack of tractable experimental models. This project will establish the meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius), a small North American hibernator, as a laboratory model of hibernation. Unlike current models, Zapus has a short generation time and it can be induced to hibernate using photoperiod and temperature regardless of outside season. The overall goals of this project are 1) to sequence and annotate the Zapus genome, and to compare the genome of Zapus with that of a closely related non-hibernator; 2) to establish a robust breeding colony and refine the conditions required to induce obesity and hibernation; and 3) to compare whole body and tissue-specific cellular metabolism in the summer-active, obese, and hibernating states, with a focus on regulation of glucose metabolism. This project is designed to establish the meadow jumping mouse as a tractable, genetic model of hibernation. The proposed metabolic characterization will advance the hibernation field by providing the first comprehensive view of hibernation metabolism. The long-term goal of this work is to lay the foundation for comprehensive study of the mechanisms of hibernation phenotypes, which may have important application to human health."

"9377505","Project Summary The long-term goal of this proposal is to apply causal inference methods to inform implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention (PrEP). PrEP is a proven biomedical intervention that has the potential to dramatically reduce the number of HIV infections globally, but insufficient adherence to PrEP is the biggest barrier to its effectiveness. Widespread implementation of PrEP is required to realize PrEP's full public health potential, and the most recent strategic plans and research priorities of NIH, PEPFAR, NIMH, and the Office of AIDS research all reflect the urgent need for more work in implementation science as it relates to HIV prevention.  No single HIV prevention program is ideal for all contexts, and before PrEP is rolled out widely, policy- makers need to assess how PrEP should fit into their own HIV prevention programs. This will require estimating the anticipated public health impact of PrEP in each context, and identifying priority populations for targeted adherence support. Transportability provides a timely solution to these challenges currently facing the PrEP implementation field.  Transportability is a novel mathematical framework for predicting the anticipated real-world effectiveness of interventions. The objective of this proposal is to use transportability to inform PrEP implementation by estimating PrEP's real-world effectiveness and identifying priority populations for adherence support. Using data from the iPrEx, iPrEx OLE, and PrEP DemoProjects, Aim 1 will illustrate how transportability can be applied to estimate the effectiveness of a randomized intervention in a distinct target population, and Aim 2 will clarify which characteristics and populations should be prioritized for adherence support.  The proposed study will provide valuable and timely insight for PrEP implementation, and will serve as a model for estimating real-world effectiveness of PrEP in other target populations. The interdisciplinary training environment, expert mentorship, and use of cutting edge methods will provide the applicant an opportunity to develop unmatched subject matter, technical, and methodological expertise for her career as a future independent researcher in HIV prevention epidemiology."
"9342865","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The advent of custom built DNA binding domains fused to restriction enzymes changed the landscape of biomedical research and heralded a new age in gene therapy. This fact is highlighted by Phase I clinical trials in which zinc finger nucleases are being used to knockout the CCR5 receptor in CD34+ T cells of HIV infected individuals to generate HIV-resistant T cells (clinical trial #NCT00842634). In addition to targeted gene knockout, other biomedical applications of the designer nucleases are gene correction and gene activation. However, gene correction requires homologous recombination following a DNA cut - a very inefficient process - and current strategies for stable gene activation require constitutive expression of an ectopic protein, limitations that are likely to hinder therapeutic efficacy. In contrast to endogenous gene editing or genetic activation, I propose to develop a platform for epigenetic reprogramming of any locus of interest.  As a proof-of-concept for this technology, I propose to engineer site-specific DNA binding module fusions with DNA demethylating enzymes for epigenetic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) for therapy of sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is caused by mutation of the adult b-globin gene which forces red blood cells to sickle and occlude small blood vessels leading to exquisite pain and a wide range of medical complications. Fetal hemoglobin is normally silenced at birth by DNA methylation of the g-globin locus as adult hemoglobin increases. Because small increases in HbF can cure this disease, SCD is an optimal application for developing epigenetic re-programming technologies.  The major advantage of epigenetic engineering is that successful DNA demethylation of CpGs on both strands will lead to durable HbF-induction, not requiring continuous expression of ectopic proteins. This highly-innovative strategy has no precedent in the SCD literature. Development of this technology will lead to potent and durable"
"9385113","ABSTRACT The Phenotyping and Pathophysiology Core is designed to address the need for effective phenotyping of kidney function in mouse models of selective gene overexpression or deletion. In addition, this Core is designed to provide experimental mouse models of acute or progressive renal injury to assess potential therapeutic interventions. This Core also helps investigators who may have developed genetic mouse models or potential therapeutic interventions but do not have the expertise and/or infrastructure required to design and carry out appropriate kidney phenotyping studies or studies investigating mouse models of kidney injury. In this proposal, we propose five distinct subcores that will offer and/or develop methodologies to define the pathogenesis of kidney disease and design therapeutic interventions. The Phenotyping Subcore will provide a battery of well-established invasive and non-invasive tests of kidney function. The Injury Model Subcore will provide investigators cost-effective testing of potential pharmaceutical or immunologic therapy strategies in appropriate mouse models of acute or progressive kidney injury. In addition, this subcore will provide murine models for screening of potential kidney side effects of drugs. This subcore provides a wide variety of experimental models of mouse kidney injury that offer consistent and reproducible results. Some of the mouse models available have been developed by the Center investigators. The Metabolism and Bioenergetics Subcore will offer direct measurements of kidney tissue partial oxygen consumption and will develop methodology for the measurements of whole kidney oxygen consumption based on kidney blood flow and measurements of arterial and renal venous partial oxygen. Furthermore this subcore will provide expertise in metabolic flux analysis, glucose uptake and quantification of various metabolites in kidney tissues using mass spectrometry methods. The Mouse Kidney Imaging Subcore will provide established non-invasive imaging techniques for the assessments of mouse renal diseases and will provide methods and further optimize novel methods for the noninvasive characterization of renal microstructure and function in mice. The CRISPR/cas9 Subcore will provide guidance for the design, construction, and generation of a CRISPR mouse. In summary, the Phenotyping and Pathophysiology Core provides a broad range of services that aid researchers interested in utilizing murine models for kidney-related research. The structure of this Core is unique in that it performs a variety of kidney functions, non-invasive quantitative kidney images analysis, and experimental platforms for the testing of drugs and interventions. Importantly, this Core performs all these services in house and directly oversees these studies. We have been very successful in providing these services not only to the local scientific community interested in kidney research, but also in serving as a national and international resource."

"9408894","Summary The goal of this Phase II SBIR application is to extend the functionality of the QuickSee by incorporating a tunable lens module that provides a fast and accurate way of varying the optical power. This upgraded QuickSee, called QuickSee Plus, will be a unique tool for eye care professionals that enables comprehensive refraction (objective and subjective) in a single, portable package. It will provide tremendous value for eye care professionals as it improves their efficiency within the clinic and extends their reach outside the clinic. The first aim of the project is to facilitate the incorporation of a tunable lens system by modifying the QuickSee to simultaneously perform autorefraction on both eyes, without changing the form factor. The second aim is to select and integrate a suitable tunable lens system with the QuickSee. This forms the basis of QuickSee Plus hardware which will then be fully calibrated and characterized. The third aim proposes the development of additional software and hardware to enable the use of the QuickSee Plus as a phoropter and it's performance will be verified in a human study against a commercial phoropter. In the fourth aim, the device will be refined and refabricated based on feedback from pilot tests with eye care professionals. The final output is the completion of a locked-down design for production of the QuickSee Plus. The tight integration of objective and subjective refraction within this single device will lead to significant reductions in overall refraction time, enable more accurate prescriptions, and provide a better patient experience. Thus, the QuickSee Plus will help eye care professionals to better serve more customers within and outside of their practices. From a societal point of view, this translates into greater accessibility to refractive eye care."
"9397917","Project Summary Despite the essential role of alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells in gas exchange, the AT1 cell has not received much attention within the context of lung development, maintenance, and disease. We found that AT1 specific deletion of the transcription factor NK homeobox2.1 (NKX2.1) during development results in loss of three defining features of AT1 cells, as well as adoption of an alternative cell fate. This led to our hypothesis that NKX2.1 is a key transcriptional regulator of development and maintenance of AT1 cells. We will investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of NKX2.1 dependent transcriptional control in developing AT1 cells (aim 1) and determine the role of NKX2.1 in mature AT1 cells as well as its contribution to lung injury (aim 2). Successful completion of this study will elucidate the first transcription factors known to regulate AT1 development and maintenance, paving the way for future investigation of AT1 cells in lung development and disease. ."

"9342878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Torn tendons and ligaments often require surgical repair to their bony insertions. A large percentage of these repairs have poor outcomes; for example, up to 94% of surgical rotator cuff repairs fail. At the root of these failures is the fundamental challenge of attaching two materials, tendon and bone, with vastly different mechanical properties. The natural tendon-to-bone insertion involves a number of mechanisms that create a strong and tough attachment. Unfortunately, this tissue degrades with age, and is not regenerated in healing. Our overall goal is to develop a multiscale model of the tendon-to-bone insertion that will lead to (1) tissue toughness metrics that can guide clinical decisions for elderly patients, and (2) foundations for future tissue- engineered surgical grafts. Based on our previous work, we hypothesize that toughening and strengthening mechanisms exist across several length scales, and that these are most pronounced in a the compliant region of tissue between tendon and bone that does not regrow in the healing setting. We will characterize the stiffening, strengthening, and toughening mechanisms that contribute to this resilience across scales in natural and pathologic tendon-to-bone insertions as a function of age. The work involves three aims: (1) At the nanoscale, elemental spatial maps will be acquired using transmission electron microscopy electron energy loss spectroscopy to determine mineral and collagen distributions across the insertion. Individual mineralized collagen fibrils will be mechanically tested; we have recently performed such tests on mammalian collagen fibrils. In silico experiments will identify and quantify deformation mechanisms underlying the toughness of mineralized collagen fibrils. (2) At the microscale, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and polarized light microscopy will be used to determine the distributions of mineral content and collagen orientation. Mechanics of the tendon-to-bone insertion will be examined with micrometer resolution using a confocal microscope-mounted testing frame. In silico, nonlinear homogenization methods will be used to incorporate mineralized collagen fiber mechanics from Aim 1 into constitutive models of connected networks of mineralized and cross-linked collagen fibers. (3) At the millimeter scale, the 3D inter-digitation geometry of tendon and bone will be determined using phase contrast X-ray computed tomography and the mechanics of the tendon-to-bone insertion will be determined using tissue level tensile tests. In silico experiments combining tendon-to-bone geometry with microscale tissue models will produce hypotheses of mechanisms underlying tendon-to-bone insertion toughness. Mechanical fields will be passed down hierarchical model levels to evaluate collagen fibril response to predicted physiologic and pathologic tendon-to-bone insertion loading. Together, these models and data form the foundation of future tissue engineering efforts and efforts to identify clinically useful metrics of tendon-to-bone tissue health."
"9388681","Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) disproportionately affects males (?) over females (?), possibly because of a Female Protective Effect (FPE). Characterizing the FPE may help us to understand and treat ASD in both sexes. Our Network has contributed to understanding sex differences in ASD at the levels of gene structure and expression, neural dynamics, brain function and connectivity. We have curated an unprecedented sex-balanced, age-, IQ- and severity-matched cohort of cognitively-able school-age ?, and ? with ASD, age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children and unaffected siblings (US). At T1, we conducted behavioral phenotyping and measured key neural systems at the levels of brain structure, connectivity, function and temporal dynamics. Genotyping, whole-genome sequencing and gene expression analyses are underway. We now seek to pursue an extraordinary opportunity to assess our participants again (T2) as they make the transition through adolescence and into young adulthood. Our field has failed to generate a sufficient knowledge base to help optimize this transition for people living with ASD and their families. We will leverage the expertise of our Network to identify sex differences in ASD longitudinal brain development during this important transition. We will clarify both temporal and spatial characteristics of developing social perception, emotion regulation, reward and implicit language learning circuits, in addition to neural mechanisms for sensory habituation, creating dimensional, multi- level neural signatures of brain development. We will bridge DNA sequence and brain development and relate neural signatures to behavior and genetics to predict ?real-world? functioning in young adulthood. We will combine multiple levels of biology and endophenotypes?SNVs, CNVs, clinical measures, pubertal status, presence of seizures/epilepsy, sex hormones and multimodal, longitudinal measures of brain development?into one framework using an Integrated Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (iWGCNA). Finally, we will extend our T1 systems-biology approach through a collaboration*with ASD self-advocates/participants to evaluate the experiential validity of our findings. The proposed research marks the start of a new era in which advanced multimodal neuroimaging and genetic analyses will evolve into an integral part of a translational research chain. Novel behavioral treatment and pharmacotherapies for ASD may be further developed in adolescence and young adulthood with the tremendous benefit of directly and more precisely assessing impairment and change in neural circuits. By providing information about distinct, sex/gender-based developmental pathways in ASD, this study will identify if intervention/prevention strategies should include sex-based modifications."

Each student will be paired with a research mentor according to the student's background and interests. Faculty mentors engaged in cancer and/or cancer disparities research using emerging technologies from the DF/HCC and UMB communities will provide full-time, hands-on emerging technology research experiences that will prepare participants to begin to successfully navigate the path to careers as cancer and cancer disparities research scientists. The 12-week program will also expose students to the decision processes and skills acquisition necessary for a successful research career. Students participating in SPARC will attend a variety of seminars beginning at orientation and throughout their research experience?these will include both formal and informal discussions on ethics and the responsible conduct of research. SPARC will focus on three areas critical to the development of successful, innovative cancer researchers: (1) acquisition of scientific knowledge in the area of cancer and emerging technologies; (2) development of communication skills; and (3) individualized career preparation. Program activities in these three areas will provide the strong intellectual, technical, and personal foundation essential for developing and implementing cutting-edge research.

"9403957","PROJECT ABSTRACT: Pluripotency is the remarkable ability of a single cell to give rise to every cell type of the mammalian body plan. Pluripotent cells exist in epiblast of early implantation embryos. There are two well-described pluripotent cell types, those of the early versus late epiblast that can be modeled in vitro as naïve embryonic stem cells versus primed epiblast cells respectively. These cells differ minimally in terms of their expression profiles, yet vastly in terms of their epigenomes. In particularly, largely distinct enhancers drive expression of the same genes in the two states. The reason for the extensive enhancer rewiring in the absence of gene expression changes is unknown, but appears to be a critical aspect of early mammalian development. Preliminary results begin to address this problem by following the function of a single transcription factor Grhl2. Grhl2 is upregulated during embryonic stem to epiblast cell transition and is able to induce previously latent enhancers to a fully active state driving expression of proximal genes. Yet, these genes do not change expression during the transition. Evaluation of potential enhancers regulating the same genes in the embryonic stem cells uncovered the Klf2/4/5- related transcription factors as likely regulators of the genes in the naïve state. Indeed Grhl2 is upregulated just as Klf2/4/5 is downregulated. However, Klf2/4/5 regulates a much larger network of genes in the naive state than Grhl2 does in the primed state. Therefore, it appears that Grhl2 assumes control of a subset of Klf2/4/5 targets during the transition and that other transcription factors must assume control of other parts of the very large Klf2/4/5 network. These findings led to the hypothesis that during the early to late epiblast transition, large naïve regulatory networks are broken down into much smaller primed regulatory networks, providing the late epiblast cells the flexibility to differentiate down the divergent somatic lineages that form at gastrulation, immediately following the late epiblast stage. Then each of the smaller networks can be selectively maintained among the different lineages. Indeed, the Grhl2 network is excluded from the primitive streak while remaining expressed in the surrounding epiblast cells. To test the hypothesis, there are three specific aims. In aim 1, cutting edge technologies are used to identify all Klf2/4/5 and Grhl2 driven enhancer promoter interactions in the embryonic stem and epiblast cell states respectively in order to directly determine whether Grhl2 results in the rewiring of enhancer-promoter interactions among a subset of Klf2/4/5 targets. In aim 2, bioinformatics and novel biochemical methods are used to uncover additional epiblast cell transcription factors that rewire other subsets of the Klf2/4/5 driven network. In aim 3, single cell sequencing of wild-type and knockout embryos is used to explore the biological role for enhancer rewiring in vivo. Successful completion of this project will be highly significant as it will uncover novel paradigms of gene control that regulate cell fate and a cell?s unique development potential."
"9353552","The success of multidisciplinary, multi-investigator scientific programs critically depends not only on the scientific quality of the individual research programs and their thematic synergy, but equally on the ability of the group to work together and to stay on course to accomplish larger goals of the common endeavor. Even greater scientific advancements are possible if teams can enhance the quality of science by cross-fertilization of ideas and the potential to draw new conclusions from cross-analysis of data contributed by studying different components of the same system (organism). Coordination of the above issues is particularly critical when the area of research lies at an interface of two complex disciplines, as is clearly the case with immunology and gerontology research. All of the above necessitates a deliberate and systematic approach to ensure Program success at all levels.  To that effect, the Scientific Integration and Administration Core (Core A) will be the nerve center of the Program, coordinating every aspect of its scientific and administrative progress.

Universal toddler screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been shown to lower the age of ASD diagnosis by two years compared to the national median; this in turn lowers the age of access to ASD-specific treatment. Yet on February 17, 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published a final statement on autism screening in JAMA, in which they found insufficient evidence to recommend universal ASD screening. One of the primary gaps they identified was a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which children detected through screening received treatment for ASD, with their outcomes compared to those of children not screened. The current proposal aims to fill this gap, connecting the dots between the screening and treatment literatures, and demonstrating that standardized, high-fidelity, universal screening lowers the age of diagnosis and treatment onset, leading to improved short- and long-term outcomes. The intervention in this RCT is supported deployment of such screening, with immediate evaluation of at-risk children, compared to a control group receiving usual care approaches to early detection of ASD, namely physician surveillance and/or unstandardized screening. In a sample of 8,000 toddlers enrolled through participating pediatric practices near Drexel University, the University of Connecticut, and the University of California Davis MIND Institute, we expect that cognitive functioning and ASD symptom severity will show greater improvements in the experimental group, in which most children will be detected at 18 m screening, compared to the control group, in which children are expected to be detected significantly later. In both groups, missed ASD cases will be detected through screening at 48 m. Across both groups, all children identified as at risk for ASD will receive a diagnostic evaluation, and all children diagnosed with ASD will be enrolled in one year of manualized early intensive behavioral treatment (EIBI). In addition to the primary outcome measures of cognition and symptom severity, exploratory outcomes will include group differences in adaptive functioning, kindergarten readiness, and social reciprocity as measured by experimental eye tracking and parent-child interaction ratings. We also will examine the impact of the screening intervention on physician attitudes and on parent empowerment and stress. Finally, we will examine potential moderators of group differences, to determine whether initial symptom severity, cognitive ability, or SES affects the expected superior response to treatment in the experimental group. Our Autism Centers of Excellence Network is uniquely positioned to carry out this study; our prior work demonstrates our extensive experience and productivity in the field of early screening and treatment in ASD. This study will be the first RCT of toddler ASD screening, and will use rigorous methods that have provided evidence for universal screening protocols in other medical fields. This study will have a significant impact on science, policy, and practice. By demonstrating that universal early screening leads to earlier treatment and better outcomes, this project will provide evidence for the benefits of universal ASD screening, including better social and cognitive functioning, mitigating lifespan disability, reducing societal costs, and improving personal well-being and productivity of individuals with ASD."
"9322195","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the third renewal application for this project to understand the pathophysiology of proteinuric kidney diseases. Progress over the last 20 years has focused attention on the podocyte, at least in part because of our pioneering work on CD2AP. In the last funding period, we hypothesized that foot process effacement, a universal feature of proteinuria, was the physiological manifestation of Rac activation. Previous in vitro studies showed that Rac controlled actin cytoskeletal structures like the lamellopodia and membrane ruffling. We postulated that podocytes maintain high levels of Rho activity, which functions to enhance cell adhesion by controlling the formation of actin cables known as stress fibers. To prove our hypothesis, we showed that the acute activation of Rac induced foot process effacement and proteinuria. However, others in the field have argued that it is Rho activation that is the cause of effacement and proteinuria. Because all of this work is based on transgenics, which are difficult to compare because of the number of copies of the transgene and because of random integration, we propose to generate mice using ES cell technology, where a single copy of the transgene is targeted to a specific chromosomal locus. This will allow different transgenics to be compared to each other.  In specific aim #1, we will compare and contrast three transgenic mice that we generated that allow for inducible expression of constitutively active Cdc42, RhoA and Rac1. In specific aim #2, we will test whether the activation of RhoA can attenuate the activation of Rac1 and proteinuria in several different models of podocyte injury. Since GPCRs are a major regulator of Rho in cells, and as we believe that Rho activation to be a potential strategy for the treatment of proteinuria, we propose to first characterize all of the GPCRs expressed in podocytes. We will then test whether ligands for this GPCRs can activate Rho using both cultured podocytes and a novel minced kidney assay that we developed in the last funding period. We believe that a better understanding of the mechanistic cell biological causes of foot process effacement and proteinuria will allow for novel therapeutics to be developed that will allow this process to be reversed."
"9353835","Project Summary  Crystallization, followed by subsequent structure determination, is a major step in understanding the structure-function relationship of macromolecules. Understanding macromolecule structure has become a key part in the development of new pharmaceuticals, and is a major area of NIH research. Crystallization however is also the rate limiting step, despite technological efforts to automate the set-up and crystallization data acquisition processes.  Macromolecule crystallization conditions are arrived at by screening experiments, where the target material is typically subjected to hundreds or even thousands of different chemical cocktails. In most cases screening experiments fail as they do not result in a crystal. We propose that screening experiments contain useful information about the target proteins behavior in response to the tested solution conditions. No screen or group of screens can systematically cover the combinatorial chemical space for protein crystallization, and we hypothesize that in the absence of clear positive hits scored results can be analyzed to determine these factors. The analysis method developed is called the Associated Experimental Design (AED) approach. The analysis identified the most significant factors and a 96 condition screen based on those factors is prepared for each protein and set up. In the (ongoing) Phase I effort the AED software is being progressively evolved, adding functions for aiding in prioritizing the screen factors employed for likely success in crystallization. The software is written to not duplicate input conditions for a given protein in the output; i.e., all output conditions are new combinations of high probability factors as determined from the analysis. The software has been tested with 23 proteins to date. Of the 5 proteins that did not give crystals upon initial screening, 2 gave crystals from screens developed on the basis of the AED analysis. Of the 18 remaining proteins, 72% gave as many or more crystals in the single AED based screen than were obtained in the 4 x 96 condition screens. One of these 18 proteins was the RrP41-RrP42 archaeal exosome catalytic core complex.  Based on the Phase I results the AED method shows considerable promise. A major advantage of this approach is that it fits into existing practice, making use of existing materials, methods, and data routinely generated in crystallization screening. The AED software can be used with any imaging system that gives a scored assessment of the results for each trial, including manual scoring by a user with a simple low power microscope. The Phase I results also showed that it can be used with a reduced, more granular, scoring scale. Success with this approach will increase the number of hits generated and greatly reduce the time and effort required for macromolecule crystallization. The proposed Phase II effort is to build upon the successful approach developed in Phase I and further develop the analytical methods employed."

"9396800","Project Summary/Abstract  Periodontal disease affects nearly half of the adult American population and is characterized by bacterial- driven inflammatory bone loss. Traditional and emerging treatments for periodontitis management do not typically target the host immune response, which is the major source of tissue damage. The demethylation activity of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (KDM1A) at histone 3 lysine 4 leads to a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription. By contrast, lysine specific demethylase 4B (KDM4B) is a histone demethylase that specifically demethylates histone 3 trimethyllysine 9 (H3K9me3). Interestingly, previous data has shown that cross talk between these two enzymes leads to a balanced system wherein lysine 9 methylation serves as a prerequisite to lysine 4 demethylation by KDM1A. The research plan outlined in this proposal will exploit this crosstalk for the design of new potential therapies for PD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that promotion of KDM1A activity by introduction of a specific KDM4B inhibitor will alleviate PD by controlling the overactive immune system in diseased areas, enabling the host to better manage the disease and prevent its recurrence (Fig.1). We will test this hypothesis through completion of the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Mechanistically define the role of KDM4B in periodontal inflammation; Specific Aim 2: Use structure-based design techniques to discover novel inhibitors of KDM4B for adjunctive treatment of PD inflammation, and Specific Aim 3: Evaluate novel and known KDM4B inhibitors for immunomodulatory activity in vivo. Our preliminary data have shown that inhibition of KDM4B results in significant decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription and translation. Existing drugs will be used to further validate KDM4B as a target for PD, followed by computational chemistry docking experiments paired with physical compound screens to delineate the correlations between compound structure and changes in disease progression markers. These novel compounds will be interrogated both in vitro and in vivo for efficacy and toxicity. This study will provide a more robust understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of that may play a significant role periodontal disease progression, validate KDM4B as a drug target for periodontitis, and result in development of a novel therapeutic for local immunomodulatory adjuvant treatment of periodontitis. This fellowship will provide training in immunology and drug design and will foster the development of the trainee into a unique and critically needed oral health academic clinician/scientist."
"9306920","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the fact that their health effects are unknown, electronic cigarettes have become so popular that some sources project their sales to surpass those of traditional cigarettes within the next decade. Currently, however, regulatory efforts are greatly hampered by a severe deficiency of relevant scientific data. The main objectives of this proposal are to clarify (i) the origins and levels of toxins produced during e-cigarette vaping and (ii) the properties of the particles that are inhaled by vapers and those exposed by second-hand means. The central hypothesis is that e-cigarettes are reaction vessels that promote free radical reactions that lead to a range of products formed at high temperatures. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that a comprehensive investigation of the reaction variables influencing toxicant formation and aerosol properties will provide regulatory agencies, manufacturers, and home chemists a clearer understanding of conditions to be avoided when using e-cigarettes. A multidisciplinary team has been assembled to address the chemical, engineering, analytical and biological aspects of e-cigarettes. Preliminary studies have led to the discovery of a previously-unknown reaction pathway that leads to total formaldehyde levels that approach those of delivered nicotine. The research plan builds upon our preliminary results and involves four Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to define the effect of vaping upon glycerol and propylene glycol, the primary aerosol-forming molecules. Aim 2 is to define the effect of vaping upon nicotine, as well as related alkaloids likely to be present in some e-cigarette liquids. Aim 3 is t define the effect of flavorants and environmental contaminants on vaping products. Aim 4 is to determine the ability of formaldehyde to be released from carrier product molecules, and to examine the toxicities of e- cigarette aerosols by various bioassays. We will generate predictive models that will enable probing design variables and processes controlling product formation and particle size distributions (PSDs)."

"9245239","Project Summary In 2010, nearly one million children born in Mexico were living in the United States. This large population of immigrant children is of central concern to scholars and policy makers because child migration often signals the permanent settlement of their families in the United States, and immigrant children and their families, particularly those from Mexico, face substantial barriers to successful incorporation into U.S. society. Yet due to data limitations, we know relatively little about the migration process of immigrant children. This is an important oversight because pre-migration conditions and the migration process are thought to be key determinants of health, wellbeing, and socioeconomic integration in the United States. In this R03 proposal, I outline a research project to study child and parent migration using the Mexican Family Life Survey, a nationally representative data set that tracked Mexican households over time, including across the Mexico-U.S. border. The central objective is to understand why and under what conditions children and their parents migrate from Mexico to the United States, with two specific aims. First, I will determine the individual, household, and community factors associated with the migration of children from Mexico to the United States, and examine whether the relevance of these factors varies among children in relation to their position in the life course. Child migrants may be autonomous actors who migrate to maximize their own or their household's economic interests, much like adults, or they may simply be dependents of adults, migrating primarily to maintain or reunite families. In a third perspective, considerations specific to the life course circumstances of children are paramount, including the child's transnational family structure, educational opportunities, safety, and youth norms of migration in the community of origin. Second, I will determine whether, and if so how, considerations that are relevant to child well-being impact parents' decisions to migrate from Mexico to the United States and whether to do so with children. If child-specific considerations matter for adult migration decisions, then our current understanding of the causes of migration from Mexico to the United States, and policy recommendations based on that understanding, are incomplete."
"9429426","PROJECT SUMMARY The research program to be continued through this competitive renewal focuses on abnormalities in nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) function as a factor in ethanol (EtOH) addiction, and the treatment target potential of this system for EtOH abuse. Studies during the previous funding period investigated the functional status of the N/OFQ system in Marchigian Sardinian Alcohol Preferring (msP) and stock Wistar rats, as well as N/OFQ system activation as a means to reduce EtOH-related addictive behavior. Nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP) agonists reliably reduced voluntary EtOH drinking. However, in msP rats that carry an innate upregulation of the N/OFQ system, these effects required chronic administration. At the same time, rats with NOP receptor deletion (NOP-KO rats) consumed significantly less EtOH than wild-type controls. Thus, the ?therapeutic? actions of NOP agonists seem to depend on their eventual downregulation of the N/OFQ system. Consequently, acute suppression of N/OFQ transmission by NOP antagonists would be expected to produce the same inhibitory effects on EtOH-motivated behavior as chronic agonist-induced downregulation of this system. Preliminary data that acute NOP receptor blockade reduces EtOH intake in msP rats tentatively confirmed this hypothesis. Capitalizing on these findings, this project is designed to investigate the ?therapeutic? potential of NOP antagonists and the association between N/OFQ function and EtOH-motivated addictive behavior. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will establish the effects of acute NOP receptor blockade on EtOH consumption, motivation to obtain EtOH under increasing workloads, and EtOH craving measured by contextual reinstatement of EtOH seeking. This Aim will also establish whether rats with innate (msP rats) or EtOH-induced (postdependent Wistar rats) N/OFQ system upregulation, are more sensitive to the effects of NOP blockade than rats with normal N/OFQ function (nondependent Wistar rats). SPECIFIC AIM 2 will establish the effects of chronic NOP antagonist treatment -- likely to be employed in treatment settings -- on EtOH- motivated behaviors to generate translationally relevant information. In parallel, this Aim will establish whether chronic NOP antagonist exposure produces adaptive changes in the N/OFQ system that may have implictions for the therapeutic potential of NOP receptor blockade. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will investigate how N/OFQ system upregulation enhances vulnerability to EtOH drinking and seeking. This Aim will also to identify the brain areas in which dysregulation of the N/OFQ system is responsible for enhanced vulnerability to these behaviors, and thereby shed light on critical sites for the inhibitory actions of NOP blockade on EtOH-motivated behavior. Overall, the research plan is designed to advance current understanding of the treatment target potential of the N/OFQ system for alcohol use disorder and the role of this system in predisposition vulnerability to develop EtOH dependence. NOP antagonists are in Phase 2 clinical trials such that the proposed work may have significant relevance for future development of these compounds towards treatments for alcohol use disorder."
"9477918","The FDA?s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has created the first integrated network of state and federal laboratories (Genome Trackr) to use whole genome sequencing to track foodborne pathogens to improve outbreak response and effective monitoring of preventative controls. The Genome Trackr network has created a publically available, global database containing the genetic makeup of thousands of foodborne disease causing organisms. This project is intended to develop a stronger international rapid surveillance system for pathogen traceback by further enhancing the Genome Trackr network and the growing database. The accurate and timely subtyping and subsequent clustering of isolates of a bacterium associated with a foodborne outbreak event is essential for successful investigation and eventual trackback to a specific food or environmental source. The genomic information provided by the Genome Trackr network points investigators to specific food products potentially related to an outbreak, and provides insight into the origin of the contaminated food. This project will promote public health and state agricultural laboratories sequence pathogenic foodborne bacterium to be added to the on-line database. The local laboratories will be required to sequence a minimum of 400 food, environmental or animal isolates to be added to the database to identify future outbreaks. The local laboratories will also be required to participate in Genome Trackr in a standard process requiring consistency of the sequencing and analysis while also participating in meetings, conferences and proficiency tests to ensure standardization between laboratories."
"9478391","The West Virginia Department of Agriculture Regulatory and Environmental Affairs Division (WVDA-READ) had 15 biological methods ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accredited in August of 2016. ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation supports a strong management and technical structure in the laboratory. Accreditation has enhanced the laboratory in being recognized as an officially competent food testing laboratory.  In order to maintain and enhance the scope of accreditation, and conduct surveillance testing, the WVDA is seeking support through a FDA cooperative agreement ?Maintenance and Enhancement of ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation and Whole Genome Sequencing for State Food Testing Laboratories, funding opportunity RFA-FD-17-010. The cooperative agreement will support the fees associated with maintaining accreditation such as equipment calibration and preventative maintenance, assessments, personnel, and travel for training. Personnel and consumable costs will be supported in order to conduct surveillance testing on FDA products.  The quality system is being maintained by personnel who are trained in the management and technical requirements of ISO/IEC 17025. Personnel support is necessary for updating documents, training, internal audits, conducting corrective action, and maintaining additional quality requirements in the laboratory. ISO/IEC 17025 requires more stringent calibrations and preventative maintenances for equipment which result in higher expenses for the laboratory. Travel funds will be used to ensure personnel will have the training available to maintain ISO/IEC 17025 and attend the cooperative agreement meetings. Annually, the ISO/IEC 17025 assessments will be conducted by the accreditation body in order to maintain the accreditation. The FDA Biological Analytical Manual (BAM) Cultural Salmonella method will be added to the scope of accreditation in 2018, and the FDA BAM cultural Listeria monocytogenes method will be added in 2019.  Surveillance testing is planned on FDA products throughout the year. Processed produce will be collected by the Regulatory Officers and delivered to the laboratory for analysis. Produce will be analyzed for Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SET) in 2018. In 2019, samples will be analyzed for Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SET). Sample results will be entered into the laboratory information management system (LIMS) and automatically uploaded into eLEXNET.  The WVDA Microbiology Laboratory has been a participating member in the Food Emergency Response Network since 2005 and actively tests for various pathogenic bacteria in foods, environmental samples, and food contact surfaces.

"9540128","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pannexins (Panx1-3) comprise a unique family of membrane channels that mediate a variety of immune responses including apoptotic cell clearance, cytokine secretion, and T-cell activation. Pannexins also play crucial roles in modulating synaptic activity and plasticity; for instance, Panx1 knockout mice display diminished excitatory postsynaptic potentials, resulting in impaired object recognition and spatial learning. Also, Panx1 promotes aberrant postsynaptic activity after repetitive NMDA receptor stimulation, suggesting that Panx1 plays important roles in epileptic seizures. These studies highlight the vital roles of pannexins throughout the body, however, little is understood about what activates pannexin channels, how they open and close, and what cellular events accompany these changes. Our long-term goal is to uncover the mechanisms underlying pannexin gating, regulation, and downstream signaling using structural and functional approaches. The specific aims of this proposal are approached through the following lines of investigation: 1) Solve the first crystal structure of a pannexin. We have identified a pannexin species that expresses at a high level, assembles into a stable and monodisperse oligomer in solution, and forms crystals that diffract to ~9Å. We will continue optimizing crystallization conditions and determine the firt crystal structure of a pannexin. We expect the atomic resolution structure of a pannexin will serve as a solid foundation for determining what constitutes the channel pore and how the opening and closing are controlled. 2) Dissect the mechanism underlying Panx1 channel gating. Our preliminary experiments suggest that Panx1--the most studied subtype thus far--most likely harbors an intrinsic voltage sensor. We also discovered that carbenoxolone, the most commonly used nonspecific antagonist of Panx1, allosterically inhibits the voltage-gated Panx1 channel activity. Taking advantage of this drug and electrophysiology, we will identify the key residues that govern voltage gating, defining their position relative to the membrane field, and probing how they move in response to voltage. Our proposed research is innovative not only because it will uncover the first atomic resolution structure of a pannexin, but also because it wil provide the first detailed molecular mechanism of this unique class of a voltage-gated membrane channel. Moreover, this is the first detailed investigation for the mechanism of action of any known pannexin inhibitors. We expect that our studies will open new avenues for developing long-awaited Panx1 specific agonists or antagonists through structure-based drug design or in vitro screening based on the conformational changes associated with Panx1 channel opening. Once such molecular tools become available, we hope to clarify why pannexin misexpression results in widespread dysfunctions in vivo, and in the long term, potential new strategies for treating devastating conditions such as chronic pain and epilepsy."
"9355191","Project Summary!  This STTR Phase-II project continues the development of the Newborn Acuity Cardstm and the Newborn Contrast Cardstm. Together, these Newborn Cards form a new clinical test of visual acuity and contrast sensi- tivity for use on newborn full-term and preterm infants. The stimuli are square-wave gratings which the examiner presents to the infant in a fixation-and-following protocol, and determines from the infant's looking behavior whether he/she saw each stimulus or not. An infant's visual acuity or contrast sensitivity is the highest spatial frequency or lowest contrast (the least visible stimulus) he/she can see.  The proposed Phase II work will include a training study in which the best method for training examiners in the use of the cards will be established and documented. The project will also establish age norms by meas- uring visual acuity and contrast sensitivity on a large sample of healthy full-term and preterm infants. Because the test is so new, it is not known how reliable the measurements are. Therefore, this project will include re- peated testing of individual newborn infants, on different days, by different examiners. The Intraclass Correla- tion Coefficient will determine whether measurement of an infant's level of visual function produces results that are more related to the infant's vision rather than to the more ephemeral characteristics of the infant's alertness or the skill of the examiner. The clinical utility of the test (its sensitivity and specificity in detecting vision disor- ders) has not been established, so this project will explore these parameters by testing a sample of infants with and without Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). ROP is not the only serious visual disorder experienced by newborn infants, but it is one of the most prevalent and most serious. This is not a clinical trial, but the results on infants with varying stages of ROP will be a good indicator of whether the Newborn Acuity Cards and Newborn Contrast Cards are sensitive and specific indicators of healthy visual function. The results on the ROP infants will also be used, in conjunction with the age norms, to establish a normal cutoff value for a screening test of only a few cards, which will further increase the convenience of this noninvasive test.  The Newborn Contrast Cards and Newborn Acuity Cards will allow the physician to monitor the vision of patients in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and other pediatric settings, in cases where the visual disorder is progressing (as in Retinopathy of Prematurity or Cortical Vision Impairment) or where the disorder may be treated. Its potential market includes hospitals, neonatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric ophthalmologists around the world. In 71% of cases of childhood blindness in the U.S., the blinding disorder is present in the neonatal period, and the inability to see well may be the only sign of a blinding disorder in half of those cases. Ultimately, we want every newborn infant's vision to be screened, and every premature infant's vision to be tested more thoroughly, and this project will be the next step towards making this plan a reality."
"9385604","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Zika virus (ZIKV) is a reemerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that presents a formidable health threat substantiated by neurological and developmental anomalies and a sexual transmission route. The significant knowledge gap, as well as the lack of antiviral therapies and vaccines, has greatly increased the urgency of ZIKV research. Based on the precedents set by the investigations of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in HIV-1, HCV, and ZIKV, we hypothesize that RNA post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) play important roles in ZIKV infection by regulating essential functions in viral gene expression in different hosts. Understanding these functions will reveal new promising targets for antiviral development.  The presence of PTMs on the genome of various RNA viruses has been known for decades. A concerted approach combining immunoprecipitation of m6A-containing fragments and RNA-seq analysis has facilitated functional analysis of m6A. The lack of detection capabilities has however severely hindered such knowledge of the more than 140 other known PTMs. The development of a more versatile platform based on mass spectrometric (MS) analysis has allowed us to examine the global landscape of PTMs present in total RNA extracts of mock- and ZIKV-infected cells, as well as on viral genomic RNA isolated by affinity capture from infected cells and virions. Our exciting results have shown that the genome of ZIKV is decorated by 38 different types of PTMs other than m6A, and that these astonishing constellations present noticeable variations as a function of origin and conditions.  In this proposal, we will initiate the functional study of viral PTMs by initially pursuing those with distinctive expression patterns in infected cells and virions. More specifically, we will use MS-sequencing to target different dimethyl-cytosine modifications that were prominent on intracellular ZIKV RNA, but not on packaged RNA. We will deplete the enzymes that install/remove dimethyl-cytosine modifications, mutate the ZIKV RNA to prevent PTM addition, and examine the biological impact on viral translation, replication, and assembly. We will perform these experiments with different viral strains and in different cell and mosquito lines. The results will provide unique insights into the impact of PTMs on virus-host interactions and gene expression during development. These insights will lay the groundwork for the development of novel antivirals targeting host factor essential for ZIKV infection, but also possible broad- spectrum antivirals active across all flaviviruses. This study will help establish the priorities and framework for the elucidation of the remaining viral PTMs, which will be pursued by dedicated project grants. Beyond the investigation of ZIKV biology, these principles and the enabling technologies developed in this R21 will be applicable to study other conditions involving RNA malfunctions, which will further substantiate the broad transformative impact of this project."

"9353320","The mission of Core B is to facilitate translational and laboratory-based research performed by program investigators in Projects 1-5. The core has 2 functions. The first is to collect and bank primary AML samples, AML cell lines, and AML primary xenografts (primagrafts), for distribution to program investigators for their studies. The second function to perform a set of analyses on all newly diagnosed AML patients and all patients going on clinical trials that include mutation analsysis and BHS priming. The repository functions of the core include the acquisition of appropriate patient samples, isolation and cryopreservation of mononuclear cells, separation and storage of plasma or serum, isolation and storage of genomic DNA, maintenance of a data-base annotating patient samples and distribution of samples to program investigators. While the core will not do in vivo or in vitro drug testing itself, it will provide live and/or cryopreserved primary cells to Projects 1-5 for use in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing of novel therapeutic agents and combinations of therapies as described in each project. For in vivo testing of drugs, most of the projects will utilize AML cell lines expressing luciferase so that the mice can be readily imaged in real time, and the core will generate and store these lines for the use of all projects. Also, the use of primagrafts is of increasing value and interest in the field and the program investigators will have access to a growing panel of these cells for in vivo studies. As noted, these are primary AML cells selected for passage in immunocompromised NSG mice. By using a standard set of banked cell lines and primagrafts, we can minimize variability between labs, and also fully characterize the cell lines and primagrafts by SNP analysis, Profile mutation analysis, and karyotype. Core B does not plan on banking engineered murine leukemia cell lines initially, but if lines become of interest to more than one project, these lines could be added to the bank. The Core will enable all Projects to utilize the models that are most scientifically relevant to their studies, rather than be limited by the internal capabilities and sample access within the individual Project laboratories. Given the criticality of in vivo studies for establishing proof-of-concept and as a bridge to clinical testing, this Core is essential for the translational goals of the Program as a whole."
"9352819","NATIONAL RESOURCE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities are at substantial risk of diabetes. Consequently, In 1997, Congress created the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) to fund diabetes prevention and treatment programs throughout Indian Country. This initiative led to substantial improvement in blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels among AI/ANs with diabetes, accompanied by significant decline in diabetes-related end-stage renal disease. A subset of these programs translated evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment practices into the everyday world of Indian health. Modest weight loss through dietary changes and increased physical activity reduced incident diabetes by 57% among participants. An intensive case management approach to reducing risk of cardiovascular disease also yielded substantial weight loss, increased physical activity, improved diet, smoking cessation, and aspirin use: major indicators of this serious complication. Yet the lessons from this exciting work have been slow to be learned. The subsequent institutionalization of such well-documented evidence-based practices has been constrained by a poor understanding of community dynamics, program capacity, resource allocation, organizational commitment, and policy.  The Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Diabetes Translation Research (CAIANDTR) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (UC/AMC has begun to address this problem by: 1) Expanding its Research Base to include faculty at our sister universities through an innovative network of Satellite Centers whose research either directly targets diabetes prevention and treatment or is translational in nature with clear potential for application to diabetes translation research; 2) Extending the knowledge, skills, and experience of this Research Base -- emphasizing 6 specialty areas, including community engagement, cultural adaptations of intervention, health literacy, health technologies, dissemination and implementation science, and sustainability -- to facilitate a multidisciplinary, culturally grounded, problem-oriented translational research program of major scientific and programmatic importance, and 3) Rigorously evaluating the impact of the training, technical assistance, and consultations provided to other investigators in the U.S. seeking to work with AI/AN communities, as well as to those struggling to pursue diabetes translational research in rural and other racial/ethnic minority populations. This rich array resources relevant to diabetes translation research, generally, and to AI/ANs specifically, is engendering new capacity to address these diabetes-related health disparities."
"9335833","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is an F32 postdoctoral fellowship designed to enhance the candidate's training in the application of stable isotope tracer techniques to measure metabolic flux. Hepatic insulin resistance results in inappropriately elevated gluconeogenesis in the liver and activation of certain pathways of the hepatic TCA cycle. These effects contribute to diabetes by increasing blood glucose and also perhaps interact with liver disease by impinging on oxidative metabolism. The TCA cycle is a central pathway of both gluconeogenesis and hepatic energy metabolism. It is located in mitochondria and provides energy through its oxidative function and intermediates required for gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid production through its anaplerotic function. Impaired mitochondrial function has been linked to hepatic insulin resistance. Recent results from our laboratory have shown that hepatic insulin resistance stimulates both anaplerosis and oxidative metabolism in the TCA cycle. Whether increased TCA cycle flux is a cause or an effect of increased gluconeogenesis remains unknown. To address this question, we will specifically disrupt the oxidative function and anaplerotic function of the TCA cycle using conditional mouse genetics. The role of these two pathways will be examined using a combination of stable isotope tracer-based nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry techniques to measure metabolic flux. The necessity of these pathways for hepatic insulin resistance will be tested in normal and high fat diets. We hypothesize that disrupting the anaplerotic or oxidative function of the TCA cycle will reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and therefore reduce the severity of hepatic insulin resistance. These studies will serve as a scaffold for the candidate to train in the application of metabolic flux approaches."
"9342901","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding how genes interact to coordinate tissue development and cause human disease is a fundamental problem in biomedicine. We are drawn to this puzzle through studies of Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21, T21) and the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. DS causes multiple hematopoietic abnormalities including polycythemia, thrombocytopenia and two related clonal disorders: transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). The latter disorders are part of a multi-step progression that requires somatic GATA1 mutations resulting in an 83 amino acid truncated protein termed GATA-1s. Similar germline mutations in GATA1 cause anemia in euploid patients. These clinical observations raise several interesting questions: 1) what genes on chromosome 21 (HSA21) regulate hematopoiesis? 2) How does the GATA-1 amino terminus facilitate hematopoietic differentiation? 3) How do the same GATA1 mutations cause different diseases in patients with and without T21? and 4) How do T21 and GATA1 mutations synergize uniquely to cause myeloproliferation? Murine models have provided important information, but do not fully recapitulate the human diseases. We are studying these problems using human fetal liver specimens and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from patients with DS, TMD, and GATA1s-associated anemias. Preliminary studies indicate that iPSCs with T21 and GATA-1s exhibit distinct hematopoietic abnormalities that recapitulate many aspects of the associated human disorders. Now, we will perform systematic characterization of primitive (yolk sac-type) and definitive (fetal liver-type) hematopoiesis in iPSCs with T21, GATA-1s or both. We will manipulate the expression of candidate HSA21 genes in iPSCs to identify those responsible for DS-associated blood abnormalities. In parallel, we will use our patient-derived iPSCs and a MEP-like cell line to study how GATA1s mutations dysregulate hematopoietic gene expression and investigate the associated mechanisms through efforts to identify proteins that interact with the GATA-1 amino terminus. Our studies will elucidate how GATA1 and HSA21 genes, separately and together, modulate hematopoiesis. More generally, we hope to create new paradigms in which other hematopoietic diseases can be modeled through creation and manipulation of patient-derived iPSCs."

"9226198","Project Summary/Abstract  The overall goal of this 2-year R21 collaborative research project is to adapt an existing adult-child interaction coding system for use with dental personnel, parents/caregivers, and child patients to provide an evidence-based method of understanding behavioral interactions in pediatric dental care. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to assess the extent to which oral health professionals rely on a unique set of skills to build rapport, prompt adherence, and manage the behavior of very young children (ages 0 through 5). Two years of funding will be required to examine typical behaviors utilized by dental providers and to test the psychometric properties of this unique, practical coding system within the dental setting.  This project will align community- and university-based (faculty and professional staff) dental providers with a research team to assess the effects of dental provider behaviors on outcomes of child compliance, disruptive behavior, parental and child distress, and parental satisfaction. In addition, moderators/mediators (i.e., dental care-related anxiety and fear in both parent/caregiver and child, internalizing and externalizing behaviors) will be assess for possible impact on outcomes, as will environmental factors (e.g., parent proximity), to allow a comprehensive understanding of a child's experience in a dental setting. With an innovative methodology, findings from this project will reveal oral health care providers' responsivity to children's developmental needs in an underutilized population (0-5 years) in both research and real-life dental settings.  The valuable connections with community partners in the state of West Virginia and Ohio allow this study to be both feasible and representative of a large variety of dental settings. The project is designed to target a few key skills that could greatly impact child comfort in the dental office and create a foundation for future positive oral health care behaviors. The long- term goal is to translate identified skills into a simple training package that will be useful for dental providers to reduce distress in very young children and increase positive early experiences with oral health care. Specifically, the ultimate intent is to create a concise, effective skills training framework for all dental providers to increase developmentally-appropriate behaviors for the youngest patients in the dental setting."

"9316065","ABSTRACT In 2015, a total of 229,888 babies were born to women aged 15?19 years, for a live birth rate of 22.3 per 1,000 women in this age group. Although this rate is a significant improvement from a decade ago, considerable health issues surround adolescent mothers and their infants, many of which can be addressed through behavioral change. The goal of this study is to develop and pilot an intervention to address three significant health risks among adolescent mothers. Drawing on our previous research, our interdisciplinary team developed a Multiple Health Behavior Change (MHBC) intervention focused on breastfeeding, healthy eating/active living, and depression prevention. The purpose of this study is to pilot test the MHBC intervention ? momHealth Teen Pregnancy Program (momHealth) to middle - late adolescent pregnant women. Beginning during the third trimester of pregnancy, the technology enhanced intervention includes iPad delivered multi- media based educational modules on each content area spaced in time prenatally and postpartally to 4 weeks; simultaneous educational text messaging; virtual video home visits with project health care professionals (e.g. lactation consultant nurse and psychologists); and virtual peer support groups. Experimental and usual care control groups will be used to test these hypotheses: 1) momHealth will result in significantly longer duration of breastfeeding in days to 3 months; 2) momHealth will result in higher rates of any and exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge, 5 weeks, and 3 months; 3) momHealth will result in significantly lower number of ?red? foods consumed per day at 5 weeks and 3 months postpartum; 4. momHealth will result in significantly more minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity per week at 5 weeks and 3 months postpartum; and 5) momHealth will result in significantly fewer postpartum depressive symptoms as indicated by the total score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 5 weeks, and 3 months postpartum. This is the first pilot MHBC trial targeted at middle adolescent pregnant women to improve breastfeeding outcomes, healthy eating/active living, and depression prevention and has the potential to positively enhance the health of adolescent mothers' and their children."
"9265173","Abstract Ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks pose a serious health challenge worldwide. However, very little is known about this virus, including how it replicates and kills host cells. An unbiased genome-wide functional screen for the host factors that facilitate viral replication and ensuing cell death would provide a path to explore host-virus interaction more deeply since viruses rely on host factors for every step of their life cycle. Here we propose to systematically identify ZIKV host factors in human cells with a genome-wide knockout screening method based on CRISPR- Cas9 that we have developed independently. In preliminary studies, we have identified host factors with high sensitivity and specificity and more importantly, strong phenotypes for West Nile virus (WNV), which is a close flavivirus family member of ZIKV. In addition, we also seek to improve our screening strategy so that host genes with weaker phenotypes will also be identified. Thus, we expect to identify ZIKV host factors to construct a comprehensive human host factor?virus interaction map, and to identify potential therapeutic targets for ZIKV.  "
"9395276","PROJECT SUMMARY Inexpensive and abundant, unactivated alkanes are ideal precursors for the production of commodity chemicals. Common starting materials in industrial processes and ubiquitous motifs in complex molecules, alkenes can be produced from more readily available alkanes through transition-metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation. While heterogeneous catalysis has proven useful in industrial dehydrogenation of low-carbon alkanes, applications in chemical synthesis have been limited due to high temperatures, susceptibility to catalyst-deactivating coking, and low selectivity with longer-chain alkane substrates. In contrast, homogeneous catalytic reactions generally proceed under milder conditions and can be effective in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes. Extensive research has revealed pincer-ligated Ir compounds to be the optimal catalysts, and recent studies have implicated Ir(III) complexes as promising candidates capable of circumventing many limitations of established Ir(I) systems. This application describes the development of a novel protocol for catalytic alkane dehydrogenation by pincer- ligated Ir(III) complexes using the most economical oxidant available, molecular oxygen. The research strategy builds on the previously demonstrated capabilities of a (NCN)Ir(III) complex for mediating alkane dehydrogenation and for regenerating under aerobic conditions. To date, catalysis has remained elusive due to the instability of the Ir(III) complex in the presence of oxygen at the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation. Computational studies suggest that ligation of the Ir(III) metal center with electron-poor pincer ligand frameworks will lower the energy barrier to dehydrogenation. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experimental and computational investigations, the central hypothesis of this research plan is that catalytic dehydrogenation can be realized by reducing the reaction temperature through strategic modification of the pincer ligand supporting the Ir(III) metal center. The specific aims of this application are: 1) synthesis of novel Ir(III) pincer complexes for alkane dehydrogenation, 2) Ir(III)-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenation under aerobic conditions, and 3) dehydrogenation of functionalized organic substrates. The development of a method for Ir(III)-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenation under aerobic conditions will contribute a novel olefin preparation strategy invulnerable to many limitations of current processes while using an environmentally friendly oxidant. The results of this project will greatly impact the preparation of olefin- containing commodity chemicals and complex molecules relevant to human health or intermediates thereto."
"9354526","PROJECT SUMMARY On the morning of December 18th 2014, I arrived in the laboratory early to check on my experiment ? what ended up being the ?rst proof that the Mutagenic Chain Reaction (MCR) functioned as a highly ef?cient CRISPR/Cas-based gene-drive system in fruit ?ies [1]. I later built a similar, albeit more complex, MCR construct in mosquitoes, that was tested in collaboration with the James group (UCI) [2]. As was the case for the fruit ?y element, the mosquito MCR propagates with exceptional ef?ciency (99.5%) via the germline. During this process, my advisor Ethan Bier and I expanded the concept of `active genetics' [4] to a family of genetic elements that actively copy themselves onto the companion chromosome (as in the MCR). These elements bypass the constraints of Mendelian inheritance, thereby potentially overcoming current limitations in laboratory experiments. Gene drive systems can be used to combat vector-borne diseases thereby bene?ting global public health (e.g., malaria eradication), as well as to restore native ecosystems (e.g., suppress invasive species populations). Although I am interested in future applications in diverse ?elds, during the award period I will focus on deepening the knowledge on the mechanism of action of active genetic elements in the fruit ?y. Here I propose to build and characterize in Drosophila melanogaster three categories of active genetic elements: (1) Full MCR-gene drives, (2) Split, ?transcomplementing-MCR?, an alternative that could offer advantages when performing population modi?cation in the wild, (3) Reversal constructs to stop, limit or reverse the spread of a Cas9-based gene drive in the wild. 1) I will examine the basis for the extraordinary ef?ciency of our existing gene drive technology and re?ne its  functionality for future ?eld applications. Several gene drives, based on MCR technology, will be developed  in the fruit ?y. Different regulatory regions will be identi?ed to drive the expression of the Cas9 nuclease in  the most effective time during development while assuring its restriction to germline cells. 2) I will build and test trans-complementing-MCRs in which the two primary MCR components (Cas9 and  gRNAs) are split in two separate transgenic constructs. Each component individually would not generate  inheritance bias; only when combined will these elements reconstitute a gene drive arrangement. This  technology could be used in population suppression schemes where a full gene drive, purposely affecting  ?tness, would otherwise render problematic the ampli?cation of the laboratory population to the levels  necessary for ?eld release. 3) I will develop reversal constructs that can counteract the spread of a Cas9-based gene drive construct in a  population. I will test two different types of such constructs: the ?rst one acts by cutting out and replacing  the gene drive at the same locus at which it is inserted; the second type is located in a different location in  the genome, but carries guide-RNAs able to exploit the Cas9 protein to disrupt the Cas9 gene itself."

"9367437","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to develop a longitudinal study of patterns of care and health outcomes among individuals who were diagnosed with disorders of sex development (DSD). We propose a study of DSD patients from three large integrated health care systems (HCS): Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA), and Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS). These HCS share similarly structured electronic medical records (EMRs) and represent a geographically, socio- economically, and demographically diverse population of nearly 5 million members. Most methods of data collection described in the current application have been successfully implemented in our recently completed or ongoing studies of transgender people. Applying these methods to the 2006-2015 data at the participating sites, we identified 19,233 patients with ?likely DSD? based on diagnoses or keywords in the medical records. In addition, 47,107 individuals were identified as having ?possible DSDs? (e.g., non-specified uterine anomalies or hypospadias). The proposed project will address three areas of importance in DSD research: 1) patterns and guideline-concordance of care; 2) controversies in treatment; and 3) comorbidities and long-term health outcomes. We will use validated EMR data to estimate the percentages of confirmed DSD patients who underwent diagnostic workup and received care according to current recommendations. We will examine whether guideline concordant DSD management is associated with health outcomes, such as the need for additional care and behavioral health problems later in life. The often cited area of disagreement is the optimal timing of sex assignment surgery in cases of atypical or ambiguous genitalia with some advocating early procedures and others arguing for a deferral. Another controversial issue is the common practice of a prophylactic gonadectomy for DSD patients whose karyotype includes Y-chromosome material (+Y DSD). We will use relevant KPSC, KPGA, and KPMA diagnostic and procedure codes to identify genital surgery and gonadectomies. Using these data we will assess the association between timing of gender assignment procedures and surgical complications, gender dysphoria, or other health problems later in life. We will also review pathology reports to estimate the frequency and determinants of ?positive gonadectomy,? i.e., with evidence of malignant or premalignant lesions. We will then compare measures of health status of DSD patients to the corresponding measures among age- and membership matched non-DSD male and non-DSD female HCS enrollees (reference cohort). We will examine the incidence and prevalence of comorbidities and long-term health outcomes across age groups, categories of DSD conditions, and relative to the matched reference cohort. The proposed project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in DSD research and care, EMR-based data collection, epidemiology, and evaluation of health services."

"9334857","Project Summary: Urinary Stone Disease (USD) is an increasingly prevalent and highly recurrent condition associated with major morbidity at a rising cost to society. Thus, improved management can significantly reduce its health burden. Increasing fluid intake is recommended to all USD patients. However, knowledge gaps persist regarding the impact of fluid therapy in preventing USD recurrence including the optimal urine volume, safety of fluid therapy, effectiveness of strategies to achieve and maintain a high urine volume, and whether such strategies reduce USD recurrence. Although ureteral stenting is routinely performed after urological procedures for USD to mitigate peri-operative complications, stents cause significant patient discomfort. The causal mechanisms are only partly understood, and use of new stent biomaterial and medications post-stenting only partly relieve these symptoms. Limiting inflammation is one pathway to reduce stent-related discomfort. Based on current knowledge, we submit the following hypotheses: 1. Compared to standard practice, a strategy achieving a higher urine volume by combining counseling, frequent reminders, and fluid intake modification by feedback, safely reduces USD recurrence. 2. Biological factors identify USD patients likely to develop stent-related symptoms, and oral glucocorticoids reduce stent-related discomfort by mitigating inflammation. To test these hypotheses, we will pursue the following objectives in a multi-center collaborative effort: Aim 1. We will compare USD progression in patients randomized to standard care vs. achievement of a urine volume >2.5 L/day in adult and >30 ml/Kg/day in pediatric USD patients. We will also assess the impact of a customized strategy [combining counseling, frequent reminders (via mobile technology), and modification of fluid intake habits using feedback (from periodic assessment of urine volume surrogates)] on preventing USD recurrence. Aim 2. We will evaluate USD patients undergoing ureteral stent insertion at the time of unilateral ureteroscopy for USD and receiving standard-of-care medications with pre-, and post-procedural psychometric testing to identify predictors of greater stent-related symptoms. Based on the findings, we will randomize high risk patients to a 5-day methylprednisolone course or matching placebo to determine whether methylprednisolone as an adjunctive therapy safely reduces stent- related symptoms. Aim 3. We will collect blood, urine, DNA and stool from stone formers as a resource for USD Research Network investigators and other researchers. To achieve these aims, this application will combine the expertise of established USD researchers and clinicians with a large base of USD patients to participate in a collaborative effort with other USD investigators with the ultimate aim of improving USD patient care."
"9264412","?     DESCRIPTION:     Abstract  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a signature injury of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. TBI causes severe persistent disability including cognitive impairment and mental health problems, resulting in loss of productivity and quality of life for the young Veterans returning from the wars. The long-term health care costs of combat-related TBI have created a huge financial burden and generated serious public and personal crises in the United States. To date, evidence-based treatment for TBI recovery is not yet available. Considering the fact that TBI Veterans are currently in the chronic phase of the disease, there is a critical need to develop neurorestorative strategies for brain repair in the chronic phase of TBI.  Our recent studies have revealed that a stroke-damaged brain is repairable in the chronic phase by the combination of two essential hematopoietic growth factors, stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SCF+G-CSF). Using the same approach, our preliminary studies have demonstrated the neurorestorative efficacy of SCF+G-CSF in brain repair in the chronic phase of TBI. However, it remains unclear how SCF+G-CSF repairs the brain in the chronic phase of TBI and whether SCF+G-CSF treatment could repair a TBI-damaged brain in a delayed chronic phase. The objective of this research proposal is to address these unanswered questions. Based on our recent publications and preliminary data, we hypothesize that SCF+G-CSF repairs a brain in the chronic phase of TBI through neural network rewiring, which is accomplished by its direct regulation of neurons and its indirect effects via bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMDM). Using the approaches of live brain imaging, transgenic mice and targeted knockout mice, neurobehavioral assessments, and cell signaling, the central hypothesis will be tested and the objective of this application wil be achieved by accomplishing the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the contribution of SCF+G-CSF on brain repair in the delayed chronic phase of TBI, Aim 2 will define the role of neural network rewiring in SCF+G-CSF-induced brain repair in chronic TBI, and Aim 3 will identify the involvement of BMDM in SCF+G-CSF-induced brain repair in chronic TBI.  This project is innovative in the unique approach of using hematopoietic growth factors to repair the brain in chronic TBI, which is originally created by our group. This study will significantly advance current knowledge in rehabilitation research for TBI. This research is highly compatible with the objective and scope of the RR&D priority areas for supporting the development of therapeutic strategies on neural plasticity in chronic TBI repair. The contribution of this research is in keeping with the VA mission to ensure that Veterans achieve maximal recovery from combat-related neurotrauma."

"9425588","Pre-hospital care plays a crucial role in determining health outcomes after trauma and out-of-hospital complications of other leading causes of death, such as stroke and heart disease. Yet, it has largely been neglected by the scientific community, leaving assumptions rather than evidence to guide policy decisions on the ambulance type and hospital destination that would optimize a patient?s health outcomes. In previous work, our team compared two competing strategies for delivering emergency ambulance care, advanced life support (ALS) and basic life support (BLS), and found that ALS, which is much more common in the United States, may be less successful in keeping patients alive and as well as possible. In this work, we studied several out-of- hospital medical emergencies using quasi-experimental research methods and a large national sample of Medicare claims from 2006-2011. In our first aim of the proposed work, we will extend this analysis to the under 65 adult Medicaid population, which is particularly important to do for major trauma as younger people sustain different patterns of injury than older adults. In addition to major trauma, we will also study out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, stroke, respiratory failure, and acute myocardial infarction, all of which are time sensitive conditions requiring prompt medical care. The next aim will build upon this and our previous work and analyze choice of hospital destination for ALS and BLS patients. To date, regionalization studies that evaluate outcomes of out-of- hospital medical emergencies at specialty hospitals like trauma centers rarely account for the amount of time spent in pre-hospital care, which is influenced by whether that care was provided by ALS or BLS, or adequately study the trade-off between minimizing travel distance and optimizing hospital characteristics. We will improve upon the existing literature using Medicare and Medicaid claims, regression analysis, and causal inference methods to study the associations and causal relationships between these key factors and survival. To describe the broad implications of our findings, in our third aim we will quantify the potential benefits at the national level of optimizing individual pre-hospital care decisions based on existing resources using a microsimulation model. Finally, for longer-term policymaking, we will assess how shifts in ambulance resources and hospital locations in four states might affect population health outcomes for out-of-hospital medical emergencies. The proposed work will advance safety and quality research for the pre-hospital care system and hospital regionalization and will fill critical gaps in the scientific literature. We expect to provide specific, evidence-based insights that policymakers can use to substantially improve pre-hospital and hospital care for out-of-hospital medical emergencies. Importantly, our use of Medicaid claims and focus on trauma care will be particularly relevant to inner-city, low-income, and minority populations."
"9316724","Project Summary Recent human genetic studies identified a link between a class of centrosomal proteins and microcephaly, which is characterized by a selective reduction of brain size in comparison to other organs. The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel mechanism of microcephaly by understanding how dysregulation of mitotic progression and cell cycle re-entry leads to neural progenitor cell (NPC) reduction in microcephaly. This contrasts with the dominant model in the field that disruption of symmetric/asymmetric division of NPCs causes microcephaly. We will test this mechanism by focusing on WDR62 (MCPH2; OMIM 604317), which is the second most common genetic cause of human microcephaly and encodes a WD-40 repeat protein.  We created a hypomorphic mouse model of Wdr62 deficiency and found that mutant mice exhibited reduced brain sizes due to a decrease in NPCs. Wdr62 deficient NPCs exhibit mitotic progression delay and an increase in cell death. Wdr62 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed reduced spindle stability and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation. Wdr62 physically and genetically interacts with Aurora A, an established spindle assembly factor. In addition, Wdr62 localizes to the basal bodies of primary cilia and regulates cilia disassembly and cell cycle re-entry of MEFs. Depletion of Cep170, another Wdr62 interacting protein, also results in cilia disassembly, suggesting that Wdr62 may function together with Cep170 to regulate cilia biogenesis and cell cycle progression. These preliminary data lead to a novel hypothesis that Wdr62 regulates neural progenitor expansion in the developing brain by influencing mitotic progression and cell cycle re-entry, which are disrupted by disease mutations in a specific manner.  To test this hypothesis, three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Test the hypothesis that Wdr62 regulates mitotic progression of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by influencing spindle integrity; 2) Test the hypothesis that Wdr62 regulates cilia disassembly and cell cycle re-entry by functioning together with Cep170; 3) Test the hypothesis that individual disease alleles of WDR62 compromise its specific functions (mitosis or cilia disassembly) due to loss of regulation of specific Wdr62 interacting proteins. Together, these studies will improve our understanding of mitosis and cell cycle re-entry regulation of NPCs in the developing brain and provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying human microcephaly diseases."

"9351285","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this application is to systematically explore functional and molecular differences in astrocytes from hippocampal and striatal circuits, and thus obtain a quantitative understanding of astrocyte heterogeneity between these regions. Astrocytes are ubiquitous glial cells that interact with neurons via fine specialised distal extensions called processes. These cells serve a variety of important homeostatic roles within circuits, regulate synapse formation/removal and modulate synaptic transmission. It has generally been assumed that astrocytes are a homogenous glue throughout the brain. A significant bottleneck to critically assessing this view has been the lack of data on astrocyte properties in different parts of the brain. Thus we lack information that is necessary to systematically evaluate if astrocytes are functionally diverse within circuits that serve separate functions. The current application seeks to test the hypothesis that astrocytes are diverse in two brain circuitries with distinct functional roles. Specifically, this application seeks to extend insights made in our laboratory that revealed functional differences between striatal and hippocampal astrocytes, and preferential dysfunction of striatal astrocytes in mouse models of Huntington's disease. I will test the hypothesis that astrocytes in the hippocampus and striatum have distinct functional, morphological and molecular properties. This hypothesis gains support from preliminary data shown in the application that I gathered using immunohistochemical analyses of GFAP and Aldh1L1 reporter gene expression in the hippocampus and striatum. Further support comes from ongoing physiological experiments suggesting functional and morphological differences between astrocytes in these two brain regions. I will logically extend these initial findings with three specific aims. The first aim will test the hypothesis that functinal properties of striatal and hippocampal astrocytes differ. The second aim will test the hypothesis that striatal and hippocampal astrocyte morphology and astrocyte network topography differ. The third aim will test the hypothesis that the proteome of hippocampal and striatal astrocytes differ and that this can explain functional differences studied in aims 1 and 2."
"9259447","Project Summary: 1-in-3 persons with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is characterized by progressive renal dysfunction leading to end-stage renal disease. TGF-beta, a protein stimulated in response to elevated blood glucose and systemic inflammation of diabetes, causes fibrotic- thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and damages the structural supports (podocytes) of the kidney's filtration barrier - resulting in impaired renal filtration. The metabolic sequelea of T2DM and CKD also, synergistically, alter skeletal muscle's ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways (degradative pathways), satellite cell function (muscle reparative cells), and mitochondrial health (muscle energetic machinery) -- resulting in muscle breakdown, intermuscular adipose/fibrotic tissue (IMAT) accrual, exercise intolerance, and immobility that exacerbates CKD. The temporal nature of these changes in CKD, however, remains unknown. With mandates from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) urging avenues of treatment that impede the progression of CKD, it is critical now, more than ever, to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to disease progression. This will inform more effective targeted interventions.  We therefore aim to determine how common metabolic changes in T2DM promote renal fibrosis and renal dysfunction, and in-turn, how renal dysfunction dictates the activity of muscle degredative pathways, the status of muscle reparative cells, and the energetic production of muscle. We will also determine the relationship between these muscle pathways and muscle quality, performance and physical mobility. This will be determined across stages of CKD. Muscle pathway analysis will be analyzed via immunoblotting of muscle tissue samples for relative concentrations of key proteins that govern these pathways, while the status of muscle reparative cells will be determined by their expression of specific regulatory genes and their capacity to form mature muscle in an isolated environment. Muscle energetic production will be assessed by Polarographic respiration tracking of muscle mitochondrial oxidative function (via muscle biopsy). Muscle quality will be assessed with MRI. Renal filtration will be estimated via serum concentrations of cystatin C protein, and fibrotic damage assessed via urinary concentrations of pro-fibrotic protein (TGF-beta) and a constituent of the protein support structures of the kidney (Podocalyxin). Muscle performance will be assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer, with physical mobility evaluated with a functional performance test battery.  A cross-sectional research design (15 in each CKD stage; 1/2, 3, and 4/5, total N=45) will be used to examine the relationship between stage of CKD and the specific activity of physiological contributors to muscular decline and how these pathways, in turn, relate to muscle volume, performance, and quality.  This research may advance the understanding of when, how, and what form of exercise may impede/reverse CKD progression in those most at risk ? those with diabetes.    "
"9348639","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stable genetic modification of autologous stem cells using HIV-1 derived lentivirus vectors confers clinical benefit in patients with inherited disorder of hematopoiesis and immunity. Broad tropism for gene delivery to diverse tissues, stable passage of the proviral integrant to all progeny, and the ability to scale production for clinical use provide strong motivation for using this vector system in stem cell gene therapy. Nevertheless, instances of insertional activation of endogenous genes continue to raise concerns for the use of integrating lentivectors in hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. Current non- integrating vectors provide long-term expression in postmitotic tissues, but failure to replicate the episomal vector genome leads to rapid loss in dividing stem cell populations. We recently reported the development of a novel, non-integrating episomal lentivector that faithfully replicates through cell division and expresses a gene of interest - without selection. In distinctin to similar vectors, this anchored Non-Integrating LentiVector (aNILV) avoids heterologous viral sequences and relies on human ?-interferon nuclear scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) locus sequences. Our principal hypothesis is that aNILV will optimize biosafety and provide long-term correction of bone marrow failure in a murine model of Fanconi Anemia. We will develop a second-generation episome vector design (aNILV-II) additionally capable of conversion to backbone-free minicircles to further enhance biosafety and long-term transgene expression. This proposal is uniquely responsive to PAS-13-006: New Directions in Hematology Research (SHINE-II). SPECIFIC AIM 1 [A] Demonstrate aNILV-mediated phenotype correction, biosafety and clonal diversity under physiologic and pharmacological selection in a murine model of Fanconi Anemia (FA) associated bone marrow failure. SPECIFIC AIM 1 [B] Track molecular persistence and multilineage expression during serial transplantation of aNILV transduced human CD34 progenitor cells in immunodeficient mice. SPECIFIC AIM 1 [C] Design a minicircle-delivering lentivector (aNILV-II) and systematically determine its performance in clonally-derived cell lines and in vivo. The proposed platform promises to reconcile the efficiency of lentivector delivery with the inherent biosafety of episomally maintained genomes. This vector system will have a strong translational impact on stem cell gene therapy and may allow for significant cost savings, currently associated with long- term integration site surveillance in patients."
"9388744","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of prenatal brain development. While syndromic forms of ASD have received considerable attention, to what extent findings in these heterogeneous disorders apply also to the broader or idiopathic form of ASD with no identified single genetic risk is unclear. In this project, we will study how the normal trajectory of prenatal neurobiological development of the brain is disrupted in idiopathic ASD. To identify neurobiological factors that are associated with risk or protection from ASD during prenatal development, we will recruit participants from a well-characterized cohort of younger siblings of children with ASD, who were followed longitudinally. The siblings will be either concordant for ASD diagnosis (ASD:ASD; n=12 pairs) or will be discordant (ASD:TYP; n=12 pairs). We will use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived cortical organoids, 3D cellular structures which model in vitro the fetal development of the human cerebral cortex. Organoids will be analyzed by high resolution imaging approaches, molecular tools and transcriptomics. In Aim 1 we will obtain sets of biological measures (excitatory/inhibitory neuron fate, density of synapse, and neuronal arborization), comparing and contrasting phenotypes between ASD:ASD concordant sibs ASD:TYP discordant sibs. This comparison will refine our ability to isolate risk/protective factors that will be exclusively at work in the discordant pairs. In Aim 2 we will perform global gene expression analysis by RNA-seq and network analyses, aiming at finding differences in gene expression and network organization between the ASD:ASD concordant network and the ASD:TYP discordant network. We will perform correlation analyses where neurobiological measures and gene expression will be correlated with each other and with clinical severity scores. The correlations between neurobiological and gene expression measures with symptoms severity may help discriminate between risk and protection. In Aim 3, in collaboration with Project 2, we will obtain structural MRI and BOLD-based functional connectivity data on the concordant (ASD:ASD) and discordant (ASD:TYP) sib pairs that participate in Aim 1 and Aim 2 studies. We will then make correlations between imaging and neurobiological and gene expression measures. We hypothesize that increased inhibitory neuron fate in ASD may be correlated with less efficient cortical network connectivity and that increased synaptogenesis and neuronal arborization may be correlated with higher gray matter ratio, and also to altered connectivity. This project will feed data to the statistical core, where imaging and neurobiological measures can be used to predict clinical severity, allowing a more powerful analysis of risk factors for ASD. In summary, our in vitro ASD risk human cellular model will allow, in principle, to develop future biomarkers for early diagnosis and the exploration of new treatment options based on the underlying biology.  "

"9468952","PROJECT SUMMARY  The way the genome is arranged in the nucleus plays an important role in gene regulation but several aspects remain unknown. Genomes are spatially organized into compartments further made up of megabase structures called topologically associating domains (TADs) that have similar chromatin modifications and histone marks. TAD boundaries are demarcated by the Cohesin complex and the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF). It is presumed that response elements, segments of DNA where transcription factors typically bind to increase or decrease gene transcription, interact with promoters of genes within the scope of a TAD. DNA response elements can be far apart on a linear genome but chromatin loops bring these elements in proximity of gene promoters for gene transcription in the nucleus. I aim to investigate the relationship between gene transcription and two higher-order genome structures, chromatin loops and TADs. It has proven difficult to identify response elements and their cognate promoters thus the relationship between metazoan transcriptional regulation and genomic arrangements has not been defined.  The first objective of this project is to identify functional response elements and their cognate regulated promoters (Aim 1). I will exploit the properties of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcriptional regulatory factor whose genomic binding and regulatory activities require prior binding by glucocorticoid ligands. Glucocorticoid receptor response elements (GREs) are segments of DNA that confer a regulatory action in vivo but it is not known which GR binding site is a GRE and which specific gene it targets. I will then assess the formation and positions of chromatin loops relative to validated glucocorticoid response element (GRE) ? promoter pairs, and test for loop degeneracy (Aim 2). Finally, I shall examine whether TAD boundaries limit looping and GRE action (Aim 3).  This proposal will be the first to properly identify GREs and their target genes. This work will provide us with insight regarding gene regulation and TAD regulatory structure."
"9322674","Project Summary    Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the causative agent in over 80% of urinary tract infections (UTIs).  On average, 8-­9 million people are treated for uncomplicated UTIs and over 1 million people are diagnosed  with hospital-­acquired UTIs annually in the US. Complications of UPEC infections include recurrent UTIs,  ascending infection into the ureters and kidneys resulting in pyelonephritis, and in severe cases, urosepsis and  death. Identifying and characterizing the mechanistic functions of UPEC virulence factors will lead to improved  prevention protocols and treatment for complicated UTIs. The hemolysin exotoxin (HlyA) is an important UPEC  virulence factor. HlyA is expressed in 31-­48% of E. coli recovered from uncomplicated UTIs, while in strains  isolated from cases of pyelonephritis or urosepsis, 50-­78% of strains express HlyA. At high doses, HlyA is  cytotoxic to a wide range of cell types and species, although the mechanism for initiating cell death remains  unclear. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that a host receptor or signaling pathway is subverted  by HlyA to cause cell death. A genome-­wide selection of a CRISPR/Cas9 mutated library of eukaryotic cells  was performed to identify host factors that are required for HlyA-­mediated cell death. Two hits were identified,  the integrin b?2 subunit and signal peptide peptidase-­like protein 3 (SPPL3), a protease involved in regulation of  cellular glycosylation. This research plan is designed to validate the top candidates by discrete CRISPR/Cas9  mediated genome targeting to disrupt genes of interest. Preliminary data in cell lines with the subunits of b?2  family integrins targeted for disruption individually reveals that none of the individual alpha subunits of b?2  integrins are necessary for HlyA cytotoxicity. The sufficiency of the four possible b?2 family members for HlyA  cytotoxicity will be assess in this proposal. Based on the receptor range for HlyA, the interaction of HlyA with b?2  family integrins will be characterized using site-­directed mutagenesis targeting regions of interest. The role of  SPPL3 in HlyA mediated cytotoxicity will be validated by genetic disruption using CRISPR/Cas9. A protease-­ deficient form of SPPL3, which cannot regulate glycosylation, will be used to complement SPPL3-­deficient  cells to investigate additional roles for SPPL3 in HlyA cytotoxicity. The glycosylation state of b?2 family integrins  will be examined in SPPL3 deficient and overexpressing cell lines. Finally, the receptor-­mediated activity of  HlyA will be examined in a species specific manner. Human cells expressing b?2 receptors are 100-­fold more  sensitive to HlyA cytotoxic activity than mouse cells expressing b?2 receptors. If the interaction is species  specific, in vivo work in the mouse model cannot accurately assess the role of HlyA in human UPEC infections  and the generation of a humanized mouse model will be warranted. This work will provide important insight into  the mechanistic function of HlyA-­mediated cytotoxicity and provide the groundwork for therapeutic intervention  in complicated UTIs."
"9349369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Weight-related problems including obesity, poor eating behaviors, and inadequate physical activity are prevalent among emerging adults and have adverse physical and psychosocial consequences. Obesity is one of the most significant public health problems facing young people today. Emerging adulthood is one of the most rapid periods of growth and development as young people undergo identity formation and changes in interpersonal influences (becoming more independent from parents and more aligned with friends). College freshmen are at particular risk as they generally have very poor diets and low levels of physical activity, which have been associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity into adulthood. Recently NIH has called for the development of multi-level studies to better understand and address obesity and other weight-related problems, and there is a lack of research focusing on the role of friends in population-based samples of college students. It is crucial to identify longitudinal mechanistic and contextual factors among friendship networks of young people at greatest risk for obesity and weight-related problems. The identification of multi-level predictors of key weight-related behaviors and outcomes among friendship networks will guide the development of more comprehensive and effective interventions to promote healthy eating, physical activity and weight status in emerging adults. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to assess the role in which friendship networks are involved in nutrition and physica activity behaviors and risk for excess weight gain among college freshmen. To accomplish this aim, we will use a mixed-methods approach, capitalizing on the unique opportunities at Arizona State University which includes high percentages of students from ethnic/racial minority (40%) and low-income (40% are Pell Grant recipients) backgrounds who are at greatest risk for obesity. We will collect qualitative and multiple sources of quantitate data, each complementing the other, to longitudinally track how friendships are created, and better describe the mechanisms by which friends are prospectively associated with weight-related behaviors and outcomes. We will also collect data on contextual aspects of the students' networks (e.g., type of friendship, race/ethnicity) to capture information that can be used to create targeted interventions. Innovative research methodologies (i.e., ecological momentary assessments and university databases) will be utilized to survey friends of participating students across an academic year to explore friends' potential impact on freshmen's weight-related outcomes. The proposed study builds upon our research team's experience, and expands to address new areas that are emerging as important in addressing obesity and related problems in young people, creating an ideal environment for a young investigator to become an independent researcher. Findings from this innovative, comprehensive study on the role of friends and social networks will guide the development of more effective interventions to prevent and treat weight-related behaviors and outcomes among college students."
"9526679","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPAs) offer a powerful functional proteomic approach to investigate molecular mechanisms and response to therapy in cancer. MD Anderson Cancer Center has been a leader in the implementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers of samples in a cost-effective, sensitive and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~300 protein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated through its selection as the sole platform for characterizing >10,000 patient samples through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); and recently it has been designated as one of two NCI Genome Characterization Centers, and will characterize up to ~10,000 samples from ongoing NCI initiatives and other consortium projects. For TCGA project, the applicants built The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), a web platform for visualizing and analyzing RPPA data, which has a community of >5,000 users worldwide. The long-term goal is to promote the ability of functional proteomics to impact cancer research and the development of relevant therapeutic strategies. The current objective is to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and datasets, and to enhance and improve its existing analytic capabilities. Working relationships have been formed to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatic resources (e.g., cBio, UCSC Genome Browsers, Firehose and Synpase) and other ITCR projects. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing RPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental design, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities. Aim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web platform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide pathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis of cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web platform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort will provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other tools. The expected outcome is the first, dedicated bioinformatic resource that fully integrates RPPA data generation, analysis and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic data in a rich context. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of RPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers biomedical researchers face in mining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating proteomic data into other widely used bioinformatic resources; and directly facilitate development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine."
"9384272","Alcohol consumption impairs motor coordination, attentional efforts and memory function. Alcohol-impaired driving accounted in 2013 for ~31% of all traffic accidents resulting in 10,076 fatalities and $59 billion crash-related cost. We propose to study the mechanisms how ethanol affects brain state-dependent neural signaling. Brain state-dependent signaling comprises adjustments in cellular and circuit activity to optimize how the brain processes information in a distinct behavioral context. We and others have used a locomotion paradigm to reveal that noradrenergic signaling is involved when such optimizations occur. At transitions from rest to locomotion astroglia, the support cells in the central nervous system, are norepinephrine-dependently activated simultaneously in brain regions as disparate as the cerebellum and primary visual cortex. The noradrenergic system is involved to support attentional efforts and in gating synaptic plasticity. It has long been known that alcohol can suppress the activity of locus coeruleus, the structure where noradrenergic neurons are clustered; however, it is still unclear what the consequences are for the activity of individual brain cells during active behavior. We propose to test the hypothesis that alcohol severely impairs brain state-dependent noradrenergic neuromodulation in an astroglia-dependent manner. Our approach is to combine specific mouse lines for cell type-selective genetic manipulation and expression of Ca2+ sensors with our motorized linear treadmill and two-photon microscopy to study Ca2+ dynamics and electrical activity in well-controlled behavioral states. These in vivo investigations will be complemented with acute slice Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology experiments. We will focus our investigations on the cerebellum for its relatively straightforward circuit arrangement that facilitates mechanistic studies. The novel utilization of a specific Cre mouse line will enable us to selectively manipulate Bergmann glia, the astrocytes of the cerebellar molecular layer, but not astrocytes of the granule cell layer. We will pursue the following aims: (1) We will define extent and mechanism of the effect of acute ethanol on locomotion-induced Bergmann glia Ca2+ activation. (2) We will reveal ethanol-sensitive components of locomotion-induced Purkinje cell Ca2+ dynamics and dissect the relationship to Bergmann glia function. (3) We will investigate how locomotion- induced Purkinje cell Ca2+ dynamics regulate intrinsic and synaptic activity. Upon conclusion of our proposed studies we will have learned what components of brain state-dependent noradrenergic neural signaling are impaired by ethanol. This work will reveal how ethanol might exert its detrimental effects on attentional efforts and memory on the cellular and circuit level. These studies will further build the groundwork for future research on brain state-dependent neural signaling under neurodegenerative and neurobehavioral conditions associated with changes in noradrenergic signaling, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorder."

"9388742","Limited attention to faces of conspecifics constitutes one of the markers of ASD.1-4 Limited attention to faces is associated with increased severity of autism symptoms and poor adaptive functioning,5-8 and early individual differences in attention to faces contribute to the variability in later social and cognitive outcomes.5 Attention to faces is enhanced in 6-month-old unaffected females at familial risk for ASD and predicts better social functioning 1.5 years later.9 Despite the well-documented role that monitoring faces of conspecifics plays in socio-cognitive development, the brain mechanisms underlying such deficits in ASD are unknown and treatments typically focus on ameliorating symptoms rather than addressing underlying causes. Considering that signs of atypical attention to faces are evident by 6 to 9 months in infants later diagnosed with ASD both in laboratory1-3, 10 and real-world environments, 11-13, [Preliminary Study (PS#1)], we hypothesize that the neural foundations for these impairments are already reflected in functional brain organization (the connectome) at birth. Attentional functions in the brain are subserved by the Salience Network (SN), the Executive Control Network (ECN), and the Default Mode Network (DMN), all of which have been implicated in ASD,14-16 and have been found to be atypical in newborns at risk for ASD due to non-familial factors (PS#2). Here we propose to examine whether, when compared to unaffected high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) newborns, HR newborns who, at 24 months, meet criteria for ASD exhibit abnormal strength of functional connectivity within the three networks. We will also examine whether the strength of functional connectivity in the three networks at birth is predictive of later performance on a selective social attention (SSA) eye-tracking task at 6 and 24 months and severity of autism symptoms at 24 months. By targeting neonates, we plan to investigate properties of attentional networks known to be affected in ASD14-16 before they are shaped extensively by extra-uterine experience. To achieve these aims, we propose to study 120 neonates who have an older sibling with ASD (HR) and 30 neonates without familial history of ASD (LR). The neonates will undergo a resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) at 42-44 post-menstrual weeks and at 6 and 24 months will be administered the SSA task. Performance on this task discriminates between ASD and non-ASD groups during prodromal stages of the disorder in high-risk siblings of children with ASD,1 in clinic-referred toddlers newly diagnosed with ASD,17 and in school-age children (PS#3) and shows strong associations with autism symptom severity5 (PS#3). Diagnostic assessment will be completed at 24 months through which severity of autism symptoms and diagnostic grouping will be determined. The project advances integration of psychological and brain science in autism by investigating whether functional brain organization in ASD is altered at birth and, if so, how this disruption affects social development in infants at risk for ASD."

To date, the TL1 Training Program has trained medical and graduate students recruited from all partner institutions. The TL1 trainees are fully integrated into CTSC activities and have access to all services provided by CTSC partners. Building on our successful training program developed over the last 10 years, we will introduce new technologies with an emphasis on team-based research, creativity and entrepreneurship, informatics, and precision medicine. Additionally, we are building more flexibility in training to include an expanded (10 weeks) intensive program for medical students and PhD students, a research experience that will be instrumental in sparking interest and drawing trainees into the world of C/T research. A unique summer program is available for bioengineers to introduce them to clinical research and medicine funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Externships and mini-sabbaticals with biopharmaceutical companies and government agencies will also enrich trainees? exposure to diverse career options in clinical and translational research. To enhance efficiency, pre-doctoral MD and PhD students and pre-doctoral DSN and DPT students at Hunter College School of Nursing will be eligible for dual degree programs during their doctoral training. Flexibility will be built in allowing rolling entry with PACT approval. In this program, trainees can elect an area of concentration in clinical and translational (C/T) research within the Masters Degree in C/T Investigation after completing the core curriculum and a C/T capstone research project. A short-term clinical summer immersion education program will be offered to biomedical engineering PhD students. The overall program will be enriched with workshops, seminars, and courses in creativity, entrepreneurship, team science and informatics.

"9338314","Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease due to deficiency of alpha-Liduronidase.  Recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) is available as laronidase (trade name  Aldurazyme) for intravenous delivery to treat physical disease due to MPS I. While partially effective for  physical disease, intravenous rhIDU does not treat neurological symptoms of MPS I, because the blood-brain  barrier prevents the bulk of the administered protein from entering the central nervous system (CNS).  Patients with MPS I suffer from progressive neurological disease, including cognitive decline and dementia,  as well as spinal cord compression, hearing and vision problems, hydrocephalus and headaches. Our  preclinical research has found that intrathecal (IT) administration of rhIDU can disperse throughout the  neuraxis, reach deep brain structures and remove brain lysosomal storage in MPS I dogs. We have treated  a small number of MPS I subjects with IT rhIDU for disease-related spinal cord compression and have found  no significant safety concerns for this approach. Currently, we are conducting a 2-year randomized study of  IT rhIDU for cognitive decline in MPS I patients, which was funded as a pilot project by the LDN  (NCT008523580). This new project would permit a five-year extension study for participants in the pilot  project, which would allow us to collect long-term data on safety and efficacy. The primary safety outcome  measure will be the rate and severity of treatment-related adverse effects. The primary efficacy outcome  measure will be the mean intra-subject change in memory score between baseline and the subject's final  visit. Other important efficacy measures are changes in scores of tests of other neuropsychological domains  and changes in 3 Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, such as volumes, morphology,  diffusion abnormalities and white matter fiber tracking. Currently, there are no treatment options for the brain  in MPS I patients, except for the youngest, most severely affected patients, who may be considered for  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. If successful, intrathecal rhIDU would bring major innovation to the  clinical care of MPS I patients."
"9408803","Core 3: CryoEM Summary Since the CRNA?s inception, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has been a key structural biology technology provided through the CryoEM Core. During CRNA 1.0 we made many advances in developing cryoEM procedures for studying the structures of small RNAs, initiated CryoEM projects with several CRNA investigators, and held cryoEM workshops to inspire CRNA members and others to use this powerful structure technique. Our most notable achievements are reaching a major technical milestone in determining a subnanometer resolution cryoEM structure of the 30 kDa HIV-1 dimerization initiation site (DIS) RNA dimer and revising the current Rev response element (RRE) structure with rigorous cryoEM structure validation protocols. These studies were done in collaboration with multiple CRNA groups, including Marchant, Summers and Case, to integrate structural information from cryoEM, NMR and molecular dynamics. The DIS structure represents the smallest macromolecule structure determined to date by cryoEM. Moving into CRNA 2.0, we have extended our team to include investigators with complementary expertise from Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Virginia and NIH. We have set three aims: (i) to utilize state-of-the-art cryoEM as a tool for determining the highest possible resolution structures of RNAs, RNA-protein complexes and HIV- related protein complexes, in collaboration with investigators from the CRNA projects and throughout the CRNA; (ii) to develop new experimental and computational protocols in cryoEM for characterizing challenging specimens of RNA and RNA-protein complexes, which are either small, compositionally or conformationally variable, or both; and (iii) to integrate measurements from NMR, X-ray crystallography, cryoEM, molecular dynamics simulation, and biochemistry for partial or intact biological complexes relevant to the CRNA research missions in order to understand their structure and function. In addition, we will continue to offer systematic, hands-on cryoEM training to CRNA students and postdoctoral fellows so that they will become more versatile structural biologists in the coming decades."

"9527263","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanism of aggregation in neurodegenerative disease has been investigated by numerous laboratories and although the process is still elusive, significant progress has been made in defining different stages of the process. To fight these debilitating illnesses it is not only critical to characterize aggregation processes but alsoto understand the mechanisms of aggregation inhibition. N-terminally acetylated a-synuclein (Ac-aS) is a small neuronal intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that self-associates in pathological ways to oligomers and fibrils in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. In contrast, a highly homologous IDP protein, acetylated ß- synuclein (Ac-ßS) that co-localizes with Ac-aS, does not self-associate into fibrils but can act as a neuro-protector of Ac-aS toxicity in vivo to inhibit pathological Ac-aS fibrillation. In light of the incredible importance of neurodegenerative diseases and their threat to global health in the ageing population, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of inhibition is critical. At this stage very little known about these processes and about the specific inter-molecular interactions that guide inhibition versus aggregation. The goal of this proposal is to use NMR and other biophysical techniques, in conjunction with cell toxicity studies, to provide the first molecular description of the complexes that exist at the different stages of inhibition. In this grant we will: (1) characterize the influnce of different aS/ßS sequences, or structural units, on the potential to accelerate/inhibit fibril formation by the natural inhibitor ßS and its toxic mutants; (2) map interactive regions that define the earliest stages of inhibition; and (3) undertake the molecular characterization and toxicity studies of aS, ßS and hetero aS/ßS oligomers. The outcome of the proposed work will be to advance our fundamental understanding of the 'structure-toxicity' relationship of aS/ßS inhibition and to address more global questions about the location, nature and specificity of inhibitory interactions. These studies will provide a framework for identifying specific interactios that are important for disrupting toxic oligomers and for proposing novel targets for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease. The approaches developed here can be more widely applied to other cross amyloid interactions that have been shown to play a critical role in neurodegenerative disease, such as the interaction between aS and amyloid-ß-protein, or aS and tau."
"9335178","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as interval or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics."

Twin Cities PBS BRAINedu: A Window into the Brain/Una Ventana al Cerebro is a national Spanish/English informal education project providing culturally competent programming and media resources about the brain?s structure and function to Hispanic middle school students and their families. The project responds to the need to eliminate proven barriers to Hispanic students? STEM/neuroscience education, increase Hispanic participation in neuroscience and mental health careers and increase Hispanic utilization of mental health resources. The program?s goals are to engage Hispanic learners and families by 1) empowering informal STEM educators to provide culturally competent activities about the brain?s structure and function; 2) demonstrating neuroscience and mental health career options; and 3) reducing mental health stigma, thus increasing help-seeking behavior. The hypothesis underpinning BRAINedu?s four-year project plan is that participating Hispanic youth and families will be able to explain how the brain works and describe specific brain disorders; demonstrate a higher level of interest of neuroscience and mental health careers and be more willing to openly discuss and seek support for brain disorders and mental health conditions. To achieve program goals, Twin Cities PBS (TPT) will leverage existing partnerships with Hispanic- serving youth educational organizations to provide culturally competent learning opportunities about brain health to Hispanic students and families. TPT will partner with neuroscience and mental health professionals, cultural competency experts and Hispanic-serving informal STEM educators to complete the following objectives: 1) Develop bilingual educational resources for multigenerational audiences; 2) Provide professional development around neuroscience education to informal educators, empowering them to implement programming with Hispanic youth and families, and 3) Develop role model video profiles of Hispanic neuroscience professionals, and help partner organizations produce autobiographical student videos. We will employ rigorous evaluation strategies to measure the project?s impact on Hispanic participants?: a) understanding of neuroscience and brain health, particularly around disorders that disproportionately affect the Hispanic community; b) motivation to pursue neuroscience or mental health career paths; and c) mental health literacy and help-seeking behavior. The project will directly reach 72 Hispanic-serving informal STEM educators and public health professionals, and 200 children and 400 parents in underserved urban, suburban and rural communities nationwide."
"9484083","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental toxicants can induce changes in the epigenomic status of exposed cells, resulting in altered gene expression, which can consequently lead to human diseases such as cancer. The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, is expected to play a key role in this process upon exposure to these toxicants. However, how these epigenomic changes are brought about in response to environmental toxicant exposure is far from being understood. One major toxicant is the prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) which is found in air pollution generated by incomplete combustion of organic materials. To understand important upstream events for implementing epigenomic status in response to environmental toxicants, we will study the effect of B[a]P on higher-order chromatin structure (such as chromatin looping formed via inter- or intra-chromosomal interactions). Epigenomic status and subsequent gene expression profiles of individual genes are governed at the level of higher-order chromatin structure. We will address the role of the genome organizer protein SATB1 in the process of conformational changes of chromatin induced by B[a]P. SATB1 can establish higher-order chromatin folding, affect the epigenomic status at hundreds of its target genes, and reprogram gene expression genome-wide in response to external signaling. Thus, we propose the hypothesis that SATB1 is a critical driver in executing the effects of environmental toxicants in affected cells at the level of higher-order chromatin structure. If so, the gene regulatory role of the ligand-activated AhR after B[a]P exposure would be greatly altered under the influence of SATB1. We will determine the effect of gene expression patterns in response to B[a]P exposure using our breast epithelial MCF10A tumor progression series, containing SATB1- expressing and non-expressing cells. We will determine genomic binding sites of AhR (and its associating partner, ARNT) and SATB1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by deep sequencing to find if any SATB1 and AhR-ARNT complex binding sites merge upon B[a]P exposure, and we will examine the biological consequences of B[a]P exposure of the cells expressing varying levels of SATB1. We aim to assess whether B[a]P exposure promotes malignancy to a degree dependent on the SATB1 levels in the exposed cells. The potential role of a genome organizer in controlling ligand-activated AhR after exposure to environmental toxicants has never been addressed to date, and testing this hypothesis will likely provide a valuable new perspective for the field of environmental health science."
"9438657","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The recent and devastating Ebola outbreak exposed the need for greater investment in health and human resources in Liberia. Supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Liberian-U.S. Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus (PREVAIL) was developed as an emergency, collaborative research endeavor to conduct clinical trials for Ebola vaccines and therapeutics to help end the suffering from Ebola virus infection. Although the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak is over, the history of 33 prior Ebola outbreaks tells us that we must continue to prepare. The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in collaboration with the University of Liberia (UL), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), will develop and implement a rigorous training program in clinical and epidemiological research methods for Liberian investigators and health professionals. The primary aim of training is to build the capacity of Liberians to become independent clinical investigators who can successfully implement high-quality clinical and epidemiologic research addressing key areas of importance in Ebola virus and other emerging infectious diseases. The eventual goal is to enable UL to support its own Master's (MS) Degree in Clinical Research by having nurtured and mentored a core group of well-trained investigators who can in turn become leaders in their field. Specifically, we will enroll Liberian health professionals in UCSF's program Training in Clinical Research (TICR) that provides rigorous training in clinical research, epidemiology, biostatistics, implementation science and analysis of original research, and confers a two-year MS Degree in Clinical Research. The degree requires practical research training that will be performed in collaboration with PREVAIL. PREVAIL scientists will also co-mentor trainees along with UCSF and UCLA faculty. The School of Public Health at UCLA brings many years of experience with emerging infectious disease research and training in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The training plan is based on over two decades of experience at UCSF's Global Health Sciences and the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, in training international investigators, post-doctoral scholars, and junior faculty. In addition to providing Master's level training, we will also offer advanced training in how to be a successful mentor, which is critical to nurturing junior investigators, but is rarely formally supported as part of the academic or research culture in sub-Saharan Africa. This D71 application describes the planning process for developing a Global Infectious Disease Research Training Program (D43).The D43- funded training will strengthen the capacity of scientists and health research professionals in Liberia to conduct independent, high-quality infectious disease epidemiologic and clinical research relevant to a successful public health response to emerging infectious diseases."
"9353558","PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT  Age-associated thymic involution plays a critical role in the deterioration of T cell-mediated immunity, thereby contributing to the increased susceptibility of older individuals to infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmunity. The involuted thymus produces fewer naïve T cells impairing the generation of protective immune responses against newly encountered antigens; moreover, defects in the aged thymic environment may lead to inefficient central tolerance induction, potentially contributing to the increased incidence of autoimmunity with age. Thymocyte maturation depends on indispensable survival, differentiation, and proliferative cues provided by heterogeneous thymic stromal cells. Deterioration of the thymic stromal compartment is largely responsible for age-associated thymic involution. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in stromal decline and the precise impact on T cell development and selection remain unknown. The premise of Project 3 is that declining function of aging thymic stromal cells is due to altered gene expression that impairs multiple stages of T cell differentiation. We hypothesize that identifying specific molecular and cellular age-associated defects in thymic stromal cells will provide a basis for devising strategies to restore thymic function to maintain a healthy T cell compartment throughout the lifespan. In Aim 1, we will determine if the loss of early thymocyte progenitors (ETP) during thymic involution is due to an age- associated decline in the quantity and/or quality of ETP niches, and whether effective rebound therapies restore the ETP niche. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that as the thymic epithelial cell (TEC) compartment deteriorates, thymocytes are no longer efficiently recruited into the medulla, and negative selection is impaired, which could allow escape of autoreactive T cells. In Aim 3, we will perform transcriptional profiling to identify age-regulated genes expressed in TEC that regulate TEC homeostasis and support of thymopoiesis. Subsequent functional analysis will determine the impact of candidate genes on thymic function.  P3 has multiple points of intersection with all other Projects and Cores. For example, we will provide data on molecular signatures of aging mouse TEC and endothelial cells (EC) and corresponding human thymic data (Core C) to the Human-Mouse Timeline (P1). For analysis of ETP niche quantity, we will collaborate with Core B, which will also provide general Biostatistics support throughout. Analysis of age-associated changes in TEC and EC will be integrated (through Core A) with data from P2 on changes in EC that impact thymic rebound. In addition, we will compare molecular and cellular drivers of thymic involution with aging-associated changes identified in lymph nodes (P4), to facilitate design of novel strategies to rejuvenate both central and peripheral lymphoid organs (Core D). Thus, the results generated in P3 are integral to achieving the overall Program goals of elucidating mechanisms responsible for thymic and peripheral immunosenescence, and devising and evaluating rational therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate the T cell compartment."

"9334335","Project Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments to date. Progressive striatal atrophy caused by the selective loss of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is a hallmark of HD. Transcriptional dysregulation occurs early in the course of HD progression and is thought to play a central role in this disease. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, including posttranslational modification of histones, play important roles in the transcriptional dysregulation observed in HD. A significant gap in our current understanding of this disease is the lack of an integrated epigenetic and transcriptional landscape in the at-risk neuronal subpopulation, the striatopallidal MSN. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover therapeutic strategies that target early epigenetic and transcriptional abnormalities in a specific, disease-relevant neuronal subpopulation to prevent neurodegeneration. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify and integrate the epigenome and transcriptome specifically in striatopallidal MSNs in HD model mice in vivo. The two specific aims are as follows: 1) To identify key HD- associated mRNA changes in striatopallidal MSNs; and 2) To identify key HD-associated epigenetic changes in striatopallidal MSNs in HD. The proposed research overcomes current limitations of gene expression and chromatin analysis in normal and diseased neurons in vivo by using a combination of a recently developed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique and next-generation sequencing. Unique HD mouse models, which express genetically-tagged ribosomes specifically in striatopallidal MSNs, will be utilized for the isolation of cell type-specific mRNA and chromatin from brain for RNA-sequencing (seq) and ChIP-seq analysis. Furthermore, among the differentially regulated genes discovered in the first aim, critical genes and upstream regulatory mechanisms that contribute to cellular phenotypes caused by the mutant HD protein will be identified using physiologically relevant and complementary mouse and human neuronal culture systems. Identification of key alterations in the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape in the at-risk neuronal subpopulation in HD will provide fundamental insights into important epigenetic mechanisms that drive transcriptional dysregulation and subsequent neurodegeneration. Such findings are expected to have an important positive impact in the field of neurodegenerative disease since identified molecular changes will likely provide novel therapeutic targets for HD."
"9376997","Project Summary The research objectives in this proposal are aimed at increasing our basic understanding of how Eya2 and Eya3, co-factors to the transcriptional activator Six1, may mimic their embryonic roles as they function in the muscle cancer rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). With five year survival rates less than 30% and few targeted molecular therapies available, pediatric patients facing this deadly disease depend primarily on surgery and radiation for treatment. Long term effects of these treatments include severe, disabling and life-threatening effects (i.e. secondary tumors), which are experienced by more than 50% of childhood cancer survivors. Therefore, therapies with much lower toxicities, including those currently in development which are directed specifically at Eya-Six1, are of high interest, especially for young patients. However the functions of individual Eya family members in RMS progression, which will be investigated here, may affect whether these targeted therapies are appropriate for RMS patients. Previous studies of Eya proteins have demonstrated that biological context can have diverse effects on their function, as extreme as promoting tumor progression through enhancing cellular immortalization versus participating in tumor suppressive activities such as triggering apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis of RMS gene expression indicates divergent roles for Eya proteins in this disease in particular, as Eya2 levels are significantly increased while Eya3 levels are significantly decreased in RMS tumors compared to normal muscle controls. This oppositional expression aligns with the dissimilar roles previously observed for these two Eya proteins in normal muscle development, in addition to recent evidence for varied immune roles. As embryonic programs are often usurped by tumor cells, this proposal is focused on investigating whether Eya2 and Eya3 function divergently in normal muscle and immune development and how these diverse roles may contribute to RMS progression by Eya2 versus RMS suppression by Eya3. Zebrafish will be utilized for these studies as CRISPR gene knockout strategies, ease of embryonal investigations and an existing RMS model all align to make this an ideal organism for these experiments. Data collected here has the potential to impact future drug design and expand treatment options for RMS patients."
"9364757","Protein/polymer Devices for Slow-release of Immunotherapies to Treat Ovarian Cancer Summary  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death amongst gynecologic diseases, with over 100,000 deaths per year worldwide. Prognosis is poor, because patients often present with disseminated disease. We propose an immunotherapy approach using a virus-like particle (VLP) technology and in situ vaccination. Using soluble VLPs and weekly treatment sessions, we have achieved potent efficacy in a hyper-aggressive mouse model of ovarian cancer (ID8vegf/defb29 cells and C57BL6 mice) with 50% animals being cured from the disease. To alleviate the need for repeated treatment sessions and to further increase potency of the approach, we propose to formulate VLPs into a slow-release vaccine delivery device using melt-based polymer processing methods. The clinical utility of such a device would be immense. Ovarian cancer is typically treated by surgical debulking followed by an aggressive regimen of chemotherapy. The PIs envision a simple modification to the treatment work-flow, where a small degradable implant is left in the IP cavity, releasing the in situ vaccine over the course of weeks-to-months. Such a device would eliminate repeated and painful IP injections and lead to enhanced efficacy due to depot effects related to immune priming. A strong set of preliminary data indicate feasibility of the approach: we demonstrate stability of VLP/polymer blends manufactured through melt-based extrusion. Data indicate that VLPs retain their macromolecular structure after melt-based processing into a slowly-degrading poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer. The manufacturing technique is critically important to incorporate sufficient amounts of VLP therapeutic into an implantable device; 100% of the active therapeutic is incorporated in melt-processing, where up to 70% can be lost during solvent-based encapsulation. Furthermore, the manufacturing process is universally accepted in industry, making the device highly translatable. The innovation within our team lies in coupling the in situ vaccination technology with polymer device manufacturing to enable a next-generation treatment of ovarian cancer. VLP/polymer blends will be developed through melt-extrusion processing; the engineering space is vast and will be defined within this proposal by vaccine loading levels ranging from 1-25% VLP/PLGA (w/w%) and manipulation of formulation components to tune release rates from weeks to months. The efficacy of the vaccine devices will be evaluated using mouse models of ovarian cancer. We will determine the anti-tumor efficacy and immune priming capabilities comparing soluble VLP vs. VLP devices. The fate of soluble vs. released VLP will be determined through non-invasive imaging coupled to immunological analysis to gain insights into the underlying mechanism of the stimulated anti-tumor immune response. In summary, the PIs propose a disruptive treatment formulation for metastatic ovarian cancer. The multiple-PI leadership team brings complementary expertise in polymer/protein blends and VLP-based in situ vaccination, and are thus uniquely poised to execute the research."

This proposal has three primary scientific goals. (1) We will develop infrastructure and analytical tools to harmonize heterogeneous genomic datasets ascertained for the study of complex disease, as demonstrated on DNA sequencing data from over 50,000 individuals; (2) we will design statistical frameworks to identify functional mutations in T2D and analyze their biological consequences, taking advantage of existing data and resources on genetic variation, transcription, and epigenetics; and finally (3) we will democratize access to genomic data by creating user-friendly portals with automated analytical pipelines and intuitive features for data exploration. The software, methods, and web portals we build will help overcome the barriers that currently inhibit the translation of genomic data into biological knowledge and therapeutic insights for T2D."
"9335419","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear organization of DNA is complex and consists of multiple layers. At the lowest resolution, large sections of chromosomes are packed in territories, at a higher level chromosomal regions are organized in topologically-associated domains that provide a framework for interactions of transcription factors (TFs) bound to promoters and distal regulatory elements (enhancers), and finally the structural interplay of regulators, RNA polymerase II, and chromatin then lead to regulated gene expression. In recent years, a number of methods called chromatin (conformation) capture (CC) have been developed and used to capture dynamic and stable DNA contacts that constitute genome architecture and potential regulatory interactions. A major limitation of these methods is that they all depend on a single crosslinker, formaldehyde, which crosslinks DNA to proteins as well as proteins to other proteins. This complicates the interpretation of the observed 'DNA-DNA' contacts and it lacks distance information. Here we propose an orthogonal strategy, named Distance-Hi-C (D-Hi-C), where we design, test, and apply a battery of photo-activated crosslinkers, designed to directly measure distances between interacting sites genome-wide. These bivalent crosslinkers consist of two reactive groups separated by a linker. DNA intercalaters that can be crosslinked by photo-activation (i.e. Psoralen) will be used as the reactive groups. Linkers will be of varying precise lengths, and either flexible or rigid in nature so that the 3-dimensional distance between crosslinked loci can be inferred. Such DNA-specific bivalent crosslinking reagents, when substituted for formaldehyde in Hi-C protocol, produces space constraints revealing enhancer- promoter interactions and potentially allowing the inference of the 3D arrangement of the nuclear genome with unprecedented precision. Moreover, D-Hi-C is expected to lower backgrounds and allow examination of short and moderate range interactions, which are obscured by high backgrounds of current methods. Addition of groups such as digoxigenin to the bivalent crosslinkers, in addition to biotin incorporated to the ligation products, will enable better purification and thus deeper examination of genomic interactions. Finally, sampling DNA distances in time following gene activation provides a means of exploring the 4D architecture and setting critical limits in evaluating mechanisms of gene activation. The specific aims are to 1) synthesize a battery of bivalent crosslinkers and evaluate their ability to crosslink DNA in vitro; 2) test D-Hi-C crosslinkers relative to formaldehyde in the Drosophila nuclei model; 3) apply new crosslinkers to tier 1, ENCODE GM12878 and K562 cell lines to test their efficacy in human cells; and 4) test locus-specific photo-crosslinking that will allow a more focused and thorough examination of locus-specific interactions with the genome in a time course of gene activation. The development of these methodologies will be broadly useful in providing critical insights into gene regulatory mechanisms that are operative in normal animal development and homeostasis and that go awry in diseases like cancer."
"9305241","PROJECT SUMMARY: A major obstacle to the development of new vaccines and treatments for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) has been the efficiency with which this pathogen evades complement killing. The complement cascade, an important arm of innate immunity, targets invasive pathogens for killing. Infectious disease researchers have identified many ligands on Ng for fluid phase complement inhibitory proteins of the human host. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the contribution of membrane-associated complement inhibitory proteins (mCIs) to Ng complement evasion strategies. This gap needs to be filled in order to design effective treatments against gonorrhea, which is now resistant to most antibiotic therapies. The long term goal is to develop new therapies that hinder Ng's ability to use complement inhibitors of the human host to evade complement killing. The objective of this application is to define the contribution of mCIs and other epithelial proteins to Ng complement evasion. The central hypothesis is that during infection of epithelial cells Ng recruits mCIs into bacterial aggregates called microcolonies as a method to evade complement killing. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and his students. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on a new assay that can address the lack of knowledge about mCI-dependent Ng complement evasion. Using a co-culture serum bactericidal assay (ccSBA), in which Ng serum survival is monitored in the presence of human epithelial cells, the applicant has shown that infected epithelial cells positively contribute to Ng complement evasion. Guided by solid preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by probing three specific aims: 1) Determine if altering epithelial mCIs levels alters Ng's survival in serum; 2) Define the contributions of individual mCIs to Ng survival in the ccSBA; and 3) Elucidate pathways by which Ng recruits serum-protective epithelial proteins. For Specific Aim 1, expression levels for three mCIs (CD46, CD55 and CD59) will be stably altered in epithelial cells using shRNAs or protein overexpression and tested in the ccSBA for their influence on Ng survival. One cell line with altered mCI levels has already been made and supports higher levels of Ng survival. For Specific Aim 2, an epithelial cell line lacking all three mCIs will be made with genome editing technology. Each mCI will be individually expressed in the ?mCI line to determine if all three mCIs, or a subset, can protect Ng from serum killing. For Specific Aim 3, the applicant will use electron microscopy to characterize epithelial membranous structures induced by Ng infection and determine if microvilli contribute to protection of Ng from serum killing. Expression of specific epithelial genes that influence microvilli biogenesis will be altered in cells and evaluated for Ng survival phenotypes. This proposal's research is innovative because it uses a new assay that can test the contribution of epithelial-derived proteins to Ng complement evasion. This research is significant because it will expand our understanding of Ng complement evasion strategies dependent upon the infected cell and may lead to development of new antibody-based therapies or vaccines."
"9357657","Project Summary/Abstract The aim of this project is to continue to invent, refine and apply generalizable computational tools for neutron protein crystallography. Our primary focus will be to provide innovative, but practical solutions, that can be rapidly deployed to the target user community to address the computational bottleneck in neutron protein crystallography and to determine the neutron structures of a series of proteins, many with high biomedical importance, that span a spectrum of size and complexity. We will continue our current work adapting these computational tools for incorporation into PHENIX (Python- based Hierarchical Environment for Integrated Xtallography) for automated crystallography as extensible C++ and Python modules. The software will use and contribute towards the basic programming tools for crystallography in the Computational Crystallographic Toolbox (cctbx). Our vision is to contribute to a computational workbench that structural biologist, with a range of crystallographic experience, can use alternately for neutron, X-ray, or global neutron/X-ray/energy crystallography. Our research so far has demonstrated that the computational methods for analysis of neutron diffraction data can be improved, with better density maps, better models, increased automation and more reliable structure refinement. We have also shown that these methods can be successfully applied to challenging biological systems. However, as new experimental facilities come on line it is clear that new classes of biological systems will be studied. Neutron methods will need to be further advanced for success in these cases. In our interactions with the growing neutron crystallography user community it is becoming increasingly clear that there are remaining challenges that limit progress in this field and that will require the innovative solutions proposed in this project. The computational tools developed in this project will be used to shift current research to more complex structures that are larger in size, complexity and biomedical relevance. Our new developments will lead to improved models from all classes of neutron diffraction data, while simultaneously making it possible to study new challenging biological systems. 1"
"9527438","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the US population aging, it is important to find novel dental biomaterials that will promote periodontal regeneration, and translate these to clinical practice. As both a dentist and materials scientist, the applicant is in a position to brige the gap between biomaterials development. and their application in patient care using nanotechnology, tissue engineering and clinical knowledge. The purpose of this award is to provide the principal investigator extensive training in cellular and molecular biology, skeletal biology, and translational research with an emphasis on periodontal tissue regeneration. The experiments in this application have been designed to incorporate new methodologies, and will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of experts who will provide the required training to advance Dr. Bottino's scientific technical and analytic skills. The principal investigator's ultimae goal is to become a productive and independent clinician-scientist who can secure federal funding to sponsor an independent research program. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that a multilayer membrane capable of stimulating the regeneration of various tissue types in a location specific manner, through the addition of calcium phosphate and fibroblast growth factor-2 (CaP/FGF2) and FGF2, will lead to alveolar and periodontal tissue regeneration in the appropriate locations. The literature indicates that no single implantable biomaterial can consistently guide the coordinated growth and development of multiple tissue types, especially in very large periodontal defects. Thus, there is a critical need to develop regenerative therapies to promote oral and craniofacial tissue regeneration and reconstruction. The specific aims of the proposed research are (1) To use an in vitro assay model to maximize the tissue-specific regenerative capacity of the multilayered implant surface layers, (2) To assess the effectiveness of CaP/FGF2 on bone regeneration in an alveolar defect using an in vivo canine model, and (3) To assess the effectiveness of the multilayered implant to regenerate soft and mineralized tissues in a location-specific manner using an in vivo canine model. The principal investigator has devised a comprehensive career development plan that includes formal coursework, laboratory guidance to cover intensive cell and molecular biology training, as well as in vivo techniques combined with a diverse set of bone/periodontal tissue regeneration related analyses under the supervision of his mentoring team. Collectively, the K08 award has the capacity to provide the resources and training needed to give the applicant the foundation and critical theoretical and practical means to become a highly qualified clinician-scientist who can translate his knowledge of biomaterials to clinical practice."
"9341914","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunotherapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade is changing the landscape of cancer therapy, as best evidenced in melanoma with sustained tumor responses in a significant number of patients leading to the first approval of an anti-PD-1 therapy by the FDA. We have been studying response and resistance to this therapy and we are now in the position to propose mechanistic studies aimed at providing a molecular understanding of response, innate and acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade.  In the 1st theme I propose to characterize the T cell responses unleashed by blocking PD-1 in patient-derived samples. This will include phenotypic and functional studies in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), as well as analyses of the fine antigen specificity of the therapeutic T cells. With the lon term follow up of the initial cohorts of patients treated with the PD-1 blocking antibody pembrolizumab we are now seeing cases of delayed tumor progression after a long period of objective tumor response. We will study the mechanisms of acquired resistance by analyzing changes in T cell function, antigen processing machinery and mutational changes, leading to the loss off neoepitopes due to immune editing.  The 2nd theme is centered in research that has been a longstanding theme in my laboratory and that now is becoming a clinical reality. We had hypothesized that targeted therapies could sensitize cancer cells to immunotherapy, and this led my group to work on the clinical development of BRAF inhibitors and study the molecular mechanisms of resistance. But the goal was always to use them in combination with immunotherapy. BRAF inhibitors have a series of properties that make them very good candidates for combination, but it is evident that the translational efforts require adequate preclinical modeling and mechanistic understanding in patients.  The 3rd theme builds on my 15 year experience in investigator-initiated cell therapy-based cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. We started with dendritic cell vaccines, both peptide pulsed and genetically modified, and realized that the benefit was restricted to occasional patients with long-term responses. This  brought my group to make a big investment in setting up a T cell receptor (TCR) engineered adoptive cell  transfer (ACT) program, which is one of the very few in the world. We are now combining TCR engineered ACT with checkpoint blockade therapy and I propose to pursue this research during the funding period.  In conclusion, our proposal is based on hypothesis-driven bench-to-bedside-and-back mechanistic studies with  the goal of patient-centric advances in tumor immunotherapy for melanoma."
"9360580","ABSTRACT  Early in human life, the gut is colonized by a complex microbiome that includes dynamic interactions between the host, bacterial microbiome and virome (community of eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophage). Alterations within these microbial communities during early infant development may have long term health impacts. However, very little is known about maternal factors that drive virome acquisition and dynamics in infants. Breastfeeding provides nutrition and immune protection to the infant, but is also known to be a major route of mother-to-child transmission of some viruses. HIV infection can be transmitted through this route, and yet current guidelines recommend that HIV-positive women take antiretroviral treatment (ART) and breastfeed their infants because the health benefits outweigh the risk of HIV transmission. Infant morbidity and mortality remains higher in HIV-exposed uninfected infants compared to HIV-unexposed infants, and we hypothesize that differences in the breastmilk virome of HIV-infected women may play a role. Studies in HIV-infected adults and SIV-infected primate models demonstrate that the profound virome alterations are associated with HIV/AIDS disease progression. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the impact of maternal HIV disease progression as well as the role of maternal antiretroviral treatment on infant virome acquisition early in life. We will first leverage unique archived samples to demonstrate that the maternal virome is altered by effects of HIV infection. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that immune status and ART impact the virome of HIV- infected mothers and we will conduct a retrospective case-control study to test the hypothesis that maternal virome profiles are associated with infant health outcomes. In addition, we aim to understand the impact of maternal HIV infection on virome acquisition in infants using prospective studies that allow us to sample both the mother and infant over time. We propose to characterize the mother-child virome interactions and test the hypothesis that perturbations in the maternal virome, due to the effects of HIV infection including CD4 count and use of ART, impact the composition of the infant virome. Further, we will determine associations between infant virome and infant health outcomes. These findings will have broad implications to infant health and development, and direct clinical relevance for current HIV treatment practices."

"9352834","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the increasingly recognized role of inflammation in cancer maintenance and progression, the contribution of specific inflammatory bone marrow (BM) niches to the regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis is largely unexplored. Evidence supporting a non-cell-autonomous role for Notch signaling in the regulation of hematopoiesis has recently emerged; however, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which Notch regulates the integrity of the BM niche are still poorly understood. By using a Notch/RBPJ loss-of- function model, we showed that loss of RBPJ results in an inflammatory state of the BM microenvironment, leading to aberrant expansion of myeloid progenitors. We demonstrated that RBPJ functions as a transcriptional repressor of the microRNA miR-155, a microRNA involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis. We observed that persistent miR-155 up-regulation due to loss of RBPJ transcriptional repression induces NF-kB activation and a global state of inflammation in the BM niche, particularly in endothelial cells, leading to an uncontrolled expansion of myeloid cells and eventually to the development of a myeloproliferative disease. Of note, analysis of patients affected by myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) revealed elevated expression of miR155 in the BM. Based on these results, we hypothesize that Notch signaling contributes to hematopoietic homeostasis by regulating the level of the inflammatory tonus in the BM vascular niche. Thus, while transitory inhibition of Notch signaling in the BM microenvironment may trigger a physiologic inflammatory circuitry in response to BM injury, continuous inhibition of Notch signaling may contribute to the development or progression of myeloproliferative disorders. Focusing on the regulation of hematopoiesis by the BM niche and using several animal models, we propose: 1) to define the role of endothelial Notch signaling in regulating the integrity of the BM niche; 2) to determine how miR155 regulates NF-Kb activation and to map the Notch/miR155/NF-kB circuitry and its impact on myelopoiesis, and 3) to dissect the molecular underpins of the Notch/miR155/NF-kB pathway in human MPN. We believe that these studies will provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the interactions of hematopoietic cells with their supportive niches in the BM during conditions of stress and malignancy, and that will lead to strategies to target inflammation and disease progression in MPN."
"9383257","Project Summary/Abstract One of the major challenges in neuroscience research is to understand the function of the brain at the level of genes, gene regulatory networks, neurons, and circuit structure. This proposal seeks to understand Drosophila reproductive behaviors, a highly tractable model, given knowledge of the master regulatory transcription factors and neuroanatomical structures that underlie these behaviors. fruitless (fru) encodes a set of master regulatory transcription factors, which are necessary and largely sufficient for specifying the potential for innate male courtship behaviors. This proposal is built on our results that demonstrate that a family of cell adhesion molecules, called Dprs and DIPs, have important functions in specifying the potential for reproductive behavior downstream of fru. We will determine the roles for behavior of subsets of fru-expressing neurons that overlap with Dpr/DIP expression (fru P1?Dpr/Dip), using genetic intersectional strategies. We will also determine how anatomical sexual dimorphism in fru P1 neurons arises by functionally examining the roles of Dpr/DIPs. This study will also elucidate the Dpr/DIP interactome within fru-expressing neurons. Using cell-type specific genomic tools, we will also molecularly classify fru P1?Dpr/Dip-expressing subpopulations to elucidate the molecular underpinnings that give rise to different neuronal functions."
"9277152","In the past year, Zika virus has gained worldwide attention due to the rapidly spreading infection, its association with Guillain-Barré syndrome, its ability to be transmitted sexually and in utero to the fetus, and the increased number of infants with microcephaly and other severe brain defects. The genome of the current epidemic virus has 75 amino acid substitutions relative to the virus originally isolated from a rhesus monkey in Uganda in 1947 (MR766), which appears to have caused only sporadic and mild disease. Whether any of these substitutions has effects on viral replication fitness, pathogenesis, or spread between humans is unknown. Thus it is important that studies be done using the African isolate as well as more recent epidemic strains. The goal of this proposal to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the severe neural pathogenesis of the epidemic virus and to test our hypothesis that induction of autophagy will inhibit the virus infection. This proposal brings together the knowledge of two well-established and experienced investigators in related fields. By combining the expertise in the Spector lab in virology, specifically the molecular/cell biology and pathogenesis of human cytomegalovirus (currently the major viral cause of neural birth defects), and stem cell differentiation, and in the Yeo lab on human stem cell biology (including differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] to cerebral cortex neurons), high-throughput analysis of gene expression and RNA processing (including single cell RNA seq), and cutting edge computational technologies, we have a unique opportunity to gain greater understanding of this major medical problem. We will determine the kinetics of viral infection and cell death when cells are infected at different stages of differentiation of iPSCs to cortical neurons. We will also leverage our strengths in genome-wide technologies to identify changes in expression of host genes (including coding and noncoding RNAs and microRNAs) during infection. Importantly, we will compare the differences between infection with the early African Zika virus strain MR766 and a more recent epidemic isolate. Also novel and potentially of great therapeutic significance is our proposed strategy of inducing autophagy to inhibit ZIKV infection and promote cell survival and differentiation. Specifically, we will test whether treatment of cells with the nontoxic disaccharide trehalose, which induces autophagy via a novel mTOR-independent pathway, will inhibit the infection, as we have found for human cytomegalovirus. We will also test 2 other autophagy inducers, a mTOR-independent small molecule SMER28 and tat-beclin 1. Accomplishment of the goals of this proposal will facilitate the development of new strategies designed to prevent and treat Zika virus infection."
"9410244","Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals? best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze two hundred 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of clinical trials. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team."
"9448654","Project Summary/Abstract The ATR protein kinase sits atop a complex signaling cascade that is activated by DNA replication and hyper- activated by replication stress or DNA double-strand breaks. Activation of ATR by genotoxic stress is essential for the ability of cells to survive stress and represents a barrier to transformation of normal cells to a pathological condition that promotes tumorigenesis. The downstream effectors and consequences of ATR signaling are now being understood, however early events in signaling, such as the initial activation of ATR kinase at sites of gentoxic stress, are still poorly understood. This proposal focuses on the biochemical mechanism for ATR activation at sites of DNA damage. This proposal features the TOPBP1 protein, which physically interacts with ATR at sites of DNA damage and is required for ATR activation during the replication stress and DNA damage responses. TOPBP1 is a BRCT repeat containing protein that likely acts as a scaffold to link checkpoint proteins together into active signaling centers. In this proposal we combine biochemical studies using purified factors, functional studies in Xenopus egg extracts, and in vivo studies in cultured cells to mount an in-depth exploration of how TOPBP1 activates ATR at sites of DNA damage. Recent studies on the ETAA1 protein have shown that TOPBP1 is not alone in its ability to activate ATR, and our preliminary studies suggest that a third and possibly more ATR activators are present in human cells. In this proposal we will also study these new activators, with the long-term goal of building a comprehensive, systems-level view of how ATR signaling is initiated. The work is divided into three Aims. In Aim 1, we examine how active ATR signaling centers form at sites of damage. The recruitment mechanism is complex, and likely involves multiple protein-protein interactions between TOPBP1 and its binding partners. Recent work from our group has shown that soluble TOPBP1 is held in an auto-inhibitory conformation and thus an additional goal of Aim 1 is to determine how this auto- inhibition is resolved at sites of damage. In Aim 2 we examine how ATR may use a negative feedback loop to regulate assembly of additional signaling centers at sites of damage. We will also explore the possibility that an ATR signaling center is mobile on DNA. In the final Aim we will define a rule-book for how different ATR activators are utilized, how their functions are related (or not), and how their activities are integrated during an ATR response."
"9326330","INFORMATICS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY The Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy (POST) Center has developed three projects to discover and validate novel genomic markers (genes, transcripts, metabolites or SNPs) associated with statin effects. To facilitate scientific progress and synergize the Center such that the collective whole is greater than the sum of the parts, we have developed an Informatics Core to integrate the extensive data that will be collected, provide analysis expertise to the projects, and develop novel methods to integrate and visualize data across the three projects which include transcriptomic and metabolomic studies in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, genetic and functional studies in murine models, and extensive genetic epidemiology studies in a large population sample. A key function of the Informatics Core is to integrate information obtained across these diverse yet complementary platforms, thus fully leveraging each dataset to maximize our understanding of the factors underlying variation in statin response. The overall objective of the Informatics Core is to facilitate the maximal level of analysis and coordination of data and results across the three projects. This Core will function as the central hub for data sharing across the three POST projects, as well as functioning as `The Integrator' for combining the data/results from the three projects to extract new knowledge about statin response, not realized from one project alone. We will achieve these goals through the following three specific aims: Aim 1) Assemble and integrate datasets from Projects 1-3 to maximize collaborations across the three projects. Aim 2) Develop and apply a bioinformatics tool to integrate results from different experimental strategies (from Projects 1-3) to identify genes, metabolites, networks and/or DNA variants associated with statin efficacy or adverse effects using machine learning and powerful biological annotations. Aim 3) Develop an interactive data visualization tool to combine results from different experimental strategies (from Projects 1-3). In addition to these Aims, the Core will also work closely with individual Project investigators to perform higher-order statistical analyses to serve the specific needs of each Project. Through these activities, the Informatics Core will not only aid in the identification of markers that may be used in the development of precision medicine guidelines for statin treatment, but will also develop novel statistical tools that may be generally applied to pharmacogenomics research."
"9360238","Project Summary (Rajan Project) CRISPR-Cas systems are comprised of RNA-protein complexes that inactivate foreign DNA or RNA entering a bacterial or archaeal cell by producing sequence specific cleavage in the intruding DNA or RNA. CRISPR was given the status of a ?bacterial/archaeal immune system? because of its ability to protect against recurring phage infections, based on genetic memory retained from the past infections. The RNA-based DNA targeting function of CRISPR-Cas systems is widely used for gene editing and has promise for the treatment of inherited and infectious diseases. One of the less characterized aspects of CRISPR-Cas systems is their role in alternate functions in bacteria other than phage predation. For example, CRISPR-Cas systems have been shown to enhance bacterial pathogenicity in Francisella tularensis (Ft) novicida, Neisseria meningitidis, and Campylobacter jejuni. Paradoxically, in highly drug resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Francisella tularensis, components of the CRISPR-Cas systems are inactivated possibly to capitalize on the benefits of horizontal gene transfer. It is critical that we understand how bacteria turn on and off the benefits of CRISPR-Cas systems. The proposed work aims to characterize the biochemical, structural, and functional mechanisms by which the CRISPR-Cas complexes of Ft. novicida enhance bacterial pathogenicity by down- regulating a bacterial lipoprotein (BLP) essential for host recognition and immune response. A non-canonical, RNA-independent, Mn2+-specific DNA cleavage activity for Cas9 and Cpf1 (two Ft. novicida Cas proteins) was observed recently in the PL's lab. The structural and conformational basis by which Cas9 and Cpf1 differentiate RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and DNA-Mn2+ as their substrates will be further characterized using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, X-ray crystallography, and Small Angle X-ray Scattering. The results from the proposed studies will identify the nuclease involved in blp mRNA degradation and the mechanistic aspects of how Cas9 associates with other cellular components for regulating bacterial pathogenicity. The basis of substrate recognition by Cas9 and Cpf1 will provide mechanistic details of a previously unknown activity of these proteins and how these enzymes perform RNA-independent DNA cleavage. The results will provide the basis of future studies on characterizing CRISPR-Cas mediated pathogenicity in other bacteria and the physiological relevance of RNA-independent, Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage in bacterial physiology. This information can be used to develop innovative strategies for combating microbial antibiotic resistance and development of anti-microbials."
"9545377","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many women suffer from life altering lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, prevention of LUTS is hampered by lack of understanding and definition of true bladder health. The existing paradigm of healthy bladder is too narrowly defined as absence of LUTS, ignoring the World Health admonition that health is NOT JUST absence of disease. To become a nation of women with healthy bladders and reduce high public and private medical care costs, a seismic shift is necessary in how we approach knowledge development about bladder health and subsequently LUTS prevention. We know what LUTS look like (incontinence, urinary tract infection, etc.) but scant literature is availableto guide characterization of the healthy bladder. In this proposal, a broadly interdisciplinary research team with backgrounds in nursing, epidemiology, prevention science, behavioral science, and primary care medicine at the University of Michigan will use our expertise in health promotion and risk reduction to address this knowledge gap. We will characterize bladder health across the lifespan using a process of understanding key intersections of biological and physiological life stages (adolescence, adulthood, childbearing, peri-menopause/menopause, elderly) with psychosocial and behavioral responses to societal messaging about bladder health as experienced by female adolescents, women, parents and primary health care clinicians. The goal is to develop an evidence base about healthy female adolescent's and women's experience of bladder health using novel mixed methods approaches to inform prevention strategies for LUTS. Study aims are:  1. Construct an operational definition of the healthy bladder drawing from expert opinion and concept analysis methods, 2. Further develop/refine/pilot a simple but conceptually novel survey instrument capable of capturing variance within the healthy bladder state.  3. Pilot low-cost developmental projects that will enrich productivity and interdisciplinary collaborations of the Preventing LUTS consortium, including developing fundamental knowledge required for securing funding on investigation of LUTS prevention. More than 1 in 3 US women suffer from the distressing, embarrassing, and often unreported problems of LUTS. This work significantly addresses these challenges by establishing an evidence base of normal ranges and associated covariates for women with healthy bladders across each life stage to lay the foundation for developing rational, effective prevention strategies to reduce the heavy disease burden of LUTS faced by women and society."
"9536368","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of a-synuclein in which the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra die. The innate immune system is thought to play a role in the demise of these neurons. Therefore, we hypothesized that genotypic differences in microglia are involved in the pathophysiology of PD and, particularly, in the death of these dopamine producing cells. Our preliminary cis-eQTL analyses of data from healthy young individuals have implicated 11 PD susceptibility genes in myeloid cell function, whose expression, relative to each risk allele, is altered in the innate immune cell type monocytes and not in T cells that represent the adaptive arm of the immune system. Therefore, these loci represent excellent candidates as the first step in the cascade of molecular events that link genetic risk factors to the altered innate immune function that contributes to PD pathology. The principal goals of the proposed project are (1) to identify the component genes of networks perturbed by the PD susceptibility loci in myeloid cells (2) to understand their functional consequences on microglia behavior and (3) examine the role of these susceptibility loci on CNS microglia activation and gene expression."
"9230756","Abstract: The goal of this project is to produce a regional history of local responses to vaccination for smallpox in Southeast Asia from its first introduction in 1804 to the initiation, in 1966, of the World Health Organization's program to eradicate smallpox. Southeast Asia has been a crossroads where peoples, and their microbes, from East Africa, Europe, the Middle East, India, East Asia and Australasia have come into contact since pre-historic times. This is true not only of ancient human scourges such as smallpox, cholera, and malaria but also of more recent international public health problems such as SARS and Zika virus. For at least a thousand years before the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated, this dread disease adversely affected the physical health of individuals and the economic health of entire communities worldwide. Thus, in each place where vaccination to prevent smallpox was introduced it provoked interest. However, it sometimes also produced controversy, and in each place the interest and the controversy were shaped by local factors and local actors. Worldwide, when political decisions were made to enforce vaccination, this produced resistance and in colonial societies protests against vaccination and other health regulations were often co-opted by anti-colonial movements. In a post-colonial globalized world, the history of vaccination for smallpox offers a window on the social factors which molded, and still mold, responses to international efforts to eradicate specific epidemic diseases. The environmental, ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity of Southeast Asia ensures that a monograph on the history of vaccination in the countries of Southeast Asia will offer particularly interesting insights into this global story. Through careful analysis of the records of colonial and indigenous governments, private papers from colonial and indigenous physicians and nurses, and local newspapers and magazines, this study will offer information pertinent to both historic and current controversies regarding prophylactic treatments, such as vaccinations and inoculations, for epidemic diseases."

"9517164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate cell division requires the proper assembly and function of microtubule-based structures such as the bipolar spindle needed to segregate chromosomes, and the spindle midzone (or central spindle) required to keep segregated chromosomes apart and help position the site of cell cleavage. These micron-sized structures require both motor and non-motor proteins to move and organize microtubules, as well as to regulate the formation of new filaments. Our long-term goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of these essential structures. To achieve this goal we take a multidisciplinary approach that combines biochemical, structural, biophysical, chemical and cell biological methods. We will build on recent publications and our unpublished preliminary data to focus on the following three Aims: (1) Analyze centrosome-independent microtubule formation. In particular, we will examine how augmin, a recently discovered hetero-octameric protein complex, contributes to microtubule formation within the metaphase spindle. We will employ biochemical, electron microscopy-based, and TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy-based approaches to elucidate how augmin nucleates branched arrays of parallel microtubules. (2) Examine mechanisms regulating microtubule organization. Specifically, we will dissect how PRC1, a non-motor protein that selectively crosslinks antiparallel microtubules, and kinesin-4, a microtubule plus-end directed motor protein that can suppress microtubule growth and disassembly, contribute to the assembly of the spindle midzone, a specialized array of overlapping microtubules that is rapidly assembled during anaphase. We will combine structural, TIRF-microscopy-based, cell biological, and real-time confocal microscopy-based approaches to examine how these two proteins, which bind each other to form a stable complex in solution, regulate microtubule dynamics and antiparallel crosslinking in dividing human cells. (3) Analyze the micromechanics of microtubule arrays. In particular, we will measure how much force is generated to slide microtubules relative to each other by ensembles of motor proteins. TIRF- and optical trap-based assays will be used to determine how the magnitude of forces generated by motor proteins that can crosslink and slide two microtubules apart depends on filament orientation and overlap length. Together, our findings should advance our understanding of how conserved nanometer-sized proteins build the micron-sized structures needed for the stable propagation of our genomes through multiple cell divisions. Errors in cell division have been linked to developmental defects and diseases in humans. Our research should shed light on the molecular mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Blocking cell division with chemotherapeutic agents is a mainstay of cancer treatments. New anti-cancer drugs are being developed that inhibit cell division by targeting the proteins we study. It is possible that our proposed research will help decipher how these drugs work and may also suggest new targets for therapeutic agents."
"9352350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large scale studies of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in neonates have largely been neglected. Thus, its clinical and social implications are largely unknown. The proposed study aims to increase scientific knowledge of these implications for acutely ill neonates. This population may stand to benefit largely from WGS given the severity of illness. The proposed clinical study is a prospective, randomized, partially blinded study which has both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the risks and benefits of the use of STATseq, a 2-day genome test, in acutely ill neonates at Children's Mercy Hospital. Study participants include neonates, their parents and clinicians caring for them. The overall aims will provide a nuanced understanding of the role of rapid diagnostic WGS for acutely ill neonates, including relative diagnostic sensitivity and change in management both for broad NICU populations and subpopulations, accuracy, reproducibility, and relative value of proband WGS and familial triads. The technologic aims include improving diagnostic sensitivity without sacrificing the rapid turnaround time. The clinical aims include looking at increased diagnostic yield, shorter time to diagnosis and clinician perception of management changes that result from implementation of STAT-seq. Finally, the study will investigate the perceived value of STAT-seq in parents and clinicians using structural equation modeling. The studies also are designed for long term continuation of assessment of the enrollees (beyond the current funding period) and in additional sample types (via a bio repository). Long term continuation studies will test effects on long term morbidity, mortality, quality of life and cost of care. We hope that the study results will be sufficient to provide an evidence base for physician adoption and provider reimbursement of WGS in Level 3 and 4 NICUs."

"9353890","Abstract  Three dimensional genome organization is emerging as a potent regulator of gene expression. Due to recent advancements in methods used to study higher-order chromatin structure, there has been a dramatic increase in the understanding of how the human genome is organized in three dimensional space. This has led to a greater appreciation for the role of 3D genome architecture in regulating nuclear biology, and a recognition of the role of alterations to normal 3D genome structure in causing human disease. Despite this, the mechanisms used by cells to build higher-order chromatin structures remain relatively obscure. The experiments in this proposal will shed light on the mechanisms of higher-order chromatin structure formation using two primary approaches. First, how cells construct their own 3D genome architectures will be studied by taking advantage of naturally occurring biological systems where chromatin structures are formed and re- formed. This will be accomplished by studying changes that occur during re-formation of chromatin structure after exit from mitosis, and by studying the formation of new chromatin loops in the genome upon change in cellular identity. Second, to determine how higher-order chromatin structures are built, CRISPR/Cas9 technology will be used to engineer exogenous chromatin loops into the genome. This will be accomplished by delivering protein cargo using Cas9 fusion proteins to specific loci in the genome to perform locus specific ?re- programming.? This will be used to assess what are the minimal essential events that are required to create higher-order chromatin structures in the genome. These experiments will greatly expand our knowledge of the mechanisms used to construct higher-order chromatin structures in our genome and will provide the necessary foundation to link our knowledge of 3D genome organization to human phenotypic variation and disease."
"9352339","Project Summary / Abstract Water fluoridation is a population health intervention used in Canada and the United States to control tooth decay. The safety of administering fluoride via public drinking water is uncertain. Recent human studies suggest that exposure to fluoride in drinking water may alter thyroid function, increase blood lead levels, lower IQ, and increase the risk of developing ADHD. Still, many of the human studies included groups who were exposed to higher levels of fluoride and they often lacked a comparison group or sensitive measures of behavior or learning. Given widespread exposure to fluoridated water, the US National Research Council concluded in a 2007 report that rigorous epidemiological research is urgently needed to address the controversy about the safety of this public health intervention. The aim of this study is to determine if prenatal and childhood exposure to fluoride impacts learning abilities and behavioral problems in young Canadian children, with particular emphasis on vulnerable populations. The present proposal will build upon an exceptional national pregnancy cohort study: ?Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals? (MIREC). The MIREC cohort is ideally suited to address the research objectives because the requisite information (urine during pregnancy and child outcomes) was collected in a large sample that varied as a function of municipal water fluoridation. Fluoride concentrations will be measured using stored urine samples obtained from a sample of 1960 pregnant women living in ten large Canadian cities ? half of which add fluoride to municipal water. Out of 1207 participants who were approached, standardized questionnaires assessing behavioral outcomes are available for 898 children (74% of sample) living in select cities across Canada. In addition, standardized cognitive assessments, or IQ scores, are available for 610 of the children in the birth cohort. The study will also examine whether neurodevelopmental outcomes differ among children who ingested infant formula using fluoridated versus non-fluoridated water. Finally, we will examine whether serial urinary fluoride concentrations in pregnant women are higher in women who live in communities that fluoridate their municipal drinking water. The results of this study will inform public health officials and decision makers about ?real-time? fluoride levels of pregnant women living in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. It will also provide important information about whether fluoride exposure adversely impacts children?s behaviors or learning abilities. This information will direclty impact decision making concerning the safety of water fluoridation among vulnerable populations and is therefore an area of high"
"9551722","Stroke is a significant health problem with limited treatment options. In this application, we present a new model in which activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels provides neuroprotection following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) through two independent yet additive mechanisms. First, we provide evidence that pharmacological activation of vascular TRPV1 channels during the reperfusion phase selectively restores cerebral perfusion to the damaged brain regions. The hypoperfusion which occurs in damaged brain during early reperfusion can be dramatically and quickly restored without affecting the flow in non-injured brain regions. We propose that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced following stroke lead to increased TRPV1 channel sensitivity to agonists, and thus the increased cerebral blood flow response. Second, activation of TRPV1 channels in the thermoregulatory system produces a rapid and sustainable decrease in body temperature (mild hypothermia) that is neuroprotective. In this context, TRPV1 activation effectively lowers the body's temperature ?set point?, allowing for a more rapid and controlled level of therapeutic hypothermia to be achieved.  We have already established that pharmacological activation of TRPV1 channels (?TRPV1 agonism?) is neuroprotective. While part of the neuroprotective effect is through induction of mild hypothermia, our new studies indicate that an additional protective effect may be through restoration of flow to hypoperfused brain regions. We now propose the overall hypothesis that TRPV1 agonism provides two arms of protection following stroke by 1) improving reperfusion in injured brain regions and 2) promoting protective hypothermia. We will study these mechanisms separately and then in combination to determine the additive benefit following stroke in adult and aged mice of both sexes.  In aim 1, we will demonstrate selective increase in cerebral blood flow within the ischemia/reperfusion territory with TRPV1 agonism. These studies include in vivo cerebral blood flow measurements in adult and aged mice of both sexes following stroke. In aim 2, we will determine the role of ROS in potentiating endothelial TRPV1- mediated vasodilation and increased cerebral blood flow using isolated cerebral arteries and in vivo preparations. We will use a combination of pharmacological approaches, available knockout/transgenic mice, and a novel knockout mouse to demonstrate the specific role of endothelial TRPV1 channels and NOX-derived ROS in the mechanism. In aim 3, we will demonstrate the long-term neuroprotective benefit of TRPV1 agonism following stroke. We will evaluate the vascular component alone (hypothermia-independent mechanism) as well as the combined vascular and hypothermic components (hypothermia-dependent mechanism). Aged mice of both sexes will be evaluated by behavioral testing, histology, and blood brain barrier function during the course of one month of reperfusion. All together, these studies should establish TRPV1 agonism as a multi-faceted approach to neuroprotection following stroke."
"9386607","Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, yet its treatment options remain limited, in part due to the lack of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression and response to therapies. We propose to develop simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (PET/MR) using 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) to assess subchondral bone remodeling as a marker of early OA progression and relate bone metabolism to biochemical changes in articular cartilage. This approach will provide a considerable advance for imaging of OA; including new markers of early disease and insights into the spatial and temporal progression of OA. This project aims to develop a new approach to knee imaging using PET/MR, providing fast, quantitative and registered metabolic and biochemical markers sensitive to the earliest changes in OA. Our specific aims are (1) to develop parallel MR imaging techniques for fast and simultaneous bilateral knee MRI; (2) to create an automated attenuation correction method for flexible MRI knee coils to achieve accurate and reproducible dynamic scans of 18F-NaF PET uptake; and (3) to study the spatiotemporal relationships between bone remodeling and adjacent cartilage changes and evaluate if 18F-NaF PET can predict degenerative knee changes in subjects at risk of developing OA following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. The innovation of this work lies in the development of a novel imaging technique for studying OA, PET/MR, that offers quantitative and multimodal information sensitive to the earliest metabolic and biochemical changes in bone and cartilage. Advanced methods developed in this work will enhance fast, quantitative assessment of early disease biomarkers within each imaging modality. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track the earliest changes of OA, and study the spatiotemporal progression of disease. These contributions will provide new insights into OA pathogenesis, leading to new treatment targets, and ultimately therapies to arrest the onset and progression of OA."

"9353958","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Biospecimen Core will continue to provide high quality annotated specimens and expert pathology consultation to enhance the projects of Case GI SPORE investigators. This process will continue the longstanding, successful, collaborations between the members of the Core and the individual project investigators. During the course of these collaborations the Core has developed an extensive biospecimen archive derived from over 13,000 patients. Previously, the Core has supplied high quality annotated specimens leading to the discovery of 15-Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase as an important tumor suppressor gene in colon carcinogenesis ? the basis of Project 1; the African American colon cancer 15 gene-panel ? the basis of Project 2; methylated vimentin as a biomarker of Barrett's Esophagus ? the basis of Project 3; and the discovery of unique glutamine metabolism in PIK3CA mutated colon cancers ? the basis of Project 4. The Core also provided significant support to the SPORE's Career Enhancement and Pilot Projects Programs. The Core has an extensive archive of colon neoplasms from over 4,800 patients including 2,292 primary colon cancers of known pathologic stage and databased clinical follow-up as well as a substantial number of cancer metastases. Frozen material from 1053 of these cases is also banked with matched normal controls. The Core also has 350 esophageal cancers and Barrett's esophagus paraffin specimens as well as 134 frozen esophageal specimens. Many of these samples have undergone extensive molecular analysis ? enabling sophisticated translational studies. The Core works with the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center to make available to the SPORE a wide variety of techniques and technologies in a cost effective manner. The Core will organize all prospective GI biospecimen procurements and distribution to SPORE investigators as well as provide access to its existing tissue archive resource. The Core will support the projects of this application by identification of tissues of interest to investigators both from the Core archive and from prospective accrual. The Core will provide histopathological quality control for tissue sections, along with project specific morphology case reviews and will oversee and provide longitudinal follow-up of clinical outcomes linked to these tissues. The Core will also provide tissue microarray sections for tissue targets of interest, expertise in immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assessment and samples appropriate for specific studies. The primary objective is to provide a resource that contributes significantly to the translational goals and endpoints of the individual projects and to facilitate cooperation between other GI SPOREs."

"9340219","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for renewal of the Integrative Program in Complex Biological Systems (ipCBS), a graduate training program providing a specialization for students that are members of the Biophysics and Bioinformatics group. The ipCBS is a comprehensive interdisciplinary program specifically designed around the understanding and engineering of complex biological systems (systems biology). At a fundamental level, this program seeks to solve the sociological and linguistic problems associated with training scientists to be simultaneously conversant in the multiple languages of biology, mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This program was built on an entirely new foundation focused on observation, modeling, and manipulation of complex systems. Over the past grant period, the ipCBS has continued to develop and evolve the curriculum, especially in the area of hands-on project based, experiential learning. As a result, a purpose-built Graduate Teaching Laboratory was constructed as a direct outcome of this training program, and a pair of required courses Dynamical Systems, conducted in the spirit of Cold Spring Harbor / Woods Hole, have become a keystone of the graduate first year experience. The key points of the ipCBS are as follows:   Long term objective: To provide critical training necessary for a research environment driven by team-based interdisciplinary approaches to biomedical science and human health and dominated by large-scale and high complexity data.  Approach: The ipCBS holds four core principles as the basis for graduate training. 1) Focus on the basic principles of biological organization, from the molecular to the cellular level. 2) Focus on complex systems from an interdisciplinary team-based perspective. 3) Focus on breaking down the language/sociology barrier.  4) Focus on mentoring."
"9349366","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States lacks a consensus over the economic, environmental, health and social implications of the rapidly expanding use of high-volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) in both unconventional and conventional oil and gas development (this includes shale gas). Although these operations have been employed for over a decade in some states, and much controversy exists about the effects of these operations on the environment and public health, there is a dearth of studies measuring community impacts. In addition, there exists very little empirical guidance on the use of lease terms involving environmental protections (e.g. compressor station restrictions, surface damage remediation) and health-related protections, both of which are potential mechanisms for sheltering homeowners from the potential costs of shale gas development. Negotiated lease terms could depend upon the characteristics of homeowners, such that individuals who do not have negotiation power sign inferior lease terms. Subsequently, such inequities in lease terms could be a significant source of variation in health outcomes resulting from living in close proximity to shale gas development, with the most vulnerable populations experiencing the largest burden on health. The long-term goal is to build a research agenda that seeks to broadly understand the trade-offs (e.g. increased economic activity versus increased environmental degradation or harm to public health) that are facing policymakers and community members with respect to energy production, as well as the implications for public health and environmental health policy. The objective is to comprehensively study the effect of shale gas development on infant and child health outcomes and to identify health-protective lease terms. The proposed research aims to: 1) measure how air emissions from operations contribute to childhood respiratory disease exacerbations and incidence; 2) estimate how drinking water contamination from shale waste affects pregnancy outcomes and drinking water violations; 3) investigate how lease clauses modify previously measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and how leasing clauses and royalties depend on socio-demographic contexts. The approach is innovative because it uses econometric techniques to exploit both temporal and spatial quasi-random variation across sites that are otherwise uniform, thereby allowing for quantifying differences in health associated uniquely with operations while holding other individual and community characteristics constant. The proposed research is significant because the findings will guide both the future research of specific pollutant pathways as well as policymakers and individual mineral rights owners about how to enhance the economic benefits and diminish any measured risks of shale gas development."

A pipeline and process will be developed for reporting results of genomic sequencing to neonatologists and pediatricians, and a pilot clinical trial will be conducted to explore the impact of delivering genomic sequencing results in the newborn period. To evaluate the use of genomic screening in healthy newborns, 240 newborn infants and their parents will be enrolled shortly after birth at Brigham and Women's Hospital. To evaluate the use of early genomic screening as a resource for clinicians caring for infants who are ill, 240 newborns from the NICU at Boston Children's Hospital will be enrolled along with their parents. The trial will randomize these 480 newborns to receive either 1) clinically meaningful information derived from genomic sequencing and current newborn screening or 2) only current newborn screening as standard of care. Project 1 will rapidly sequence, analyze arid interpret genomic sequencing in a CLIA-approved pipeline and deliver an understandable and useful report to the family and pediatric care team of newborns in both groups. Project 2 will enroll newborns and their parents into the protocol, provide a team of genetics experts as a resource for families and pediatricians, and safely monitor the use of genomic information in clinical practice. Project 3 will examine preferences and motivations of enrolled parents, evaluate the flow and utilization of genomic information within clinical interactions and assess understanding, behavior, medical consequences and healthcare costs associated with the use of genomic sequencing in newborns."
"9326333","PROJECT 3: SUMMARY Statins are the frontline treatment for reducing risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and do so primarily by lowering LDL cholesterol (LDLC). The goal of this project is to identify genetic and environmental determinants that mediate the effect of statins on improving lipid levels and preventing adverse CVD-related outcomes. In addition, factors that underlie risk for adverse side effects of statin treatment for some individuals, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes mellitus, will be identified. This population-based research will utilize electronic health records (EHR) from which clinical data will be extracted and linked to genetic information as a cost-efficient means to integrate molecular, clinical and environmental data. The study will utilize the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH) Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) Cohort. This multi-ethnic cohort contains over 100,000 individuals with full genome-wide data on over 674,000 SNP markers. Demographic, socioeconomic and health-related behaviors are available from participant surveys. KPNC maintains extensive EHR data, for example the typical cohort member has nearly 10 lipid measurements over a two-decade period (1 million measures for the entire cohort) for each of the major lipid fractions, enabling longitudinal and prospective analyses. In addition, the KPNC database contains full information on pharmacy prescriptions and utilization. Specifically, the GERA cohort contains over 46,000 individuals with statin prescriptions. For this subgroup, there are approximately 500,000 lipid panels (half prior and half post statin prescription), 1,300 cases of MACE (major adverse coronary event) and 2,000 cases of ischemic stroke, over 200,000 laboratory test results for creatine kinase (a biomarker for myopathy) and over 500,000 fasting glucose measures (a biomarker for new onset diabetes). Thus, the GERA dataset represents the largest available that links genome-wide genetic data with clinical outcomes in statin users, allowing for evaluation of potential racial/ethnic and sex differences in drug response. Identification of both common and rare variants genetic variants and environmental factors associated with statin clinical efficacy and adverse effects will be assessed in Aim 1 using multiple linear regression and survival analysis time to event with candidate factors included as covariates with interactions. Correlations in closely related individuals and kinship analysis in unrelated individuals will be used to estimate overall heritability of the various efficacy and adverse effect traits (Aim 2). Finally, results will be followed up using a custom exome genotyping array run on 3,360 individuals with target outcomes of interest (Aim 3). Merging together the lipid, biomarker and clinical outcome data with the genome-wide genotype and environmental data on this large cohort will enable novel powerful analyses of genetic and environmental determinants of statin efficacy and side effects. The results from this study will help enable precision medicine, whereby individuals who are most likely to benefit from statin use can be determined, and those most at risk of adverse side effects identified."

"9286499","Chromosome breaks are the most dangerous form of DNA damage because they result in multiple types of mutations and gross chromosome rearrangements. DNA is most sensitive to breakage during replication, when hard-to-replicate noncanonical DNA structures cause replication fork stalling. Noncanonical DNA structures are strongly implicated as endogenous sources of chromosome breaks and translocations leading to developmental defects and cancers, however, the mechanisms by which replication fork stalling causes DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are not known.  Despite significant analyses of DNA damage response proteins in global or single molecule studies where the sites of damage are not identified, the molecular mechanisms of replication-dependent DNA strand breakage and repair at specific sites in human cells are incompletely understood. To address this knowledge gap, we will study two types of natural replication barriers (CTG/CAG trinucleotide repeats and asymmetric purine-pyrimidine (Pu/Py) mirror repeats) integrated at an ectopic site in the human genome where their structure and effect on replication can be manipulated. We also examine several endogenous replication fork barriers that induce DSBs during DNA replication. We will use PCR, DNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and flow cytometry to show (1) how polymerase stalling at noncanonical DNA structures causes DSBs, (2) how DNA repair proteins act to remodel stalled replication forks to restart synthesis, and (3) the mechanisms and genomic consequences of DSB recombination at structure-induced fork barriers.  We will test the hypothesis that noncanonical DNA structures induce DSB by blocking the progress of DNA polymerases, promoting nuclease-sensitive fork regression, and inhibiting DNA end processing required for recombination. Conceptual advances from this work will include determination of the molecular mechanisms of DSB formation near specific stalled forks, biochemical analysis of replication fork reversal, and identification of how the processing of structure-induced DSB differs that of nuclease-induced `clean' DSB. Our long-term goal is to define the role of DNA structure-induced g e n o m e instability in human disease.  Aim 1 will disclose the relationship between fork stalling and damage signaling, the biochemistry of fork reversal, the function of structure-specific endonucleases at stalled forks, and the impact of DNA secondary structure on fork resection and repair. Aim 2 will build on our demonstration that the Fanconi anemia type J protein (FANCJ) is essential for the maintenance of noncanonical DNA structures across the genome during replication stress, to determine the mechanisms of FANCJ dependent microsatellite stabilization. In Aim 3 we will characterize the genomic consequences of FANCJ deficiency. Our experiments will show how hard-to- replicate DNA sequences cause chromosome breaks and mutations that lead to genetic disease."
"9533342","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is required for maintaining telomeres, the specialized nucleoprotein structures that protect eukaryotic chromosome ends from aberrant processing and deleterious end-to-end fusion events. Telomerase catalyzes processive extension of telomere DNA using a unique catalytic mechanism that requires a strong functional interdependence of the telomerase RNA, telomerase reverse transcriptase, and several additional protein subunits. The primary objective of this proposal is to elucidate how conserved structural RNA and protein domains coordinate the processes of telomerase RNP assembly, catalysis, and regulation. To address the substantial challenges associated with structural analysis of telomerase we will utilize a multi-faceted experimental strategy that combines single-molecule biophysical techniques paired with computational, biochemical, and high-resolution structural approaches. We will study human telomerase and the enzyme from the model system Tetrahymena thermophila. In aim 1, we will employ x-ray crystallography, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), and biochemical probing to characterize local and global structural features of the telomerase complex. Distance constraints furnished by these experiments will aid telomerase structural modeling in collaboration with Nikolai Ulyanov (UCSF). In aim 2, we will use smFRET and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to analyze the role(s) of telomere DNA structure and telomerase-associated proteins (POT1-TPP1, human; Teb1, Tetrahymena) in the regulation of telomerase-DNA interactions and catalysis. This work will be conducted in collaboration with Kathleen Collins (UCB) and Greg Hura (LBNL). In aim 3, we will exploit several novel single-molecule assays to critically evaluate existing models for telomerase conformational dynamics during processive telomere DNA synthesis."
"9334324","PROJECT SUMMARY Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder for which no disease modifying therapy exists. Clinical symptoms include progressive involuntary movement, psychiatric signs, cognitive decline, and a shortened lifespan. There is no currently available ?neuroprotective? therapy to modify the disease course of HD. Although normal huntingtin (Htt) function is not fully understood, mutant HTT (mHtt) has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction because it disrupts energetic function, leads to impaired mitochondrial protein trafficking and interruption of mitochondrial dynamics and protein import. Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a key determinant of the disease progression in HD. Therefore counteracting mHtt-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as a target of treatment for this devastating condition. Proper mitochondrial function requires well-orchestrated homeostasis and careful regulation of the activity of mitochondrial enzymes. Lysine acetylation is a highly regulated posttranslational modification in which a substantial number of mitochondrial proteins are subject to reversible lysine acetylation, and the function of these proteins is regulated by its acetylation status. SIRT3 has been demonstrated as a dominant mitochondrial deacetylase and controls acetylated levels of global mitochondrial proteins. The goal of the current application is to determine whether SIRT3 can protect against mHtt-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neurondegeneration in vivo and reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of SIRT3-mediated neuroprotection in HD. In pursuit of this goal, we will test the hypothesis that SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial acetylome and maintains mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis in response to mHtt through the following specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether overexpression of SIRT3 before or after the onset of disease will delay disease onset and slow disease progression in HD mouse models. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the SIRT3-medicated neuroprotection in HD by combining hypothesis-driven approach and unbiased acetylome approach. Successful completion of these specific aims will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the role of a mitochondrial fidelity protein, SIRT3, in HD and mitochondrial dysfunction with potential identification of novel targets for pharmacologic manipulation for HD."

"9310429","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Markers that identify risk for End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) and accurately report treatment efficacy will place glomerular diseases into a new paradigm of logical decision-making that improves outcome and efficient testing of new drugs. The Wiggins laboratory (supported by NIDDK) has used model systems to prove that podocyte depletion is the underlying mechanism responsible for progression of glomerular diseases to ESKD, and to demonstrate that urine podocyte mRNA markers non-invasively monitor accelerated podocyte detachment common to all progressive glomerular diseases in man and model systems. We have now developed novel automatable technology that allows high throughput measurement of podocyte density, number per tuft, size and other parameters in routine kidney biopsies. Application of these quantitative approaches to archival human biopsies shows a remarkable age-dependent decrease in podocyte density that can in part explain age-associated kidney failure in man (Aim 1). The kidney transplant setting (where protocol biopsies are routinely done prior to and following transplantation and where patients are closely followed long term) will be used to test the hypotheses that transition from the 2 kidney to the 1 kidney state is associated with hypertrophic podocyte stress that results in accelerated podocyte depletion long term, and that transplant glomerulopathy occurs in those individuals with high level prolonged podocyte depletion (Aim 2). Recurrent FSGS in the allograft will be used as a model system to test the hypothesis that FSGS supervenes when the podocyte density falls below a critical threshold (100 per 106 um3) (Aim 3). The relationship between the rate of podocyte detachment (as measured by the non-invasive urine pellet podocyte marker) and the rate of loss of podocytes from glomeruli (measured morphometrically as the decrease in podocyte number per glomerular tuft and density in relation to glomerular volume) will be defined. The insights developed and principles established will be applicable to prevention of progression in human glomerular diseases."
"9395346","Project Summary Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a degenerative retinal disease that affects over 2 million people worldwide. Patients initially suffer from night blindness and gradually lose their peripheral vision as their visual field becomes increasingly restricted. The majority of patients with RP are completely blind by age 40. Although there is no treatment for RP, many cell and gene replacement therapies are currently being explored. The overall goal of this project is to provide an improved understanding of the in vivo manifestations of the pathophysiology of RP, to guide the continued development and translation of the various therapeutic approaches. In order to effectively diagnose and treat RP, there is a need to develop methods to quantify disease progression on a cellular scale. We will accomplish this through the following two aims ? Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that cone reflectivity is positively correlated with function in the transition zone in patients with RP; Aim 2: Determine the sensitivity of in vivo retinal imaging tools (AOSLO & OCT) for detecting degenerative changes in cone structure in RP. For aim 1, we will use high-resolution imaging with adaptive optics to directly image the cone photoreceptors in patients with RP. This imaging has previously shown that cones in the RP retina don't reflect light normally, suggesting they are ?sick? or malformed. What isn't known is whether these cones are functional ? and we will examine this by using microperimetry to test the sensitivity of individual cones in areas of active disease in patients with RP. This work should result in a validated, cellular- resolution method for assessing retinal function. For aim 2, we will use a transgenic pig model of RP to study how understand how specific anatomical changes in cone structure (due to degeneration) affect the visualization of cones in high-resolution images of the living retina. This work addresses the broad knowledge gap surrounding the cellular origins of reflective signals in both AOSLO and OCT images, which will have a positive impact on the acceptance of these methods for noninvasive monitoring of photoreceptor structure and function in RP and other inherited retinal degenerations. Importantly, this project approaches this goal using both human RP patients and an established RP animal model, a truly unique aspect of the fellowship training."
"9322371","Project 1 Abstract The goals of Project 1 are to define molecular events responsible for cause, severity, and treatment of ANCA glomerulonephritis (GN). Aim 1 will address the genetic basis for susceptibility to ANCA GN using results from a genome-wide associated study (GWAS) of North American patients with ANCA GN performed in collaboration with the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium and included over 550 samples from a UNC patient cohort. Associations found in this GWAS will be fine mapped to identify genetic variants within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Computational analysis of specific HLA variants can predict potential inciting autoantigen peptides. These peptides will used to identify autoreactive T cells and characterize the response of these T cells. The results of this aim will inform what causes the disease in some people and may provide a potential therapy by tolerizing patients to the inciting autoantigen. Aim 2 and 3 we will dissect molecular events that distinguish active disease from remission. Aim 2 is based on studies implicating expression of the autoantigen correlates with disease activity and the expression differences between patients with active or remitting disease are regulated by epigenetic changes. The distribution and levels of histone modifications and DNA methylation will reveal an epigenetic signature that distinguishes active disease from remission. These results will provide a rationale for using therapies targeted against epigenetic regulation. Aim 3 will survey the transcriptional landscape of total leukocytes and 4 different cell types (neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, and myeloid derived suppressor-like cells) important in ANCA GN. Gene expression results will be used to establish a transcriptional signature that distinguishes active disease from remission. A panel of a subset of genes within this signature can be used to monitor disease status, which could ultimately guide clinicians in their choice of therapy. Expression data will be interrogated with genotypes from GWAS to map expression quantitative trait loci associated with disease activity. Finally, Aim 3 will directly tackle the issue of therapy by comparing the transcriptional profiles from patients with ANCA GN to the Connectivity Map, which is a compilation of transcriptional changes among cells lines following treatment with FDA approved drugs. This comparison will identify drugs that agonize or antagonize the transcriptional signature in ANCA GN, and importantly, is the rationale for repurposing drugs to treat ANCA GN. Project 1 addresses the primary questions of patients with ANCA GN: What caused the disease? What makes it more or less severe? How can it be treated?"

"9344632","The use of systems modeling and analysis is central to the study of the absorption, distribution and elimination of therapeutic drugs, understanding how drugs produce their effects and quantifying how genomic and other factors influence an individual's therapeutic response to treatment. Over the past 30 years, systems modeling and simulation has evolved to become a critical component in efforts to understand and quantify the processes of uptake, disposition and action of therapeutic drugs. Methods for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic systems modeling and analysis impact all aspects of drug development including in vitro, animal and human testing, as well as drug therapy. Systems modeling methodologies developed for studying pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic processes confront many challenges related in part to the severe restrictions on the number and type of measurements that are available from laboratory experiments and clinical trials, as well as the variability in the experiments and the complexity of the processes themselves. The overall goal of Core project #1 is to develop, evaluate, apply and disseminate systems modeling and analysis methods that will improve the study of drug action in all phases of the drug development, leading to more effective treatments."
"9349390","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive behaviors arise from an interplay between neural activity driven by external stimuli and internal activity patterns or brain states that relect motivation, intention and experience. Historically, neuroscience re- search has focused almost exclusively on stimulus-driven activity, ignoring the impact of internal state. Clearly, to develop theories of cognitive function and to understand psychiatric illnesses, which are disorders of internal state, a new neuroscience must be developed that measures and models both externally and internally generated neural activity and seeks to reveal the interactions between them. Several significant challenges have prevented the study of internal state. First, to analyze experimental data, it is typical to average across many trials. However, if the internal state differs from trial to trial, this procedure will destroy the state-dependent neural responses in data. Second, internal states may differ from each other only by the way that they process information in time, in other words, by their dynamics. Third, to date, the neuroscience field has no insight into how transitions between internal states arise and remain limited to only occur at appropriate times. This application meets these challenges by offering methods for 1) inferring the transition times between states so that state-specific activity can be elucidated; 2) discovering state-dependent dynamics in experimental data; and 3) determining the mechanisms for maintenance of internal state and transitioning between states. The study of internal state will support the basic neuroscience goal of developing circuit level theories neural computation and cognitive function. However, this application also impinges upon two hypotheses for the development of psychiatric disease and thus may lead to new approaches to diagnosis and treatment. First, illness may develop because state-specific computations have gone awry leading to symptoms such as, in the case of schizophrenia, the misidentification of internally generated spontaneous activity as external stimuli (that is, hallucinations). Second, and completely novel, psychiatric phenomena may arise, not from disordered states per se, but rather from disordered state transitions, or transitionopathies. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, for example, a state associated with a compulsion (for example, the need to check that the door is locked) maybe completely nor- mal, but pathology results from the failure to transition appropriately to a new state. The tools presented in this application will permit the comparison of data between healthy animals and disease models, and thus may give insight into how state-specific computations can fail and lead to disease. Additionally, by exploring potential mechanisms by which transitioning may become disordered, this application may offer insight into the development of transitionopathy. While the analysis methods developed in this application will initially be applied to data from animals, in the future they could be extended toward the analysis of noninvasive measures of brain activity in humans such as fMRI or EEG. If a robust theory of normal and abnormal internal states and state transitioning is developed, such analyses could aid in the diagnosis of psychiatric disease."
"9548419","Research focuses on molecular messenger systems characterized in the Snyder laboratory which are  substrates for actions of drugs of abuse. One involves a signaling cascade linking nitric oxide (NO),  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the ubiquitin E3-ligase Siah-1 and nuclear targets.  A second deals with inositol hexakisphosphate kinase-2 (IPK6K2) in cell death and neurotoxicity, while a  third addresses inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and neural function.

Recent work reveals a  physiologic role wherein nitrosylated GAPDH, responding to neuronal growth factors, via Siah-1, degrades  the histone methylating enzyme SUV39H1 leading to histone acetylation, gene transcription and dendritic  outgrowth. Cocaine, in behavioral stimulant doses, activates this pathway. We will elucidate this pathway.  IP6K2, a mediator of apoptosis, acts via p53. We are assessing how it distinguishes cell arrest/cell death via  influences upon DNA protein kinase to activate p53. Its role in cocaine and MPTP actions is being  investigated. IPMK is an inositol phosphate kinase and a PI3-kinase. We recently discovered that it is  physiologically nitrosylated and acetylated, then binds to CBP and CREB, apparently activating CREB  genetic programs. Cocaine administration activates IPMK nitrosylation/acetylation. We will explore its  neural functions using newly generated IPMK knockout mice. We recentiy discovered that IPMK binds the  small G-protein Rheb, known to activate mTOR. We previously showed that IPMK binds and stabilizes  mTOR. We will investigate whether IPMK/Rheb coordinately regulate mTOR signaling in the brain in  response to abusable drugs."

One of our current missions is to maintain this accreditation. As the only state food testing laboratory in Nebraska, the NDA Food Lab supports the statutory mission of the NDA Food Safety & Consumer Protection (FSCP) program. These two state programs rely on each other to improve public health in the State of Nebraska and to actively participate in building the National Integrated Food Safety System. These ties will be strengthened by the FDA Sample Collection and Analysis Project. The NDA Food Lab will use standard methods under an accredited Quality Management System to examine at least 75 food surveillance samples. These samples will be collected by NDA FSCP Sanitarians and the test results reported to both NDA FSCP and eLEXNET. The eLEXNET database supports the FDA's mission to protect public health as outlined by the Food Safety Modernization Act. The NDA Food Lab has the personnel, expertise, and physical laboratory capacity to participate in the National Integrated Food Safety System. Also, the NDA Food Laboratory has been an active FERN laboratory since September 2005 and continues to participate in surveillance projects and multi-laboratory validation studies. There are three chemists, who will perform microbiological food analyses for the Sample Collection and Analysis Project, and a QA Manager, who will continue oversight of the Quality Management System in order to maintain ISO 17025 accreditation. Lab personnel will travel to annual face-to-face conferences and attend off-site training to learn about upcoming revisions to the ISO/IEC 17025 standards. Further, the NDA Food Lab will continue the annual renewal of service agreements for the preventive maintenance and/or calibration of lab equipment. The NDA FSCP has been enrolled in Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) since 2012 and has a current human food safety inspection contract with FDA. The sampling contract between the NDA Food Lab and FSCP will be revised in the upcoming project year to include the collection and analysis of at least 75 food surveillance samples. These samples will be gathered in addition to routine samples and food samples implicated in foodborne outbreaks. This new sample collection program is viewed as a means of elevating communication and collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies because future advances in food safety for public health lie in the prevention of illness rather than reaction to it."

"9356821","Abstract Project 4 is focused on testing the safety of novel inhaled mucolytic compounds in persons with asthma (specific aim 1), testing these in an allergen challenge model of acute exacerbation in mild mite allergic asthmatics (specific aim 2), and examining the effect of such compounds on mucociliary clearance (MCC) and lung function in moderate asthmatics on stable controller therapy over a 2-week period (specific aim 3). Studies from our group indicate that S-S bonds are a key element in increased viscosity of mucus in asthma and have catalyzed the study of thiol based mucolytics for asthma in this tPPG. The best candidate for this intervention is P2176, a di-thiol mucolytic which has robust ability to degrade mucins in sputum samples from asthmatics in vitro, has been well tolerated in animals in pre-clinical studies, and is currently in Phase I studies of healthy volunteers. Safety studies of P2176 in asthmatics will be the major focus in years 1-2. In years 2-5, we will begin to screen mite-allergic asthmatics for late phase responsiveness to mite allergen, and begin to pursue aims 2 and 3. Specific Aim 2 will examine the effect of P2176 on an allergen-induced late phase response, which we have shown is associated with increased mucus secretion and decreased MCC. Success with SA2 would suggest a role for mucolytics in acute exacerbation of asthma. Specific Aim 3 will examine the effect of 2 weeks daily treatment on MCC in volunteers with moderate asthma. If successful, this study would indicate the P2176 has a role in maintenance therapy for asthma in persons with long term mucus-derived airway obstruction. "
"9338241","Although antibodies (Abs) to brain antigens have been implicated in the development of ASD, and the specificities of these Abs are beginning to be identified, there has been no direct quantification of the mechanisms responsible for the behavioral aberrancies associated with ASD. Communication between neurons in different brain regions requires the neurons to establish information delivery circuits with extended arms connecting the neurons located at different distances. Interference with proper connections can affect numerous behaviors as well as normal body functions. This study will utilize brains from mice that have ASD- like behaviors (BTBR strain) and those with normal behavior unless exposed to altered fetomaternal influences from toxicant exposures with HgCl2 and/or diesel exhaust particles (DEP). Prenatal Hg and DEP effects have been reported to induce ASD-like behaviors similar to those of BTBR mice, which have anti-brain Abs and neuroinflammation. These immune activities in the brain are posited to interfere with development of proper neuronal connections. The hypothesis is that environmental toxicants induce a combination of fetal innate immune cell (microglial) activities and maternal Abs to initiate a detrimental neuroinflammatory response in the developing brain. The resultant inflammation and immune interferences with neuronal structures/functions alter synaptic neuronal connections and functions resulting in the ASD-like behaviors of offspring. Microglia are known to influence the development of neuronal circuits, so it is not surprising that toxicants, which can alter immune cell phenotypes, could directly affect the type of microglia developed from yolk sac progenitors, their distribution in the brain, and their functions in the presence of immune complexes (Abs and brain antigens). The common specificities from mouse studies will be used to explore the Ab specificities in newborn blood of children now known to have ASD. In the proposed study, Abs will be assayed in organotypic co-cultures of fetal or neonatal tissue from different brain regions to quantify modulation of ?neuronal connectivity?. The brain regions will come from normal untreated mice or from brain regions of the fetuses or neonates from Hg and DEP exposed dams ± the Abs with common specificities of experimental mice and human newborns. By mixing the source of the mouse brain region, we will investigate if the detriment is more with the sprouting or targeted region. The study has short-term and long-term impact on the field of ASD research. The most immediate impact is identification of an ?Ab Biosignature of ASD? that could diagnose the ASD phenotype at birth. Another short-term impact would be delineation of the specificities and mode of action of the Abs and microglia that identify ASD-related mechanisms, which in the long-term could aid in determining interventions that might be most appropriate. Identification of the mechanisms detrimental to normal neuronal connectivity and function could assist in the development of therapeutic interventions. The study also will validate the establishment of an experimental model system to screen additional environmental toxicants."
"9476515","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While through efforts like the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, ARDSNet and others, supportive therapies have improved survival of the critically injured and/or septic patient, nonetheless, a substantial number still develop this morbid syndrome and die. Unfortunately, as no true medicinal/ molecular therapeutic agent is presently available to treat the developing immune/ organ dysfunction in these individuals or diagnose/ prognose their trajectory, the need remains to further clarify the complex pathobiology of traumatic shock and/or sepsis so as to identify such agents. In this regard, we have recently uncovered a novel role for a family of cell-associated co-inhibitory receptors, Programmed Cell Death Receptor-1 [PD-1] and B-/T-Lymphocyte Attenuator [BTLA] and their respective ligands, popularly referred to as checkpoint proteins. What our data and information developing in the field tell us is that a number of these receptors may have far more diverse cell/organ targets than those of us historically appreciated. While checkpoint protein expression on CD4/CD8 lymphoid cells has a role in these dysfunctional septic processes, one of the novel observations we have made is that they appear to have unanticipated effects on phagocyte as well as `innate regulatory lymphoid cell' functions that also seems to contribute to the increased susceptibility/ immune suppression in the critically ill injured and/or septic patient/ animal. With this in mind, e propose to examine the following general hypothesis in this MIRA: that the classic co-inhibitory receptor(s), PD-1, BTLA and/or their ligands, play a novel role(s) in regulating the development of shock/septic immune/ organ dysfunction via novel myeloid cell and/or select regulatory lymphoid subset interactions with other immune or non-immune cells present in a given tissue. In the 1st sub-project area we will determine how the select expression of PD-1 or BTLA, on myeloid as opposed to lymphoid cells alters the development of morbid events associated with sepsis; then, how the expression of ligands for these co-inhibitory molecules, on leukocytes and/or endothelial/ epithelial cells, contribute to the onset of septic liver, intestine and/or kidey dysfunction. In our 2nd sub-project area, we will utilize a novel murine model of indirect-acute lung injury (iALI)(dual insults of hemorrhage shock followed by CLP) to ask how checkpoint protein expression not only effect the patho-mechanisms driving the development of iALI, but how are these co-inhibitors altering cell `priming'/'innate immune memory'/function. Finally, (3rd) since the neonate possesses a unique/naïve immune system and is more susceptible to morbid response in the face of infectious challenge; we ask if the expression of members of the PD-1 family and/or their ligands not only have a comparative impact on the response to septic insult, but how it might be mediated? To do this we will interrogate these 3 cogent models of sepsis, shock/sepsis and/or neonatal sepsis, by applying a combination genetic mouse models, adoptive transfer and/or chimeric mouse constructs to examine these questions/ hypotheses along with select observational clinical studies in the critical ill patient population."

During the current funding period the colony has been maintained at a level of approximately 800 animals. This was a management decision based on the demand from NIH funded AIDS researchers and available funds to support the colony. Going forward we expect to expand production in the next few years based on recent developments in funding and animal demand. The specific aims address the components specified in the funding opportunity announcement (FOA) and are divided into the overall program description, husbandry core, viral testing core and genetics/MHC core. Program income (and Center funds) will be used to fund components of the program not covered by grant funds including: per diem for any colony animals in excess of the 800 supported by this application, testing for those animals, infrastructure repairs and improvements, veterinary support for all of the U42 colony animals, behavioral management support, and portions of the genetic testing for the entire U42 colony. Specific Aims: · Overall. To maintain the existing SPF colony and distribute available animals to  the NIH funded AIDS research community. · Husbandry and Management.

"9502482","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on recent successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which has acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing ConnectomeDB data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include Connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded as U01 projects under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases RFA. The platform will be developed and operated following policies and procedures vetted by the HCP to ensure the privacy and security of the data hosted by the CCF. Together, these three aims will establish the CCF as a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and sharing. The CCF's suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing will ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database will enable the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease."
"9363943","Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in both sickle cell disease (SCD) and ?-thalassemia is an extremely promising approach to ameliorate the severity of both diseases. Recent molecular studies have revealed new regulators of the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch in humans, including BCL11A. BCL11A is a genetically and functionally validated regulator of ?-globin expression and a prime candidate for targeted therapy aimed at induction of HbF in individuals with SCD. Curative treatment for SCD can be attained with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Graft failure and transplant-related mortality contribute to the significant complications associated with allogeneic HSCT in SCD. Favorable outcomes in SCD are largely dependent on the availability of matched sibling donors and the incidence of graft failure and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Fewer than 10% of SCD patients have unaffected HLA-matched sibling potential donors. Gene therapy for the hemoglobinopathies offers the clear advantage of eliminating the risk of GVHD and the need to identify suitable stem cell donors by the use of autologous cells. Targeting BCL11A in SCD holds the significant advantage that adequate knockdown of BCL11A in erythroid cells derived from gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) will increase HbF expression while concurrently reducing expression of mutant HbS. Since hemoglobin polymerization in sickle red cells is highly dependent on the intracellular concentration of HbS and is strongly inhibited by HbF, vectors effectively targeting BCL11A should prevent the cellular phenotype of sickle-containing red cells. Reduced hemoglobin polymerization would thus lead to a pronounced increase in the red cell half-life in vivo. We have recently shown that that use of erythroid-specific expression of microRNA adapted shRNAs (shRNAmiR) targeting BCL11A effectively induces HbF in human erythroid cells derived from transduced HSCs, largely attenuating the hematologic effects of SCD in a murine model. Based on mathematical modeling and preclinical data, we predict that transduction of human HSCs will reduce red cell sickling in a range that will significantly attenuate the SCD phenotype. Based on these data, we propose a pilot/feasibility study in a limited cohort of SCD patients determine the applicability of this approach."
"9353315","The number of targeted therapies available for the treatment of different cancers increases annually. However, for many of these agents, we do not have effective predictive biomarkers. The result is that patients who might benefit for certain therapies are not receiving them, and patients receive therapies from which they receive no benefit. In many cases, it is likely that an individual drug might be effective in only a small subset of a particular cancer, so that without a validated predictive biomarker, introduction to that cancer is impossible. W propose a novel and generalizable functional predictive biomarker approach, based on measuring death signaling early in the response to targeted therapies. We hypothesize that if we  could identify those cancer cells that induce the strongest activation ofthe mitochondrial apoptotic pathway at early time points in response to a drug, we could thus identify those tumors that are most likely to respond in vivo. We are greatly assisted in this approach by our development of a novel tool, BH3 profiling, which can measure a cell's proximity to the threshold of apoptosis. Our approach is to treat cells with drugs, measure at short time points the extent to which apoptotic signaling is forcing cells toward the threshold of apoptosis, a method we call Dynamic BH3 Profiling. As we will show, we are now adept at making such measurements. Moreover, we already have exciting preliminary data that suggests that those cells that are  pushed the most are also those that are destined to choose death as a cell fate. We propose to develop Dynamic BH3 profling first in AML cell lines, and then in murine AML primagrafts. Our output will be a set of drugs for which we have validated Dynamic BH3 profiling as a predicitve biomarker in vivo. These drugs might be useful as single agents, or as agents to increase priming to enhance sensitiity to conventional, curative agents. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is an attractive disease in which to test our ideas because of our established expertise, established relationships, and access to clinical samples. Dynamic BH3 profling has the potential to expand the pharmacopeia and personalize therapeutic decision making for  the AML patient."

"9550868","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this renewal is to respond to two commonly observed clinical problems in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease by engineering a biomimetic TMJ disc complex. This will subsequently be implanted in a porcine animal model. The overall hypothesis is that the implantation of an anatomically-shaped, robust TMJ disc, engineered with attachments and containing appropriate matrix anisotropy, will be able to address TMJ disc perforation (via a patch approach) and TMJ disc lateral defects (via a subtotal approach). The following three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: 1) to characterize the bulk and interfacial properties of the discal attachments, 2) to engineer an anatomically-correct TMJ disc with attachments, and 3) implant this engineered TMJ disc complex in a porcine animal model with clinically representative in vivo defects. While in the previous grant the properties of the TMJ disc were investigated to inform the engineering of the TMJ disc, collaboration with TMJ surgeons has highlighted the functional importance of the disc attachments. Aim 1 will inform the engineering of the TMJ disc and attachments for Aim 2, by characterizing the biochemical composition, biomechanical properties, and cellular population of the disc attachments and interface. The previous grant also identified the need for a biological TMJ disc replacement to match the native tissue shape and organization. It also recognized the costal cartilage as an alternative cell source for TMJ disc engineering. Therefore, Aim 2 will use this cell source to generate robust constructs with anisotropic features for implantation in Aim 3, and the properties of this TMJ disc complex will be modified using ion channel modulators, a matrix remodeling enzyme, and a tension-compression bioreactor. Finally, Aim 3 will devise methods to surgically access the TMJ, and for the first time, implant and secure an engineered TMJ disc complex in vivo, to fill clinically relevant TMJ disc defects in a porcine model. This proposal seeks to: 1) characterize the discal attachments and their function in the TMJ, to 2) inform the tissue engineering of a functional biological replacement TMJ disc complex, and 3) develop a surgical approach to implant this replacement.

"9513123","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of new targeted therapies for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the more urgent needs in clinical hepatology. To reach this goal, large multidisciplinary networks are required. The proposed initiative Integrated Approaches for Identifying Molecular Targets in Alcoholic Hepatitis (InTeam) will coordinate a multidisciplinary group composed of clinicians, physician-scientists, basic scientists and bioinformatics experts. The overarching hypothesis of InTeam is that the most rational way to provide a useful framework for future clinical trials in (AH) consists of the (i) determination of ey drivers of the disease process, (ii) classification of molecular profiles and subtypes of AH, and (iii) identification of druggable targets based on both key drivers and molecular classification. Moreover, mouse models for AH are lacking making it impossible to evaluate promising targets in preclinical mouse studies in a meaningful manner. For this purpose, InTeam will integrate data obtained from molecular pathology studies in human AH and functional studies of key pathways in animal models. The proposed InTeam consortium includes three research projects, ten clinical centers, a Human Biorepository and a Mouse Models Core. The Human Biorepository Core will generate the to-date largest collection of samples from patients with AH from 10 academic liver centers and a comprehensive database that will serve as a basis for the proposed translational studies and be a valuable asset for the broader scientific community. The Mouse Models core will conduct murine studies after establishing and evaluating mouse models of AH based on the pathophysiology and molecular drivers of human AH determined by this consortium. The three scientific projects will combine a thorough molecular characterization of patients with AH with studies on key and targetable pathways that drive key aspects of AH disease progression and outcome such as inflammation, injury and regeneration. Project 1 (Molecular Subtypes for Targeted Therapies in Alcoholic Hepatitis, PIs: Ramon Bataller and Philippe Mathurin) will identify molecular and cellular drivers of AH to provide a molecular classification using RNA sequencing, kinomic, metabolomic and novel systems biology approaches, and determine contributors to unfavorable outcome and the associated progenitor cell accumulation. Project 2 (DAMPs for Targeting Alcoholic Hepatitis, PIs: Robert Schwabe and Wajahat Mehal) will explore the contribution of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including HMGB1 and mitochondrial DAMPs, to the development of hepatic and systemic inflammation, and organ damage in AH. Project 3 (Microbiota as Therapeutic Targets in Alcoholic Hepatitis, PIs: Bernd Schnabl and David Brenner) will using cutting-edge pyrosequencing and bioanalytical tools to investigate changes in the intestinal microbiome, metatranscriptome and metabolome as potential contributors and targets for therapeutic interventions in AH. In summary, the InTeam network will provide a unique combination of the to-date largest systematic sample and data collection of AH patient samples with a strong group of scientists dedicated to translational AH research and a large network of participating clinical centers. We anticipate that the systematic approach and translational nature of this consortium will advance the understanding of AH, and provide novel approaches for its prevention and treatment."

This experience led the applicant to Case Western Reserve University where she completed her doctoral studies under the guidance of Dr. Ruth Keri on the forkhead box transcription factor, FOXA1, in normal mammary gland development and luminal breast cancer. Inspired to expand her expertise to the tumor microenvironment (TME), the applicant then ensued postdoctoral training in Dr. Michael Ostrowski?s lab at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC). The OSUCCC was recently bestowed an ?exceptional? ranking by the National Cancer Institute, and provides a strong atmosphere of collaborative, high impact science that is ideal for Dr. Sizemore to train towards her ultimate goal of a tenure-track faculty position. Dr. Sizemore?s postdoctoral work has been multi-faceted with one of her four projects culminating in this application, which addresses the role of interactive PDGFR? signaling during breast cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. PDGFR? is a targetable receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in cancer stroma and perivasculature, but its role in the breast primary and metastatic TME is not understood. To address this fundamental question, a mouse model with mesenchymal-specific activation of PDGFR? was created. These mice exhibit mammary hyperplasia and upon injection with murine breast cancer cells, display increased experimental metastases only to the brain, with intracranial tumor growth that is dependent on tumor derived PDGF-B, the ligand for PDGFR?. These preliminary findings suggest PDGF-B-to- PDGFR? signaling in the brain metastatic TME promotes metastatic progression of a subset of breast cancers. To test this hypothesis, Specific aim 1 will use mouse genetic mesenchymal-specific and pericyte-specific gain-of-function as well as pharmacologic loss-of-function approaches to determine whether PDGFR? establishes a metastatic TME that potentiates tumor growth and disease progression within the brain. Specific aim 2 will assess whether PDGF-B expression affects primary tumor growth, brain metastasis and correlates with site-specific metastasis in patients. Specific aim 3 will uncover the functional mechanisms underlying how tumor-stromal PDGFR? signaling dictates pericyte and/or tumor cell adhesion and motility during breast cancer progression. Breast brain metastases occur in 10-20% of all metastatic breast cancer patients yielding only a ~20% one year-survival rate. The completion of this proposal will uncover the relevance of PDGFR? in the breast TME and metastatic niche, and assess the clinical utility of targeting this pathway. The mouse models evaluated herein are to the applicant?s knowledge the first to model the brain metastatic niche. This K22 period will allow the candidate the protected time to characterize these models, expand her expertise in neuro- oncology and the perivasculature, and provide an excellent launching point to begin her independent career."
"9376851","Project summary and abstract Human disease is caused by several different types of structural variation, including deletions, duplications, and inter and intra chromosomal rearrangements. Currently, no one diagnostic test can identify all of these changes, which can lead to a diagnostic odyssey with serial genetic testing. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) allows for the detection of point mutations, small indels and large structural variants (SV) in a single test, and has the potential to replace both exome sequencing and chromosomal microarrays in the clinical setting. However, the adoption of clinical testing for SVs from WGS has been hampered by both technical and interpretative challenges. Existing algorithms for the detection of SVs from WGS suffer from high false-positive rates, reference bias, and mappability issues. This proposal will address the issues of detection, interpretation, and reanalysis of copy number and other structural variation in individuals presenting with pediatric genetic disorders. We will utilize SV data from various types of genomic technologies in order to minimize false positives, incorporate genomic positional information, and enhance pathogenicity determination by the prioritization of these variants. In this proposal, we will utilize two orthogonal methodologies, chromosomal microarray and de novo assembled optical genome maps, to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of SV detection. Since the number of SVs identified from whole genome data can number into the thousands, the lack of tools for annotation and interpretation of SVs results in a huge burden for clinical laboratories. We propose to facilitate the prioritization of clinically-relevant SV by developing web-based analysis tools that integrate patients? phenotypes with SV-specific annotations for efficient prioritization and reporting of clinically relevant SVs. We will apply these tools towards the reanalysis copy number variants of uncertain clinical significance previously identified in our clinical laboratory. In addition, additional characterization of duplications of uncertain clinical significance with be investigated using targeted optical maps to determine the location and orientation of the duplicated region. The impact of new gene discovery on SV interpretation, as well as additional information regarding insertional locations, will be assessed for their contribution to changes in classification of SVs."
"9360237","PROJECT SUMMARY (Laboratory for Biomolecular Structure and Function) The OUHSC X-ray Core Facility was initiated in 1998 with a NIH IDeA grant to Dr. Paul Weigel, former chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The facility was recently renamed the Laboratory of Biomolecular Structure and Function (LBSF). The LBSF provides expertise and assess to instruments to the individual COBRE projects on a variety of techniques critical to crystallographic and small angle X-ray scattering studies (SAXS) of proteins and nucleic acids. The crystallographic techniques include screening crystals for diffraction quality at room temperature, crystal cryo-protectant screening, crystal cryprotection under high pressure, diffraction data collection, diffraction data processing, space group assignment, structure determination, structure refinement, structure analysis, structure interpretatoin, and figure preparation. The SAXS-related methods include dynamic light scattering to check for aggregates and to measure polydispersity prior to sending the samples for SAXS data colleciton at national facilities. In Phase I of the COBRE, the facility was upgraded with a new Rigaku MicroMax 007 X-ray generator, a plate Wyatt plate-reading dynamic light scattering instrument for high throughput studies, and a Leica microscope for making images of crystals. The new X-ray generator gives a four-fold more intense X-ray beam of smaller diameter. These features are critical for the screening the small, weakly diffracting crystals common in the COBRE research projects. The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation donated a Mar345 image plate X-ray dectector, a Varimax HF optic system, an Oxford cryosystem, and a MSC Xe-Siter apparatus for introducing noble gases into protien cavities in crystals for phasing experiments. The Rigaku X-ray system was modifed by adding a second bench to enable the addition of the Mar345 system to the second port of the X-ray generator. The RaxisIV system was enclosed with shielding that enables users to mount crystals on the Mar system while data are being collected on the Rigaku system. This setup has enabled two groups to collect data simultaneously or one group to collect diffraction data from two crystals at the same time. The new X-ray generator has been used to screen protein and RNA crystals for diffraction quality and to develop cryo-conditions. The plate-reading DLS apparatus has been used to screen buffers for those that promote protein stability for protein storage and crystallization trials. DLS has also been used to screen SAXS samples for the presence of aggregates prior to shipment to SAXS beam lines at national facilities. In Phase I, ten groups participated in SAXS studies. During Phase II, an Integrative Molecular Modeling Unit will be added to faciltate intenstive computational work such as virutal screening for candidate drug molecules, molecular dynamics simulations, molecular replacement with phenix-rosetta, and molecular modeling of SAXS data with ensenbles of structures. This unit will be managed on a daily basis by Dr. Tim Mather from OMRF who is also an adjunct member of the OUHSC Department of Biochemistry and Molecualr Biology. In addtion, an Art Robbins crystallization robot for the crystallizaton of integral membrane proteins in the lipidic cubic phase will be added to the LBSF to facilitate crystallograpic studies of membrane proteins on the OUHSC campus. The crystallization robots in the MCL on the OU-Norman campus will continue to be used for soluble proteins. The MCL will also be used for high- troughput screening of crystals with the Plate-Mate and Pilatus detector. OUHSC has been providing salary for a staff sceintist, Dr. Simon Terzyan, who was hired in 2015 to manage the day-to-day operatons of the LBSF. He maintains the instruments, schedules users, and provides training in crystallography. He has also installed most of the new instruments. In 2015, the LBSF became a core lab in the suite of core labs supported by the Vice President of Research (VPR). The administrative core of this suite issues invoices and manages the independent account of the LBSF. The VPR setup an oversight committee for the LBSF. This committee is chaired by the COBRE associate director. The Director of the LBSF, Dr. Blaine Mooers, serves on this committee as an ad hoc member, promotes the LBSF in seminars, oversees the Lab Manager, writes equipment grant applications, and writes progress reports for the VPR, EAC, and NIH. He had been the director of this facility since 2008. Drs Mooers and Terzyan have over 45 years of combined experience in macromolecular crystallography that will help the Project Investigators achieve success in their proposed structural studies during Phase II."
"9356813","  The overarching therapeutic goal for the UNC tPPG renewal is to clear the hyperconcentrated, adherent mucus that promotes airways obstruction, inflammation, and infection. A straightforward approach to treat muco-obstructive diseases is to rehydrate airway surfaces. However, recent experimental and biophysical analyses have identified that thickened adherent mucus can be modified to generate ?permanent? gels resistant to clearance by hydration. The therapeutic strategy identified to clear permanent mucus gels is the reduction mucin molecular weight (MW). Consequently, the tPPG is configured to take advantage of novel thiol mucin MW reducing agents, e.g., a di-thiol P2176 and a monothiol P2114, and has assembled a full drug development team to quickly and safely bring these molecules into patient populations in need. The tPPG will be overseen by a decision making Project Development/Statistical Core (Core A, Richard C. Boucher, MD, PI) that will guide selection and development of thiol class compounds and oversee selection of drug dose, dosing frequency, drug formulation and clinical trial designs. Projects/Cores overseen include: Project 1 (Michael Rubinstein, PhD., PI: Mechanism of Action of Mucolytics in Improving Mucus Clearance in Lung Disease), will focus on the relative roles of MUC5AC (an ?asthma? mucin) vs. MUC5B (a ?CF/COPD? mucin) as disease specific targets and generate biophysical measurements to assist in compound selection and as biophysical assays for the clinic. Project 2 (Richard C. Boucher, MD, PI: PK/PD Requirements for Mucolytic Therapeutic Agents In Vitro and In Vivo), will utilize in vitro, small animal, and large animal models to compare P2176 with P2114 with respect to mucolytic dose, dosing frequency, and the requirement for a hypertonic saline (HS) formulation. Project 3 (Scott Donaldson, MD, PI: Treatment of Mucostasis and Airways Obstruction in Cystic Fibrosis with a Novel Mucolytic), will test the safety and short term efficacy of P2176/P2114 in CF populations. Project 4 (David Peden, MD, PI: Treatment of Mucostasis and Airways Obstruction in Asthma with a Novel Mucolytic), will test on the safety and short-term efficacy of P2176/P2114 in patients with asthma under basal and allergen challenged conditions. The projects will be supported by three cores: (1) Core B, Analytics for Mucolytics (Mehmet Kesimer, PhD, PI), will provide a broad spectrum of biophysical and biochemical measurements of mucolysis; (2) Core C, In-vivo Imaging of Mucus Obstruction and Clearance (William Bennett, PhD, PI) will provide imaging of subjects, including radio-nuclide mucociliary clearance measurements and F19-MR ventilation imaging; and, (3) Core D, The Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (Charles Esther, MD, PhD, PI) will provide measurements of pharmacodynamic and drug pharmacokinetic measurements of thiol compounds. The tPPG deliverable is to mobilize our experienced drug development group to advance a novel class of IND-ready therapeutic compounds into patients in need of pulmonary mucus clearance, including, asthma, CF, ultimately COPD."
"9338313","The availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with algucosidase alfa (rhGAA, Myozyme?,  Lumizyme?) has been commercially available since 2006 and, in general, has improved the natural history  for patients with Infantile Pompe Disease (IPD). Cross Reactive Immunologic Material (CRIM) status is a  well-appreciated factor influencing clinical outcomes, as patients who are characterized as CRIM-negative  (CN) with no residual GAA enzyme activity are at risk to develop a strong immune response against rhGAA  resulting in clinical decline and ultimately death despite continued ERT. Additionally, a subset of CRIM-positive  (CP) patients also develope high sustained antibody titers (HSAT). We have developed and  demonstrated the success of immune modulation prophylactically in CN patients prior to starting ERT, as  well as for CN and CP patients in the entrenched setting after the development of HSAT. With such  advances in treatment IPD patients are living longer, transforming the clinical course of Pompe disease as  we know it. Further investigation is needed to characterize the emerging natural history of IPD survivors and  assess the efficacy of immune tolerance induction (ITI) and suppression algorithms. With supplemental  support from Genzyme Corporation and the Alice & YT Chen Pediatrics Genetics & Genomics Research  Center, continuation of this observational study [LDN6709; Duke IRB Pro00001562] aims to 1) explore  clinical response to treatment in CP and CN IPD patients receiving ERT with and without immune  suppression regimens through prospective and retrospective data collection; 2) continue to correlate GAA  genotype with CRIM status in association with immune responses; and 3) assess efficacy of immune  modulation prophylactically in CN IPD, suppression of HSAT in the entrenched setting, as well as assess  prophylactic ITI for CP IPD. Continued long-term clinical data collection will help us to gain a better  understanding of natural history and treatment outcomes in IPD, which is expected to guide the use or  development of new therapeutic interventions for the next generation of IPD patients?the importance of  which is underscored by the advent of newborn screening for IPD."

"9351195","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the U.S. population ages, the prevalence of cancer and its impact on life span, quality of life, and healthcare costs are on the rise. While cancer treatments have greatly improved over the past several decades, they are still inadequate for many forms of cancers, indicating the urgent need for new approaches. A rapidly growing area of research with the potential to greatly improve cancer therapy is the use of immune system as an anti-tumor agent. Currently, several drugs have been developed that target the immune system to treat cancers; however, these drugs are mainly designed to act against late stages of cancers, when cancer cells have already spread to other parts of the body. The limited success of these drugs highlights the need for a fundamentally new approach to cancer treatment using the immune system. The goal of this application is to explore the anti-tumor properties of an immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) that can drive a high degree of immune activation sufficient to prevent cancer formation from pre-cancerous lesions in the first place. This research raises a great opportunity to discover the immune mechanism mediating the anti-tumor effects of TSLP, which can be leveraged in cancer therapy and prevention. To pursue this goal, I will study skin cancer as an ideal cancer model in which the spatial and temporal relationship between inflammation and cancer development can be determined with exceptional precision. Moreover, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer; it is readily identifiable, and amenable to treatment. With the ultimate goal of improving cancer treatment, I plan to study the underlying mechanism of immune activation by TSLP and determine its impact on skin cancer therapy in patients. TSLP is made in the skin and plays a critical role in causing allergic diseases such as eczema. We and others have demonstrated that the skin rash caused by high TSLP levels leads to strong cancer resistance in the affected skin. Our findings are supported by population studies showing resistance to skin cancers among patients with allergic diseases. Importantly, we have found that a short-term increase in TSLP levels leads to a long-lasting resistance to skin cancer with no sign of allergic skin disease in our animal models and patients. This data provides the evidence that immune factors causing inflammatory diseases can be optimized for use in cancer therapy while avoiding their chronic side effects. To determine if TSLP is a good candidate for use in skin cancer immunotherapy, I will study how TSLP causes skin cancer resistance. Specifically, this application will apply mouse models of skin cancer and data from clinical trials to determine (1) the tumor-associated signals that are detected by TSLP-stimulated immune cells to specifically target the tumors, (2) the downstream mechanism by which TSLP-activated immune cells suppress skin cancer development, and (3) the effects of TSLP induction on pre- cancerous skin lesions in humans. The outcome of these studies will help shed light on the mechanism of TSLP action against cancer and promote its development for skin cancer immunotherapy. Considering the emerging importance of the immune system in cancer biology, the understanding of how a pro-inflammatory factor affects cancer development is highly applicable for identifying other immune factors that can be effective in cancer treatment."
"9333137","ABSTRACT How does the molecular composition of cells and cell-cell contacts change over time or after experimental manipulations? This fundamental question is asked across all fields of biomedical science and is at the heart of most studies focused on determining cellular and molecular mechanisms of biological phenomenon. Yet, our ability to answer this question is severely constrained by the limitations of current methods to detect the protein composition of particular cellular structures. Imagine the rapid progress biological science could make if we could detect more than a handful of proteins at specified locations on cells in each experiment. The objective of our project is to develop a new approach to achieve this goal?called ?context-rich mass cytometry? ?a technology that enables multi-parametric analysis of proteins in the context of cellular interactions. Mass spectrometry has recently emerged as a powerful tool for cell analysis. One version of this technology called mass cytometry or CyToF is used for multi-parametric analysis of protein expression in single cells. It is similar to flow cytometry in that cells are labeled with antibodies and analyzed on cell-by-cell basis in high- throughput manner. However, unlike flow cytometry which employs fluorescently-labeled antibodies and is limited to ~12 parameters, mass cytometry employs rare earth metals as antibody labels and may be used to analyze up to 60 intracellular or cell surface markers. While an exciting technology, mass cytometry requires that cells be extracted from their native microenvironment and homogenized into single cell suspension prior to analysis. This makes connecting the protein signature to the microenvironment context very challenging. The objective of our project is to develop ?context-rich mass cytometry? ?a technology that enables multi- parametric analysis of proteins in the context of cellular interactions. Once developed this mass spectrometry approach will be used to determine the composition and organization of proteins within immune synapses. This new knowledge enabled by our technology may, in the future, be parlayed into strategies and therapies for preventing infections."
"9432324","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells within human bone marrow that are responsible both for the life-long replenishment of all blood cell lineages and for the curative effects of bone marrow transplantation. The creation of human induced pluripotent stem cells holds great promise for cellular regeneration therapies, but it is not currently possible to instruct these cells to generate HSCs in vitro. The goal of this application is to determine how pro-inflammatory signaling via NF-kB instructs HSC fate in the vertebrate embryo, and how this process is regulated by Progranulin a (Pgrna), with the ultimate goal of replicating HSC generation in vitro for clinical utility. My working hypothesis is that early pro-inflammatory inputs converge to activate NF-kB, which in turn activates key signaling events in the specification of HSC fate. These pro-inflammatory signals need to be downregulated soon after HSC specification; my preliminary results suggest that Pgrna functions in this manner. To test these hypotheses, this proposal consists of 2 aims: (1) Characterize the role of NF-kB in HSC specification; and (2) identify the role of Pgrna in HSC emergence. This study will be conducted in zebrafish, which are an ideal system for direct visualization of HSCs and have served as a model organism to study human disease. To achieve this application?s goals, novel transgenic and mutant lines will be generated, and qPCR, FACS-sorting, RNA-seq and confocal microscopy techniques will be utilized.  Dr. Espin Palazon is a postdoctoral fellow in David Traver?s laboratory at UCSD whose ultimate career goal is to lead an independent research group focused on stem cells at a major research institution. Her short- term goals are (1) to determine the spatiotemporal requirements of NF-kB within hemogenic endothelium, and the downstream genes regulated to specify HSCs; and (2) to elucidate how Pgrna governs HSC emergence. She was recruited to join Dr. Traver?s group because of her strong background in immunology and the zebrafish animal model. The project outlined in this proposal will allow Dr. Espin Palazon to transition from a mentored scientific position to an independent research career, helping her gain expertise in FACS sorting, RNA-seq, genome editing techniques, and HSC biology, all of which are fundamental to establish her independent lab. Dr. Espin Palazon will meet and present her work to experts in development, immunology and hematology, in addition to presenting her data to a formal mentorship committee comprised of senior experts that will aid her transition to an independent researcher. UCSD offers numerous courses that Dr. Espin Palazon will attend, as well as seminars on career development and laboratory management. The vibrant, collaborative scientific atmosphere at UCSD is an ideal environment for Dr. Espin Palazon to develop during the mentored phase of her award, and will be instrumental in forming the foundation for the future success of these studies. She is well poised to execute the proposed work, achieve her career development and training goals and to contribute high impact research to the scientific community."
"9479506","Project Summary / Abstract  The Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) established a uniform foundation for management of state programs responsible for the regulation of manufactured food facilities, including laboratory analysis for chemical and microbiological contaminants. Based on the Georgia Department of Agriculture?s (GDA) 2011 Improvement Plan Report, needs were determined and a cooperative agreement was awarded by FDA. This agreement (Laboratory Support Improvement Plan) was to provide the regulatory agency?s primary servicing lab the necessary resources to adopt and implement international standards. Furthermore, the labs would be assessed or audited to these standard (ISO/IEC 17025:2005) requirements by a third-party accrediting body. GDA laboratories recently achieved accreditation which assists their regulatory agencies in compliance requirements for contractual work on behalf of FDA.  In order for GDA laboratories to maintain their accreditation, we are requesting funding in the form of a cooperative agreement entitled, ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation Maintenance and Enhancement for State Food Testing Laboratories (Competition A), to offset the added expense of required Quality Assurance activities as well as the ongoing upkeep of critical analytical equipment. For state partners to assume added responsibility for Global Food Safety initiatives, further enhancement and enrichment will be necessary for the primary servicing labs? analytical capability to meet these goals. In part to achieve these goals the laboratory will rely upon the established relationships with our regulatory agency and their agreement to collect and analyze samples under MFRPS. GDA has already developed and demonstrated successful relationships with their regulatory partners and ability to fulfill this objective. In addition, signed agreements have been forged to collect a minimum of 100 additional MFRPS samples and analyzed for contaminants. These results will be submitted in a national database repository and violative adulterations will be subject to appropriate regulatory action. This cooperative agreement will allow GDA laboratories to maintain the current accreditation to ISO standards, as well as the ability to continue collecting and analyzing samples to support an integrated national food safety system."
"9388806","Under the diagnostic umbrella of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), tremendous variability is observed across affected individuals, likely reflecting distinct etiological mechanisms. Yet, most research to date has treated ASD as a unitary condition, typically comparing individuals with ASD to matched controls. This strategy has not only hindered our progress in unraveling the neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to ASD symptomatology but, importantly, such an approach also undermines the potential of translational research to contribute to `precision medicine' in ASD. In this project, we will take a critical first step toward dissecting the significant heterogeneity observed in ASD by combining state-of-the-art imaging methods, novel approaches to account for genetic susceptibility, and a deep phenotypic characterization of a large sample of youth with ASD. Specifically, we will collect and analyze a rich dataset of brain-based measures (resting-state and task-related fMRI) of unparalleled resolution and quality in order to characterize individual differences in brain network properties and examine how these may relate to a rich phenotypic battery of measures tapping into key domains of interest in our center. Using innovative fMRI activation paradigms as neural assays of social attention, sensory responsivity, and reward function, we will also examine how patterns of brain responses in associated neural circuits co-vary within and between individuals in order to determine how neural over- responsivity to sensory stimuli impacts neural processing of socially relevant stimuli, and assess how distinct neural endophenotypes of social, sensory, and reward responsivity relate to altered connectivity in functional brain networks and behavioral phenotypes. Lastly, building upon our prior imaging-genetics studies, we will examine how polygenic risk, as well as risk variants on selected ASD-associated polymorphisms, influence brain function, network connectivity, and core ASD symptomatology. Our overarching hypothesis is that both distinct and shared neuroendophenotypes will be identified based on different brain function and connectivity metrics and that these will map onto varying dimensions of social and sensory responsivities as manifested at the behavioral and neural level. We further expect that higher polygenic risk will be predictive of increasingly aberrant patterns of brain activity and connectivity as well as overall ASD symptom severity, whereas genetic variance on specific ASD-associated polymorphisms will selectively modulate brain function and network connectivity in brain circuits where these ASD risk genes are expressed. By employing (a) cutting-edge imaging methods to examine brain function and connectivity, (b) innovative paradigms to relate social attention and motivation to sensory processing atypicalities, (c) novel approaches to integrate genetic risk with neural and behavioral phenotypes, and (d) sophisticated data-analytic strategies to sensibly stratify our ASD sample, the proposed studies will foster our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in ASD thereby ultimately contributing to the development of more personalized and efficacious interventions."
"9388747","Summary   The objectives of the Yale School of Medicine?s proposed ACE Dissemination and Outreach Core include  dissemination of research knowledge and information as well as provision of ongoing educational and  awareness activities at local/regional and national/international levels to educators, medical care professionals,  the scientific community, and families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In addition, this Core  will establish and promote bidirectional communication between investigators and individuals affected by ASD  in the community. Critical to the core is the creation of mechanisms to include students, postdoctoral fellows,  and early-stage investigators in the Projects proposed, and to involve junior and senior researchers who are  new to the field of autism as well as investigators from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and  disadvantaged backgrounds.   The Dissemination and Outreach Core will utilize numerous resources to reach target audiences through a  range of activities, events, and continuing educational courses with the goal of providing research-based  information to students, families, and researchers, especially those new to the field of ASD. We shall provide  conferences tailored to three audiences: (1) pediatricians and early educators, (2) the local scientific  community including students and young investigators, and (3) families of individuals with ASD. In addition, this  Core will disseminate professional and lay publications, web-based materials, and ongoing research updates  by ACE investigators for professionals, the scientific community, and the general public, at local, national, and  international levels. Through this Core, we will also foster bidirectional communication between investigators  and individuals affected by ASD in the community. Parent Consultants will play a central role in enhancing the  partnership between investigators and research participants by serving as liaisons to other parents of children  with ASD, discussing concerns, and providing feedback to ACE Investigators. Community Collaborators will  assist us in publicizing our dissemination forums and ACE participation opportunities. Ongoing dialogue with  both sets of Parent and Community partners will lay the foundation for improved recruitment and retention of  participants for the ACE studies and future research, as well as increase uptake of dissemination activities in  the community. This objective builds on our long tradition of interaction between families and investigators that  serves to enhance long-term relationships and the quality of the research participation experience. Also  continuing the CSC?s longstanding practice of fostering new talent, we propose specific mechanisms to include  students, post-doctoral fellows, early-stage investigators, and researchers from outside the field of ASD and  from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and disadvantaged backgrounds. These goals will be addressed  by creating new lectures, symposia, mentorship programs, and Grand Rounds, as well as tapping into Yale  School of Medicine?s established training programs and new Diversity Initiatives."
"9388802","This application seeks to renew our highly productive and interdisciplinary UCLA Autism Center of Excellence (ACE III). Over the last decade, our group has made significant advances in the field, identifying risk genes, candidate brain based biomarkers of treatment response and early risk markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) beginning in the first few weeks of life. We developed new interventions for toddlers with social communication delays, identified an intervention with the most robust effects on repetitive behaviors to date, and we showed how genetic risk influences brain structure and function in ASD. Most unique and impactful is our Center's integration of genetics, early biomarkers and behavioral assays with intervention  In parallel with growing awareness in the field, we recognize the profound clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ASD, which poses a significant challenge to identifying diagnostic biomarkers and to developing effective interventions that target individual profiles. In order to move from a ?one size fits all? to a ?precision medicine? approach, we must better understand the biological and clinical basis of this heterogeneity. Our ACE application takes a multidisciplinary, integrative approach to study the relationship between genetic, neural and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD, to determine whether this heterogeneity reflects unique biological mechanisms underlying autism, and to identify predictors of developmental trajectories and treatment outcome. In four interacting projects, we will focus on three areas of heterogeneity that our work suggests has unique neural, genetic and behavioral signatures: sensorimotor processing social attention/motivation, and social communication/language. Project I aims to determine how differences in genetic risk for autism (familial risk, 22q11deletion, and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) affect early brain development, neuroimaging and EEG biomarkers in the first year of life and identifying predictors of ASD diagnosis at age 3; P. II examines heterogeneity in treatment response using a SMART design, 3-phase adaptive treatment intervention for very young children at risk for ASD; P. III uses MRI in youth with ASD to determine how behavioral phenotypes and genetic risk differentially affect brain activation, structural and functional connectivity. P. IV conducts a proof-of- mechanism pharmacological trial aimed to increase social interest and social reward responsivity with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA in adolescents and young adults enrolled in a social skills intervention.. All projects examine these target phenotypes using at least one biological marker, in addition to standardized and observational tests. This will allow us to integrate biomarkers, genetics and behavior across projects and across ages. A well-established core infrastructure centralizes diagnostics, genetics, imaging, and EEG acquisition, with a common database built for cross project and core collaboration, and outstanding, specialized statistical support. A new Dissemination, Outreach and Education Core centralizes recruitment, and strengthens our community ties and educational program to maximize scientific and community impact."
"9351838","Abstract Development of cartilage, bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments must be highly coordinated, with tissue type differentiation and morphogenesis occuring in a concerted way that allows the resulting tissues to function together. The axial musculoskeleton (vertebral column and ribs) develops from the somites, in which all musculoskeletal tissue types are specified and develop coordinately. However, the morphology of somite derivatives varies with position along the body axis. This variation is controlled by Hox proteins, conserved transcription factors that pattern the body axis of most animal embryos. In vertebrates, Hox proteins both confer anterior-posterior identity on nascent segments and play direct roles in tissue morphogenesis later in development. However, we still know relatively little about their mechanisms of action, including the cell and tissue types in which they act, the cellular behaviors they regulate, and ultimately their transcriptional targets. Hoxa5 non-redundantly patterns musculoskeletal elements at the cervical-thoracic transition. In order to understand how it acts, we used genetic lineage labeling to fate map the descendants of Hoxa5 expressing cells. We found that Hoxa5 descendants contribute to a restricted number tissue types, such as cartilage and perichondrium, but only contribute rarely to tendon and never to muscle. This restriction of Hoxa5 descendant fate may reflect an important aspect of its function. Here, we propose to investigate the mechanism through which Hoxa5 patterns the cervical-thoracic transition musculoskeleton of mice, using a combination of genetic lineage labeling, conditional and loss-of-function analysis, and high throughput sequencing. Our specific aims are designed to: (1) Identify the tissue specificity of Hoxa5 action in patterning the axial skeleton (2) Identify genes and gene networks regulated cell-autonomously by Hoxa5 and (3) Identify direct transcriptional targets of Hoxa5 in the somites. Successful completion of this project will shed light on the mechanisms through which axial patterning is regulated by Hox genes, and can also be applied to a general understanding the mechanisms of Hoxa5 in other tissue types and cancers. More generally, the work is relevant to human health through its application to understanding musculoskeletal tissue patterning and differentiation during normal development and disease. Finally, this work will be conducted with undergraduates at Barnard College, a liberal arts college for women. It will be performed by research students in the PI?s lab, and will be introduced into a newly developed, full year laboratory course at Barnard. Course-based research has been shown to increase participation of students, including those from underrepresented groups, in STEM and to increase the pursuit of postgraduate STEM training. This course will engage undergraduates in substantive original research while providing them with training in current molecular genetics approaches."
"9327290","PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal."
"9388886","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overarching goal of this treatment project is to document the efficacy of very early transactional supports  that parents can learn to change developmental trajectories and optimize outcomes of their child using a 2-stage  sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design to develop an adaptive intervention. All  parent-infant dyads in the Emory ACE will be invited at 6 months of age from the pool of 250 high and low risk siblings  and will be randomly assigned at Stage 1 to the Social Communication Growth Charts (SCGC) that uses an  innovative web-based technology to teach parents early social communication milestones and how to support  their child?s very early development or Usual Care to compare efficacy of the SCGC on parent contingent  responsiveness and child developmental trajectories. Familes of children who show early signs of ASD at 12  months of age based on tailoring variables using parent report and observational measures will be re-randomized  to Stage 2 to compare the efficacy of a parent-implemented (P-I) condition of a naturalistic developmental  behavioral intervention (NDBI) based on the Early Social Interaction model1 to a clinician-implemented (C-I)  condition NDBI based on a hybrid model from 12 to 21 months of age. Outcome measures of social  communication, autism symptoms, social visual engagement, developmental level, and adaptive behavior will  be gathered every 6 months from 6 to 30 months of age to measure treatment effects. Measures of parent  transactional support and child active engagement will be collected quarterly from 9 to 30 months of age to  examine growth trajectories during the Stage 1 and 2 conditions and at follow-up at 21 and 30 months after  intervention. The expected impact of this study will have the following important implications: 1) maximize the  use of technology to teach all parents how to support their infant?s development early to optimize opportunities  for learning and recognize as early as possible if their child is not meeting developmental milestones and may  need intervention; 2) document improved outcomes for very young children with early signs of ASD receiving a  manualized, evidence-based NDBI intervention that is cost-efficient and feasible for community-based  implementation; and 3) substantiate that these adaptive interventions implemented by parents beginning at 6  months of age lead to better child outcomes, providing evidence that very early detection of autism is crucial to  improve developmental outcomes."
"9205193","ABSTRACT  The goal of the Disease Model Development and Phenotyping Project (DMDPP) is to produce and characterize the next generation of animal models for AD that accurately model the pathology of late onset AD (LOAD) and to provide predictive models for therapeutic development. These models will be generated under transparent and open intellectual property conditions. The Jackson Laboratory will conduct 2nd-site validation of LOAD models and will ensure their broad availability and rapid dissemination to all researchers. The foundation of this endeavor is our innovative APP knock-in (APP-KI) mouse that expresses humanized Aß at physiological levels, and which exhibits amyloid plaque deposition (see introduction). We will complete our base platform for development of mouse models of LOAD, by humanizing the mouse Tau (Mapt) locus by replacing coding exons of mouse Tau with those from the human Tau (MAPT) locus. To double homozygous APP-KI and hTau (APP-KI+/+/hTau+/+) mice, we will add the major risk factor for LOAD, APOE4. To expedite analysis of additional factors influencing LOAD, the DMDPP will make extensive use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate animal models that express polymorphisms in risk factors identified from genome wide association studies (GWAS), including TREM2, PICALM, BIN1, CD2AP, ABCA7 and EPHA1. The effect of each GWAS allele in generating a LOAD phenotype will be determined when combined with APP-KI, and hTau. Subsequently we will combine specific GWAS alleles to investigate for synergistic effects on LOAD pathology. The incorporation of multiple GWAS polymorphisms on the APP-KI+/+/hTau+/+ background and production of cohorts of mice for analysis will be accelerated using IVF and embryo transfer instead of standard breeding.  The molecular pathological phenotypes in these LOAD models will be characterized at an unprecedented level of detail through a novel and innovative immunological approach, using conformation dependent and aggregation specific monoclonal antibodies that distinguish eight different types of amyloid deposits in humans and transgenic mice. The molecular phenotype will also be comprehensively determined by quantifying neurons and microglia, synaptic loss, soluble and insoluble tau and Aß and markers of phospho tau. The core will also characterize the gene expression profile of the models by RNAseq and epigenetic markers, as well as structural, functional, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The behavioral phenotype will be characterized by elevated maze, open field, and novel object recognition. The extensive data generated will be used to compare the molecular pathology to that of LOAD and to decide which lines to advance for further development and testing to produce the next generation of animal models."
"9486059","New technologies afford the acquisition of dense ?data clouds? of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB?s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of ?out of range? variables observed in a patient?s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (?personal data clouds?) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ? ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ? UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ? U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ? St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community."
"9529751","This proposal for the Harvard Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training (BIRT) program recognizes that the field of biomedical informatics is an increasingly relevant, if not essential, field for medicine and research in the health sciences. The practice of clinical care and biomedical investigation each constitute complex enterprises that are dependent on the mastery of enormous data streams. There is a crucial need for trained individuals who are able to integrate, interpret, and act upon the large-scale, high-throughput, and complex data that are generated in the course of biomedical research and the practice of medicine. The primary aim of this proposal is to contribute to the cadre of highly trained independent and successful researchers in the field of biomedical informatics. This proposal builds on the strengths of our many years of National Library of Medicine (NLM) fellowship training. The current proposed program will be overseen and administered by the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and will involve collaboration with faculty at HMS and its affiliated hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital. In addition, the program will work closely with other Harvard University Schools in the university-wide data science initiative, and, in particular, with its Data Science Education Working Group, of which the proposed PI is a member. We meet all requirements of the current NLM RFA, which focuses on those informatics areas that directly pertain to health-related application domains. The breadth and depth of our research laboratories, real-world clinical systems, research activities, academic programs, and experienced faculty provide an outstanding environment to mentor and instruct trainees in all four of the NLM-identified focus areas ? healthcare informatics, translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, and public health informatics. We request support for a total of fifteen trainees per year: ten at the postdoctoral level and five at the predoctoral level. In addition, we propose to train four short-term trainees each summer. BIRT trainees work with internationally recognized faculty on high-profile grants and research projects. The program has a formal, required academic component, which includes the Master's degree for all postdoctoral trainees, and the PhD degree for all predoctoral students. Trainees' overall progression throughout the training period is closely monitored. Trainees are regularly evaluated through their course work and through progress on their research projects."
"9355650","A reference human genome sequence and the subsequent decade-long annotation of ~20,000 (20K) protein- coding genes has enabled an explosion of disease-associated genomic variant discovery. We can now anticipate a nearly full description of all disease-related genomic variations in the human population. Genomic sequencing, however, if performed in isolation, will leave fundamental questions about genotype-phenotype relationships unresolved. For the vast majority of genomic variations identified, it remains unclear if and how they perturb the function of the corresponding genes or gene products. To ?connect the dots? of the genomic revolution, functions and context must be assigned for large numbers of genotypic changes. Currently, we know relatively few of the molecular, biochemical, and functional interactions that take place in human cells and that are necessary for biological functions. Past discoveries about interactions such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been highly biased towards pairs of `popular' proteins, representing a tiny fraction of the full space of 200,000,000 pairings of 20Kx20K genes. Systematic, high-quality, genome-wide efforts to create community resources of molecular interactions constitute the best solution to this problem. Just as reference genome sequences provided a fundamental community resource that revolutionized human genetics, reference maps of genome-wide or proteome-wide interaction networks, or ?interactome networks?, will be critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. This application is the fifth competitive renewal of a grant funded by NHGRI since 1998 to address the challenge described above through experimental mapping of binary interactome networks at proteome-scale. After devoting two cycles to the development of interactome mapping strategies in model organisms, this is the third renewal specifically addressing human PPIs. We are now at the exciting stage of presenting a three-year roadmap to deliver ?A human binary interactome reference map by 2018? as a broadly useful resource for the scientific community, with pre-publication release of 12 complementary high-quality genome-wide 20Kx20K PPI datasets along the way. Ultimately, the resulting reference map, which we estimate may well be an order of magnitude larger than the collective efforts of the scientific community to detect PPIs using small-scale experiments, will be an invaluable tool to connect the dots of genomics and will serve as a scaffold to initiate unbiased and exhaustive functional characterizations of large numbers of genomic variations associated with human disease."

"9342880","The goal of this project is to determine how changes in kidney extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness caused by advanced glycation impact progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our overarching hypothesis is that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) form crosslinks that increase ECM stiffness in the kidney and alter integrin signaling to trigger increased extracellular matrix synthesis. The newly synthesized matrix is further crosslinked, thus creating a feed forward cycle of increased stiffness and ECM synthesis. We propose that this mechanism contributes to accumulation of ECM in the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium that is characteristic of diabetic kidney disease. Our preliminary studies show that incubating renal tubules with glucose or ribose significantly increases the stiffness of the tubular basement membrane. The aims of this application are to (1) Determine the mechanism by which sugar exposure alters the stiffness of kidney tubular and glomerular extracellular matrix and (2) Determine the mechanism by which increased stiffness alters integrin signaling and leads to increased ECM production. The methods employed in aim 1 will include measurement of tubular basement membrane stiffness in normal and sugar modified kidney tubules using our newly developed microcantilever-based stiffness measurement technique. Glomerular stiffness will be measured using microscale compression testing. Mechanical characterization of the tissue will be correlated with biochemical analysis via mass spectrometry to evaluate crosslink formation. For aim 2, we will use in vitro cell culture models that mimic the mechanical properties of normal and sugar modified tubular and glomerular ECM. Stiffness induced changes in cell phenotype, cell proliferation and ECM production will be evaluated in wild type and integrin ?1 and ?2-null tubular epithelial and glomerular mesangial cells. Successful completion of these aims will establish the role of AGE- mediated ECM stiffening as a potential contributor to progression of diabetic kidney disease and will inform subsequent studies in diabetic and integrin-null mouse models."
"9403711","Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk."

"9395273","Abstract Sexual minority women (SMW; lesbian, bisexual) are 11 times as likely as heterosexual women to meet criteria for alcohol dependence, and 8 times as likely to report seeking help for alcohol-related problems, indicating a disproportionately high risk of hazardous drinking (HD) and associated health risks. HD is operationalized as an index that includes heavy episodic drinking, intoxication, adverse drinking consequences, and symptoms of alcohol dependence. SMW's high risk for HD has been linked to lifetime exposure to multiple and chronic stressors. Although the association between stress and alcohol use is well-established, little is known about the association between relationships, stress, and alcohol use among same-sex female couples. Intimate relationships confer many benefits, and are protective against stress-related negative health outcomes. Conversely, relationship stress may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors, such as HD. Although more than half of SMW in the United States are married or cohabiting, and estimates suggest that up to 50% of same-sex couples will marry within three years of the Supreme Court decision on marriage equality, there is a paucity of research on SMW's intimate relationships and health, and even less research on these associations among SMW of color. Given that hazardous drinking is among the most prominent sexual-orientation-related health disparities in women, there is a critical need to understand the role of alcohol in SMW's intimate relationships. This National Service Research Award (F32) application integrates training and research designed to develop the applicant's expertise in alcohol research and sexual-orientation-related health disparities, with the overarching aim of supporting the candidate in becoming an independent researcher with the ultimate goal of obtaining a faculty position at a major research university and conducting research on sexual-orientation-related health disparities. To accomplish her career and research goals, the applicant requires training in: (1) SMW's health with a focus on hazardous drinking, (2) racial/ethnic disparities and intersectionality, (3) complex data analysis, and (4) professional development, including competitive grant application and manuscript writing. This training program combines mentorship with coursework, seminars, and conferences to enable the applicant to build a strong and impactful program of research addressing critical interpersonal and contextual factors that contribute to SMW's hazardous drinking. In the proposed research, we will examine relationship characteristics and hazardous drinking by taking into account the larger context in which SMW relationships exist, including racial/ethnic and sexual identity differences in the potential effects of multiple stressors on drinking and drinking-related outcomes. We will use a rich dataset to address the following research aims: (1) Using a large, diverse sample of SMW, we will test two competing models?whether the effects of sexual identity and race/ethnicity are: a) additive or b) multiplicative in the associations between relationship status and hazardous drinking. (2). Cross-sectionally and longitudinally examine associations among relationship status, race/ethnicity, stress, and hazardous drinking."

"9473877","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder ranks among the most significant causes of mortality and disability in the world. Recent data from our group and others highlight that impairments in reward and loss learning are central to depression, have distinct neural substrates, and improve with successful treatment. Together, these findings suggest an urgent need to delineate the relationships among neurobehavioral reward and loss learning impairments and depression. Equally important, these insights suggest novel targets for intervention such that manipulating the neurobehavioral substrates of reward and loss learning may facilitate symptom change in depression. To address these issues, we use functional neuroimaging and a quantitative reinforcement learning framework to i) systematically characterize the neural and behavioral substrates that attend reward- and loss- learning impairments in depression (Aim 1), and ii) assess the degree to which these impairments respond to two methods of training that directly target reward and loss learning from different angles (Aims 2 and 3). In Aims 2 and 3, we capitalize on extant data from our group and others showing that explicit and covert task modifications, respectively, lead to adaptive neural and behavioral learning changes in controls. Here we extend this work to individuals with depression and test the broad hypotheses that i) that depression may be characterized by distinct neurobehavioral impairments in reward- and loss- learning, and ii) these deficits may be normalized through targeted behavioral training. Recent advances in computational model-based analyses of reinforcement learning provide a robust neuromechanistic framework within which to delineate the nature and trajectory of the suggested reward- and loss- learning impairments and their amelioration."
"9350354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia (lazy eye) and strabismus (misaligned eyes) are medical eye conditions that combine as the leading causes of preventable vision loss in children. They are irreversible if not detected and corrected by the age of seven, however half of all cases are missed because the conditions do not always manifest themselves and pediatricians are unable to reliably detect the conditions. The current health care system badly needs an accurate and effective approach toward detecting amblyopia and strabismus in preschool children, and this application aims to show that REBIScan's Pediatric Vision Scanner is capable of detecting disease, including the most difficult for providers to diagnose, with a hig level of accuracy within a primary clinic with lay users as screeners.  The study will be conducted in busy, ethnically and racially diverse primary care sites operated by the Kaiser Permanente system, with outcomes and efficiency of testing compared to the current standard of care.  The research proposed in this SBIR application will complete the last significant milestones necessary for commercialization of the PVS. While the technology has been tested in enriched populations, there are no studies that test device performance when lay users perform testing in a busy pediatric setting, and usability has not been tested in the primary care setting.  The Specific Aims will advance the health outcomes of children by using a scientifically rigorous approach to provide the efficiency and accuracy data that clinicians, investors, and payors require before the PVS can be adopted commercially. A two-phase study has been designed to compare the Pediatric Vision Scanner to the standard of care today. The first phase includes a sample population of older children in whom a limited Gold Standard Examination (visual acuity testing and non-cycloplegic autorefraction) is easily performed by a non-specialist in the primary care clinic. A linkage study will then be performed on a larger group of younger children who will receive the complete Gold Standard Examination.  If the results of this study are similar to published studies performed with enriched populations, then the NIH will have funded a technology that has the potential to change the world and the way it detects amblyopia and strabismus."

"9351187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Newborn screening (NBS) is an essential public health program in all 50 states. The falling cost of whole genome/ exome sequencing provides an opportunity to ask whether whole genome analysis (WGA) might serve as a method of cost-effective newborn screening for any and every condition. We will address certain critical questions raised by the application of this technology to NBS. We will use Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) as a cost-effective method of WGA in 1620 newborn blood spots that are linked to the clinical data of the newborns. We will then test WES as a NBS Tool for metabolic and immunological disorders. These data will be used to 1) compare the sensitivity and specificity of mutation data with biochemical testing, 2) identify gene variants that predict which  children with certain metabolic disorders are at greater risk for metabolic decompensation, 3) identify mutations in genes responsible for those primary immunodeficiencies that are not detected by the current T-Cell receptor excision circle assay used for severe combined immunodeficiency screening, and 4) scan 9 genes for variants that are clinically important for drug metabolism and would be typical secondary findings if WES were to be used as a NBS method. We will also develop a participant protection framework for conducting WGA during the neonatal period, determine the views, perspectives, and value preferences of key stakeholders about using WGA for NBS, collaborate with the UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy, to identify the legal and constitutional issues for using WGA, and for incorporating  PGx into NBS programs, and develop and disseminate policy recommendations for expanded NBS programs based on WGA."
"9334328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our proposed research is the development of vaccines against Brucella infection that are safe and efficacious. Our general approach has focused on the use of live attenuated vaccines (LAV). The use of live attenuated organisms are generally considered to be the vaccine of choice for intracellular bacteria such as Brucella spp. This strategy take advantage of the natural properties of the organism, including cell invasion and tissue tropism while presenting a full complement of immunogens, and is supported by a history of success. However, currently available vaccines are unsafe for use in humans. We have sought to identify improved live, attenuated vaccine candidates that are safe for use in humans. Routine testing of potential Brucella vaccines utilizes the mouse model to evaluate virulence and immune protection. However, mice fail to exhibit the outward signs of Brucella infection. As a result the next step in evaluation of vaccine candidates has been in the target species. For human vaccine development this might suggest the use of nonhuman primates at this stage of evaluation. However, evaluation of vaccines may be performed in a small ruminant model such as sheep or goats to eliminate candidates that produce symptoms associated with disease including abortion, providing an ultimate evaluation of safety. Although placental tissue tropism remains a well-documented phenomenon in ruminants, Brucella has not been considered to be a significant cause of human abortion. However, recent evidence revealed a strong correlation between exposure and elevated rates of abortion in endemic regions. Furthermore, there is strong evidence supporting growth of Brucella melitensis in human trophoblasts. Taken together, these data provide strong support for continued development of our LAV based on the obvious need for improved protection strategies to reduce the potential for human disease. Experiments in goats are expected to provide the support for experimentation to test these candidates in nonhuman primates with the ultimate goal of developing a Brucella vaccine that is safe and efficacious for human use. The efforts outlined have taken advantage of our recently developed platform (encapsulation) to prolong immune system stimulation without prolonging the survival of the vaccine strain. Using this innovative approach we have progressed through multiple levels of investigation to demonstrate efficacy and safety of the LAV providing strong justification to bring development to fruition. The competitive advantages and innovations of approach presented include: (1) evaluation of highly attenuated, safe, gene knockouts in well-established, stable genetic background; (2) safety evaluation under the most stringent conditions possible, (3) support for development of a nonhuman primate model; (4) potential to reduce biocontainment level and support for manufacturing (GMP) and future progress for clinical trials, production and distribution."
"9330694","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are currently more than 400,000 people undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in the United States program. The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients. We have shown that amongst these interventions, IL-1ra and Fish Oil therapies have the most significant beneficial effects on inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and    IL- 6; whereas Vitamin E and ALA therapies do not influence inflammatory state in these patients. This grant application is submitted in response to the recent NIDDK RFA DK-12-010 (Novel Interventions to Reduce Morbidity and Mortality of Hemodialysis Patients - Safety and Other Early Phase Studies) and has the overarching aim of studying the safety, feasibility and efficacy of promising pharmacological and dialytic interventions in maintenance hemodialysis patients through a U01 collaboration mechanism. Our specific aims are 1) To test the efficacy of IL-1ra and Fish Oil on inflammatory biomarkers over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; 2) To test the safety and tolerability of IL-1ra and Fish Oil over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; 3) Create a collaborative network of investigators and dialysis facilities for efficient and swift subject recruitment for pilot and feasibility studies in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The ultimate goal of this application is to obtain critical elements of the study design and suitable interventin for a subsequent full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial in MHD patients testing rigorous clinical outcomes including morbidity and mortality."
"9396404","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The RNA exosome is an evolutionary-conserved 3'-5' riboexonuclease complex critically important for both precise processing and complete degradation of a variety of cellular RNAs. One of the most critical cellular functions of the exosome is the production of mature, properly trimmed rRNAs required within the ribosome. How the exosome plays a dual role in mediating both precise processing of some RNA targets and complete destruction of others including potentially damaging aberrant transcripts is not understood; however, one model is that a variety of associated co-factors dictate target specificity. Given, the crucial role of the RNA exosome in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA, it is not surprising that the complex is essential in the systems examined thus far including budding yeast. For this reason, the recent discovery that mutations in multiple genes that encode RNA exosome subunits, EXOSC2, EXOSC3, and EXOSC8, are linked to human disease was unexpected. Mutations in EXOSC3 cause Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia type 1b (PCH1b), which is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, while mutations in EXOSC2 cause a variety of distinct tissue-specific phenotypes including mild intellectual disability. The disease-causing mutations identified thus far are not null mutations but rather amino acid changes in evolutionarily-conserved residues. The tissue- specific defects these changes cause are challenging to understand based on current models of RNA exosome function with only limited analysis of the complex in any multicellular model in vivo. To address these gaps in knowledge and provide insight into how mutations in EXOSC2 and EXOSC3 cause disease, we will develop a Drosophila model of RNA exosome-linked disease. EXOSC2 and EXOSC3 are evolutionarily conserved subunits, termed Rrp4 and Rrp40, respectively, in Drosophila. Using this model, we will exploit the Drosophila system to examine the role of the RNA exosome in vivo. The long-term goal of this project is to provide insight into how defects in subunits of a ubiquitous and critical RNA processing complex cause tissue- specific consequences. We will test the hypothesis that RNA exosome cap subunits mediate critical yet distinct activities of the RNA exosome in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in vivo. This hypothesis will be tested though three complementary aims: 1) Assess tissue-specific requirements for the Drosophila RNA exosome cap subunits Rrp4 (EXOSC2) and Rrp40 (EXOSC3); 2) Examine the functional consequences of amino acid substitutions in Rrp4 and Rrp40 that equate to disease-causing changes in EXOSC2 and EXOSC3, respectively; 3) Explore the potential mechanism by which amino acid changes in RNA exosome subunits cause distinct phenotypic consequences. Successful completion of these aims will further our knowledge of RNA exosome-linked disease and also provide invaluable insights into distinct tissue- specific consequences due to altered subunits within a single complex."
"9492159","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Task-specific primary focal dystonias (tsPFDs) are characterized by selective activation of dystonic movements during performance of highly learned motor tasks, such as writing, playing a musical instrument, speaking, or singing. Despite the recent advances in describing the clinical features of dystonia, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the neural abnormalities underlying the development of tsPFDs, which affect the same muscles but result in different clinical manifestations as in writer's cramp vs. pianist's dystonia or spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer's dystonia. Continued existence of this gap is an important problem because it renders us unable to differentiate between primary and secondary brain changes contributing to the tsPFD pathophysiology and to develop novel treatment options targeting disorder-specific brain alterations. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of primary focal dystonia for its improved clinical management. The objective of this application is to identify the brain mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of task specificity in two representative groups of patients with writer's cramp vs. musician's hand dystonia and spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer's laryngeal dystonia using a novel approach of combined clinico-behavioral examination, brain network analysis and quantitative neuropathology of postmortem brain tissue. Our central hypothesis is that each tsPFD is characterized by distinct brain abnormalities, which selectively affect the focal segments of brain networks responsible for the performance of the respective motor task. The rationale for the proposed research is that identification of tsPFD-specific brain changes and associated neuropathology will clarify the neural mechanisms (primary vs. secondary) contributing to the clinical manifestation of these disorders and thus explain the phenomenon of task-specificity in PFDs. The obtained results are expected to provide strong scientific bases for the next series of studies directed towards identification and validation of novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. We will pursue the following two specific aims: (1) determine distinct features of brain functional network abnormalities underlying task-specificity in differen tsPFDs, and (2) establish structural correlates of functional neuroimaging abnormalities in tsPFDs. This research is innovative because it will be among the first detailed investigations designed specifically to focus on defining tsPFD neu- ral markers. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to establish scientific evidence that tsPFD is a network disorder with abnormalities following distinct patterns in different tsPFDs and certain ab- normalities showing structure-function correlations are associated with underlying neuropathology. By converging the results from multimodal cross-disciplinary studies to a coherent and pathophysiologically meaningful picture, we will be well positioned to identify primary vs. secondary changes in tsPFDs and establish a scientific framework for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and novel treatment options for these disorders."
"9388740","The Yale Center represents a multidisciplinary research program consisting of five inter-related research projects and four cores dedicated to advancing understanding of early neurobiology of ASD. The proposal brings together a team of experts from the fields of developmental psychopathology and neurobiology, genetics, neurology, radiology, neuroscience, and statistics to identify the molecular, cellular, and neural mechanisms related to ASD from prenatal stages to childhood. We focus our investigation on two cohorts of younger siblings of children with ASD who, due to familial factors, are at high risk (HR) for developing the disorder: a prospective cohort recruited pre- and perinatally and followed through 24 months, and a cohort of HR siblings who was well-characterized at 24 months through our past studies and will reach the age of 12 years during the life of the Yale ACE. These cohorts enable our search for neural signatures of ASD during fetal, neonatal, and school-age periods, as well as to examine the connectome across the spectrum of risk for ASD both in males and females. Although neural and behavioral markers of ASD have been reported in 6- month-old infants later diagnosed with ASD, to our best knowledge, this is the first investigation into both fetal and neonatal functional connectivity in ASD. Emerging data suggest that male, but not female, ASD subjects demonstrate significant alterations in neural networks, and ? for the first time ? the proposed studies will identify not only the changes in connectivity in ASD but also the impact of fetal/neonatal sex upon these changes. Since recent studies demonstrate neuroplasticity in the developing brain across the late second and third trimesters of gestation, it is essential to understand if the factors associated with ASD are developing in this same time frame and to understand any sex differences that may be apparent even at that early age. The iPSC derived organoid system models human fetal development, allowing us to investigate neurobiological risk and protective factors that play a unique role in this period and may enable the discovery of patient-specific neuronal or stem cell biomarkers that could be used as predictors of risk or resilience in ASD. The Yale ACE aims rely on application of cutting-edge approaches to the analysis the connectome, fetal and neonatal imaging modeling neural development using the iPSC methodology with high resolution dual photon imaging approaches, the development of early markers for ASD, studying early attention and learning, novel predictive models relating brain organization to behavior, and statistical approaches for integrating the spectrum of data types across to address these aims. Results from the combined projects have a great potential to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers at the time of birth, identify neural, cellular, and molecular bases of risk and protective mechanisms in ASD, and clarify neural bases of sex differences in ASD."
"9349397","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large-scale efforts to characterize tumor genomes have uncovered a highly heterogeneous landscape of molecular alterations that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. A small number of these alterations are causal 'driver' events that confer neoplastic properties to tumors, such as inappropriate growth and proliferation; however, the majority of these alterations are thought to be 'passenger' events that accumulate in tumor cells by chance over the course of tumor progression. Discriminating drivers from passengers is a pressing need in cancer research and will be critical for understanding the molecular origins of tumors, identifying novel targets for drug development, uncovering mechanisms of resistance to therapeutics, and ultimately selecting the most effective therapies for patients. Current efforts t discriminate drivers from passengers rely on statistical over-representation of events in a population of tumors or their predicted effects on protein activity. However, it is now well appreciated that cancer is not a disease of single mutations, nor of genes, but of groups of genes working together in molecular networks and pathways. Cellular behaviors result from complex networks of interactions among biological molecules within the cell, such that driver mutations confer neoplastic behaviors to tumor cells by altering network structure and function. In this grant I propose to model molecular alterations detected in tumors as network perturbations and use these models to discriminate drivers from passengers. These network models will allow us to study cancer in new ways: they will be used to 1) study the biological network effects of known driver mutations versus other human genetic variation, 2) develop hypotheses about the mechanisms by which driver mutations confer neoplastic behaviors to tumor cells, 3) compare patterns of altered network structure across tumor populations, 4) evaluate the combined effect of mutations collocated within a biological network, and 5) predict the set of driver mutations and perturbed pathways in selected individual tumor genomes. I will extend the models to include molecular events overlapping functional non-protein coding elements now known to cover 80% of the human genome, and quantify how acquired alterations observed in a tumor interact with inherited variants in the patient's genome. Finally,  will work with established collaborators to experimentally validate novel computational findings uncovered by network perturbation modeling. This project will provide a more global view of the driver landscape in tumors and supply the cancer research community with a suite of computational tools for modeling the consequences of molecular aberrations and targeted interventions in cancer."
"9429381","PROJECT SUMMARY Social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa, and chronic depression are all debilitating, chronic, and often treatment-resistant mental disorders that are characterized by high rates of comorbidity. These disorders also share an underlying transdiagnostic cognitive and emotional processing style, namely, heightened performance monitoring and overcontrol (Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Cognitive Systems: Cognitive Control: Performance Monitoring). Little is known of how this underlying characteristic of heightened performance monitoring and overcontrol (HPM/OC) develops in early childhood prior to disorder onset. Moreover, it is largely unknown how this transdiagnostic construct contributes to increasing symptoms of psychopathology and social impairment in young children. This knowledge may provide meaningful targets for preventive intervention of multiple disorders. Consistent with the NIMH Strategic plan, particularly Strategy Objective 2, to ?chart mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene,? this K23 application aims to identify neural markers and caregiving processes associated with developmental risk trajectories of HPM/OC in young children. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts in neurophysiological methods, developmental and caregiving processes in early childhood, longitudinal and statistical methodology, and treatment of overcontrol, this proposal will examine the developmental psychopathology of this NIMH RDoC construct in children age 5-6 during the transition to school. Specifically, this proposal will use event-related potentials (ERPs) to identify neural markers of HPM/OC and parent-child observational interactions to assess caregiving styles and dyadic features. Children will be assessed two years later to investigate how neural markers and caregiving styles predict symptoms of social anxiety, OCD and social impairment. Findings will inform the developmental course of this RDoC construct in relation to trajectories of mental illness. The long-term goal is to understand the biological and behavioral development of HPM/OC from early ages through adolescence so as to inform interventions directly targeting HPM/OC prior to disorder onset. Mentored training will allow the applicant to gain expertise in ERP methods and analysis, developmental psychopathology and caregiving processes in young children, longitudinal design and analysis, and training in clinical translation to begin mechanistically identifying and targeting youth with HPM/OC for early intervention."

"9352377","Data Analysis & Signature Generation Component  Our goal is to generate cellular signatures of human neurons in response to perturbagens. Our studies will focus on human neurons, generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (i-neurons) obtained from both healthy people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The cellular signature will be a composite picture of the molecular properties of a neuron that distinguish the state and determine the behavior of the cell. We will generate three classes of cellular signatures. The first will be static signatures based on quantitative molecular phenotyping involving OMIC analysis of the i-neurons. Analysis of the static signatures will highlight critical signaling pathways that distinguish a cellular response to a perturbagen. The second type of signature will be dynamic signatures generated with a novel high throughput, single cell longitudinal analysis system. Robotic Microscopy (RM). RM will be able to pinpoint critical times in the life of i-neurons as their physiology change in response to perturbagens. Analysis of dynamic signatures will guide selection of time points that will be investigated more in depth with methods that generate static signatures. In turn, elements of these static signatures will be perturbed genetically and analyzed by RM to elucidate the epistatic relationship of the components of a signature and to develop explicit multivariate predictive descriptions of cellular responses to perturbations. The third type of signature will emerge from an integration of the individual signatures using clustering methods and machine learning algorithms. The technology to analyze the data of the cellular signatures will be compatible with those produced at other sites in the LINCS network. A major innovation of our program is the implementation of novel data analysis platforms that will produce signatures that will have greater predictive value of a cell's biology than standard technologies. We will integrate Data Analysis and Data Generation, creating feedback loops to allow the cellular signatures that we generate to influence subsequent data generation. In turn, the use of machine learning algorithms in collaboration with Google will allow us to iteratively refine our signatures to make them more predictive in identifying cause and effect relationships from the cellular signatures."
"9360239","Project Summary (Bourne Project) Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) modules are conserved interacting proteins that affect the survival of bacterial cells either by promoting the type of growth found in chronic infections, or by inducing bacterial cell death. Difficult to treat and chronic infections are increasingly prevalent, and the Centers for Disease Control estimate at least 2 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the United States each year at a cost of up to $20-billion in added healthcare expenses. TA modules enhance E. coli survival during antibiotic treatments, called antibiotic tolerance, which could reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments. The current proposal focuses on TA modules in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen of serious concern due to the prevalence of chronic and antibiotic resistant infections.  Despite high variability between clinical isolates, this bacteria contains two highly conserved TA modules, 1) a RelBE/ParDE gyrase-inhibiting family module, and 2) a HigBA ribosome-inhibiting module recently shown to affect virulence production in this organism. One-third of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates contain an additional conserved ParDE system. TA modules are typically expressed as an interacting pair, thus rendering them inactive. Extracellular signals can trigger degradation of the antitoxin, releasing the toxin within the cytosol to interact with cell machinery and leading to alteration of the rate of cell replication or translation. Currently, there are fundamental gaps in our knowledge of TA module functions that prevent translation into clinical settings, including the regulation of their activation and the effect of sustained interaction of toxins with their targets. The current proposal will make significant vertical advances in the field of bacterial TA biology by directly addressing these gaps.  The overall objective of the current proposal is to determine the interaction of toxins found in P. aeruginosa with their cellular targets, particularly those inhibiting DNA gyrase, and to determine the molecular interactions of the antitoxins that result in activation of these type II TA modules. The central hypothesis is that the same toxin molecule can instigate both cellular dormancy and cell death as depending on its individual potency and the length of interaction with the cellular target, and that degradation of the antitoxin is mediated by different cellular proteases depending on the specific environmental trigger. Aim 1 will pursue the structure of the toxins interacting with DNA gyrase and will measure their potency using in vitro assays. Aim 2 will determine the cellular proteins that interact with the antitoxins to mediate its degradation using a genetic interaction screening platform. Aim 3 will establish the mRNA and protein levels of the three TA modules under different environmental conditions. Successful completion of these aims will determine critical steps in TA biology. In addition, mapping the cellular proteases that control the specific responses will be key in understanding the role of TA modules in bacterial physiology. These studies will directly impact the field by defining fundamental regulatory mechanisms in P. aeruginosa that contribute to antibiotic tolerance and chronic infections, thereby revealing new or synergistic antibacterial targets."

"9342910","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. Inflammation and fibrosis are the key factors heralding the progression from steatosis (fat accumulation in the liver) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet there has been a gap in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition. Numerous studies have shown that patients with NASH have increased circulating levels and hepatic expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), however it is unknown whether this association is causative or simply correlative. I intend to demonstrate that PAI-1, a factor primarily known for its role in thrombosis, also plays a major role in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Work in our lab and others has shown that PAI-1 transcription is strongly regulated by the molecular clock. Furthermore, disruption of circadian rhythms promotes the development of metabolic diseases including NAFLD. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to determine a novel mechanism by which circadian gene disruption and upregulation of hepatic PAI-1 promote hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. In specific aim 1, we will determine the role of PAI-1 in the development of murine steatohepatitis. First we will determine the effects of hepatocyte-derived PAI-1 on murine steatohepatitis by generating a novel murine model of hepatocyte-specific PAI-1 deletion. Next, we will determine the role of bone-marrow derived PAI-1 on murine steatohepatitis using bone-marrow chimeric mice. Lastly we will determine the effects of a novel pharmacologic inhibitor of PAI-1 on the development of murine steatohepatitis. The results of the experiments outlined in Aim 1 will (i) implicate PAI-1 as a key mediator of murine steatohepatitis, (ii) determine the cell-type from which the effects of PAI-1 are derived, and (iii) identify PAI-1 antagonists as a potential novel pharmacotherapy for NASH. In specific aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that disruption of the circadian clock promotes hepatic steatosis via activation of hepatic PAI-1. First we will test the effect of altere feeding cycles (a method of inducing circadian dyssynchrony) on hepatic lipid accumulation in PAI-1-deficient mice. Next, we will test the effects of genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of PAI-1 on the steatotic phenotype observed in mice bearing a mutation in a key clock gene. The results of the experiments outlined in Aim 2 will identify PAI-1 as the critical link between disruption in circadian rhythms and hepatic lipid deposition. These studies represent the progression in my long- standing research on the molecular pathogenesis of steatohepatitis and provide the platform for my development as an independent physician-scientist."

"9351194","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Global estimates suggest that 3.2 million deaths and 3.1% of disability-adjusted life-years are attributable to outdoor air pollution annually. This places exposure to outdoor air pollution among the most important modifiable risk factors for global disease burden. There is, however, substantial uncertainty in this estimate and there remains a critical need to characterize the impacts of air pollution on cardiopulmonary health in populations that reside in both developed and developing countries. This uncertainty stems in part from the limited information available for the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on specific cardiopulmonary health impacts (e.g. stroke and reduced lung function); the inadequate characterization of vulnerable populations; and the fact that little to no direct epidemiological evidence is available for the upper portion of exposure-response relationships. Almost all epidemiological studies of cardiopulmonary health effects associated with PM2.5 have been conducted in developed countries, where PM2.5 concentrations are relatively low compared to developing countries. The objective of this research application is to address these significant uncertainties by conducting the first global epidemiological study of PM2.5 air pollution and cardiopulmonary disease by leveraging the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological Study (PURE). This cohort recruited 155,000 individuals residing in 628 communities in 17 countries and 5 continents, with current follow-up completed for four years and continuing for another six years. This research application will add an air pollution component (PURE-AIR) that will use novel satellite-based air pollution estimates, geographic information science (GIS) and ambient air pollution monitoring to characterize community-level PM2.5 concentrations in the 628 PURE communities. Epidemiological analyses (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) will examine important cardiopulmonary outcomes (e.g. myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and adult onset asthma) as well as lung function change (using repeat individual measures for 50,000 participants that are facilitated by this application). All analyses will control for a comprehensie set of confounding factors (e.g. smoking, occupational exposures, indoor air pollution from biomass use, diet, etc.). PURE-AIR would be a seminal global study that greatly enhances our understanding of the cardiopulmonary health impacts from outdoor air pollution. This information will inform human health risk assessment and reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States and other countries"
"9334860","PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal is motivated by the following observations: 1) Fluid intake is a safe and effective method to reduce urinary stone recurrence, but adherence is low; 2) Ureteral stents cause pain for many patients despite pharmacologic treatments; 3) Behavior- the way that we respond to a situation or stimulus- is a critical determinant of treatment adherence and the perception of pain; and 4) Behavioral economics and complementary theories of behavioral coping provide conceptual frameworks to decrease stone recurrence and stent pain among children and adults with urinary stone disease (USD).  Barriers to increasing fluid intake among patients with USD include limited knowledge about sufficient fluid volume, difficulty maintaining long-term engagement in meeting fluid goals, and inability to solve logistical problems such as ready access to fluids at work or school. Therefore, a customized program of structured problem solving (SPS), a systematic approach to identify the root cause of a problem and develop a feasible solution, is needed. However, SPS alone may be insufficient. People are often motivated more by tangible, short-term rewards - such as financial incentives - than by the possibility of health benefits realized only later in time. This observation is relevant for USD, because the short-term benefits of fluid intake may not be apparent since USD episodes commonly take place after months or years without symptoms. Financial incentives can overcome present bias and are a novel approach to increasing fluid intake to prevent stone recurrence.  Most patients with ureteral stents experience pain of varying intensity. This pain is often refractory to medications, suggesting that factors other than biologic responses account for a large portion of symptoms. Preoperative anxiety is associated with increased postoperative pain. Patients who catastrophize have reduced ability to modulate pain due to excessive attention to pain (rumination), exaggerating the threat value of pain (magnification), and feeling unable to cope (helplessness). Behavioral coping theory can be applied to predict which patients will have intensified pain responses during procedures or following surgery. Accurately predicting which patients are will have increased pain from ureteral stents could help identify those who would benefit most from preemptive targeted cognitive and behavioral interventions to decrease pain.  As part of the Urinary Stone Disease Research Network, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial among adults and adolescents with USD to determine the efficacy of SPS, versus SPS combined with financial incentives for meeting fluid intake goals, versus control to decrease symptomatic stone recurrence. Second, we will conduct a prospective cohort study among adolescents and adults with USD who undergo ureteral stent placement and identify psychological characteristics that predict increased pain due to ureteral stents. Finally, we will establish a repository of urine and blood from these patients to support future USD research. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to reduce the morbidity of USD."

The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation. The NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, about 15 of which are visited each year. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. Findings from this survey are used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases. Information is used to assess nutritional status and its association with health promotion and disease prevention.

"9311812","ABSTRACT Ikaros deficient large pre-B cells show attenuation of pre-BCR signaling and differentiation and an increase in stroma adhesion, and self-renewal. Ikaros plays a fundamentally unique role in the regulation of both active and cryptic Super-Enhancer networks (SE) in pre-B cells. Active SE supporting pre-B cell differentiation are defined by Ikaros and other B cell master regulators. However, they are uniquely dependent on Ikaros for their highly permissive chromatin environment and transcription activity. Ikaros, without any B cell transcription factors, is highly enriched at inactive enhancers of genes normally expressed in epithelial-stem cells. Upon Ikaros loss, expression of pre-B cell differentiation genes is attenuated, while a group of extra-lineage transcription factors, directly repressed by Ikaros, is induced. These collaborate with native B cell transcription regulators to induce a hybrid SE network that supports epithelial cell functions. This model of a dual mechanism of IKAROS regulation in promoting normal B cell differentiation while safeguarding against an epithelial-B cell phenotype and how deregulation contributes to B-ALL is investigated by three specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Regulation of pre-B cell super-enhancers and chromosomal domains. The role of Ikaros in the recruitment of chromatin modifiers and the mediator complex, key steps in SE activation, will be tested. We will also investigate whether Ikaros promotes the segregation of developmentally-affiliated genes into topological associated domains (TAD) domains. Specific Aim 2. Regulation of a cryptic transcriptional network in pre-B cells. Ikaros is engaged in the active repression of a regulatory network of transcription factors in WT pre-B cells that are normally prevalent in epithelial tissues. The contribution of these extra-lineage transcription factors to an epithelial-pre-B cell phenotype will be examined in the absence and presence of Ikaros. We will also investigate whether Ikaros provides an additional layer of protection by directly interfering with their activities at their enhancer target sites. Specific Aim 3. How a pre-leukemic transcriptional landscape is utilized for leukemia progression. Activating mutations in tyrosine kinases affiliated with growth factor receptor signaling support transformation of Ikaros mutant pre-B cells to a highly aggressive leukemic state. A key question addressed here is whether and how the leukemia-inducing signaling pathways utilize the epigenetic and transcription environment established by loss of Ikaros. Further studies on the potential conservation of these mechanisms in human B- ALL will be tested.  "
"9346654","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted cilia function in humans results in profound brain abnormalities and cognitive impairments. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the brain malformation in this class of disease, called ciliopathies. Recessive mutations in ARL13B or INPP5E cause Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD), a human ciliopathy defined by a specific hindbrain abnormality, the molar tooth sign. Here, we propose to use mouse models of JSRD causing genes (Arl13b, Inpp5e) and their JSRD-causing human mutations to systematically delineate the mechanistic underpinnings of the brain malformations in JSRD. Towards this goal, we will functionally characterize the cilia-dependent and/or cilia-independent signaling mechanisms triggered by ARL13B or INPP5E gene mutations that lead to hindbrain abnormalities. The outcomes of this work will define the role of primary cilia signaling during neuronal development and connectivity. Importantly, delineation of molecular cascades and neurodevelopmental pathways, whose disruptions are integrally related to the development of brain malformations in ciliopathies will enable us to devise optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these brain disorders."
"9366727","PROJECT SUMMARY There are significant barriers to implementing empirically-supported treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention (CB/RP), in community-based substance abuse treatment settings. Our team has devel- oped and begun to evaluate a user-friendly multimedia group counseling curriculum (RoadMAP Toolkit®) as a low-cost strategy to introduce addictions counselors to the use of CB/RP. In a one-arm pilot trial, we found that a brief training on the RoadMAP Toolkit® was sufficient to achieve very large improvements in counselor CB/RP adherence which were durable over 6 months with no additional training or supervision. In addition to these improvements, Toolkit (TK) counselors and their clients reported significantly improved satisfaction with their TK sessions. Furthermore, in our recently completed randomized controlled trial, we found preliminary support for a similarly designed 12-step facilitation Toolkit to decrease alcohol use. The purpose of this appli- cation is to evaluate the RoadMAP Toolkit?s clinical effectiveness with clients diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to assess the amount of exposure to CB/RP content (i.e., homework completion) as a function of treatment condition. Design: Fifty group counselors from 4 drug-free intensive outpatient treatment programs will participate in a randomized controlled trial. They will be randomly assigned within sites to one of two training conditions. Counselors assigned to the CB/RP Toolkit condition (TK) will receive a brief training in the use of the Toolkit and 2 key RP activities and will then conduct a complete series of 6 Toolkit groups with enrolled clients (ntotal=100). Counselors assigned to the Attention Control condition (AC) will receive training of the same length and intensity on group counseling management practices. Similar to the TK condition, counse- lors will conduct a complete series of counseling groups with enrolled clients (ntotal=100). All counselors will re- ceive three 30-minute coaching sessions (tailored to condition) during the intervention. Client participants with an AUD, alcohol use in the past 30 days, and < 4 weeks of attendance at the program will be enrolled. They will be assessed prior to beginning the intervention, weekly during the intervention, at the end of the interven- tion (8-weeks), and again at 16- and 24-week follow-ups. To address our primary hypothesis, we will compare urinalysis-verified self-reported alcohol use of clients in the TK and AC conditions at the end of the intervention (8-weeks) and at 16- and 24-week follow-ups. For our secondary hypothesis, we will compare differences in the amount of homework completed during the intervention by TK versus AC clients. Exploratory hypotheses will compare TK and AC clients on treatment attendance, coping skills, and abstinence confidence at the 8-, 16-, and 24-week timepoints. If successful, this project will provide support for a cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable strategy to equip community-based addictions counselors to deliver CB/RP using a group counsel- ing curriculum which will positively impact client alcohol use and other relevant outcomes."
"9551817","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nitric oxide (NO), produced by NO synthases (NOS), is an essential signaling molecule with fundamental roles in cardiovascular function, neurotransmission and immune response. Despite significant effort, there are no intact structures of the mammalian NOS holoenzyme and the rearrangements that drive NO synthesis are unknown. Because of this, central questions that are fundamental to the mechanism of NOS remain unanswered, including how large reductase and oxygenase domains converge to transfer electrons and how the Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) protein interacts to coordinate catalysis. The significant size and flexibility of NOS is a tremendous challenge to structural studies and this has been a roadblock to answering these questions. As a single-particle approach, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful and unexplored method for characterizing this essential enzyme. With the applicant's significant background in cryo-EM, established collaborations with experts in the NOS field, and recently published work elucidating the structure of the neuronal NOS complex, the objective here is: to determine structural and functional mechanisms of the three mammalian NOS isoforms: neuronal (n), endothelial (e) and inducible (i). The central hypothesis is: NO synthesis by NOS requires large domain rearrangements that coordinate with CaM-driven changes in a key FMN subdomain during the electron transfer cycle, and further that the three isoforms have unique structures and conformational states that explain regulatory mechanisms. This hypothesis is strongly supported by our recent work where we determined the first 3D molecular model of the NOS:CaM complex. The Specific Aims for this proposal are to (1) determine the architecture and CaM-dependent structural changes of nNOS by cryo-EM; (2) investigate isoform-specific conformational states of eNOS and iNOS; and (3) characterize structural control elements that define NOS functional states. We have utilized newly developed 2D/3D EM methods and determined a 3D model that identifies a CaM-triggered rotation of the FMN subdomain, which is critical for transferring electrons to the heme. We have determined a preliminary 3D model of iNOS that reveals a CaM-bound conformational state where the reductase and oxygenase domains are aligned in a cross- monomer state. Finally we have developed 2D EM assays to identify the structural basis of key interactions, cis regulatory elements and phosphorylation states that uniquely control the NO synthesis mechanism. The approach is innovative because it integrates the latest methods in cryo-EM imaging and computational analysis with key biochemical techniques to determine the first comprehensive characterization of the NOS holoenzyme complex. The proposed research is significant because it will answer long-standing questions about the mammalian NOS isoforms by determining key structural rearrangements that drive enzyme function. These objectives are a critical foundation to the applicant's long-term goals to understand the structural/functional basis of dynamic macromolecular protein interactions that are critical to cellular signaling and homeostasis."
"9525197","Summary Our project brings together the large NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) health system with its affiliated Medical Centers ? Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), as well as the CUMC partner, Harlem Hospital (HH), a community-based public health facility, to achieve the aims of the national Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). We will leverage our pre-existing Hospital Network Infrastructure to enroll at least 150,000 patients over 5 years from our ethnically diverse New York City population into a cohort named the NYC Precision Medicine Initiative cohort (NYC-PMI). We will collect and pre-process appropriate biospecimens from all participants including blood sample, saliva sample, and a urine sample. We will extract all electronic health record data for our participants, and provide standardized physical exam, survey data and all other phenotypic data as required for the national cohort to ensure harmonization with PMI data standards. Our HPO will also perform real-time epidemiological modeling of the characteristics of the participants enrolled and adjust enrollment to meet the goals of the National Cohort. Finally, we will actively engage community members, leaders, and organizations throughout New York City to ensure that the aims of the National PMI are appreciated by the broader community and that participants understand the initiative, its benefits and the importance of remaining engaged through their lifespan. We will bring into the national study a demographically diverse cohort that will feature a broad range of rare and common clinical disorders for which we provide expert care at our HPO. Thus, we will not only enroll the requisite number of participants and contribute diversity to the national cohort, but we will provide the clinical and research expertise necessary to make effective use of genomic data. We have long-standing experience with community engagement in research, and have long-standing experience collaboratively in cooperative NIH grant activities to ensure that the overall scientific aims of the PMI are achieved."
"9349378","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated genes) system is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that defends microbes from foreign invaders such as viruses. This immune system incorporates DNA from invading elements into the CRISPR locus, essentially generating an immunization record of past viral infection. The subsequent transcription and processing of the CRISPR locus generates small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are incorporated into a protein complex that mediates the destruction of nucleic acids based on sequence complementarity. Imperfect complementarity between the crRNA and its nucleic acid target can abrogate cleavage, but still recruit the protein complex in vivo. This recruitment can result in alternative functions such as gene regulation, but the prevalence of these non-canonical CRISPR-Cas functions has not been investigated in detail. In fact, many pathogens and important human microbiome constituents possess CRISPR-Cas systems with no known role and CRISPR arrays with no predicted targets, raising a question as to what their biological functions are. The objective of this project is to identify endogenous bacterial proteins that may modulate CRISPR-Cas activity and discover and characterize novel CRISPR-Cas functions. This research is an extension of my graduate work, where I identified the first examples of CRISPR-Cas interacting proteins, which are a diverse group of inhibitors that directly interact with different CRISPR-Cas components. This suggests that more endogenous interactors remain to be identified. Together, the potential for nucleic acid binding in the absence of cleavage and the existence of CRISPR-Cas interacting proteins, suggests that there may be entire classes of bacterial proteins that can modulate or redirect CRISPR-Cas function. To broaden our understanding of the roles for CRISPR- Cas, I will utilize proteomic techniques to identify endogenous CRISPR-Cas interactors and characterize their physiological relevance. I will also conduct bio-informatic analyses to identify CRISPR-Cas systems that appear functional in pathogenic organisms and screen them for activity. Given the sequence diversity of the crRNAs generated by a single CRISPR-Cas system, both canonical (i.e. foreign genome cleavage) and non-canonical (i.e. gene regulation) functions could be mediated concurrently and functional assays will be developed to test these possibilities. The recent engineering of CRISPR-Cas systems to provide genome editing and regulatory tools in eukaryotic cells (where these systems do not naturally exist) perfectly exemplify the possibilities that are intrinsic to an RNA-guided system. The possibility that bacteria naturally possess similar functions (i.e. CRISPR-Cas-mediated recruitment of a transcription factor) has not been investigated. Assessing the roles of these systems in many different organisms will enhance our understanding of not only CRISPR-Cas systems, but also of how bacterial pathogens defend their genomes and regulate vital cell processes."

"9551211","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The regulation of eukaryotic genes involves many hundreds of proteins. How they work together at the many thousands of genes that comprise a genome is not known. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how all genes are regulated, we need to know the precise spatial organization, structure, and occupancy levels of all involved proteins. We have developed a genome-wide assay, called ChIP-exo, to measure these aspects of genome regulation, and now propose to develop a higher-throughput version of the assay, and apply it to the mapping of hundreds of genome-binding proteins (aim 1). From this we expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structural organization of chromatin and its regulation.  The structural information about genomic binding events is woven into the complex patterning of exonuclease stop sites that probe specific DNA contact points. These patterns and their relationships with patterns generated by other proteins often require substantial bioinformatic analyses, which is often out of reach of typical wet-bench scientists. The root of the problem lies at steep learning curve for command-line operations, scripting and proper script application, and keeping data analyses organized. This creates an inherently slow trial-and-error process in biological discovery. Therefore, to alleviate the bottleneck in distillig ChIP-exo data into biological discovery which is so essential to aim 1, we will develop a dedicated and specialized bioinformatic pipeline designed to conduct rapid, easy, and efficient ChIP-exo analyses. Relationships among binding events will provide new insights into transcription complex assembly and regulation.  The goal of aim 1 will be to collect ChIP-exo data on 200 yeast potential genome-binding proteins, and their interacting partners or complexes, under multiple cellular states (growth conditions, cell cycle). Tangible outcomes include a precise near-bp map of genomic locations and sub-complex organization, with minimal false positives and negatives. We envision achieving a snapshot of the detailed spatial organization genome- binding proteins at promoters.  The goal of aim 2 will be to create a user-friendly, quickly-navigable, platform to execute scripts on ChIP-exo and related data, using our established pipeline. Public use utility of the ChIP-exo datasets will be enhanced with a dedicated platform."
"9376489","Project Summary Maternal effects comprise non-genetic influences on offspring phenotype resulting from the environmental experience of the mother. Prenatal stress is an important source of maternal effects, which can have profound effects on the resulting phenotype of the offspring, and, in humans, can lead to impaired growth, disruption of cognitive and emotional development, and physical disorders. Stress results in the secretion of stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids) that, although beneficial in the short-term, can lead to deterioration in the health of an individual if they remain chronically elevated. The particular focus in our proposed studies will be the prenatal maternal stress that ensues when immune responses of females are experimentally activated independently of the potentially confounding effects of infection during reproduction. Our proposed research employs a wild bird model that provides an excellent alternative model to evaluate maternal effects of prenatal stress because: (i) the endocrine systems of birds are similar to those of mammals, (ii) bird embryos are readily amenable to experimental manipulation within eggs, and (iii) wild birds are easily captured and manipulated in their natural environment, allowing inferences about the role of maternal stress to be made in a realistic evolutionary context. Our current expiring NIH-AREA project has revealed that experimentally induced immune responses lead to increased corticosterone levels in females and their eggs, and that this results in a significant influence on offspring size, health state, and immunity. We propose to build on this empirical foundation by: (i) characterizing the persistent influence of these maternal effects on the adult offspring phenotype, with specific reference to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, parental competence, and sex-specific trans- generational effects; and (ii) evaluating directly the role of the primary avian glucocorticoid, corticosterone, in mediating these effects by: a) employing a noninvasive method of increasing maternal corticosterone in the absence of any overt prenatal stress and b) experimentally blocking or reducing circulating maternal corticosterone in immunostimulated females. The proposed research will meet a primary goal of the AREA (R15) program in that it will expose undergraduate students to research that combines both field and laboratory work in a hypothetico-deductive framework to address important biomedical questions in a natural setting."
"9360068","The overarching goal of this program project is to advance the science of individualizing treatment to improve outcomes on the basis of response to therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) provides the opportunity to assess response to systemic therapy prior to surgery in women with high risk early breast cancer. The optimal outcome is the complete eradication of tumor, (pathologic complete response (pCR)), which is strongly associated with improved long-term survival and is a surrogate endpoint for accelerated drug approval. Conversely, women with significant residual cancer burden (RCB 2/3) suffer event free survival of less than 60% at 3-5 years. Redirecting therapy in poor responders could dramatically improve breast cancer survival in the highest risk women and minimize toxicities in early responders. The neoadjuvant I-SPY 2 adaptive clinical trial platform, designed to accelerate phase II development of new agents for stage II/III breast cancer is the ideal setting for this work. MRI will serve as a foundation for an integrated residual cancer burden assessment tool (?iRCB?), optimized by tumor subtype and pathway. Two decades of MRI imaging research in the I-SPY program have provided the necessary technology, bioinformatic and statistical approaches, and validation datasets to optimize the iRCB tool to serve as the trigger to redirect to rationally selected, biologically targeted agents. The advances from each project coalesce in Project 1, where we have developed the mechanics of integrating the pieces to determine whether treatment redirection on the basis of pathway abnormalities and avoiding the additional toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in the setting of complete or poor response leads to better outcomes. Project 2 contributes the tools for the optimization of the iRCB, using advances in imaging methods (diffusion weighted imaging and breast PET) and a longitudinal model that includes molecular data from diagnosis, and an inter-regimen biopsy to confirm absence or presence of disease and accurately classify excellent and poor response (RCB 0 and RCB 2/3, respectively). Project 3 will provide an understanding of the dynamics of the biology of response and treatment resistance, and Project 4 will delineate the rational selection of `second chance? therapies based on the biology and knowledge of agents already or being developed. We will work closely with the FDA over the course of this Program Project to establish the subtype specific thresholds for iRCB. The final result will be an evolution of the existing I-SPY Trial (into ?I-SPY2+?) that employs an innovative Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomization Trial (SMART) design to maximize both clinical impact and knowledge generation, while closely reflecting the realities of current clinical practice. Taken together, these projects leverage an established, successful, efficient, and highly innovative clinical trial platform and an experienced, collaborative research team to address a critical clinical issue in breast cancer. The innovative approach employed will mark a milestone in the implementation of personalized medicine in breast cancer and generate an unprecedented view of the molecular evolution of treatment resistance."
"9482228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia affects ~1% of all people. It is characterized by delusions and hallucinations resulting in high morbidity and mortality. These symptoms may be underpinned by misperceptions and misinterpretations of sensations that result from a basic inability to predict sensations and adapt to deviations from the expected. If predictive coding mechanisms are dysfunctional, sensations that should have been predicted, but were not, may take on inappropriate salience and lead to the construction of delusional schema to explain aberrant experience. These errors of prediction are costly to society and the patient.  Predictive coding models posit that higher order brain areas develop and maintain representations of predictable sensory stimuli, increasing efficiency of neural activity by reducing sensory cortical responses to these stimuli and increasing sensory responses to stimuli that violate the predicted pattern. In such models, the role of primary sensory cortices is to encode and transmit sensory prediction errors, that is, to respond mainly to those stimuli that deviate from the brain's representations of expected stimuli. In context-based predictive coding, the brain acquires and remembers the context of regular temporal and spatial patterns of sensory input. In action-based predictive coding, the predictability of sensory events derives from the fact that sensory events are a predictable consequence of one's own actions, and do not need to be learned or remembered.  Conceptually, action-based predictive coding models subsume efference-copy/corollary discharge forward model systems described across the animal kingdom in which an efference copy of an impending motor plan is transmitted from motor to sensory cortex where it generates a corollary discharge representation of the expected sensory consequences of the imminent motor act. Building on our prior work, we propose to ask how predictability and performance monitoring affect action-based predictive coding and how they affect sensory/perceptual processing in schizophrenia. We will use EEG and fMRI, acquired separately and simultaneously, to interrogate details of efference copy and corollary discharge components of action-based predictive coding. Using EEG, we can assess the split-second activity preceding a motor act, or the efference copy. Using fMRI, we can assess the spatial precision of the suppressive action of the corollary discharge mechanism. By integrating EEG and fMRI, we can understand the functional neuroanatomical basis of predictive coding and its abnormalities in schizophrenia.  Finally, we are adopting a paradigm and using methods that are translatable to animal models of SZ and that can ultimately be used to identify specific elements of circuits involved in predictive coding, transmitters involved in te neural mechanisms responsible for predictive coding, and even genes that underlie psychotic experiences and behavior."
"9533143","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic studies have shown that distant-acting regulatory sequences (enhancers) embedded in the vast non- coding portion of the human genome play important roles in craniofacial development and susceptibility to craniofacial birth defects. The mechanistic exploration of these distant-acting enhancers continues to be difficult because the genomic location and in vivo function of most craniofacial enhancers remains unknown. As members of FaceBase 1, we generated first sets of annotation and functional data for distal enhancers controlling craniofacial development. These resources proved to be of significant value to the craniofacial research community. However, these efforts captured only a small proportion of the enhancers that are active during craniofacial development in vivo. Here we propose to characterize the gene regulatory landscape of craniofacial development more comprehensively using new and complementary approaches. The specific aims are: 1) We will map predicted enhancers by ChIP-seq from embryonic mouse and human facial tissues. In preliminary studies, we used ChIP-seq with the enhancer-associated protein p300 to identify several thousand enhancers predicted to be active in the mouse face at e11.5 and in the secondary palate at later stages of development. Using ChIP-seq for a panel of histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3), which will require less tissue and increase the sensitivity of enhancer discovery by an order of magnitude, we will obtain higher-resolution data from all subregions of the developing mouse face at three stages of development (e11.5, e13.5, e15.5). We will complement this mouse-based effort with ChIP-seq on human embryonic face tissue to identify human-specific craniofacial enhancers not functionally conserved in mice. 2) In initial studies we characterized ~200 craniofacial enhancers in vivo in transgenic reporter assays. Taking advantage of protocols and collaborations established during FaceBase 1, we will continue to generate critically needed in vivo transgenic assays accompanied by optical projection tomography to characterize enhancers residing in new craniofacial loci identified by FaceBase 2 investigators and outside groups. This will include testing of enhancer variants associated with craniofacial malformations. 3) While enhancers are expected to have significant impact on craniofacial morphology, functional studies are lacking. We will generate a panel of 10 knockout mouse lines carrying deletions of individual enhancers at craniofacial development- or disease- associated loci. Mice will be phenotyped using expression profiling and high-resolution morphometry. In preliminary studies, we showed significant effects of three different enhancer deletions on craniofacial gene expression and morphology. All datasets, vectors, transgenic embryos, and knockout mouse lines produced through our efforts will be made available as resources to the craniofacial research community. We are deeply committed to our ongoing collaborative interactions with the Hub and other Spoke projects, contributing to and taking advantage of the unique research opportunities enabled through the FaceBase program."
"9543632","ABSTRACT Although, innate and adaptive immune functions are maintained in the oral mucosa during acute HIV/SIV infection, these responses become markedly impaired during chronic HIV infection and are not fully restored by combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Persistent oral mucosal inflammation/immune activation characterized by dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine production and oral dysbiosis are cardinal features of chronic HIV/SIV infection. Even though our understanding of oral mucosal dysfunction in HIV/SIV infection has improved, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown and unexplored. Apart from cytokines and transcription factors, recent studies show microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation to be critical for immune cell differentiation, maturation, activation and inflammatory responses. Extensive studies in other chronic inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity (Periodontitis, Oral lichen planus. etc.) have revealed a causative role for miRNAs in disease pathogenesis resulting in their identification as promising therapeutic targets. However, the role of miRNAs in HIV induced oral mucosal dysfunction is lacking. This application builds on preliminary studies, which identified significant dysregulation of miRNAs linked to T and B-cell activation and epithelial barrier disruption in tonsils and buccal mucosa (BUCM) from chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Studies of the same group using delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (??-THC) administration to chronic SIV-infected RMs significantly suppressed gastrointestinal proinflammatory gene/miRNA expression and inhibited T and B-cell activation and proliferation in vitro, suggesting their immense therapeutic potential for attenuating/reversing local (oral cavity) and systemic immune activation and slowing disease progression in the setting of suppressive cART. Based on our strong preliminary data demonstrating that miRNA expression is dysregulated in BUCM and tonsils in chronic HIV/SIV infection, we hypothesize that this leads to oral mucosal dysfunction, which contributes to immune activation and HIV disease progression. Further, we hypothesize that chronic ??-THC treatment may reduce inflammation, restore oral immune function, and slow HIV/SIV disease progression by modulating miRNA expression. A major goal of this application is to identify miRNA mechanisms associated with oral mucosal dysfunction and cannabinoid mediated suppression of immune activation. The project has three specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that miRNA (miR-142-3p,-142- 5p,-186,-7,-101-3p,-29b,-141) mediated downregulation of occludin (OCLN), claudin-1 (CLDN1) and zona occludens (ZO1) leads to oral epithelial barrier breakdown and increased epithelial permeability. 2) Identify miRNA mechanisms of cannabinoid-induced suppression of immune activation in BUCM and tonsils during the course of SIV infection. 3) Determine the effect of combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART) in conjunction with chronic ??-THC administration on the oral microflora, inflammation/immune activation, viral replication, miRNA expression and epithelial tight junction proteins in the oral cavity. The proposed research is novel and applies state of the art immunological and molecular approaches to address a significant gap in our understanding of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying oral mucosal dysfunction in the setting of suppressive cART. Additionally and more importantly, the results will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids and have important therapeutic implications for targeted immune modulation in not only HIV but also other chronic inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity. Thus, the overall significance and impact is high."
"9504746","Summary This proposal identifies a new function for Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Homozygous loss of APC causes polyposis and colon cancer in humans and deletion in early embryos causes multiple developmental phenotypes in model organisms such as Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse. Apc mutations cause accumulation of ß-catenin, which activates Wnt target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. However, nuclear ß-catenin is not detectable in early adenomas of patients with germline APC mutations (familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)) nor in the developing intestines of apc mutant zebrafish, suggesting that additional effectors are required downstream of APC. We find that APC directly enhances the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), providing an unexpected mechanism for APC-dependent suppression of multiple downstream targets, including the nutrient sensor mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) and ß-catenin. APC mutations reduce GSK-3 activity, thereby activating mTORC1 in diverse in vivo settings including adenomas from patients with FAP, intestinal adenomas in mice, and apc mutant zebrafish embryos. Our overall hypothesis is that APC directly activates GSK-3 and that this signaling motif regulates multiple pathways, including ß-catenin and mTOR signaling. This model reveals a critical, new function for APC, provides a mechanism for mTOR activation caused by APC mutations, and suggests a link between APC and other signaling pathways that are independent of Wnt/ß-catenin. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will map the GSK-3 activation domain of APC. In aim 2, we will explore the mechanism of mTOR regulation by APC in vivo, including FAP patients. Aim 3 explores the surprising observation that apc mutation causes a dramatic neoplastic phenotype in zebrafish within 3 days that requires mTOR activation. We will use molecular and genetic approaches in zebrafish to characterize these tumors as a highly accessible, in vivo model to explore APC signaling and tumorigenesis."
"9414779","Mitochondria are the principal generators of cellular ATP by oxidative phosphorylation which links electron transport via Complexes I through IV to production of ATP via ATP synthase. Over 250 pathogenic human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, associated with diseases ranging from cardiomyopathy to juvenile blindness, have been identified. Collectively, millions are affected by mtDNA disease for which there are no curative treatments. The absence of (a) cell line models that accurately mimic the human mtDNA disease state for drug discovery, and (b) pre-clinical disease models to assess in vivo efficacy of drug candidates have hampered the development of curative therapies. In an SBIR-funded project (GM117965), Enzerna is using Artificial Site- Specific RNA Endonucleases (ASREs), engineered to be transported into mitochondria to mediate inducible ablation of specific mt-RNAs, to create cell line models of mtDNA disease to screen for therapeutic candidates. Here, Enzerna will seek to address the second unmet need for mtDNA disease drug development ? the creation of mtDNA disease models to assess the in vivo efficacy of potential therapeutics. Given that most pathogenic mtDNA mutations act recessively, we will develop ?transgenic? ASRE knockdown stem (ES) cell models that can be used as in vitro (after directed differentiation) or in vivo models for drug discovery. ASREs targeted against the tRNA gene, MT-TI (tRNA isoleucine) and ND5 genes, both associated with cardiomyopathy and defects in cardiac mitochondrial function, will be transduced into mouse ES cells. Cumate?inducible ASREs targeted against MT-TI or ND 5 RNAs will be transduced using piggyBac(PB)-based vectors into C57BL6 ES cell lines and selected for puromycin resistance. Pools of puroR ES cells and ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes will be induced with cumate and screened for: (a) ASRE localization to mitochondria; (b) RNA expression of targeted locus and other mt-RNAs to assess specificity; (c) Western blotting to assess global downregulation of mtDNA- encoded proteins and ND5 protein downregulation in MT-TI and ND5 transduced cells, respectively; and (d) Complex I, II and IV activities. We will seek to demonstrate that ASREs are active in mice generated from transduced ES cells. Pools of ASRE(MT-TI) and ASRE(ND5) transduced ES cells will be injected into host blastocysts to generate germ line chimeric animals; four independent transgenic lines will be established for future studies. In parallel, ASRE(MT-TI) and ASRE(ND5) germ line chimeras will be intercrossed to wild type females to generate 13.5 dpc embryos and neonates for derivation of primary fibroblast and cardiac cultures to assess ASRE activity. Criteria for success: For ASRE(MT-TI), >75% knockdown of MT-TI expression with no off- target ablation of mtRNA expression, global downregulation of mt-DNA encoded proteins, and >50% decrease in Complex I, II, and IV activities. For ASRE(ND5), >75% knockdown of MT-ND5 expression with no off-target ablation of mtRNA expression, >50% decrease in ND5 protein expression, and >50% decrease in Complex I activity. With the development of two models that carry mtDNA knockdown mutations, we (in collaboration with Dr. Brown) will expand ongoing studies to develop therapeutics for mtDNA-associated cardiomyopathies in Phase II. Furthermore, the establishment of a general platform for ASRE-mediated knockdown in ES cells will enable Enzerna to build a bank of inducible and tunable ?knockdown? models for each mtDNA gene, which would provide the field with valuable and innovative translational models to screen for and test curative therapies."
"9287800","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, heterogeneous condition that is a major public health problem, the most common cause of disability in the aging population and is associated with a large economic burden. The pathophysiology of OA affects the whole joint, with breakdown of cartilage, associated changes in the subchondral bone and adjacent soft tissue that leads to debilitating symptoms such as pain. With the aging of the population and the epidemic of obesity, the public health impact of OA, especially knee OA, has and will continue to increase dramatically, but unfortunately, there are no FDA-approved disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs), i.e., drugs designed to impede or prevent the OA-related structural changes to cartilage and bone. This has been due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between features of OA and disease progression. MRI, however, has improved our understanding of the relationship between histopathologic changes and the structural changes to cartilage, subchondral bone and the surrounding soft tissues of the joint in OA. As such MRI represents an improvement over plain knee radiographs, which are both insensitive and nonspecific to critical changes in joint structure in the development and progression of OA. The objective of this work is to understand the impact of the trajectory of BMLs and ES on downstream clinical outcomes, including cartilage loss and disability, over the short-term (i.e., two years later) and long-term (i.e., six years later). Analysis of the trajectory of BMLs and ES will take into account the quantitative volume at baseline and the quantitative change in volume over time. The specific aims of this study are: To evaluate the impact of the trajectory of MRI-detected bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and effusion synovitis (ES) on subsequent cartilage loss; and to evaluate the impact of the trajectory of MRI-detected BMLs and ES on knee-specific disability."
"9409102","Project Summary Insulin replacement therapy has saved numerous lives of Type 1 diabetic patients since it was established in the 1920's. Currently, multiple fast-, intermediate- and longer-acting insulins are available to patients. However, many patients on insulin replacement therapy do not achieve adequate blood glucose control as indicated by not reaching target HbA1c levels (<7%). Inter- and intra-patient variability is a major factor limiting the effectiveness of basal insulin therapy; this variability enhances the likelihood of hypoglycemia and reduces the dose of insulin that may be safely prescribed. An insulin therapy that is more convenient and less likely to induce hypoglycemia would lead to greater patient compliance. Thus, methods to deliver a flatter, more even dose of insulin, with smaller variability, and in a convenient format to increase compliance, has the potential to significantly improve glycemic control in diabetes patients. Extend Biosciences is harnessing the body's own natural systems to extend the half-life and increase the bioavailability of peptides following subcutaneous injection. In this Phase I SBIR grant, we propose to develop an ultralong-acting version of insulin using our technology and formulate it as a slow-release depot to achieve a once-weekly basal insulin replacement. Preliminary results show that our technology confers a longer half-life and increased bioavailability without affecting the function of insulin at the insulin receptor. We propose to establish the feasibility of a once-weekly basal insulin for the treatment of diabetes by achieving the following three specific aims. First, we will prepare three depot delivery methods with our long-acting insulin. Then, we will test these formulations in a rat model of type 1 diabetes. We will also examine the pharmacokinetics of these formulations in minipigs, an animal model that is more predictive of behavior in humans. Once fully developed, this insulin derivative would greatly benefit patients with diabetes by helping them manage their disease using a long-lasting, patient-friendly drug. More even dosing would lower the risks of hypoglycemia while improving control of blood glucose, thus reducing long-term diabetic complications such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis, and nephropathy."
"9470018","Top-down functions (e.g., attention and working memory) go hand-in-hand with consciousness. Yet we know more about the former, because it is hard to define consciousness in most contexts. There is, however, a way in. General anesthesia (GA) provides transition through different stages of consciousness. We aim to determine which aspects of cortical processing are critical for these changes by using a surgical anesthetic, propofol, in monkeys. Propofol increases cortical-wide delta oscillations and alpha in frontal cortex. One hypothesis posits that the increased frontal alpha disrupts top-down cortical feedback from frontal cortex. Another points to the widespread delta oscillations that, unlike sleep, are decoupled across cortex. This could fragment long-range communication across cortex or, as some suggest, loss of consciousness (LOC) could be due to frontal-parietal cortex disconnectivity per se. The thalamus is likely to play a major role. Mounting evidence suggests it controls top-down cortical processing, perhaps by modulating cortical oscillations. Abnormal thalamic oscillations could entrain different cortical areas or the changed dynamics could be largely a cortical phenomenon. Previous primate studies of GA lack the combination of wide scope and single-neuron precision to directly test these hypotheses. We will use chronic intracranial multiple electrodes in monkeys to record simultaneously from a wide range of critical brain structures (prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, auditory cortex, and thalamus). We will also test if thalamic stimulation can restore consciousness and wakeful cortical dynamics."
"9341333","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ocular bacterial infections cause a significant number of cases of blindness worldwide. Efforts to prevent damage to delicate ocular tissues during infection rely on swift and proper use of therapeutics to rapidly kill organisms and arrest potentially damaging inflammation. Currently-used antibiotics can kill organisms, but the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs is controversial. These drug classes do not target tissue-damaging toxins synthesized by bacteria at the site of infection. Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are important, and often essential, to ocular virulence of the following Gram-positive ocular pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. When PFTs are absent, ocular virulence is significantly decreased. Novel PFT-targeting therapeutics which neutralize toxins across species would provide coverage for the most common Gram-positive pathogens causing ocular surface (keratitis) and intraocular (endophthalmitis) infections. Toxin neutralization as an adjunct with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents would provide a significant improvement over current therapies that are ineffective against tissue-damaging toxins.  Nanosponges have recently been developed which target Gram-positive PFTs. In vitro, nanosponges neutralize Gram-positive PFTs. In in vivo experimental models of sepsis and tissue infection, nanosponges neutralize toxins at the site of infection and reduce virulence. We hypothesize that nanosponges can effectively reduce the toxic activity of bacterial PFTs in the ocular environment, leading to use as a novel anti-toxi therapeutic with antibiotics for the treatment of intraocular and ocular surface infections. Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of testing our hypothesis. We show that nanosponges 1) neutralize PFTs of Gram-positive ocular pathogens, 2) do so in the presence of tears, vitreous, and antibiotics, 3) protect against toxic ocular cell death, and 4) are not toxic in/on mouse eyes.  A critical barrier to clinical improvements in ocular bacterial infections is th absence of toxin- targeting. We will test nanosponges for PFT-neutralizing activity and efficacy with antibiotics against ocular pathogens causing keratitis (Aim 1) and endophthalmitis (Aim 2), and will also investigate their biodistribution following ocular application (Aim 3). If nanosponge are effective, the next step is to test nanosponges with more potent antibiotics and better anti-inflammatory agents. Testing of nanosponges in the treatment of ocular bacterial infections is high risk, but is novel, high-impact, translationally relevant, and will positively influence the ocular infectious disease field by identifying a novel anti-toxin therapy which may protect delicate tissues of the eye during infection. The proposed studies are a logical outgrowth of our ocular infection research program, and we are well positioned to contribute valuable information which will provide physicians with the best possible therapeutic options to preserve vision during ocular infections."
"9287165","Project Summary/Abstract This project describes the discovery and characterization of a novel human microprotein that functions in cellular RNA decay. RNA decay, or turnover, is a critical mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, degrading not only normal cellular RNA at the end of its lifetime, but also disease-related mRNAs that are degraded to prevent production of toxic, mutant proteins. Our novel polypeptide, which we term NoBody for ?non-annotated P-body associated polypeptide?, is translated from a long non-coding RNA. NoBody is only 7 kDa in size, and is intrinsically disordered. Despite its lack of structure, NoBody is highly conserved in mammals, and we show that it specifically interacts with proteins involved in the first step of a key RNA turnover pathway ? mRNA decapping ? and that it is linked to the abundances of hundreds of cellular transcripts. We propose to elucidate the biochemical function and structure of this microprotein in complex with mRNA decapping proteins, as well as the genes and biological processes that are under its control. The significance of this proposal is that we will reveal an entirely novel mechanism of regulation of mRNA decay ? modulation of mRNA decapping by a previously unknown microprotein. More broadly, this work will demonstrate that innovative, proteomics-based platforms for new gene discovery have the potential to reveal new molecular players in important cellular processes and disease."
"9408809","Summary While the Gag-5' leader interaction is crucial for the incorporation of HIV-1 genomes into virions, it is by no means the only RNA protein interaction that is required for the formation of morphologically accurate, infectious virions. Indeed, CRNA investigators have discovered non-canonical interactions between HIV-1 proteins (matrix, integrase, protease) and RNA molecules of host and/or viral origin that are, or may be, crucial for regulating the timing and location of key events in the formation of infectious virions. Additionally, CRNA investigators have made key advances in determining the structure of an RNA:RNA interaction (tRNA:U5-PBS) that is also initiated during virion morphogenesis and is similarly crucial for the generation of infectious virions. Project 4 will consist of a mixture of structural and functional experiments that will aim to elucidate the molecular details of these events and their importance during HIV-1 virion genesis. In Aim 1 Summers, Zhang and Bieniasz will determine the structures of matrix:tRNA complexes that appear to regulate Gag:membrane binding, in Aim 2 D?Souza, Smith, and Chiu will determine structures and functions of tRNA:U5-PBS:reverse transcriptase complexes that are formed during virion maturation, but are crucial for initiating subsequent reverse transcription. In Aim 3, Kutluay and Smith will determine the structure of IN:RNA complexes that appear crucial for the correct positioning of the ribonucleoprotein complex within the capsid core of mature virions, and will determine the feasibility of inhibiting this interaction with small molecules. Finally, in Aim 4 Swanstrom and Bieniasz will determine whether RNA:protease interactions that activate protease in vitro also occur in virions, as well as their functional significance, with a view to eventually determining the structural features of this interaction."
"9349376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in the delivery of evidence-based interventions to promote under-five child survival is the coordination of care across the multiple tiers of the health system, from frontline health workers, to primary care clinics, to district hospitals, to specialty providers. Additionally, children who survive or avoid once-fatal diseases such as congenital and rheumatic heart diseases, prematurity, neurodevelopmental conditions, and disabilities sustained from traumatic injuries, are increasingly living well into adolescence, young adulthood, and beyond. Healthcare delivery systems in resource-limited settings, however, are ill- equipped to manage such patients' care. Mobile technologies, coupled with effective management strategies, may enhance implementation and coordination of evidence-based interventions, but few controlled trials exist to validate this. Particularly lacking are strategies that incorporate mobile technologies in an integrated manner across the health system. Intervention: We have developed a mobile health care coordination and quality improvement intervention within two rural district healthcare systems in Nepal, where the child mortality rate is an estimated 82 per 1,000, and coordination of child health care is poor. Firstly the intervention aims to increase the timely engagement in acute care for children under the age of five to receive evidence-based World Health Organization protocols aimed at reducing child mortality-Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, Integrated Management of Emergency and Essential Surgical Care, and Community-based Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition. Secondly, the intervention aims to implement a Chronic Care Model for pediatric patients under the age of twenty suffering from a chronic disease (congenital and rheumatic heart disease, diabetes, depression, epilepsy, asthma, musculoskeletal and neurodevelopmental disabilities, and pre- and post-surgical conditions). Analysis: We will conduct a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome of this trial will be under-five mortality. We hypothesize a 25% reduction in under-five mortality rate during the intervention periods, relative to the control period. We hypothesize a 50% improvement in follow-up rates, a 30% improvement in global symptoms score, a 20% reduction in disability score, and a 20% reduction in inpatient days in hospital. We will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the scalability of the intervention in terms of logistics, human resources, costs, and utilization. Impact: Rigorous evaluations of systems-level child healthcare interventions are needed to drive global healthcare policies and their implementation. The trial proposed here will inform the potential impact and scalability of health systems strengthening interventions."
"9484970","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central problem this work addresses is how cells communicate their fitness and recognize aberrant fitness differences that might endanger growing tissues. Much evidence indicates that the recognition of fitness disparities elicits interactions that prevent the weaker cells from contributing to the animal. This process is thought to promote optimal tissue and organismal fitness. Cell competition is a mechanism that facilitates this homeostatic process, and is initiated upon recognition of cells perceived as less it by their more robust neighbors. Examples of competitive behavior between cells of different fitness are numerous, but the best studied occur from expression differences in one of a number of ribosomal proteins (Rp), or the transcription factor Myc. The developing Drosophila wing has provided an essential, key paradigm for study of cell competition. Using this system we recently discovered that communication between the winner and loser cells is mediated by a novel signaling pathway consisting of components co-opted from innate immune pathways. Here we propose experiments to elucidate a specific aspect of this signaling mechanism, the role of Spätzle (Spz), a secreted cytokine that we identified as a key factor required for the elimination of loser cells in both Rp- and Myc-mediated cell competition. Spz, an NGF protein family member characterized by a critical cys-knot domain, functions as an activating ligand for the Toll pathway in D/V patterning of the Drosophila embryo and in larval and adult innate immunity. Our discovery that Spz is involved in transmitting information about cell fitness forms the basis of this application. Drosophila is unsurpassed for mosaic studies of cell-cell interactions in living animals and offers unparalleled genetic and molecular toolkits. The functional conservation of these signaling pathways suggests that unraveling their functions in cell competition could be transformative for an understanding of how exploitation to environmental barriers to growth leads to cancer or disease."
"9407456","PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer a progressive loss of memory and cognitive ability, and eventual loss of basic bodily functions and death. Currently 11% of Americans over 65 have AD and its incidence and toll on the healthcare system continues to rise with significant societal impact. There are no treatments for AD to prevent its inexorable course, and a principal obstacle to developing new therapies for AD has been the inadequacy of available preclinical modeling, which almost exclusively involves rodents. As nonhuman primates (NHPs) share greater homology to humans than rodents in all respects, including genomics and physiology, cognitive processing, neuronal network complexity, white/gray matter ratios, dynamics of drug/target interactions, and the triggers of age-associated pathophysiology, the long-term goal of this project is to develop a new NHP model of AD that can be standardized and deployed in rigorous, reproducible studies to overcome critical current deficiencies in translating preclinical studies into novel clinical diagnostic strategies and therapies. The objective of this application is to expand and advance recent preliminary work on a new NHP model of AD involving intrathecal administration of amyloid ?-oligomers (A?Os). The hypothesis is that A?Os will trigger a cascade of accelerated pathology that mimics the changes occurring in the brains of AD patients. This hypothesis is based on a growing consensus in the AD research field, backed by strong data, that A?Os are likely the toxic species that provoke deposition of the characteristic tangles and plaques in the brain together with loss of synapses and neurons and associated cognitive decline. The hypothesis will be tested in statistically meaningful designs by pursing the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the appropriate dose of A?O and intervals of dosing; and 2) Identify the persistence of induced biochemical and structural deficits and AD pathology following termination of A?O infusion. These studies will utilize in-life (MRI) and post-mortem measurements (immunohistochemistry, biochemistry) to establish the impact of A?Os administration in the brain of the St. Kitts green monkey, a species that has been well characterized for its propensity to develop naturally occurring features of AD pathology. The approach is innovative because it represents a substantial shift from current AD research paradigms and tests a novel theoretical concept. The research is significant because it is expected to overcome critical deficiencies in current animal AD models by validating an accelerated, inducible NHP model of sporadic AD and permit effective translation of basic studies into novel clinical diagnostic strategies and therapies. Success with this model development program would provide a valuable resource to academic, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and diagnostic laboratories in need of a reliable preclinical model of AD for basic research, and diagnostic and therapeutic development."
"9349368","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmembrane signaling plays a central role in all of biology, allowing cells to sense and respond to their environment. In humans, integral membrane receptors mediate the effects of hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and a multitude of other signaling molecules. The PAQR receptors are a poorly characterized family of transmembrane receptors, found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Recently, two PAQR receptors have attracted particular attention because they mediate the effects of a protein hormone called adiponectin. Adiponectin has been shown to induce profound insulin-sensitizing and cardioprotective effects in mouse models of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of adiponectin signaling. To unravel the molecular details of adiponectin receptor signaling, we will pursue a combination of structural and biochemical studies of adiponectin and its receptors, with the long term goal of developing a detailed molecular understanding of signaling through the adiponectin receptors and broader PAQR family."
"9382130","PROJECT SUMMARY Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neuropsychiatric conditions with a great deal of phenotypic variability. Emerging genetic analyses have unequivocally demonstrated that a variety of genetic factors create ASD risk, including common polygenic variation, de novo variation, rare inherited variation, and copy number variation. To understand how these diverse genetic factors influence risk for ASDs, we will evaluate the full spectrum of phenotypes with which they are associated, both in ASD cases and in the general population. In so doing, we will identify types of ASD-associated genetic variation that appear similar in terms of phenotypic impact and, critically, highlight types that diverge. To characterize the relationship between ASD genetic risk and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD cases, we will leverage a new resource of over 13,000 ASD cases from the Danish national psychiatric registry. We will examine how common polygenic variation and rare protein truncating variation (point mutations and CNVs) relate to phenotypic differences in ASD cases. These analyses will identify subgroups of cases that share similar genetic etiology and phenotypic presentation, allowing us to stratify ASD populations for research and eventual treatment development. Using data from two cohort studies, we will also characterize the association between genetic risk for ASDs and behavioral and cognitive variation in the general population. We will conduct a phenome-wide association study of the relationship between common polygenic risk for ASDs and behavioral, cognitive, and medical variation in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; n=7500). In the Twins Early Development Study, we will examine the general population relationship between rate of rare, protein truncating variation and each of: intelligence, autism-like traits, psychosis-like traits, and traits of attention deficit disorder. Significant genetic associations with general population phenotypes will facilitate interpretation of ASD risk variants, and inform our understanding of clinical thresholds. The projects described in this proposal will significantly improve understanding of ASDs heterogeneity and genetic influences."
"9353888","Project Summary There are two critical pacemakers for life: the cardiac pacemaker and the breathing pacemaker, the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC). The preBötC is a cluster of ~3000 neurons in the brainstem that are cyclically active, with each burst of activity initiating a breath. In contrast to the cardiac pacemaker, the molecular and cellular basis of breathing rhythm generation remains unknown, as do diseases associated with it, such as central sleep apnea and sudden infant death. The prevailing model of preBötC rhythm generation, called the `group-pacemaker' model, proposes that each breath is triggered by an emergent preBötC network phenomena. An important assumption of this model is that there are not dedicated breath-initiating neurons. However, based on the observed variety of preBötC neuron firing patterns, including ones that fire just before each breath (pre-inspiratory), and the unexpected molecular and functional diversity of the preBötC neurons I discovered during my Ph.D., I hypothesize that, as in the heart, there are specific neurons that initiate each breath, breathing pacemaker neurons, and propose to identify and characterize them in this research proposal. As a UCSF Sandler Fellow and recipient of the Early Independence Award, I plan to first comprehensively map preBötC cell types with single cell gene expression analysis and identify candidate breathing pacemaker neurons by their expression of the same ion channels important for cardiac pacemaking. Additionally, I plan identify candidate breath-initiating neurons by their anticipated activity during breathing (pre-inspiratory) and their autonomous, rhythmic activity in vitro (pacemaker activity). Lastly, I will identify candidate pacemakers by their proposed connectivity to ~175 preBötC neurons I identified in my Ph.D. that receive breathing pacemaker activity. I predict that these three independent approaches will converge on the same preBötC subtypes, the presumed breathing pacemaker neurons and I will then use intersectional genetic strategies to test if the identified neurons have breathing pacemaker properties: autonomous rhythmic activity, pre-inspiratory activity, ability to initiate a breath, and requirement for breathing. The molecular and functional identification of respiratory pacemaker neurons will be a transformative discovery, leading to the eventual resolution of how respiratory rhythms and arrhythmias, some of the most deadly diseases in infants, are generated. This mechanistic understanding of breathing rhythm generation will provide an avenue to develop pharmacological approaches to control ventilation, which would impact multiple medical fields, especially neonatology and critical care medicine. In my recent Ph.D. work, I have demonstrated extraordinary molecular diversity within the preBötC and demonstrated that small numbers of molecularly distinct preBötC cell types have highly specific functions in the breathing behavior. I am poised to continue this dissection with the objective of identifying the core neurons that initiate a breath and control the pace of breathing."
"9328091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An effective research mentoring relationship is a key element in preparing the next generation of scientists and health professionals to pursue or help make informed decisions about pursuing research careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). Yet, little is known about how specific factors in this relationship affect mentees' academic and career pursuits in research. Empirical evidence indicates that the cultural diversity factors of gender, race, and ethnicity affect undergraduate research mentees' perception of their mentoring experience, however, research on how cultural diversity factors operate in the research mentoring relationship and affect mentees is virtually non-existent. To advance training interventions that build the capacity of research mentors to effectively mentor culturally diverse research mentees, it is necessary to understand the impact of mentor cultural diversity awareness (CDA) on mentee academic and career outcomes. The proposed research addresses this critical need through the following three Specific Aims: Aim #1 will determine how mentors and mentees define mentor CDA and mentors' attitudes about the relevance of cultural diversity (CDR) in research mentoring relationships. Aim #2 will identify relationships between mentor cultural diversity awareness and mentee research-related self-perceptions and positive outcomes (i.e., intent to enter STEMM graduate training or a STEMM career). Aim #3 will investigate, via a randomized controlled trial (RCT), how mentor CDR attitudes affect their response to a training to increase their CDA and whether that training affects 1) mentees' ratings of mentor effectiveness and 2) alignment of mentor-mentee ratings of mentees' research skills/career knowledge. Expected outcomes from this proposal are: 1) a set of indicators and descriptors of mentor cultural diversity awareness (CDA) and a measure of mentor CDR attitudes; 2) validated measures of mentor CDA and CDR attitudes that can be used for mentor self-assessment and to test the effectiveness of CDA training; 3) an intervention to enhance mentor CDA, and; 4) a tested model of research mentoring relationships that includes CDA. This proposal is innovative because it: 1) focuses on cultural diversity factors within research mentoring relationships; 2) is guided by research and theory on career development and cultural competence; 3) employs a mixed-methods approach to develop indicators of and assessment instruments for mentor CDA and mentor CDR attitudes; and 4) analyzes the importance of alignment between mentor-mentee perceptions of critical elements in the research mentoring relationship. The proposed research is significant because it will: 1) shed light on two understudied aspects of research mentoring relationships - the role of CDA and the importance of alignment between mentor and mentee perceptions in the relationship; 2) empirically identify the relevance of mentors' CDA to mentee self-perceptions and positive outcomes; 3) develop and validate measures to assess mentor CDA and CDR attitudes; and 4) produce an RCT-tested intervention to improve mentor CDA."
"9538302","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide. Under physiological conditions, the Notch and Wing-less/Int (Wnt) signaling pathways modulate homeostasis and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium. In intestinal cancers, these pathways are frequently dysregulated. Canonical Wnt/?- catenin signaling pathway activation, with resultant high ?-catenin transcriptional activity, is frequently implicated in human CRC; however, there are currently no treatments targeting this pathway. Several points of crosstalk between Notch and Wnt pathways have been described in CRC. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional networks governed by the Notch and Wnt/?-catenin pathways in intestinal tumorigenesis is significant for advancing scientific knowledge on cancer biology, and would potentially provide a window for new CRC therapeutics. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to identify how transcriptional machinery controls intestinal cell differentiation and how critical transcription factors contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis. In Aims 1 and 2, using the novel transgenic mouse models and unbiased highthroughput RNA and DNA sequencing techniques, I have managed several parallel projects and multiinstitutional collaborations to understand the role of transcription factor Atoh1 (Atonal homolog 1), and its downstream target, SAM Pointed Domain ETS transcription Factor (SPDEF) in CRCs. The results from the proposed project are expected to significantly advance our current understanding of transcriptional machinery in CRCs. To extend my current knowledge and gain deeper insight into the biology of cancer, in Aim 3, I plan to pursue my postdoctoral studies in the direction of understanding how these extracellular components within the tumor microenvironment contribute to the program of cancer cell metastasis, a primary cause of cancerrelated fatality with CRCs, especially how these cells grow, invade, migrate, and resist treatment. Collectively, this training is customized to give me a comprehensive education in basic science research that will be extremely in achieving my long-term career goal of becoming an independent cancer researcher."
"9388796","PROJECT SUMMARY ? CORE B: DISSEMINATION AND OUTREACH CORE  The goal of autism research is to help people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by increasing  understanding of their difficulties and learning how to minimize their challenges and maximize the quality of  their lives. It is not enough to address and answer fundamental questions with well-designed experiments  conducted by expert scientists. If the findings are not made widely available to practitioners and those who  have the most to gain from them ? persons with ASD and their families and caregivers ? then a key aim of the  research is not realized. To insure that this perspective is ever-present in the activities of this Center, the goals  of the Dissemination and Outreach Core are to (1) widely disseminate the findings of the Center for the  Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder to practitioners as well as  persons with ASD and their families and caregivers; (2) support two-way communication between the scientists  of the Autism Center of Excellence and the broad ASD scientific community, along with the community of  stakeholders and practitioners both locally and nationally; (3) increase the workforce for autism research by  drawing talent into autism science, particularly those who have been underrepresented in ASD science; and  (4) develop the next generations of ASD scientists, from students through mature scientists, who are new to  ASD research. To achieve these goals, Core B will undertake a variety of activities including translation and  dissemination of research-based findings to local, state, and community scientists, practitioners, and  stakeholders through multiple formats including real time, and store and forward products annually; promoting  a two-way communication between the investigators and stakeholders (including practitioners) through focus  group activities and a needs assessments of stakeholder groups, and through formation of advisory groups of  family/self-advocate stakeholders and practitioners. To develop the next generations of ASD scientist who are  responsive to the needs of the ASD communities, the Core will recruit new trainees, junior faculty, and  established investigators, especially those from underrepresented racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups,  into collaborative Center scientific activities annually. In coordination with Project 1, new clinicians will be  trained in the detection and treatment of anxiety disorders in individuals with ASD. The Core will also establish  a Pilot Grants Program to encourage the entry of scientists who are not currently engaged in ASD research to  enter the field. The benefits of these activities to the larger ASD community is threefold: (1) to maximize the  relevance of ASD research to ASD community needs, (2) to encourage the implementation of research  findings in communities by practitioners and stakeholders alike, and (3) to grow and diversify the ASD  researcher base to achieve breakthroughs in the ASD field."
"9348396","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intimate partner violence (IPV) and homicides disproportionately affect immigrant, refugee and indigenous women. Thus, there is need for empirically supported culturally competent assessment and interventions for abused immigrant, refugee and indigenous women to address risk factors and any health or safety concerns. The Danger Assessment (DA) instrument was originally developed to assess risk of homicide, near lethality and potentially lethal injury by an intimate partner. The goal of the proposed study is t develop and validate clinically useful, culturally specific versions of the DA to assess risk for severe IPV among immigrant, refugee and indigenous women. Further, the study will evaluate the impact of administering the culturally specific DAs with safety planning/referral tailored to te level of danger, women's preferences and culture in promoting women's empowerment, safety and mental health. Using a sequential mixed methods design (qualitative and quantitative), data will be collected from a) practitioners serving immigrant, refugee and indigenous survivors/perpetrators of IPV, and b) immigrant, refugee and indigenous women with IPV experiences. In the qualitative phase, focus groups with practitioners and in-depth interviews with survivors will be conducted to develop culturally specific versions of the DA for immigrant, refugee and indigenous women. In the quantitative phase, data will be collected from women a) to test the reliability and validity (including predictive validity) of the created DAs, and b) to evaluate the impact of administering the created DAs with DA-informed safety planning/referrals on women's empowerment, safety and mental health. Using a longitudinal randomized experimental design, women will be randomized to either the intervention website (i.e., DA followed by DA- informed safety planning/referral intervention administered via internet and/ or smart phone application accessible safety decision aid) or the control (i.e., non-DA informed usual care) website. Data on outcomes (i.e., safety, mental health and empowerment) will be collected at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post- baseline. The study will result in evidence-based culturally tailored DAs for use by healthcare and domestic violence providers serving immigrant, refugee and indigenous survivors of IPV. The culturally tailored DAs may not only reduce risk for violence victimization, but also empower abused women and improve their mental health outcomes (i.e., PTSD, depression, drug/alcohol use)."
"9473205","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the treatment of bipolar disorder, most patients do not achieve complete inter-episode recovery and functional disability is common. During periods of relative remission, many patients continue to experience neurocognitive dysfunction. These persistent features of the illness represent critical treatment targets, as they do not adequately improve with standard mood stabilizing medications and they are strongly associated with functional disability and poor quality of life. In prior work by our group (Burdick et al. 2012), we reported preliminary evidence of a significant efficacy signal in a subset of bipolar patients who participated in a controlled cognitive enhancement trial of the D2/D3 agonist, pramipexole (Mirapex(c)). In conducting this previous study, we noted several important methodological limitations and illness-related confounds that require follow-up using a modified approach in order to adequately test the safety and efficacy of this agent in treating cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Thus, we propose a 2-site, collaborative, 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, adjunctive study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pramipexole on neurocognitive functioning in 100 affectively-stable bipolar patients. We have modified the design from the prior  trial to optimize the likelihood of detecting a positive signalby addressing several of the identified previous  limitations by: 1) increasing the maximum daily dose~ 2) including patients who are affectively-stable with  objective evidence of cognitive impairment~ 3) stratifying randomization based upon concomitant antipsychotic  treatment~ and 4) increasing the duration of the trial to 6 months in an effort to address longer term safety and  efficacy as well as potential improvement in everyday functioning.   Pramipexole is approved by the US FDA for Parkinson's disease and Restless Leg Syndrome.  In an off-label application, we will administer flexibly-dosed pramipexole (1-3 mg/day) vs. placebo to 100 stable patients with bipolar I disorder for 24 weeks. We will measure patients' performance on tasks of attention, memory and higher order cognition, using several paper-pencil and computerized tests, before pramipexole is administered, at week 4, week 8, week 16, and again at the end of the 24-week study. In addition, we will include several novel affective-neuroscience-based measures to gain insight into pramipexole's effect on the neural networks associated with DA-based reward processing. Finally, we will also investigate the effects of pramipexole on measures of functional capacity and community functions.   We will closely monitor patients for unforeseen changes in mood symptoms that are deemed to place them at  risk for developing mania or depression and will discontinue the trial as deemed necessary. We expect that findings from this study will provide a definitive go/no-go decision regarding the pursuit of this agent as a cognitive enhancer in bipolar disorder. Regardless of primary outcome, we expect that this trial will provide additional important data related to D2/D3-based reward processing in affective disorders."
"9452696","PROJECT SUMMARY Obesity is the strongest independent predictor for the onset and progression of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight gain occurs due to a shift to a positive energy balance through some combination of increased food/energy intake and decreased total energy expenditure. Energy balance is not constant or consistent, and therefore long-term weight gain occurs as a sum of numerous, small positive fluctuations over time scales ranging from days to seasons. These acute episodes of positive energy balance occur as a complex interaction of the current obesogenic environment and inappropriate metabolic regulation. One route of metabolic regulation may be the control of food/energy intake through a liver/brain axis. The main goal of the proposed 5-year research career development plan is to facilitate the applicant's transition from postdoctoral fellow to a fully independent academic scientist. This will be accomplished by training the applicant in a variety of metabolic, neurophysiology, and molecular techniques that will be used to identify mechanisms by which the hepatic mitochondrial function impacts short-term, western diet- induced weight gain. Reduced liver fatty acid oxidation and lower hepatic energy status results in increased food intake, which requires intact vagal nerve communication between the brain and the liver. Additionally, we have shown that increased food/energy intake, weight gain, and adiposity are associated with decreased hepatic fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial respiratory capacity during a 3-day high fat diet (HFD). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that reduced hepatic mitochondrial function results in increased acute HFD-induced weight gain via: 1) increased HFD food intake, and 2) decreased hepatic and systemic utilization of fat. In this proposal, we will use a liver-specific, PGC-1? heterozygous (LPGC1a+/-) mouse model to study the role of reduced hepatic mitochondrial respiratory function on HFD-induced weight gain. Hepatic vagotomy will be used to test the involvement of liver/brain afferent signals in LPGC1a+/- and wildtype mice. Additional work will include experiments to study the role of hepatic mitochondrial function in onset of metabolic inflexibility and control of systemic substrate utilization, and the role of liver adenine nucleotide levels in the initiation of hepatic efferent vagal signal."
"9532335","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority (>85%) of human cancers use telomerase as the primary telomere length maintenance mechanism. My long-term goal is to establish an independent research laboratory, where I will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which alternative splicing plays a role in telomere length maintenance mechanisms. This basic biological information will be important for my long-term goals for designing telomerase specific cancer therapeutics. The K99/R00 career award will help me in achieving my goals as a research scientist by advancing my training in: gene expression regulation, alternative splicing, next generation sequencing, and molecular biology under the co-mentorship of Dr. Woodring Wright, as well as cancer cell biology and models of cancer cell phenotypes under the co-mentorship of Dr. Jerry Shay. This training and guidance will compliment my previous training in gene expression, muscle biology, and cell signaling. The scientific environment at UT Southwestern Medical Center is extremely stimulating and will provide me with the facilities necessary for the completion of the mentored phase of this project and will prepare me to transition smoothly into the independent faculty phase. hTERT expression is developmentally regulated and has several splice variants. Only full-length hTERT mRNA produces catalytically active telomerase. Upon differentiation into mature tissue telomerase activity is down-regulated and only non-catalytically active hTERT splice variants remain. However, upon transformation to cancer, the majority of cancer types express full-length hTERT and have functional telomerase activity that helps to maintain the already very short telomeres in precancerous lesions. The transcriptional activation of hTERT has been widely studied, but the regulation of hTERT alternative splicing is almost entirely unknown. In Aim 1, during the K99 phase, I will define the role of NOVA1 that I identified in two different RNAi screens, in the regulation of hTERT splicing, telomere length, and telomerase activity. I will determine if NOVA1 binds hTERT pre-mRNA directly (CLIP) or in a protein complex (RIP). I will also define the role of NOVA1 in cancer cell alternative splicing by RNA sequencing. In Aim 2, during the K99 phase, I will use two xenograft models of tumor progression to determine if reduced levels of NOVA1 result in less metastases and tumor progression via inhibition of telomerase. During the R00 phase, Aim 3, I will characterize the regulation of NOVA1's 3'UTR in cancer cells and the potential of using a NOVA1 3'UTR reporter for small molecule screening to find a novel telomerase inhibitor. I will also continue to decipher the hTERT splicing code I discovered during my mentored phase with the goal of finding novel means to inhibit telomerase in cancer. These studies should lead to a robust research program into how alternative spicing participates and regulates telomere length maintenance mechanisms in cancer cells."

"9397922","Lung cancer remains the most common cause of death from cancer in the US and there is a high need for improved therapeutic interventions. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) which accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases, has a poor 5 year survival rate of only 16.8%. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a major target for the treatment of (NSCLC), but only a subset of patients, those who have EGFR mutations, benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib and afatinib (FDA approved drugs). Intrinsic lack of response to erlotinib in wild-type (WT) EGFR and development of acquired resistance in mutant EGFR NSCLC could be driven by a transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state, induction of a stem-cell phenotype, and other STAT3-dependent mechanisms. Critical to the development of intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, is the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 is persistently activated in 22% - 65% of NSCLC and overexpression of STAT3 is associated with poor prognosis, making it an attractive target to overcome EGFR TKIs for NSCLC therapy. STAT3 inhibitors that target STAT3 activation (by inhibiting phosphorylation) are clinically limited because they lack the ability to effectively block STAT3 dimerization and nuclear translocation. To address this problem in AIM 1, we are currently testing the ability of a novel STAT3 inhibitor (cyclic STAT3 decoy ? CS3D) and have generated preliminary evidence that CS3D produces anti-tumor effects in NSCLC independent of EGFR mutation status. CS3D acts as a STAT3 ?decoy? by mimicking the DNA consensus sequence in the promoter region of STAT3- responsive genes, causing the binding of STAT3 dimers and preventing their nuclear translocation and the transcriptional regulation of pro-survival genes. Molecular and genetic in vitro approaches will be used to demonstrate CS3D specificity for STAT3 compared to an inactive mutant control (CS3M). To further validate the anti-tumor effects of CS3D in AIM 1, we will utilize a variety of in vivo models (xenograft, orthotopic, and immune-competent) to confirm the therapeutic effects of CS3D as compared to CS3M. Assessment of biomarkers of CS3D sensitivity in WT and mutant EGFR NSCLC will provide predictive markers to identify patients that would benefit from this therapeutic approach. In AIM 2, we also predict that CS3D combined with afatinib, (an EGFR/HER2 irreversible TKI) will produce a superior anti-tumor effect compared to single agents. We will further test the ability of CS3D to re-sensitize afatinib-resistant cells to EGFR inhibition by reversing the EMT and stem-cell phenotype. Biomarkers of drug sensitivity will also be assessed in AIM 2. The rationale for this proposal is both to utilize a more effective approach to target STAT3 and to demonstrate the general principle that combination treatment has greater therapeutic benefit than single therapy for NSCLC."
"9353889","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Therapeutic modulation of immune checkpoints has emerged as a transformative new paradigm in the treatment of cancer. This development has triggered immense interest in targeting new co-regulatory pathways to amplify the early success of immunotherapy. A major challenge in this endeavor is the widespread pleiotropy characteristic to immune signaling pathways. Due to the promiscuity of their ligand:receptor interactions, co-regulatory proteins can produce multiple, often contradictory activities. This poses difficulty in developing agents that can isolate specific pathway functions and obscures a precise understanding of the physiology of individual receptor:ligand pairs. The LIGHT/HVEM/LT?R signaling network is a key exemplar of this challenge. LIGHT is an immune co-stimulator that plays a crucial role in the activation and expansion of T cells. It signals through both the Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT?R), and it is antagonized by decoy receptor 3 (DcR3). However, each of these receptors binds additional ligands besides LIGHT, resulting in a complicated and interconnected signaling network. Here, we propose to leverage our expertise in structure-guided protein engineering to develop and characterize LIGHT variants that can uncouple the disparate activities of the LIGHT/HVEM/LT?R pathway. We will knock-in these ?biased? alleles into transgenic mice to study individual pathway interactions in vivo and in parallel, we will assess the therapeutic potential of biasing LIGHT activity in models of immunotherapy. In sum, this proposal will provide insight into a pivotal immunoregulatory pathway, candidate molecules for therapeutic development, and new approaches for targeting pleiotropic checkpoint receptors.  "
"9326331","PROJECT 1: SUMMARY Nearly half of Americans between 40-75 yr are eligible for statin treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) according to new AHA/ACC guidelines for cholesterol management. However, a high proportion of statin-treated patients remain at risk for CVD, and there is significant potential for adverse effects of treatment, most notably myopathy and new onset diabetes. Currently, there is limited information regarding the basis for these varying outcomes and very few genetic or other biomarkers for their prediction. Thus, there is need for the development of precision medicine standards for statin therapy. Using transcriptomic analysis of in vitro simvastatin or sham exposed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from participants in a statin clinical trial, we previously identified a number of novel genes implicated in modulating the lipid metabolic effects of statin treatment. Supporting evidence for the biologic and clinical roles of these genes was obtained by in vitro knock-down and overexpression studies as well as by identification of SNPs associated with both candidate gene expression (eQTLs) and in vivo statin lipid-lowering response. The overall objective of the present project is to utilize this general approach to identify novel biomarkers and/or determinants of statin clinical outcomes, namely efficacy for CVD prevention, and risk of statin-induced myopathy and type 2 diabetes. In Aim 1 we will utilize the POST Clinical Core at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) to obtain LCLs from statin treated patients with: 1) a major adverse coronary event (MACE); 2) statin-induced myopathy; or 3) new onset type 2 diabetes; as well as matched controls for each outcome. The LCLs will be exposed to simvastatin vs. sham and transcriptomic and metabolomic measurements will be used to identify novel cellular biomarkers for statin efficacy and adverse effects. In Aim 2, in collaboration with Project 3 and the Informatics Core, DNA variants associated with these biomarkers will be identified and tested for association with MACE and statin adverse effects using genotype data from a very large KPNC cohort in which genome-wide genotype data are available. Finally, in Aim 3, novel genes associated with statin response identified within this Project or throughout the Center will be functionally validated using hypothesis-driven studies employing knock-down and overexpression in appropriate cell models. Overall, we anticipate that the completion of these aims will lead to identification and validation of new biomarkers (transcripts, metabolites, and/or SNPs) predictive of statin treatment outcomes that can add value in developing future therapeutic guidelines. Moreover, by expanding our knowledge of the underlying molecular determinants of variation in statin response, the systems approach employed in this project and throughout the POST Center could lead to development of new therapeutic approaches for augmenting statin's benefits and/or reducing its risks. "

"9326332","PROJECT 2: SUMMARY   Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the western world, used to treat elevated cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. While statins are highly effective and generally safe, adverse effects occur in a small proportion of users, which represents a large number of individuals due to statins' widespread use. In some individuals, statins adversely affect muscle, with symptoms ranging from mild pain to rhabdomyolysis. Recent studies have also shown a 9-12% increase in risk for type 2 diabetes among statin users. We hypothesize that many of the genetic variants and molecular mechanisms that influence statin-related myopathy and new-onset diabetes remain to be identified. In preliminary work, we have established that the mouse is a feasible model in which to identify genetic variation in statin-related muscle toxicity and dysglycemia, and it offers superior features for genetic and molecular analysis. In this Project, we will utilize a novel mouse genetics resource, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), which consists of ~110 inbred mouse stains. We will use the HMDP to identify genes (Aim 1) and mechanisms (Aim 2) underlying statin-associated myotoxicity and diabetes. In Aim 3 we will perform in vivo studies in the mouse to validate selected genes identified in human studies in other projects within this Center. Innovative features of our approach include the ability to perform genetic association to high resolution in the HMDP, often to loci containing just a handful of genes. Additionally, our studies will include full HMDP sets of males and females, providing the opportunity to identify sex-specific statin effects. Our preliminary studies have identified effects of statins on protein kinase D signaling and autophagy in myocytes and beta cells, and we will elucidate these further at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. These studies, together with the translation of human genetic variants to in vivo mouse models, will inform us about potential genetic and molecular markers that may be valuable for the evaluation of individual benefit versus risk of statin drug treatment."

"9338301","Project Summary/Abstract The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among minority children, in particular children of African descent. African American (AA) children are four times more likely to be hospitalized and seven times more likely to die from asthma than non-AAs. Recent studies have identified genetic and environmental exposure factors that contribute to asthma risk; however, the extent to which these factors interact to explain a person?s risk to asthma remains largely unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic causes of asthma among AA children, and establish the utility of this information to reduce and predict asthma risk in children. The objective of this study is to investigate the interactions between genetic ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors contributing to asthma risk in AA children using a well characterized cohort with banked DNA samples, environmental exposure and clinical data as well as ancestry informative markers. We hypothesize that genetic variants with large allele frequency differences and variation in environmental exposures between African and European ancestry may be partly responsible for the current difference in asthma risk in African American admixed ancestry. Moreover, ancestry and environmental exposure may jointly influence the variation and development of asthma. Two Specific Aims are proposed to test our hypothesis and achieve our proposed plan: Aim 1) Determine local and global genetic ancestry in AA asthmatic children using ancestry informative markers (AIMs); and Aim 2) Identify interactions between local ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors. The proposed study is highly significant (it addresses a major public health issue given the high burden of asthma among minority children) and highly innovative (it dissects the genetic and non- genetic causes of asthma disparities using ancestry mapping). Ultimately, this research may provide the link and insight between asthma and genetic and non-genetic factors and has potential avenues for intervention. Success in this R03 application will provide key knowledge and data to apply for fundable R01 grant application related to racial disparities in childhood asthma. We therefore believe that this pilot study along with future studies will uncover fundamental information about whether genetic factors and selected environmental exposure factors as well as their interactions can affect asthma risk and prediction, thereby reducing the burden of asthma on patients and their families and improving their quality of life. 1"
"9397971","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we will assess the impact of different sedative agents on the incidence of healthcare-associated infections and other complications of critical care in mechanically ventilated patients. This work has the potential to highlight a novel risk factor for healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and poor clinical outcomes, and may set the foundation for a prospective study of sedative management as a new strategy to reduce these infections. This study is critically important because 1) healthcare-associated infections continue to harm patients throughout American hospitals - especially intensive care patients - despite ample evidence and clear guidelines on how to prevent infections, and 2) there is sparse literature on the effect of sedative agents on infection risk, despite a rational clinical-biologicl basis for this relationship and suggestive data. Our first aim is to determine the relationship between different sedative agents and the relative rates of healthcare- associated infection in a mechanically ventilated patient population. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine will carry a reduced risk of infection compared to propofol and benzodiazepines. We will perform a matched case-control study to evaluate this hypothesis. We will obtain clinical data from a comprehensive electronic health record search of 150 hospitals in the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) network, as well as a manual chart review of HAI cases for data points not available electronically. Our analysis plan will be based on conditional logistic regression, including patients who are exposed to multiple agents simultaneously, with careful adjustment for potential confounders. Our second aim is to determine the effect of sedative choice and management on objective clinical outcomes in a mechanically ventilated population, including the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, and mortalit. It is known that non-benzodiazepine sedatives are optimal for reducing these outcomes compared to benzodiazepines, however it is not clear whether certain non-benzodiazepine agents of different mechanisms may have superior rates of these adverse events than others. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine will reduce the morbidity and mortality of ventilated patients. We will perform a cohort study of patients based on sedative exposures, using an electronic query of HCA's clinical database for data collection. Analysis will include Cox proportional hazard regressions models with time-varying covariates to identify associations between exposures and outcomes."
"9395644","PROJECT SUMMARY Recognition of cell-surface carbohydrates by lectins plays an essential role in biological processes ranging from fertilization and cell signaling to pathogen clearance and immune response. Human intelectins (hIntL-1 and hIntL-2) are a relatively uncharacterized class of lectins that are secreted at mucosal barriers and are implicated in various disease states such as Crohn?s Disease, asthma, and diabetes. Previous work from the Kiessling group has indicated that hIntL-1 specifically recognizes microbial glycans via binding to an exocyclic 1,2-diol motif; however the full binding profiles of hIntL-1 and hIntL-2 have not been investigated. Additionally, the difficulty of capturing intelectin ligands directly from cells makes understanding the correlation between saccharide-binding affinity and cell-binding activity challenging. We hypothesize that the affinities of intelectins for specific chemical epitopes significantly influences their differential cell recognition and are thus associated with their physiological roles. We will test this hypothesis by identifying and characterizing the ligand binding profiles of hIntL-1 and hIntL-2, and by generating new tools for the capture of endogenous intelectin ligands. In Aim 1, I will employ chemical synthesis and biochemical assays to determine and compare binding affinities of hIntL-1 with mono- and oligosaccharide ligands. I will use this data to elucidate structural characteristics that contribute to intelectin binding and specificity, including stereochemistry, substituents, and position within the glycan. In Aim 2, I will design and synthesize bifunctional boronic acids that will act as glycan capture agents through conjugation to hIntL-1 and its endogenous carbohydrate binding partners. These molecules will stabilize the carbohydrate-protein complexes and enable detection and isolation of cellular hIntL-1 ligands. In Aim 3, I will identify and characterize the mucin-binding properties of hIntL-2 through the synthesis of polymeric mucin mimics. By varying the sugar epitopes on the mucin-like polymers, we will be able to glean information about the function of hIntL-2. Together, these studies will deliver key foundational recognition data that will aid in the discovery of the physiological role of intelectins. More broadly, we expect that the ligand-binding information revealed through the proposed work will guide future research into the development of probes and therapies for disease states that are affected by intelectin expression."
"9455192","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhanced glycolysis and suppression of mitochondrial metabolism are features of the Warburg phenomenon in hepatocarcinoma and other cancers. Metabolites enter and exit mitochondria through one channel in the outer membrane: the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that high free tubulin in cancer cells blocks VDAC and suppresses oxidative phosphorylation in Warburg metabolism and that reversal of tubulin inhibition of VDAC has an anti-Warburg effect that enhances oxidative phosphorylation and decreases glycolysis. Based on exciting new preliminary data, we further hypothesize that VDAC-tubulin antagonists, including erastin, reverse tubulin- dependent VDAC inhibition with consequent mitochondrial hyperpolarization, increased ROS generation and cell death. Accordingly in Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the effects of erastin and other VDAC-tubulin antagonists on cellular bioenergetics (ATP, ADP, AMP, Pi, NADH redox state, phospho-AMP kinase, and rates of respiration and glycolysis) in human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2, Huh7 and FOCUS). We will also assess in a Huh7 mouse xenograft model the effect of erastin/VDAC-tubulin antagonists on mitochondrial membrane potential (??) and the glycolytic phenotype. Erastin-like compounds that emerged from high throughput screening will be confirmed by electrophysiology as VDAC-tubulin antagonists, further evaluated for effects on cellular bioenergetics and used to create a pharmacophore. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine if protein kinase A (PKA) agonists and PKA inhibitors alter the bioenergetics of Huh7, FOCUS and HepG2 cells in the presence and absence of erastin/VDAC- tubulin antagonists and in VDAC isoform double knockdown cells. We will also assess the effects of PKA overexpression/silencing on cellular bioenergetics. Additionally, proteomic analysis will determine specific sites of VDAC isoform phosphorylation. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine mechanisms of erastin-induced ROS formation that leads to cell death. We expect that erastin and other VDAC-tubulin antagonists will increase mitochondrial metabolism, ?? and ROS formation, leading to the mitochondrial permeability transition and mitochondrial bioenergetic failure, culminating in cell death. Ultimately, we expect that antagonizing VDAC- tubulin interaction will suppress tumor growth in vivo. Overall, the project will generate fundamental new knowledge on mechanisms underlying suppression of mitochondrial metabolism in hepatocarcinoma cells and identify new agents that block VDAC-tubulin interaction to revert the pro-proliferative Warburg metabolic phenotype and selectively promote cytotoxic oxidative stress."
"9394235","ABSTRACT Alcohol (ALC) use disorder (AUD) is an unrelenting public health concern. Several medications have been approved for treating AUD, but these pharmacotherapies are not widely used, nor are they universally effective or appropriate to use in all AUD patients due to contraindications. To address the continued need to improve AUD treatment, identifying novel AUD pharmacotherapies is a high NIAAA priority. Preclinical studies show that chronic or binge-like ALC administration decreases extracellular glutamate levels, which are then increased during ALC withdrawal. These elevated glutamate levels observed during ALC withdrawal can be reduced with further ALC administration, driving a cycle of heavy ALC use and withdrawal periods that characterize AUD. The changes in glutamate homeostasis that occur during the cycle of chronic ALC intoxication and withdrawal have been attributed to altered glutamate transport (e.g., changes in cystine- glutamate exchanger [xCT] and glial glutamate transporter [GLT-1] expression and function). Normalization of extracellular glutamate levels (i.e., restoration of glutamate homeostasis) through administration of compounds like n-acetylcysteine (NAC), which increase expression of the xCT and GLT-1 following drug exposure, attenuates maladaptive brain changes produced by ALC, as well as ALC self-administration and behavioral sensitization in preclinical models. Preclinical data provide a strong scientific premise for the hypothesis that restoration of glutamate homeostasis is a promising pharmacotherapeutic approach for AUD, yet this research area remains unexamined in prospective clinical studies. The overarching goal of this application is to demonstrate that restoration of glutamate homeostasis with NAC is a viable strategy for treating AUD. This goal will be achieved through the conduct of a rigorous within-subject, placebo-controlled study that has been modeled from previous successfully reverse-engineered human laboratory approaches. This research will demonstrate the initial efficacy, safety and tolerability of NAC for treating AUD. This work will directly translate findings from preclinical research and provide basic science information about the glutamatergic mechanisms underlying the pharmacodynamic effects of ALC in humans. The proposed research will also expand the scope of current AUD treatment research by focusing on glutamate homeostasis, which has strong preclinical evidence supporting its critical role in AUD but remains unstudied in clinical research."
"9508318","The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery is a set of interacting protein complexes responsible for cargo selection and biogenesis of intralumenal vesicles inside endosomal multivesicular bodies, also known as late endosomes. Evolutionary conservation and the discovery that ESCRTs are required for topologically equivalent processes including viral budding, cytokinetic abscission, and nuclear envelope closure led to the now widely accepted concept that ESCRTs are uniquely involved in membrane fission for reactions that share this topology. ESCRT-III proteins act by changing conformation and polymerizing into membrane-remodeling filaments that spiral on the inside ? negatively curved ? surface of membrane tubules, ultimately pulling the tubules closed to drive membrane fission and release. Intriguingly, there are twelve ESCRT-III proteins in humans that are not functionally interchangeable. Beyond identification of different molecular binding partners, there has been little structural distinction among these proteins to explain their unique physiological importance. We recently made the surprising discovery that two human ESCRT-III proteins ? CHMP1B and IST1 ? assemble into filaments that spiral around the outside ? positively curved ? surface of membrane tubules, forming external coats in vitro and in vivo. This unexpected preference for positively curved membrane tubules challenges the dogma that the membrane deforming and fission activity associated with ESCRT-III filaments is limited to a single topology and prompts us to reconsider established paradigms for ESCRT-III function. This project will (1) define the topology preference of particular ESCRT-III homo- and heteropolymers polymers and the corresponding distribution of endogenous ESCRT-III proteins across the endosomal system, (2) establish the role(s) of representative ESCRT-III proteins in distinct endosomal cargo trafficking pathways, and (3) compare the effects of depleting different ESCRT-III proteins on endosomal and lysosomal morphology. This work will expand our understanding of the ESCRT-III membrane remodeling system with significant implications for future studies of trafficking and organization within the endolysosomal system."

"9554671","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          The goal is to conduct innovative, multidisciplinary research to identify the major sources of As and Hg exposure and to elucidate the protracted effects of early life exposure to As and Hg on human health. The ATSDR has identified As and Hg as the number one and number three environmental chemicals of concern with regard to human health. As exposure in the young increases the rates of diabetes, respiratory disease, and reproductive and developmental disorders. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a major contaminant in the food supply, particularly fish. For fetuses, infants, and children, exposure to MeHg has severe, adverse effects on the developing nervous system and interferes with cognitive thinking and memory. Despite growing concern and increasing research focus on As and Hg, there are significant knowledge gaps, especially with regard to very low levels of exposure in the US.  Accordingly, the Dartmouth SRP is dedicated to obtaining new information on the effects of exposure to very low levels of As and Hg and thereby provide a foundation for science-based risk assessment leading to more informed, effective and comprehensive public health policies.  The specific aims are to: (1) Elucidate how As is taken up and accumulated in rice and to use this information to identify new rice cultivars that assimilate lower amounts of arsenic; (2) Elucidate how MeHg accumulates in fish and how environmental changes in temperature, salinity, and carbon content influences MeHg in marine ecosystems; (3) Identify the dose dependent and relative effects of inorganic and organic As on the innate immune response of the lung to bacterial infections; and (4) Understand the effects of maternal and fetal As exposure on the development of metabolic syndrome and inflammation in mothers and newborns, the most at risk in our population. The research will be supported by a Training Core, a Trace Elements Analysis Core, and the Research Translation and Community Engagement Cores that will communicate our research findings to our stakeholders and communities, respectively."

"9529867","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The tremendous regenerative capacity of the intestine, with epithelial turnover every 5-7 days, is mediated by the carefully orchestrated activity of intestinal stem cells (ISC). The recent identification of molecular markers for ISCs, combined with in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro primary organoid culture methodologies has revolutionized ISC biology. The resultant wealth of findings have showcased ISCs as a robust general paradigm for stem cell behavior and have elicited a next generation of studies exploring the ISC niche, interrelationships and interconversion of actively cycling versus quiescent ISC populations, and translational applications of ISC transplantation. Accordingly, the current application is a continuation of our prior 5 year project for the NIDDK Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium (ISCC), and is responsive to RFA-DK-13-012, Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium Research Projects (U01), seeking to define conditions controlling proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells, determine the developmental lineage of characterized populations of stem cells in the small intestine and methods for expanding and grafting stem cells back into the intestine. Here, we build upon our preliminary data from the prior cycle with novel reagents and methodologies. Aim 1 explores R-spondins as regulators of Lgr5+ ISC symmetric cell division combining adenovirus-mediated gain- and loss-of-function approaches with in vivo lineage tracing, and pursuing mechanistic and niche localization studies. In Aim 2, interrelationships between diverse cycling and quiescent ISC populations will be investigated by RNA-Seq, and novel lineage relationships of Bmi1+ ISC will be explored. Aims 3 and 4 explore translational aspects of ISC biology, with Aim 3 utilizing organoid culture to evaluating the effects of R- spondins on colon cancer stem cells, and Aim 4 attempting the phenotypic correction of a Mendelian intestinal epithelial defect by ISC transplantation. Overall, these studies describe an integrated approach to ISC biology and translation that is highly responsive to RFA-DK-13-012, Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium Research Projects (U01), with implications for stem cell biology, and intestinal disease pathogenesis and therapy."
"9262695","ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) has been very recently implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, however the actual impact of the presence of ZIKV in the fetus on neural development, including microcephaly, is poorly understood. While ongoing epidemiology will likely strengthen pregnancy outcome associations with ZIKV and possibly reveal the dynamics of maternal infection that influence pregnancy outcome, direct interrogation of factors that drive fetal outcomes will not be possible in human clinical settings. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to gain insight into these pathophysiological processes in fetal infection with ZIKV. Our overall goal is to establish a fetal ZIKV infection model by amniotic fluid delivery to study its effects on fetal growth and CNS development. By directly infecting the fetus with the virus, we will bypass the potential bottleneck of transplacental transmission, which may be a rate-limiting step in studying fetal outcomes, since in most circumstances the placenta prevents, and does not facilitate, transmission of pathogens to the fetus. Thus, direct introduction of the virus into the amniotic fluid will be a more efficient approach for defining pathological events directly in the fetal compartment. We propose two Specific Aims to address our goal. Specific Aim 1. To determine whether the macaque fetus is sensitive to ZIKV infection, we will bypass the potential placental barrier and directly inoculate the amniotic fluid, monitoring fetal well-being and development with virological, immunological, ultrasound and MRI analyses. Specific Aim 2. To define the ontogeny and tissue tropism of fetal infection, we will sequentially collect fetal tissues following intrauterine infection to map viral tropism and fetal pathogenesis, focusing on comprehensive fetal histopathology. The development and validation of this model will establish a rapid screen for the impact of fetal infection on the central nervous system as well as overall fetal development. Direct validation of the nonhuman primate model to study fetal neuropathology, growth restriction, and possibly fetal demise will be an incredibly valuable step forward in building the nonhuman primate platform to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the severe neuropathology seen in the outbreak in Brazil. A predictable fetal outcome will allow selective titration of the dose-related neurological impact as judged by histopathology, so that the model will also reveal more subtle neurobehavioral insults than microcephaly, likely to be an extreme outcome."

This UH2/UH3 project is to test the hypothesis that salivary extracellular RNA (exRNA) can be developed for the clinical detection of human diseases. Our laboratory first reported the existence of a transcriptome and microRNA profile in cell free saliva followed by its scientific characterizations and clinical utilities including biomarker development for molecular oncology applications. Most recently we have performed RNA-sequencing in cell free saliva and reported three major types of RNA in saliva (mRNA, miRNA and snoRNA). This UH2/UH3 application is to test the hypothesis that salivary exRNA can be developed to detect gastric cancer by performing a biomarker development study to definitively validate salivary exRNA biomarkers for the detection of gastric cancer. We are selecting gastric cancer to be the human disease indication because of an ongoing productive collaboration with the Samsung Medical Center where we have already procured saliva from 500 gastric cancer patients and 2250 non-gastric cancer controls. This will permit the UH2 phase for exRNA biomarker discovery to begin immediately. Additional clinical samples will be procured in the UH3 phase, 375 cases and 375 non-gastric cancer match controls each year for two years. These clinical samples for discovery and validation will allow us to definitively validate if salivary exRNA can be used to detect gastrc cancer in a defined clinical setting (Context of Use).  There are four Specific Aims in the UH2 phase of the project. Aim 1 is to randomly select saliva from 100 gastric cancer and 100 non-gastric cancer controls to be used in Aim 2 which is to perform comprehensive RNA-sequencing to comprehensively profile salivary exRNA to the nucleotide level. Aim 3 is to perform data and statistical analysis of the profiled salivary mRNA, miRNA, and snoRNA to select the top 20 salivary ex- mRNA, ex-miRNA and ex-snoRNA. Aim 4 is to verify the candidate exRNA biomarkers in the original discovery cohort. Only verified candidate salivary exRNA will be advanced to the UH3 phase.  In the UH3 phase, Aim 5 is to enroll and procure saliva from an additional 750 gastric cancer patients and 750 non-gastric cancer controls. Aim 6 will use 500 of the gastric cancer saliva and 500 matched control subjects from Aim 4 to individually validate the verified candidate salivary exRNA biomarkers and configure a panel of validate exRNA biomarkers with highest performance using logistic regression analysis. The panel will be validated in Aim 7 using saliva from an independent cohort of 250 gastric cancer and 250 non-gastric cancer controls.  The goals of this UH2/UH3 application are to demonstrate the clinical utility of salivary exRNA by the discovering and definitively validating salivary exRNA biomarkers for the detection of a human disease condition."

The goal of the program is to provide strong, integrated training in the cognitive and social psychology of aging, within a life- span developmental perspective. The training program, however, is designed to go beyond a simple focus on cognitive or social aging. Rather, our program is predicated on a belief in the critical need for graduate and postdoctoral training that emphasizes the intersection of cognitive and socioemotional factors, and the increasingly recognized importance of stress reactivity and stress regulation to health and cognition in adulthood and later life.  Predoctoral trainees will be admitted through either the existing graduate programs in Social and Developmental Psychology or in Cognitive Neuroscience. Predoctoral students' progress and performance will be biannually evaluated by the procedures of the program in which they are enrolled, and by the training program core faculty. Postdoctoral trainees will have free access to all courses offered in the university and will work closely with a primary plus a secondary preceptor to foster the integration of cognitive, social, and health perspectives in their training. Training will be carried out in the laboratories housed in the Psychology Department and Volen National Center for Complex Systems at Brandeis University. In addition to the core faculty's focus on socioemotional, cognitive aging and health processes, considerable expertise also exists within the department and the Volen Center in social and developmental psychology, statistics, research methods, computational modeling, neuropsychology and cognitive science.

"9356820","PROJECT SUMMARY Mucus obstruction of airways is a significant pathologic feature of CF lung disease. Available therapies are only partially effective at relieving this obstruction, and additional treatments are needed. Gel-forming mucin molecules are a major constituent of CF mucus and to a large degree determines its bio-rheological properties. The development of inhaled agents that target mucin molecules and improve the transportability of airway mucus is a rational and attractive therapeutic goal. In this Project, we propose to first test the safety of a novel inhaled mucolytic in CF subjects in a single ascending dose study. We will then evaluate the ability of this agent to improve mucus clearance and reduce airways obstruction during two weeks of use, in a placebo controlled cross-over study in CF. Relevant, novel outcome measures will be utilized to evaluate drug effects on mucus clearance (gamma scintigraphy) and airways obstruction (19F-MRI with 1H-MRI/UTE), in addition to traditional clinical trial endpoints. The combination of these functional and structural modalities should greatly enhance our understanding of drug effects on this heterogeneous lung disease."
"9340197","PROJECT SUMMARY  The NEI Audacious Goals Initiative is a bold effort to ?to restore vision through regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system.? One of the major roadblocks in mammalian photoreceptor transplantation experiments has been, and continues to be, the low efficiency of integration and synapse formation following transplantation of photoreceptor populations. In order to address this roadblock, and in response to RFA-EY-15-002 (which is directed at ?discovery-based approaches to identify unknown factors critical to the regeneration of neurons, guiding their axons to targets, and making new functional connections?), we propose to combine state-of-the-art stem cell methodologies with high content screening approaches to identify novel small molecules and molecular pathways that promote human photoreceptor axonal outgrowth and synapse formation. To accomplish this ambitious goal, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of investigators who have years of experience in human retinal stem cell biology, retinal cell and molecular biology, high content screening (HCS) assay development and drug screening, axonal guidance, synaptic biology, and microfluidics.  Members of the research team have already carried out screens that have successfully identified molecules that promote neurite outgrowth of murine retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and other retinal neurons, and that increase synapse formation in cultures of human stem cell-derived neurons. For this project, we propose to extend this prior work and develop robust and reproducible in vitro neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis assays using photoreceptors (PRs) obtained from human pluripotent stem cell (hPSCs) derived 3-dimensional optic vesicle-like structures, and then to use these assays to identify and characterize biologically and clinically relevant molecules. More specifically, SA1 will focus on the development and execution of a two-tiered in vitro screen designed to identify molecules that influence hPSC-PRs axon outgrowth and/or guidance; SA2 will focus on a screen to identify molecules that enhance hPSC-PR synaptic marker expression; and SA3 will focus on the development of assays to confirm functional PR synapse formation in culture. Successful completion of these aims and milestones will yield the first in vitro human assay system designed to rapidly screen and rigorously test molecules for their ability to promote hPSC-PR connectivity. This platform should not only accelerate efforts to achieve functional PR replacement in patients, but could also serve as a valuable human preclinical model system."
"9383704","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how organisms as diverse as humans and the fruit flies use the same molecules to determine how large their organs will grow. The specific focus of this application is a protein that promotes growth called Yorkie. In our cells it is called Yap1, however it performs the same job in both species. When Yorkie/Yap1 is `active' in cells, it tells the cells to grow and divide, and thus generates many new cells. This makes tissues larger since they have more cells, but it can also lead to the growth of a cancerous tumor. We know a bit about how Yorkie/Yap1 become `active' but not enough to reliably predict when and where this happens, or how it promotes cancer when it becomes `active' all the time.  We have found another protein that physically binds to Yorkie called Taiman, and we think Taiman may be key to understanding when and where Yorkie gets activated. Taiman itself has to get `activated', but in this case we know more about this happens. Taiman gets `activated' by the fly equivalent of the human sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. We think that when these hormones `activate' Taiman that they also activate Yorkie, and that this is an important way receive signals to grow and divide.  The experiments we propose will address this hypothesis in a number of ways. We will test our idea that some cells can make their own fly `sex hormone' (called ecdysone), and that how much ecdysone they make controls when and where Taiman and Yorkie get activated in adolescent flies. This kind of patterned `activation' of Yorkie/Yap1 may be part of why we grow organs & appendages in the right places each time an embryo develops into a newborn baby, and by extension how inappropriate `actvation' of Yorkie/Yap1 at the wrong place and time can drive disease. We will also test another idea that cells with `activated' Yorkie and Taiman actually think they are part of a healing wound and start the process of regeneration to fill in the missing cells and tissue. Although we use flies to study these ideas, we remain confident that much of what we learn will teach us about how all of the proteins work in our cells."
"9343075","Familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (f-FTLD) represents a critical group to target for clinical trials in FTLD. F-FTLD accounts for 30 to 50% of all FTLD. Three mutations account for the majority of known mutations that cause f-FTLD. Mutations in the tau gene (MAPT) lead to FTLD-tau pathology, and mutations in the progranulin (GRN) or chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C90RF72 ) genes both lead to TDP-43 proteinopathy. Because each mutation is highly predictive of the underlying proteinopathy, clinical trials of new therapies directed at these specific biochemical targets would be guaranteed a homogeneous population if they focused on f-FTLD. In addition, f-FTLD is the only context in which patients affected by FTLD can be identified in the presymptomatic and early symptomatic stages, which are becomign increasingly important in models of treatment for neurodegenerative disease. However, little is known about the natural history of presymptomatic f-FTLD. The proposed study will quantify rates of clinical decline in both symptomatic and presymptomatic f-FTLD and examine rates of brain MR imaging changes in presymptomatic individuals. We will enroll 455 asymptomatic individuals age 30 or older from families with a known FTLD-causative mutation and anticipate that approximately half will be mutation carriers, as well as 455 symptomatic individuals. Clinical assessments including cognitive testing and functional evaluations will be performed at baseline and one year in all participants. In asymtomatic patients, we will obtain T1-MR1 (and additional imaging sequences) at baseline and one year. The Aims for the project are: 1. To establish the magnitude and variance across subjects of clinical decline over one year in symptomatic (CDR>=0.5) f- FTLD due to known mutations, 2. To examine the relationship between medical comorbidities, lifestyle factors and natural history in f-FTLD, and 3. To establish the magnitude and variance across subjects of changes in imaging and clinical measures in presymptomatic (CDR=0) f-FTLD. Accomplishment of these Aims will provide much needed data for planning clinical trials in f-FTLD."

"9543066","SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and the alarming rise in fetal brain malformations highlight ZIKV as an urgent public health concern. ZIKV has recently met Shephard's criteria for teratogenic classification because of the brain anomalies reported. This application addresses the direct relationship between ZIKV infection and fetal brain development using our established fetal primate model of intrauterine pathogenesis. The studies outlined in this application leverage our prior discoveries and collaborative investigations on neural precursor cell function in relation to microglia in the fetal primate brain, and our expertise in primate development, imaging, virology, and immunology. Our track record and experienced team provides the means to pursue the goals of this proposal?understanding the mechanism(s) of ZIKV teratogenesis?and the steps necessary to progress to studies focused on interventions. Our goal is to determine how ZIKV alters cortical development by capitalizing on our team's essential expertise and research experiences to address this urgent public health concern rapidly and effectively through the following Specific Aims: (1) Define the impact of fetal ZIKV on neural precursor cells and cortical development, and (2) Determine the impact of fetal ZIKV infection on fetal and maternal inflammation and assess if inflammation is predictive of abnormalities in cortical development. These studies will provide new insights into the underpinnings of ZIKV teratogenesis in a primate model with similar neurodevelopmental features when compared to humans, and by efficiently leveraging an existing primate model of fetal viral infection. Overall, these investigations focus on fetal developmental outcomes associated with direct ZIKV infection and will provide the necessary mechanistic understanding and outcome metrics to assess intervention strategies that protect the fetus and newborn from the devastating consequences of ZIKV infection and congenital disease."
"9335871","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness throughout the world and the second leading cause of blindness overall in the USA. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and aging are the most important risk factors for most forms of glaucoma. IOP level is highly dependent on the rate at which the aqueous humor is filtered through the conventional outflow pathway including the trabecular meshwork (TM). Reduced cellularity within the TM and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover occur in glaucomatous conditions and correlate with increased outflow resistance and elevated IOP. The goal of this project is to define the mechanisms of stem cell homing and engrafting to the TM tissue, stimulating regeneration of the TM tissue, and hence restoring outflow facility and reducing IOP. In advance of this project, we have already isolated and characterized trabecular meshwork stem cells (TMSCs) from human and mouse TM tissues. These stem cells are multipotent with the abilities to differentiate into phagocytic TM cells and to home to the normal mouse TM tissue after intracameral injection. They can home and engraft to the TM region damaged by laser photocoagulation. This project is designed to test specific hypotheses about the mechanisms of TMSC homing and engrafting as well as remodeling pathological ECM of the TM for TM regeneration. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that TMSCs home and engraft to the TM tissue via specific chemokines. We will test the role of CXCR4/CXCL12 axis by knockdown or overexpression of these genes in TMSCs and TM cells. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that engrafted exogenous TMSCs can reconstruct the trabecular meshwork ECM and thus improve aqueous outflow to reduce IOP. We will test the ability of TMSCs to degrade abnormal collagens and to secrete organized ECM in vitro and in vivo. The scientific impact of this study will be the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of regeneration potential of the TM by stem cells. The results may also directly lead to the design of stem cell-based therapy or adjunctive treatments that prevent blindness from glaucoma."
"9274794","Project Summary/Abstract  Proteomics research at the University of Kansas (KU) is limited by antiquated mass spectrometry instrumentation. This proposal requests $600,000 to acquire a new state-of-the-art Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (1) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1200 chromatographic system for proteomics operations within the KU Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (MSL). The mass spectrometer combines a prefilter, a high performance quadrupole, and an ultra-high field Orbitrap analyzer. The primary rational for the requested instrument is that its analytical performance will enhance the research of NIH-funded scientists from six department at KU: Molecular Biosciences, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medicinal chemistry, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Ecology, and Evolutionally Biology. Additionally, as proteomics service of the KU MSL have expanded beyond the KU Campus, the requested instrument will impact the biological and health-related research of investigators at neighboring institutions such as Kansas State University (KSU), and the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). Including these institutions brings the total number of regular users to 15.  This proposal highlights several specific proteomics applications for each NIH-funded user that leverage the essential features of the requested instrument. The requested instrument will serves as an analytical workhorse for a wide variety of health-related research projects with the common focus of protein quantitative analysis in complex mixtures. Examples include, 1) quantitative protein up and down regulation in cancer cells deficient of Hsp90 using SILAC technology with the focus for low abundant kinases, 2) identification of SUMOylation substrates in primary hepatocytes under stress conditions that typically cause inflammation; 3) identification of partners in protein-protein interaction machinery relevant to mitochondrial neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease using mouse models."
"9537961","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ca2+ release via IP3R channels is the most ubiquitous and versatile cellular signaling mechanism that plays a key role in the regulation of diverse physiological functions, including fertilization, hormone secretion, gene transcription, metabolic regulation, immune responses, apoptosis, learning and memory. Despite established significance of IP3Rs in physiology and pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying function of these channels, both in native and disease states, remain poorly understood, mainly because of the lack of high- resolution structural details about the 3D architecture of IP3Rs. Such structures have proven exceptionally difficult to obtain given the large size of IP3Rs (~1.3 MDa), their location in the membrane environment, and their dynamic nature. The focus of this proposal is type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), the predominant type of IP3-gated Ca2+ release channel in cerebellar Purkinje cells. To date, the best structure of the entire IP3R1 is resolved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) at intermediate resolution (10-15 ?), and the crystal structures are limited to a soluble portion of the cytoplasmic region representing only ~15% of the overall structure. Therefore, most critical issues surrounding gating of IP3R channels are stil ambiguous. In this application, we seek to answer the fundamental  questions on IP3R1 gating: what are the structural determinants  of Ca2+  permeation  through  IP3R1,  how  ligands  control  the gating  process  and  what conformational changes underlie pore opening in IP3R channels. To address these questions, we will extend structure determination of the entire IP3R1 to sub-nanometer resolution and will determine its structure in a near-native lipid environment. We will combine structural methodologies from cryo-EM, computational tools and bioinformatics with biochemical and biophysical techniques including radioligand binding, fluorescence- based Ca2+ flux assays and lipid bilayer channel recordings. This multidisciplinary approach will allow correlating structural analysis with channel function. Proposed structural studies will exploit single-particle cryo- EM methodology. Thus, the IP3R1 protein complex will be purified from detergent solubilized microsomal membranes and visualized in the form of individual particles embedded in vitreous ice. The IP3R1 structure will be analyzed in Apo- (aim 1) and ligand-bound states (aim 2) by reproducing the functionally relevant conditions in vitro and freeze-trapping the reaction on the EM grid. We then propose to reconstitute IP3R1 channel into small unilamellar lipid vesicles and to use a variant of single-particle reconstruction to solve the channel structure in the lipid membrane (aim 3). With these studies accomplished, we anticipate to establish the structural and mechanistic basis for IP3R1 function and to elucidate how defects in molecular mechanisms regulating the channel's gating can lead to abnormal cell Ca2+ levels underlying numerous diseases."
"9262762","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast effects of explosive devices is the signature injury   of the current Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, affecting an estimated 18% of deployed American service   members. Although termed mild in comparison to brain injuries resulting in death, coma, or paralysis,   mTBI, particularly repetitive mTBI characteristic of soldiers deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)   and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), in Afghanistan, may have devastating personal, professional   and domestic consequences. Impairment of memory and concentration, increased anxiety, irritability   and mood instability, and sleep disturbance interfere with job and family relationships, producing   substantial disability. In cases of civilian TBI from all causes, screening for hypopituitarism has been   increasingly recognized as a necessary component in the investigation of the long-term outcome of   TBI. Hypopituitarism, as defined by deficient production of one or more pituitary hormones measured at   least one year after injury, has been reported to occur in 30-70% of TBI cases, and its occurrence is not   related to trauma severity. Hypopituitarism is associated with numerous non-specific symptoms easily   mistaken for behavioral symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic postconcussive   syndrome, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, and decreased quality of life   (QoL), as well as changes in body composition including increased fat percentage, hyperlipidemia, and   a decrease in muscle mass. If accurately diagnosed as a consequence of hypopituitarism, these   symptoms can in most cases be successfully relieved with hormone replacement. Measurement of   baseline concentrations of pituitary hormones and their target hormones has been shown to have   considerable diagnostic utility in identifying most types of pituitary deficiencies. However, definitive   diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and secondary adrenal insufficiency (sAI) typically   requires the use of provocative testing. Provocative testing is costly, time-consuming, and laborintensive.      In addition, the insulin tolerance test (ITT), which is generally considered the gold standard   test for both GHD and sAI, requires intensive medical supervision and is contraindicated in cases of   head injury, so it cannot be employed to diagnose GHD or sAI in OIF/OEF Veterans with mTBI. The   rationale for this study is based on the high risk for hypopituitarism associated with TBI in civilian   settings, the apparent absence of any systematic investigation of pituitary dysfunction after blast mTBI   in OIF/OEF service members or Veterans, and the absence of routine screening for hypopituitarism in   this population. We propose to investigate the frequency and specific nature of blast mTBI-related   hypopituitarism in OIF/OEF Veterans and to devise a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient screening   procedure that will direct appropriate therapeutic intervention, facilitate recovery and rehabilitation, and   improve QoL. The objectives of the study are: 1) to determine whether pituitary hormone defects that   are readily identifiable from the results of basal hormone measurements are more prevalent in OIF/OEF   Veterans with blast mTBI than in deployment control subjects not exposed to blast trauma; 2) to   determine whether the glucagon stimulation test (GST) can substitute for the (contraindicated) ITT as a   provocative test for diagnosing GHD and/or sAI in OIF/OEF Veterans with blast exposure mTBI; 3) to   determine whether evidence of hypopituitarism is associated with increased frequency of sleep   problems, symptoms of chronic postconcussive syndrome, depression, and PTSD, lower cognitive   performance, adverse changes in body composition, and poorer QoL; and 4) to determine whether a   combination of basal hormone measures, serum lipid profiles, body composition indices, and additional   demographic, behavioral, and symptom values can be used to diagnose GHD and sAI with acceptable   accuracy compared to more expensive and time-consuming provocative testing procedures."
"9325095","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mice and humans share approximately 20,000 genes. To date, little data exists for more than half of these genes and nearly one third have no functional annotation. Because of the high degree of similarity between the mouse and human gene set, genetic data generated in mice can often be extrapolated to human gene function. Mouse models of genes with common functionality between mice and men can lead to new models of human disease, which are useful for drug screening, preclinical studies and deeper understanding of biological and disease mechanism. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) is to generate lines of mice that carry knockouts (KOs) for a genome-wide collection of mouse genes and subject the mice to broad based phenotyping. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes to merge its currently funded KOMP2 Mouse Production and Cryopreservation (U42) and Knockout Mouse Phenotyping (U54) operations as part of RFA-RM-15-017 Limited Competition: Knockout Mouse Production and Phenotyping Project (UM1). JAX KOMP2 proposes to use cutting-edge and cost-effective Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (Cas9 RGN, also called CRISPR/Cas9) technology to generate, breed, cryopreserve and phenotype1500 lines of mice during the project period. Continued effort will be made to improve the Cas9 RGN technology so as to reduce costs, increase targeting efficiency, and create more complex mutant alleles. Genes will be selected in coordination with our KOMP2 and IMPC partners, and will focus on those with poor annotation, genes that have significant community demand and integrate with other NIH-support programs, and genes predicted to function in select pathways. To guarantee ready access to the community, we will ship mice to outside investigators while they are alive on the shelf and deposit the lines into the Mouse Mutant Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) repositories for future use. Broad based phenotyping on juvenile animals up to 18 weeks of age will be performed on all 1500 lines of mice using International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)-required and JAX-specific protocols. We will assess body weight and composition, metabolic and physiological parameters, and behavioral and cognitive function. To detect age-dependent phenotypes, we will use the same pipeline to phenotype 20% (300 total) of the lines between 15-18 months of age. Based on data generated from the current phase of KOMP2, we expect about 30% of lines to be non-viable. We will characterize the non-viable mutants using high-throughput imaging modalities at three embryonic time points. All data generated from embryonic, juvenile and adult mice will be rapidly deposited into the Data Coordination Center (DCC) that supports KOMP2 and the IMPC. Lastly, JAX will work collaboratively with the KOMP2 Regional Network and with member organizations of the IMPC to share protocols, innovation, and new technology and to broadly and openly disseminate our findings to the international community through publication, presentations at meetings, web activities and social media."

"9548421","Exposure to drugs of abuse results in changes in gene expression, chromatin remodeling, cell signaling, and neuronal plasticity that leads to changes in behavior and with repetitive and increased exposure results in cell injury and cell death. To discover signaling pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic processes to promote effective cell signaling and survival in a hostile setting we performed a series of genetic screens and discovered Iduna. The PAR binding and E3 ligase actions of Iduna are important for neuroprotection, DNA repair and cell viability following DNA damage. Iduna is induced by stress and expressed during periods of plasticity positioning Iduna to play key roles in regulating genetic and/or protein expression that mediate neuronal plasticity. To explore these diverse actions of Iduna with relevance to the stress of cocaine exposure we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: How does Iduna regulate cell survival? We will examine the Iduna proteome to identify and characterize a full complement of Iduna target proteins to better understand pathways to neuroprotection. Specific Aim 2; What is the role of Iduna in activity dependent epigenetic modification and regulation? Histone modification and DNA methylation are key events in the complex behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, in particular to cocaine. In exploring Iduna biology we discovered that PAR is a major epigenetic regulator of gene expression. How PAR regulates gene transcription and protein translation is yet to be discovered. Specific Aim 3: Identification and characterization of the Iduna in the regulation of microRNA processing. PAR signaling is important in the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules and thus control protein translation by altering microRNA stability. PAR modification of stress granule proteins results in silencing of microRNA. Iduna is localized to stress granules. Its function in regulating expression of stress granule proteins and thus the stability of microRNA will be explored. Through these innovative aims exploring new biology with advanced technology we will provide new information regarding the role of Iduna in neuronal viability, epigenetic regulation and microRNA stability in the stress response to the drug of abuse, cocaine. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Exposure to the drug of abuse, cocaine, initiates a complex choreography of detrimental cell signaling. Iduna is induced in response to this stress in a response to maintain homeostasis, efficient cell function and cell viability. Understanding the complex events regulated by Iduna will lead to new knowledge regarding the long lasting changes in cell function that underiie the behavioral response to drugs of abuse and may in the future direct new treatment strategies."

"9515372","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory BIRCWH Program will be a multidisciplinary education program designed to provide career development training and support for outstanding early career investigators with a professional interested in innovative and high impact women's health research. The rationale behind the proposed dedicated education and training program includes: 1) the expanding need, particularly in the southeastern US to identify and train next generations of health-scientists invested in women's health research; 2) the growing necessity for high-quality biomedical research aimed at bridging health disparity between the sexes; 3) the importance of fostering interdisciplinary education and training in sex/gender life science; and 4) the unique opportunity to leverage the extensive expertise and the well-developed research infrastructures, particularly in the field of communicable disease at Emory, to address scientific questions pertinent to women's health. Strengths and resources from partner institutions, combined with a critical mass of investigators working in a significant number of health- related disciplines relevant to women's health within Emory, create an ideal training environment for advancing women's health research. The focus of our program on communicable disease and the impact on women's health highlights health disparities -in our case, among racial/ethnic minority women in the southeastern US - thereby aligning the proposed work with the agenda of the NIH office of research on women's health (OWHR) and capitalizing on Emory's strength in communicable diseases and basic immunology while leveraging existing collaborations with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Morehouse School of Medicine, and Georgia Institute of Technology, all within a few mile radius of Emory. A formal curriculum has been designed featuring didactic training and mentoring by a team of interdisciplinary established senior scholars and practitioners. Training of investigators from minority and underprivileged backgrounds is a particular focus of this program, and will be facilitated by existing strengths and partnerships in Atlanta. The program also will include a rigorous system for tracking and assessing progress. The Emory BIRCWH is an important component of a growing academic enterprise at Emory, and Emory is poised to provide outstanding career development for emerging leaders in women's health research."
"9330206","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Very fragile yet highly structured, the lung is assaulted with potential pathogens, allergens, and irritants with every breath. Yearly epidemics of influenza virus are a significant source of morbidity and mortality, presenting a major health obstacle with high economic burden for the United States and the world. Notably, the short incubation period, high infection rate, and rapid transmission of the influenza virus uniquely complicates the care of patients with pulmonary co-morbidities. However, the presence of effector memory CD8 T cells in the lungs can quickly control the local spread of a pathogen while mitigating an undesired and potentially deleterious wide-spread inflammatory response in the lungs. Key findings from human and animal model studies denoted that the protective efficacy of airway-resident memory CD8 T (TARM) cells directly correlates with the number of memory CD8 T cells present in the lung airways at the time of influenza challenge; as the number of TARM cells declined, so did protection from influenza challenge. Yet, it is unknown how TARM cells are maintained at the site of infection, the lung airways, where they are uniquely positioned to rapidly respond to an influenza infection. The first step in the process is elucidating the manner by which these memory CD8 T cells enter the lung from the general circulation. It is accepted that a chemokine receptor and adhesion molecule pair is necessary for trafficking of resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cell subsets to specific peripheral tissues. While the adhesion molecule has been identified, the chemokine receptor necessary for steady-state recruitment of memory CD8 T cells to the lungs has not. Identification of this specific chemokine receptor and elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate its expression are the basis of this proposal. The goal of the proposed project is to define the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR6 in steady-state trafficking of influenza- specific memory CD8 T cells to the lung airways and to identify the factors that regulate CXCR6 expression. In addition to gaining insight to the role of CXCR6, it is hoped that these studies will create a platform to advance the field of prophylactic cell-mediated vaccines against respiratory pathogens and to develop novel therapeutic agents that promote pathogen-specific T cell recruitment to the lung airways; in this manner, such agents could enhance protective immunity to respiratory pathogens. Such advances would strengthen preventative care methods to impart a higher quality of life for patients. The proposed research project will serve as a framework for the applicant's training plan, which is specifically designed to integrate basic science research in pulmonary mucosal immunology with the applicant's career goal of becoming an independent physician scientist whose research focus will be viral mucosal immunology."
"9545379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms are prevalent, distressing, and costly for women across the life span. They are characterized by storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms, and associated with urinary tract infections, overactive bladder, and bladder pain syndrome. The occurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms implies an abnormal or unhealthy bladder. Promotion of bladder health through treatment of modifiable risk factors and improving bladder habits may decrease the incidence of these symptoms over a woman's lifetime. Our long-term goal is to develop effective interventions to reduce the lifetime risk of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary tract infections in women across four life-stage groups: adolescent girls (pre-reproductive years); young adult (reproductive years), midlife (post- reproductive years) and older women (65 years and older). We plan to: 1) examine the utility of an adaption of the Symptom Management Model to identify risk and protective factors that predict bladder health in the four life-stages; 2) examine the shared and unique impact of risk and protective factors on lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary tract infection in women in each of the four age groups; and 3) design and conduct qualitative and cohort studies and clinical trials in collaboration with PLUS Research Consortium members that are focused on identifying and reducing risk factors related to bladder health in women. Specifically, we will conduct an evidence synthesis on the risk and protective factors and preventive interventions for lower urinary tract symptoms; use qualitative methodology to describe adolescent girls and women's bladder health experiences and their symptom management strategies; develop an instrument to be used in longitudinal studies in consortium sites based on our qualitative research results; and use epidemiological and electronic health record databases (including clinical data and claims data) to determine risk factors for urinary tract infections in women. In addition, we will design and conduct multisite observational studies and randomized controlled trials in collaboration with PLUS Research Consortium to identify and reduce risk factors associated with bladder health in selected female populations."

"9526117","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our project seeks to identify the regulatory elements recognized by the vast majority of transcription factors (TFs) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the initial modENCODE project, an experimental pipeline was developed and applied to -100 TFs in each organism. In this intervening year, we expect to capture data for another 75-100 factors. The present project builds on the advances made by the groups in the initial phase and also combines the production pipelines to increase efficiency and to realize economies of scale. With these improvements, we will generate data sets for another 400 factors from each organism, which when combined with previous work will represent the bulk of all transcription factors in these key model organisms. For both organisms, the overall strategy tags transcription factor genes by fusion with an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) sequence through recombineering of large insert clones, and introducing the tagged genes into the genome by transgenesis. ChlP-seq using a high quality anti-GFP antibody is performed on the developmental stage(s) with maximal GFP expression, as guided by available RNA-seq expression data. The aligned sequence reads are analyzed to identify candidate binding sites and likely target genes. We will prioritize TFs with human homologs to maximize the broader utility of the data. We will also perform RNAi of 125 TFs in each organism, followed by RNA-seq, to validate called peaks and their assigned target genes. Finally, we will integrate the information for the different data setsto construct regulatory networks implied by the TF binding site data. We will coordinate with ENCODE projects on human TFs, and our data will provide key in vivo and developmental regulatory information that will be essential to delineate both fundamentally conserved as well as human-specific properties of TFs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Insights from the study of the model organisms Drosophila and C. elegans provide the basis for broad understanding of fundamental processes of animal biology. Because many of their genes have clear relatives in humans, these studies have also led directly to improved understanding of human diseases and in some cases to therapies. Similarly, creating a comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites and building regulatory networks in these key model organisms will create the foundation for understanding human regulatory networks both in health and disease."
"9372203","ABSTRACT We propose an interdisciplinary K12 training program for junior faculty that will promote the development of independent implementation researchers committed to addressing cardiopulmonary disease prevention, treatment and management. The program will be led by the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) in collaboration with Baystate Health and the Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research of the Veteran's Health Administration. The overarching goals of our program are: 1) To promote the development of independent implementation scientists through educational curricula and mentored research experiences, tailored to the individual, and conducted in collaboration with a diverse range of clinical and community partners; 2) To identify effective program components and implement continuous program improvement through an innovative, comprehensive program evaluation; and 3) To broadly advance the field of implementation science by disseminating innovative best practices in implementation science training. Six scholars will be enrolled over the course of the funded grant period. Depending upon previous training, scholars will matriculate into a three or two year tailored training experience. Three year tracks are intended for scholars from clinical or other non-quantitative backgrounds; these scholars have the option of obtaining a Master of Science in Clinical Investigation. Two year tracks are intended for scholars with prior methods training. This program will leverage an existing implementation science training infrastructure at UMMS, developed as part of an ongoing NNIH-funded post-doctoral fellowship program in implementation science. Through this program, we have developed 12 core implementation science competencies and associated training modalities. Three overarching educational strategies will drive the K12 program: 1) didactic curriculum; 2) mentored research; and 3) enrichment activities.  Didactic courses in implementation science frameworks and theories and in implementation methods and measures were developed through the NIH-funded post- doctoral fellowship program and are currently available to all trainees, including K12 scholars. This grant will develop additional coursework focused on emerging methodologies in implementation science and will cover topics such as systems science, simulation and big data, and cost analysis. Each scholar will have a multi- disciplinary mentorship team and conduct an independent research project with a partner clinical or community implementation setting. Enrichment opportunities, developed through this K12 program and leveraged from ongoing programs, focus on enhancing learning of implementation science topics, cardiopulmonary disease prevention, treatment and management, grant and scientific writing and career development. An innovative evaluation will be used to identify effective training components and for continuous program improvement. At program completion, we anticipate that scholars will establish careers as independent investigators who address gaps in the translation of evidence-based cardiopulmonary treatments and interventions into practice."
"9432907","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on creation of a sequencing core for the Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) as well as comparison of the utility of genome-wide sequencing (GWS; also known as whole genome sequencing) versus Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for the identification of causal variants. Illumina and the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) have worked together to advance genomic sequencing into clinical medicine; this proposal is joint between these entities. All of the necessary components for the UDP sequencing core are functional at MCW and Illumina and required capacity and turnaround are met. Both groups have championed GWS as opposed to WES for genetic discovery leading to the second focus; comparison of GWS and WES for diagnostic success. MCW uses both WES and GWS; along with obvious advantages in detecting non protein coding variants, we find significantly better coverage of actionable genes with GWS, and a higher diagnostic success rate. We thus propose to conduct GWS for all participants enrolled in the UDP creating the opportunity to compare utility of WES versus GWS. With an integrated team and using innovative lab and bioinformatics techniques we propose to test the hypothesis that GWS will produce at least 25% more diagnoses than WES. Aim 1 will generate clinical grade GWS for all UDP cases sequenced and perform read mapping and variant calling. Sharing of the data generated and the methods developed will enable the UDP network to directly compare diagnostic use of WES and GWS. Aim 2 will undertake clinical grade tertiary analysis of the data using our clinically validated analysis platform; we will also provide clinical interpretation and report generation for all cases requested. These will be produced using our existing clinical methodology and tools. Aim 2 will also support dissemination of the methodology and offer tertiary analysis and clinical interpretation to all UDN sites. Aim 3 will confirm the NextGen sequencing results using Sanger and, through gathering of this data, determine whether this step will be necessary in the future. We envision that all of the laboratory operations, methodologies, and tools developed will be made available and will be suited for cloning in additional currently non network hospitals and large clinics. Relevance: This application is highly relevant in that it seeks to establish MCW as the sequencing core for the UDP. In addition to meeting this goal, the application seeks to extend the UDN benefit by determining whether application of GWS as compared to WES provides a diagnostic advantage."

"9349395","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previously we found that the adapter protein SHN3 had a major effect to suppress bone formation by osteoblasts in vivo by inhibiting the activity of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK. We also identified that WNTs have a previously unidentified activity to activate this SHN3/ERK pathway. Here we seek to make critical extensions of these observations by determining how SHN3 inhibits ERK and how this pathway influences models of skeletal disease in vivo. This area of study is significant as osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disorder of low bone mass and skeletal fragility. Half of all women will experience of an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime, with each of these fractures incurring significant morbidity and mortality. Based on the profound ability of SHN3 to suppress bone formation, building a better understanding of this pathway will yield new methods to control the activity of osteoblasts to form bone, potentially offering approaches to treat osteoporosis and other disorders of low bone mass. The three overlapping areas to be investigated in this project are: 1. Determine the contribution of SHN3 to skeletal disease models while we have established that SHN3 strongly suppresses bone formation in mice at baseline, the specific contribution of SHN3 to murine models of post-menopausal osteoporosis and skeletal fracture are unknown and will be studied in SHN3-deficient mice. 2. Determine how SHN3 inhibits the ERK pathway in osteoblasts While we have established that SHN3 acts in osteoblasts primarily by suppressing the activity of ERK, the relevant ERK substrates and how SHN3 shapes the kinetics of the ERK response are unknown and will be studied using phosphoproteomics and a quantitative ERK activity biosensor. Determining the relevant substrates of ERK may identify downstream effectors of the SHN3/ERK pathway that are themselves amenable to therapeutic targeting. Additionally, the mechanism for the activation of the ERK/SHN3 pathway by WNTs is unknown, and this will be addressed by a focused screen to determine the MAP3K required for proximal activation of this pathway. 3. Determine if chromatin acts as a scaffold to orchestrate the activity of the SHN3/ERK complex in osteoblasts. Both SHN3 and ERK have previously been identified to bind DNA, raising the possibility that regulation of ERK activity by SHN3 occurs in chromatin bound complexes. In this aim, a complimentary series of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments will be utilized to explore if chromatin orchestrates the function of the SHN3/ERK pathway."
"9552301","Project Summary/Abstract  Chemosensory responses are critical components in the control of several essential behaviors of insects that are vectors for pathogens responsible for many important human diseases. In particular, olfaction plays a major role in host seeking and oviposition preference/selection behaviors of blood-feeding female mosquitoes and, as such, constitutes a critical component of the mosquito's ability to transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Zika and West Nile virus encephalitis. Within this context, and together with our colleagues, we have undertaken a molecular, cellular and organismal examination of several elements of the olfactory signal transduction cascade in the principal African malaria vector mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis and An. funestus. An increased understanding of olfactory mechanisms and their underlying chemical cues provides insight into the processes of insect behavioral responses in general and disease transmission in particular and would likely be instrumental in the development of novel mosquito control strategies. In this context we have made significant progress in the characterization of several aspects of olfactory process in mosquito systems leading to, among other things, the identification and functional characterization of a family of odorant receptor proteins that lie at the heart of the olfactory signaling pathway. Building on those advances, this proposal for competitive renewal focuses on extending several elements of our ongoing program including characterization of: (1) the in vivo impact of biologically relevant Plasmodium falciparum infections on OR expression and OR-based olfactory receptivity, (2) the olfactory physiology and functional role of labellum ORs in An. coluzzii and (3) an examination of anthropophily via a comparative analysis of OR expression and functionality across Anophelines."
"9357738","This is a K01 application by Dr. Adel Driss, a research instructor at MSM. Dr. Driss is establishing himself as a young investigator pursuing research in global health to understand the molecular mechanisms mediating interactions between hemoglobinopathies and Malaria. Although these two diseases overlap in sub-Saharan Africa, the biological interactions between malaria and hemoglobinopathies are poorly understood. Dr. Driss recently returned from Ghana after an eleven-month field study sponsored by a Fogarty Global Health Fellows award to screen microRNA polymorphisms associated with severity of anemia in sickle cell and malaria in Ghana. This collaborative research was conducted between MSM and the University of Ghana (UG). He successfully obtained blood samples and clinical data and conducted preliminary analysis during his fellowship. This K01 award will greatly enhance Dr. Driss' goals of: 1) developing a path to independence in biomedical research; 2) conducting investigations on the role of microRNA's in the pathogenesis of malaria and hemoglobinopathies; 3) applying advanced genomic and proteomic methods to identify and validate biomarkers of malaria severity; and 4) developing global health collaborations between MSM in the USA and UG in West Africa. To achieve these goals, Dr. Driss has assembled a mentoring team consisting of: Dr. Stiles, Professor of Microbiology at MSM, who will provide support through his expertise in immuno- pathogenesis of blood diseases and hemoglobinopathies; Dr. Wilson, Professor of Parasitology at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the UG. Dr. Wilson will provide the necessary onsite support and guidance in the Ghanaian host institution; Dr. Hibbert, Associate Professor and an expert in animal studies relating to the role of nutrition in modulation of various human diseases will provide support for the proposed animal studies; and Dr. Quarshie will provide statistical support. The rationale for the proposed study is that specific host-derived microRNAs (miR-451 and Let-7i) have been associated with protection against the Malaria parasite in individuals with sickle-cell trait. These findings have never been validated in a population- based study. The hypothesis is that malaria severity is associated with alterations in expression of microRNAs linked to the hemoglobinopathy status of the individuals affected. Thus, Dr. Driss proposes 3 aims to (i) correlate miR-451 and Let-7i expression profiles with clinical blood analytical values and heme metabolism in individuals with different sickle cell status; (ii) characterize the role of miR-451 and Let-7i regulation on P. falciparum development in human erythrocytes in vitro and (iii) determine the role of miR-451 and Let-7i in modulation of pathogenesis of malaria and hemoglobinopathies in a sickle cell mouse model. The overall goal is to increase understanding of malaria severity in individuals with hemoglobinopathies and to identify molecular biomarkers that may be used to predict severity risk which can be attractive targets to malaria protection therapies. The experience gained will allow Dr. Driss to successfully compete for an R01 funding."
"9303162","PROJECT SUMMARY Mitochondrial mutations occur at a very high rate in humans and are a major cause of inherited and age- related diseases. Although elevated mutation rates have long been considered a byproduct of the intense metabolic activity that occurs within mitochondria, recent evidence has called this view into question, creating enormous uncertainty in the field about the causes of mitochondrial mutations. In contrast to humans, some eukaryotes exhibit extremely low rates of mutation in their mitochondrial DNA. Answering the question of how some organisms are able to maintain low mitochondrial mutation rates has the potential to inform our understanding of what causes them to be so high in humans. Remarkably, however, little effort has been made to address this fundamental question of eukaryotic genetics. The proposed research will focus on flowering plants as a model for understanding the mechanisms responsible for variation in mitochondrial mutation rate. Rates of mitochondrial (and plastid) DNA substitutions in plants are generally lower than in plant nuclear genomes and orders of magnitude lower than in animal mitochondria. However, plants also exhibit extreme fluctuations in rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution even among closely related species. Progress in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the extremely low rates in most plant species has been impeded by the inherent technical difficulties in studying rare mutation events. The advent of new methodologies that leverage deep sequencing and quantitative PCR technologies to directly measure rare mutations and quantify rates of DNA damage presents an exciting opportunity to overcome these historical barriers. The proposed research will apply these methodologies to both wild-type and mutant backgrounds in the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana to test a suite of alternative hypotheses, relating to the fidelity of DNA polymerases, the efficacy of recombinational repair mechanisms, the effects of biased gene conversion, and exposure/susceptibility to DNA damage in plant organelles. Analyses will be conducted on both vegetative and meristematic tissues to distinguish mutations that simply accumulate in plant tissues from those that are actually transmitted to offspring. The research will also be extended to related species of flowering plants in which there has been a recent and massive acceleration in rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution. These investigations will elucidate the mechanisms responsible for variation in mitochondrial mutation rates across eukaryotes and inform ongoing debates about the role of oxidative damage as a mutagenic force in human mitochondria."
"9285847","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During embryonic development, the heart becomes innervated by sympathetic nerves, which control heart rate and contractility. Sympathetic nerve extend along blood vessels to reach their targets, in what is called neurovascular congruency, but virtually nothing is known of how these axons are instructed to reach the heart in order to establish a precise circuitry. New observations described in this proposal lead to a model in which endothelin signaling from specific vascular components is a critical guidance mechanism for sympathetic axons to take appropriate routes in order to reach the heart. In this application, using both in vivo and in vitro assays, I propose experiments to address the spatial and functional role of specific components of endothelin signaling in cardiac axon guidance. I approach this strategy within a developmental context that coordinates neuronal outgrowth with cardiovascular cell lineage and morphogenesis."
"9355725","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The immune system is a decentralized network of diverse white blood cells that is distributed across the entire organism. Contributing to its complexity, the immune system has developed mechanisms by which it remembers its prior experiences and is influenced by them. Recently, strategies to activate the immune system of cancer patients to recognize and eliminate tumor cells have resulted in significant clinical progress. These immunotherapies attempt to initiate new, potent immune responses in individuals with tumor burden. While inspiring, the majority of cancer patients do not respond to these therapies, especially those with adenocarcinomas, which are the most prevalent forms of cancer. Thus, there is a pressing need to understand why these therapies often fail and use this knowledge to develop more effective strategies. One of the major barriers to accomplishing this goal is our poor understanding of how the state of the immune system differs in cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. While it is well appreciated that tumors actively evade immune responses, we still do not understand how this context shapes the ability of the immune system to initiate and execute new responses. This gap in our knowledge has partially resulted from insufficient methods to measure and interpret the immune state. However, we have recently developed experimental and computational methods capable of modeling the state of the immune system under any condition, identifying how its behavior differs from the healthy setting. Therefore, in this proposal, we plan to apply these tools to provide a comprehensive assessment of the immune state in tumor-bearing individuals. We will begin by understanding how the immune system adapts its organization and behavior across the body during the development and spread of a tumor. We will subsequently assess how immune cells that have experienced tumor burden change their propensity to respond to new stimuli, including molecules that have potential as immunotherapies. Lastly, we will reveal how the immune system responds differently to new challenges in healthy versus tumor-bearing individuals. The result of these studies will be a comprehensive understanding of how the experience of a tumor alters the behavior of the immune system. This knowledge will be essential for the development of new immunotherapies for cancer by revealing which pathways of immune activation remain functional or become enhanced in tumor-bearing individuals. Moreover, this proposal will reveal mechanisms by which the immune system incorporates its prior knowledge when making decisions with broad implications for all immunological processes including those in infection, autoimmunity and transplantation."
"9330688","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent inflammation underpins the accelerated atherosclerosis and increased prevalence of protein-energy wasting in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. However, the etiology of unprovoked inflammation in MHD patients remains unresolved. The human gut harbors 1014 bacteria, and gut microbial imbalance has been linked to inflammation, insulin resistance and atheroscleroisis. Prebiotic oligofructose enriched inulin (p-inulin) has been shown to restore gut microbial balance, thereby reducing endotoxin generation and inflammation. Pentoxifylline (PTX) blocks cytokine generation in response to endotoxemia at the tissue level, and hence complements the actions of p-inulin. In a two-by-two factorial clinical trial, we will randomize 120 MHD patients to receiv p-inulin/PTX/placebo daily for 12 months. First, we will demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment randomization, and retention of study participants in order to record endpoints in at least 90% of participants. Secondly, we will establish the safety and efficacy of  p-inulin and PTX in reducing systemic inflammation. Finally, we propose to evaluate the effect of study intervention on selected exploratory clinical end-points: (a) Progression/regression of atherosclerosis will be determined using phase-sensitive dual inversion recovery magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy technique; (b) Alterations in muscle mass and visceral fat mass will be examined by MR imaging of thigh and abdomen; and (c) Changes in presence and severity of protein-energy wasting will be determined according to the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria. This pilot study will prove the concept, establish feasibility and generate preliminary data to justify the launching of a full-clinical trial."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) was created in 2005 to evaluate the clinical course of perinatally acquired HIV infection among adolescents and pre-adolescents and the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to HIV and antiretroviral chemotherapy among a representative cohort of children in the United States. PHACS is comprised of a Scientific Leadership Group (SLG), which is overseen by a Coordinating Center, a Data and Operations Center (DOC), and 22 clinical units (CU). The Department of Epidemiology and the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at the Harvard School of Public Health, Westat, and the Frontier Science Foundation form the PHACS DOC. The DOC collaborates with the SLG to define the PHACS research agenda; provides methodological leadership for the development of all PHACS analytic projects; maintains CU subcontracts and trains and monitors sites in proper procedures for PHACS research; plans and conducts all leadership and full PHACS network meetings; develops HIV- and health- related educational materials and opportunities for the PHACS community; and, supports an active Community Advisory Board. The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP), a cohort of 450 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and preadolescents age 7-16 at enrollment, was established to investigate the impact of HIV and ART on organ systems, growth and development, sexual maturation, pubertal development, cognition, emotional development, and socialization; AMP Up was subsequently designed to extend follow-up of AMP participants and other HIV-infected young adults who have reached 18 years of age using a streamlined, mobile-friendly protocol. A drug toxicity surveillance system, Surveillance Monitoring for Anti-Retroviral Toxicities (SMART), has enrolled 3,506 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected children to evaluate long-term effects of in-utero ART exposure. In PHACS III, the DOC will continue to carry out the PHACS scientific agenda in an increasing efficient manner, enrolling and following an additional 1,000 newborns into SMARTT and an additional 525 HIV-infected and HIV-exposed, uninfected young adults into AMP Up. Together, HSPH, Westat and Frontier Science bring a long and successful history of providing the scientific and operational leadership required by PHACS, as well as innovative methods to enhance and maximize the efficiency of the PHACS study design, conduct, and analyses. Given our prior experience we are uniquely positioned to continue to provide the scientific/epidemiologic and operational leadership essential to the continued success of PHACS."

The incidence of breast cancer Nigeria was 54.3 per 100,000 per year (24,750 new cases per year) in 2014 representing a rise from 20 per 100,000 in the 1970s (3,000 new cases per year). It is now a major cancer burden in Nigerian women. There are controversies about the epidemiology and molecular subtypes of breast cancer in African women including limited knowledge about the incidence of breast cancer and determinants of this incidence such as the role of different risk factors; incidence and prevalence of molecular subtypes of breast cancer and the contributions of indigenous African diets to breast cancer incidence. In the absence of prospective cohort studies, we engage innovative research design and analytic techniques to use data from population based cancer registries (PBCR) to study the epidemiological factors associated with incident breast cancer and molecular subtypes. There has also never been a genome wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer in general and of molecular subtypes of breast cancer in indigenous African women. While many researchers suggest that African diets are associated with reduced risks of breast cancer, there have been very few systematic studies. We use the nutrition epidemiology tools that we previously developed and validated to study dietary intakes and breast cancer risk in African women. We focus in particular on the role of vitamin D and explore potential associations with breast cancer using nutrition epidemiology and genomics epidemiology tools."

"9396819","PROJECT ABSTRACT The cornea is the most anterior structure of the eye, which makes it susceptible to injury from scratching, infections, and dystrophy. In fact, corneal blindness from injury and disease is the fourth highest cause of preventable blindness globally. The only curative treatment for this condition is corneal transplantation or grafting, but viable eye tissues are not readily available worldwide. Therefore, studying the mechanism of normal wound healing in the cornea could give us information on development of potential novel therapeutic targets. Upon injury, corneal epithelial cells release nucleotides (e.g. ATP) that activate purinergic receptors P2Y2 and P2X7; P2Y2 is a G-protein coupled receptor, while P2X7 is a ligand-gated ion channel. Both of these receptors induce a transient calcium wave that has been established to be a critical step in the wound healing process. However, little is known about the long-term role of calcium signaling in wound repair. Given that the expression and localization of P2X7 and P2Y2 change after the initial calcium wave, we speculated that these receptors may also be involved in the later stages of the wound healing process. We have now identified a long-term role of calcium propagation that when inhibited attenuates the healing process. This secondary response, which occurs 10-30 minutes after the primary calcium wave is induced, consists of a series of calcium oscillations that propagate within multiple clusters of cells, and it was seen to last for several hours. Deactivating extracellular nucleotides with ectonucleotidases inhibited the secondary response, indicating that P2Y2 and P2X7 are required in this process. Unlike the primary response, the secondary calcium response depended on cell-cell contact and thus was inhibited by sub-confluent conditions and gap junction inhibitors. These results demonstrate that the calcium response after wounding is more complex than that of either receptor alone. The goal of my project is to investigate how the purinergic receptors P2X7 and P2Y2 coordinate and produce the secondary calcium response and how that response contributes to the wound healing process. Therefore, I hypothesize that purinergic receptors P2X7 and P2Y2 differentially mediate the secondary calcium response and contribute to multiple processes in wound repair."

"9354521","Project Summary/Abstract Delayed-onset drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) are a significantly under-recognized and under- researched public health problem. Approximately 7% of the general population is affected by drug allergy. Skin is the most commonly affected organ and severity ranges from a mild rash to severe blistering and sloughing with internal organ involvement. The pathobiology of delayed-onset DHR is poorly understood due to a lack of both usable clinical samples and mouse models that recapitulate human disease. This negatively impacts patient care for 3 reasons. First, clinicians are ill-equipped to treat severe forms of disease. Second, there are no effective assays to identify a culprit drug, which can result in administering a less effective, more dangerous, and/or more-expensive drug in the future. Third, it can be difficult to discern drug allergy from other diagnoses with negative bearing on patient prognosis and/or treatment. It is therefore of paramount importance to elucidate the pathobiology of delayed-onset DHR to address these clinical needs. The central hypothesis of this project is that a recently identified population of T cells, termed skin resident-memory T cells (TRM), mediate delayed-onset DHR. The proposed project will directly test this hypothesis while overcoming current limitations in the field. Aim 1 employs three novel technologies to study a large bank of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded clinical specimens that until now were of little research utility. These technologies are (i) PerkinElmer?s OpalTM multiplexed immunohistochemistry and MantraTM Quantitative Pathology Workstation with inFORM® Image Analysis Software, (ii) NanoString technology for gene expression profiling and (iii) ImmunoSEQ high-throughput TCR deep sequencing to assess TCR repertoire. Aim 1 further includes laboratory investigation of prospectively collected clinical specimens, by taking advantage of the patient volume of Harvard?s tertiary care hospitals. Aim 2 tests the role of skin TRM in delayed- onset DHR ex vivo, and in-so-doing develops a much needed assay to diagnose drug allergy. Aim 3 leverages progress in humanized mouse technology to study human skin TRM in an in vivo model of delayed-onset DHR, thereby creating a mouse model of disease for future research. The data generated through this project will advance both the fields of skin T cell biology and delayed-onset DHR."
"9476556","Project Summary Oocyte meiosis ends with two rounds of cell division that produce an egg with a haploid genome. While mitosis uses bipolar spindles that assemble using two centrosomes, oocytes assemble bipolar spindles in the absence of centrosomes. While the assembly and function of mitotic spindles have been studied extensively, acentrosomal oocyte spindle assembly remains poorly understood, and C. elegans provides an appealing model system for investigating the mechanisms that govern this process. Moreover, our understanding of oocyte spindle assembly remains incomplete in all widely used model systems, with live cell imaging only recently beginning to shed light on the dynamics of spindle assembly, and somewhat piecemeal genetic studies having provided a partial but incomplete catalogue of the important players. We propose a systematic and quantitative analysis of oocyte meiotic spindle assembly and spindle bipolarity, using a valuable collection of temperature-sensitive mutants we have isolated. We also will use RNA interference to identify the genes and pathways that operate during oocyte spindle assembly in C. elegans, along with live-cell fluorescent video-microscopy and genome editing to provide a more complete and mechanistic understanding of this fundamentally important process. In 2014, we published a manuscript describing our initial work on oocyte spindle pole assembly in Molecular Biology of the Cell, and in 2015 another manuscript in The Journal of Cell Biology and describing our evidence that the microtubule depolymerase KLP- 7/MCAK acts through kinetochores to promote the coalescence of oocyte spindle poles. These results, together with our identification of additional temperature-sensitive mutants with oocyte spindle defects and a thorough survey of the literature covering the most widely used model systems, provide the foundation for the specific aims we now propose to advance our understanding of acentrosomal oocyte meiotic spindle assembly. Even though mitotic spindles rely extensively on centrosomes to organize bipolar spindles, oocyte meiosis and somatic mitosis share the use of acentrosomal pathways for nucleating and organizing microtubules. Thus investigating oocyte spindle assembly will improve our understanding the abnormal mitotic proliferations that result in cancer. Moreover, human oocytes are remarkably prone to errors in spindle assembly and often produce aneuploid oocytes that upon fertilization develop abnormally. A better understanding of oocyte meiotic spindle assembly is therefore relevant to human fertility and development."
"9340303","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall strategy for the company is to utilize microphysiological systems in combination with functional readouts to establish platforms capable of sophisticated analysis of chemicals and drug candidates for toxicity and efficacy during pre-clinical testing, with initial emphasis on predictive toxicity. This is a service based company that is developing low-cost in vitro systems containing a novel pumpless microphysiological platform and serum-free medium formulation. The pumpless integrated system, using a rocking motion to pump the cellular medium, reduces the complexity and cost of the fluidic circuit design and simplifies set-up and operation of the device. The system employs microelectrode arrays and cantilever systems that are integrated on chip to allow for noninvasive electronic and mechanical readouts. These functional readouts greatly reduce the number of biomarkers to be monitored for cell health and function in our systems. We have constructed physiological systems that represent cardiac, muscle, neuronal and liver function that are already being evaluated and utilized for testing in Hickman's lab by pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies. We also have functional, prototype system for human neuromuscular junction, and an integrated 4-organ system consisting of cardiac, liver, neuronal and skeletal muscle compartments. These devices are currently under validation studies and are available as a service for use by industry and government and we are negotiating with major pharmaceutical companies now to utilize these systems.  However, all current systems are fabricated and assembled by hand and this factor will continue to hinder production of these systems. In this proposal, advanced manufacturing techniques will be utilized and developed to increase rates of fabrication and testing and lower cost by an order of magnitude. We will partner with NIST to develop these advanced manufacturing techniques and take advantage of Hickman's long association with Dr. Michael Tarlov's group in the Biomolecular Measurement Division. These systems will be tested with drugs that have known multi-organ interactions and ones that target single organs and the results will be compared to human clinical responses. In particular, we will determine whether the system would predict semi-quantitative multi-organ responses to chemicals of interest to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Dr. Shuler has pioneered the Body-on-a-Chip system, a realistic multi-organ platform using cell cultures to predict human response to drugs and biologics and will create a next-generation device. Dr. Hickman has developed functional in vitro human physiological systems and integrated them onto the microphysiological platform in serum-free medium formulations."
"9294463","Abstract Since first detected in the Americas in May 2015 after rapidly spreading from Brazil, the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has attracted global attention. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil has also been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders such as Guillain- Barré syndrome and has been declared a ?global emergency? by the World Health Organization. Zika virus is related to dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, all of which are arthropod-borne flaviviruses. Building on successful flavivirus vaccine approaches reported in the literature as an initial attempt to develop a Zika virus vaccine, we have generated a panel of recombinant Zika virus subunit vaccines based on the extracellular portion of the ZIKV envelope gene or the EDIII domain of the ZIKV envelope gene. The EDIII loop of the flavivirus envelope gene is the receptor-binding domain and has been shown to be the most promising target for an antiviral neutralizing immunity. Both these antigens (E and EDIII) were generated as monomers (ZIKV-rE and ZIKV-rEDIII), as dimers in fusion with the fc portion of the human IgG1 (ZIKV-rEhIg and ZIKV-rEDIIIhIg), and as trimers in fusion with the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (ZIKV-rEfl and ZIKV-rEDIIIfl). In the preliminary studies presented here, we tested the immunogenicity of trimeric ZIKV-rEfl and ZIKV-rEDIIIfl delivered transcutaneously using dissoluble microneedle array (MNA) delivery system into C57BL6 mice. The choice of the MNA-based antigen delivery system is justified because its efficacy and it is simple and easily adaptable to use in low hygiene and pure socio-economic environment. We compared their immunogenicity with the immunogenicity of the same antigens delivered with adenovirus 5-based vaccine vector. We now are proposing extending the testing to all six ZIKV recombinant subunit vaccines generated. The immunogenicity of these six subunit vaccines, named ZIKV-rE, ZIKV-rEDIII, ZIKV-rEhIg, ZIKV-rEDIIIhIg, ZIKV-rEfl, and ZIKV-rEDIIIfl, delivered via MNA, will be compared in C57B6 mice. Once the best performing ZIKV subunit vaccine is selected, the beneficial effect of adjuvant will be evaluated. Ultimately, we will test the efficacy of the selected subunit vaccine in a ZIKV surrogate animal challenge model. We hypothesize that administration of ZIKV subunit vaccines in a prime/boost regimen will elicit ZIKV-specific immunity that will lead to the effective immunization of pregnant mice with passage of passive immunity to newborns, which will be protected by ZIKV challenge."
"9241259","Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data."
"9349388","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age globally. We are specifically interested in the diarrheal disease cholera because of the devastating impact the disease has on at-risk populations and an emerging opportunity to leverage mobile technology to overcome fundamental clinical and scientific challenges we have faced for decades in the cholera field. Despite effective treatments and advances in provider education, cholera case fatality rates remain high. Conventional methods have been unable to overcome barriers to provide patients timely access to care and fully understand the disease at the level of the household. With the emergence of high rates of cell phone penetration in areas with significant cholera associated morbidity and mortality, we feel there are new opportunities for intervention. Our research challenge is to take an unconventional approach to develop a system using mobile technology to identify cases, improve access to care, and characterize the microbial flora early in the disease state. The application's specific aims are (i) develop a system to detect cholera patients early in disease using mobile technology, (ii) validate the detection system and clinical impact of the system in an interrupted time series study with a control group, and (iii) characterize the microbial flora of cholera stool during the early disease state. These aims will generate the following deliverables: We will show for the first time that mobile technology can be used to identify and provide ORS to diarrheal disease patients early in disease. We will show that mobile technology can be leveraged to decrease the incidence and severity of cases admitted to the hospital. Lastly, we will implement the system to characterize cholera stool using modern techniques early in disease for the first time, which may impact our fundamental understanding of correlates to disease progression and transmission."

"9560512","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Evolution is the ultimate design algorithm behind biology and if sped up, could have enormous utility in bioengineering. I propose a unique strategy, called orthogonal replication (OrthoRep), to achieve fast and scalable targeted gene evolution in vivo so that the evolutionary process can be routinely applied for biomolecular engineering. The idea is to create a cell, starting with yeast, that has a second replication system consisting of a special DNA plasmid replicated by a dedicated DNA polymerase (DNAP). The second system would be orthogonal to genomic replication such that the dedicated DNAP (ortho-DNAP) only replicates the special plasmid (ortho-plasmid) and not the host genome. The ortho-DNAP could then be engineered to mutate the ortho-plasmid at rates far exceeding what the genome could tolerate. Our analysis suggests that OrthoRep could accelerate evolution by enormous amounts, as a gene encoded on the ortho-plasmid could in principle be forced to diversify ~106-fold faster than if it were encoded on the genome of yeast. We have successfully established OrthoRep in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we will continue its development by engineering highly error- prone ortho-DNAPs to reach maximum rates of asexual gene evolution. We will also add sexual evolution to ortho-plasmid, spurred by fortuitous observations of our ortho-plasmids' natural tendency to recombine. Finally, we will engineer copy number control for the ortho-plasmid to enable a broader array of selectable functions, especially negative selections. Once OrthoRep is developed, I propose to apply it to the rapid evolution of in vivo biosensors. Metabolic engineering has great potential for biomedicine, as it promises to move multi-gene biosynthetic pathways that synthesize complex drugs from dif?cult natural sources into cheap microbial production hosts. However, when a multi-gene biosynthesis pathway is transferred into a microbe, an array of rational and combinatorial optimization steps are inevitably needed. Optimization requires the ability to detect product production, but there are no high-throughput assays capable of this. Our OrthoRep system will remove this key roadblock in metabolic engineering by evolving in vivo biosensors for small molecules of interest nearly on-demand. We will evolve in vivo biosensors for four molecules, taxadiene, casbene, amorphadiene, and parthenolide, whose ef?cient production in yeast offer different challenges to metabolic engineering. Not only will these biosensors be directly useful for microbial production of these drug and drug precursors, lessons learned will help us solidify OrthoRep as a potentially transformative evolutionary engineering technology that can be broadly applied."

The technology development and transfer work focuses on three main areas: (i) using up-to-date molecular dynamics simulation methods and force fields to assist in structure determination based on crystallography, SAXS and cryo-EM data with a key emphasis on the development of novel ways to interpret small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data and to combine this information with restraints derived from NMR, (ii) developing and supporting integrated tools for NMR spectrum analysis and structure generation and refinement with a key focus on creating novel tools to make use of chemical shifts in RNA structure analysis and refinement, and (iii) investigating the evolution of functional RNA sequences in the HIV-1 genome through analysis of nucleotide sequence data, which will lead to novel bioinformatics methods for identifying functional RNA elements in viral genomes, and the creation of a web resource to support these analyses for HIV-1."
"9366319","Addressing Psychiatrist Workforce Shortages in the U.S. with Psychiatric Advanced Practice  Registered Nurses (APRNs) Project Summary/Abstract  The U.S. is experiencing a severe shortage of psychiatrists, which greatly limits access to behavioral health (BH) treatments for many individuals, including some of the most vulnerable with serious and persistent mental illnesses (SPMI). While psychiatric advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are uniquely qualified to alleviate BH prescriber shortages, there are several barriers that limit their ability to practice to the fullest extent of their licensure and training. Although APRNs have prescriptive authority in all U.S. states, whether their prescriptive management must be supervised by a physician varies by state. As of 2016, only 22 states and DC allow for fully independent prescriptive authority among APRNs while the remaining 28 states restrict their prescribing autonomy. These state-based regulations are frequently cited as barriers to full utilization of psychiatric APRNs. Past efforts to expand the scope of APRNs? prescriptive authority have met with significant opposition by physicians and prominent professional organizations who cite patient safety concerns. There are also concerns that expanding APRNs? prescriptive authority does not result in any overall net increase in the availability of medications, because APRN prescribing will merely replace or ?crowd out? physician prescribing. The proposed study will be the first to capitalize on an ongoing natural experiment to inform the policy debate surrounding the expansion of APRNs? prescriptive authority as one approach to addressing the significant psychiatrist-prescriber workforce shortage in the U.S. The proposed project will use the 50-state Medicaid Analytic eXtracts and related Medicare Part D data from 2010-2013 to evaluate prescribing of BH (i.e., antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, antidepressant, and alcohol use disorder) medications in Medicaid enrollees with SPMI (i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, major depression, co-occurring alcohol use disorders) by psychiatric APRNs and psychiatrists. Propensity score matching will be the primary mechanism to control for selection bias, and generalized linear mixed models will be used to analyze the propensity score- matched datasets to address the following specific aims: (1) To compare prescription of guideline-concordant BH medications and treatment continuity (adherence, persistence) among patients with SPMI treated by psychiatric APRNs versus psychiatrists; (2) To determine the effects of states permitting APRNs to prescribe autonomously on prescription of guideline-concordant BH medications and treatment continuity (adherence, persistence) among patients with SPMI. As an additional aim, we will leverage recent changes in state prescriptive authority regulations in Maryland to evaluate whether allowing psychiatric APRNs to prescribe autonomously has led to a net increase in prescriptions for BH medications for SPMI compared to other states where APRNs have independent practice but not prescriptive authority: (3) To investigate the effects of states permitting APRNs to prescribe autonomously on the overall availability of BH medications to patients with SMI and on crowding-out psychiatrist prescribing."

"9354435","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In multicellular organisms, a family of tightly regulated cell adhesion receptors called integrins mediates communication among cells and between cells and their extracellular matrices. Impaired regulation of integrins leads to many pathologies, which in the adult kidney include inflammatory, autoimmune and thrombotic disorders, making integrins important therapeutic targets. Indeed FDA-approved peptidomimetics, synthetic small molecules and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are being used to treat thrombotic and autoimmune diseases, and more recently, mAbs targeting ?V?3 have been shown to prevent atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy and systemic sclerosis in animal models. The anti-integrin peptidomimetics and synthetic small molecule drugs in current use are patterned after the prototypical integrin binding Arg-Gly-Aps motif in ligands. Their parenteral use has caused serious adverse outcomes in treated patients, and clinical trials using these ligand-mimetics as oral drugs to prevent thrombosis have failed due to unexpected patient death of paradoxical thrombosis. Subsequent biochemical and structural studies showed that these drugs act as partial agonists, i.e. they induce the conformational changes in the integrin produced by binding of physiologic macromolecular ligands. This partial agonism has contributed to the unexpected adverse outcomes seen in treated patients. Hence the need for a better understanding of structure- activity relationships in these receptors and for development of pure antagonists that lack the partial agonism of the ligand-mimetic compounds in current use. Our recently published studies generated during the current funding period identified an RGD-based pure antagonist and revealed the atomic basis for its unexpected mechanism of action. These studies, in addition to new preliminary data, provide a novel path for synthesis of anti-integrin drugs that lack partial agonism, and a basis for understanding structure-function relationships in integrins in more details. Capitalizing on these exciting new developments is the subject of this competing renewal application."
"9341955","ABSTRACT  APPROACHES TO TREATING MTDNA-BASED MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE   There are no generalizable rational treatments for patients with mitochondrial diseases due to deficiency in  oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We propose here to study pharmacological approaches to treat patients  with mitochondrial diseases due to mutations in mtDNA, based on our discovery that specific agents can shift  the mutation load and/or rescue mitochondrial function in cells harboring mtDNA mutations.   Specifically, we have found that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus; trade name Rapamune) induces  mitophagy in cells carrying homoplasmic mtDNA mutations, but does not do so in wild-type cells. Remarkably,  we have now found that rapamycin treatment of heteroplasmic cells containing different pathogenic mtDNA  mutations elicited a dramatic improvement in bioenergetic function, as did mdivi-1, an inhibitor of mitochondrial  fission, but surprisingly, with no apparent reduction in mutant load. We now propose to follow up on these  exciting results, in three ways. First, we will examine in greater detail the ability of rapamycin, mdivi-1, and  other agents to restore mitochondrial function in heteroplasmic cells. Second, we will try to determine the  mechanism by which functional rescue occurs, using both targeted (e,g, genetic knockdown) and unbiased  (e.g. microarray) approaches. Third, we will assess the possibility of treating patients with rapamycin in a small  clinical trial by first treating Dr. Hirano's mouse model of TK2 deficiency, which causes mtDNA depletion  (synergy with Projects 1 and 3).   If successful, the use of rapamycin or similar compounds could become the basis of the first rational  treatment of mtDNA-based OxPhos diseases."

Findings  in the current research have suggested 1) white matter is abnormal in both structure and function; 2)  significant psychosocial problems as MPS children age; and 3) need for better measurements. Our specific  aims are 1) to study corpus callosum and white matter volumes, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a new  MRI technique, resting state fMRI, by disease subtype over time compared to normal controls and in  relationship to neuropsychological functions such as attention. 2) We will examine the impact of biological,  environmental, and disease related factors on emotional and social function. 3) We will develop more precise  outcome measures. In particular, we will develop an MPS-specific and sensitive quality-of-life measure that  will measure both physical and psychosocial difficulties. Measurement of gait, physical symptom severity,  pain, and disability will also be considered in relationship to emotional/social function and quality-of-life.  Methods: We will accomplish this with 120+ patients, recruited in the past 4 years from 6 centers (70 MPS  I, 30 MPS II, and 20 MPS VI). Each patient will be seen for a total of 3 or 4 follow-up visits with quantitative  neuroimaging (volumetrics/DTI for all; fMRI for older patients) and neuropsychological tests (IQ, attention,  memory, visual spatial) as well as adaptive behavior, quality-of-life and emotion including behavior,  temperament, and self-esteem. Data will be analyzed for 1) age changes in white matter and psychological  adjustment, 2) the sensitivity of measures to disease progression, and 3) variables that contribute to  outcomes. These results will enable prevention and interventions to enhance long-term functional outcomes."
"9274832","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant proposes experiments to resolve critical viral DNA packaging initiation and translocation issues. Bacteriophage T4 DNA packaging mechanisms are widely shared among comparable phages packed with dsDNA through a prohead portal by comparable motor proteins (2), where the large terminase subunit (TerL) is responsible for translocation and the small terminase (TerS) for packaging initiation-cutting of the concatemer. Specific Aim 1 will establish the large gp17 (TerL) translocation mechanism. We propose a DNA crunching linear motor mechanism that employs a grip-and-release transient spring-like compression of B- to A-form- DNA. Our FRET measurements directly support this mechanism in a packaging stalled Y-DNA substrate in vitro that show a decrease in distance from terminase to portal; furthermore, there is a decrease in distance between closely positioned dye pairs in the Y-stem DNA that conforms to B- and A- structure. In normal translocation the TerL motor expels all B-form tightly binding YOYO-1 dye that cannot bind A-form. The motor cannot package A-form dsRNA or A-form DNA:RNA heteroduplexes. Our work shows that addition of helper B- form DNA:DNA (D:D) 20mers allows (D:R) packaging of heteroduplex A-form DNA:RNA 20mers (D:R), additional evidence for a B- to A-form spring motor. Additionally, kinetic analyses of fluorescent dye release, TerL cross-linking of photo-linkable dye, and high resolution structural data will provide support and insight into this proposed B-form to A-form motor mechanism. Crystallography and cryo-EM of TerL domains docked to proheads, portals, and to a clip region of the portal will confirm that the C-terminal nuclease domain of the terminase docks to the portal, as shown by FRET and SDM analysis. Specific Aim 2 will establish the role of the small terminase subunit gp16 (TerS) of phage T4 in DNA pac site interaction and in packaging initiation by a twin TerS ring mechanism. FRET measurements and superresolution microscopy will confirm that the T4 TerS protein acts in a double ring form to initiate packaging. Functional TerS-GFP and TerS-mCherry fusion proteins in vitro and in vivo serve as standards. FRET work shows that a ts mutant form of the TerS protein forms rings at low but not high temperature, showing ring formation is required for function. How do the double 22mer and single 11mer rings found in TerS protein-only preparations relate to DNA packaging? Strong genetic evidence supports synapsis of two homologous pac DNAs by a twin ring form of the TerS that opposes a four stranded pac DNA structure to judge by Holliday junction strand swapping DNA concatemer maturation for packaging initiation."
"9408994","ABSTRACT  Current clinical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective cancer treatment that is non-invasive and low- cost, but it has yet to become a mainstream, frontline treatment. The clinical efficacy of PDT in solid tumors depends on significant accumulation of the photosensitizer (PS) at the tumor site, availability of oxygen near the photosensitizer, and effective dosing of the drug-light combination. Our new platform for delivery and imaging of photosensitizers, entitled nano-enabled PDT (nePDT), will enhance all three of these areas, raising PDT?s therapeutic index and enabling PDT to reach its full clinical potential.  nePDT comprises a core of oxygen-rich liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) containing indocyanine green (ICG) dye stabilized by a lipid shell which houses the photosensitizer (PS) and also provides binding sites for cancer cell targeting antibodies. The ICG dye is used to trigger a liquid to gas phase change of the PFC which serves two purposes: (1) it delivers PS and additional O2 to the cell cytosol (acting as a nanosyringe) and (2) the vaporization event creates a giant acoustic transient which can be detected using combined photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging and used to visualize the distribution of drug delivery at the tumor site. From the rich 3D spatial information received by PAUS imaging of the drug distribution, light intensity and duration dosimetry for effective PDT can be calculated. This personalized dosimetry will ensure patients receive the correct therapy dose customized for their tumor.  The promise of PDT to provide localized therapy with minimal residual damage or side effects to healthy tissues is remarkable. We are excited to introduce this new nePDT platform that will enhance specific delivery of PS to the tumor, increase efficacy of therapy through O2 delivery (especially to hypoxic tumors), and ultimately create a personalized patient specific dose enabled by PAUS imaging. While PDT has the potential to treat a variety of diseases, we chose head and neck cancer generally, and specifically oral cancer, for an initial target application due to the unmet clinical need for minimal intervention, minimal scarring to reduce cosmetic and functional defects, and the superficial location of these tumors which provides light accessibility. nePDT is a revolutionary new nanoplatform capable of removing the roadblocks to widespread therapeutic efficacy and clinical success for PDT."

"9388808","PROJECT SUMMARY  Notably, since its inception as an NIH Autism Center in 2003, the UCLA Center for Autism Research and  Treatment (CART) took the lead in developing advanced training in behavioral, clinical, and health services  research in the field of autism, as well as disseminating these research findings to the community. Within this  ACE Center renewal, one of the primary aims of the Dissemination, Outreach, and Education Core (Core D)  activities will be to strengthen community partnerships to enhance our dissemination and outreach practices to  further encompass those from diverse racial and ethnic groups and disadvantaged backgrounds, while  continuing our long established practice of providing education and training to the next generation of autism  researchers. We will broaden our community ties through formalized partnerships with mental health agencies  and schools in ethnically diverse and under-resourced areas in order to reach stakeholders in  underrepresented areas throughout Los Angeles. To this end, the specific aims of Core D include: (1)  strengthening our community partnerships to ensure successful recruitment and retention of study participants  from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and those from disadvantaged backgrounds; (2) establishing  an infrastructure to optimize outreach and promote two-way communication between CART investigators and  the community of individuals with ASD, their caregivers, and other stakeholders through the sharing of current  research, as well as the discussion of feasibility about proposed studies; (3) translating and disseminating  accessible research findings to research participants, stakeholders, and the broader scientific and practitioner  communities through community-focused and University-based cross-center training activities; and (4)  developing new interdisciplinary training and mentorship initiatives in autism research for graduate students,  post-doctoral fellows, and early career investigators, including those from diverse racial and ethnic  backgrounds and those who are new to the field of autism. While Dissemination and Outreach are considered  fundamental components of Core D within the ACE Centers, the inclusion of Education within this Core is a  unique aspect of this proposal and underscores the importance which the UCLA CART places upon the  training of future generations of autism researchers. Our ultimate goal though Core D is to develop a pathway  toward interdisciplinary research that is enriched through the consideration of the needs and expectations of  the community, and through the inclusion of more racially and ethnically diverse groups, from research  participants to the scientists who serve them."
"9334294","PROJECT SUMMARY To advance HIV-related basic research, optimize the development and implementation of efficacious and effective HIV preventive interventions and strategies, support the integration of research disciplines (e.g., basic science, policy, implementation), and facilitate the use of emerging technologies to halt the spread of HIV, we need to use optimal theories and scientific methods. However, HIV research presents a challenge in determining which, from a continually growing list of research methods and data collection and intervention delivery technologies, best suit the needs of particular research questions and projects. Moreover, existing methodologies may be insufficient to address a specific research need. Additional challenges include increasingly rigorous and complex standards for data sharing and reporting results. The Methods Core ensures that CAPS investigators are equipped to meet these challenges. Investigators require timely and specialized input to learn, select, and implement best practices in developing research questions, in designing studies and measurement instruments, and in data acquisition, management, and analysis. To meet these needs, the Methods Core will promote the use of optimal methods through carrying out our specific aims: 1) Supporting, training and consulting on innovative research designs and methods; 2) Promoting development and use of new and emerging methods in HIV prevention research, and 3) Enhancing the use of cutting-edge technologies in HIV prevention research. The Methods Core collaborates with and supports CAPS scientists through all steps of the research process, from idea generation and theory testing through applying research methods in intervention development and implementation to the dissemination of final results. Reflecting the Center's long-term goals in the proposed funding period, the Core will continue its strong record of support for CAPS scientists in a broad variety of new and existing research methods while expanding its focus on new methods development and technologies. Via these activities the Methods Core will contribute crucially to the research needed to end the HIV epidemic."
"9513086","PROJECT SUMMARY This project will test the hypothesis that bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity regulates gut motility in a dose-dependent manner via signaling pathways in the enteric nervous system (ENS) that include RET, a tyrosine kinase receptor critical for ENS development and function, and TGR5, the only bile acid receptor known to be expressed by enteric neurons. To explore this hypothesis, I will integrate various technologies to produce functional readouts, combining a gnotobiotic mouse model of diet-dependent bile acid-mediated motility phenotypes with mass spectrometry, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics. In Aim 1, I propose to determine the extent to which gut motility is regulated by bacterial BSH activity. First, bacterial strains cultured from the microbiota of a single healthy Bangladeshi individual will be classified as possessing high, mid-level, or low BSH activity using an established in vitro screen. These strains have undergone preliminary screening to establish presence or absence of BSH; here I will characterize BSH activity with time-scale resolution down to 3 hours and with respect to the two predominant primary bile acid substrates in mice (taurocholic acid and tauro-beta-muricholic acid). Then, selected strains with high/mid/low BSH activity will be transplanted into gnotobiotic mice to determine (i) the extent to which BSH activity correlates with gut motility and (ii) whether BSH's motility effects are robust to taxonomic diversity (essential for understanding generalizability of the findings). In the future, I aim to initiate a clinical study to test the hypothesis that gut bacterial BSH activity correlates with motility in patients with diarrhea- or constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, in order to identify subsets in whom bacterial bile acid metabolism could serve as a therapeutic target. In Aim 2, I propose to identify key ENS mediators of the effects of microbiome-encoded BSH activity on gut motility. To determine whether the TGR5 bile acid receptor is responsible for mediating this bile acid- dependent response, I will use conventionally raised and gnotobiotic Tgr5-/- mice. To identify key ENS molecular mediators and pathways, I will adopt TRAP-Seq (translating ribosome affinity purification sequencing), a technology developed to study distinct populations of the mouse brain, to profile the ENS in gnotobiotic mice. Using this approach, I will elucidate the effects of a cholekinetic agent (turmeric) and model human gut bacterial communities with defined BSH activity on the ENS transcriptome in the small intestine and colon, correlating these signals with measured transit times and bile acid profiles. Together, these data obtained from humanized gnotobiotic mice will help dissect the extent to which bacterial bile acid metabolism regulates gut motility and provide mechanistic insights regarding interactions between dietary ingredients, the gut microbiome, and ENS signaling pathways that regulate motility. Follow-up future studies will involve transplanting intact uncultured microbiota from selected well-phenotyped humans with motility disorders into gnotobiotic mice."
"9349502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is responsible for about 2 million deaths each year worldwide and its incidence is rising. Increasing evidence indicates that patients who survive an episode of AKI will have a significant risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and even to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although the severity and frequency of AKI are shown to be closely correlated with poor patient prognosis, the mechanisms governing the different courses of long-term outcome after AKI remains poorly understood. We recently found that interstitial fibroblasts play a central role in orchestrating kidney repair or progression to CKD after AKI, depending on the severity of the insults. There is bidirectional crosstalk between the injured tubular cells and interstitial fibroblasts, mediated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Such an epithelial-mesenchymal communication (EMC) dictates fibroblast cell fate and ultimately the course of AKI outcome. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this application is that fibroblast activation, if transient ad self- limiting, is necessary and advantageous for promoting tubular repair and regeneration, whereas sustained fibroblast activation drives AKI to CKD progression. Several lines of investigation are proposed to test this novel hypothesis. Aim 1 is to investigate the role of transient fibroblast activation in kidney repair and recovery after AKI. Aim 2 is designed to investigate the role of sustained fibroblast activation in promoting AKI-CKD progression. Aim 3 is to investigate the role of EMC in promoting renin-angiotensin system activation and CKD progression. The successful completion of these studies will offer novel insights into the importance and significance of interstitial fibroblasts in dictating kidney repair or progression t CKD after AKI. Undoubtedly, the data generated from this application will have wide implications in designing future therapeutic strategies for preventing AKI to CKD progression in patients."
"9340294","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many cell surface proteins (CSPs) that are essential for neural development have been identified, but we still lack an overall understanding of the logic of the cell-cell interactions that program the assembly of neural circuits. Our long-term goal is to understand how cell-cell interactions mediated by CSPs program the assembly of the intricate synaptic patterns of nervous systems. Many years ago, it was proposed that in ?hard- wired? systems such as the fish optic tectum and the insect CNS and neuromuscular system, each neuron or neuronal type is labeled by ?identification tags? that control synaptic specificity, and that these tags are represented by specific CSPs called ?surface labels?. The original hypotheses predicted that surface labels that control synaptic specificity should be: 1) expressed on small subsets of neurons or muscles, 2) recognized by receptors whose expression is also restricted to small subsets of neurons (and might themselves be surface labels), 3) required for or influence the formation of specific synaptic connections, 4) encoded by families of related genes. We discovered a network of interacting CSPs that satisfies all of these criteria, using a new approach in which we selected proteins for in vivo analysis from a global in vitro interaction network. The Garcia group at Stanford and our group at Caltech generated an extracellular ?interactome? for all Drosophila immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, and found a subfamily of 21 2-Ig domain cell-surface proteins, the Dprs, that selectively binds to another subfamily of 9 3-Ig domain proteins, the DIPs. Each dpr and DIP gene is expressed by a small and unique subset of neurons, and mutations in these genes produce specific alterations in synaptic connectivity. The objectives of the present application are to define whether and how interactions between Dprs and DIPs constitute a ?connectivity code? that contributes to wiring specificity in the Drosophila larval neuromuscular system. The primary hypothesis underlying this application is that engagement of Dprs with their DIP partners provides information that can control synaptic targeting decisions. We plan to attain the objectives of this application through three specific aims. The first of these examines how Dpr-DIP interactions control formation of an axon branch of a specific motor neuron. The second analyzes how another DIP expressed on a single motor neuron controls innervation of its muscle target. The third creates tools for analysis of all Dprs and DIPs and identifies those expressed by specific motor neurons and muscles. The expected outcome of the proposed research will be the acquisition of new insights into the mechanisms by which interactions among CSPs control the specification of synaptic connections in a relatively simple model system. This will have a significant positive impact for human health by increasing our understanding of conserved mechanisms involved in nervous system development and disease in humans."

"9358314","Abstract Genomic testing has become integrated into cancer care. Physicians routinely order tumor sequencing analyzing hundreds of genes to identify options for personalized treatment. Unfortunately, the vast majority of physicians are poorly trained in applied genetics let alone genomics. Pathologists play a key role in tumor genomic testing and, since 2012, the Training Residents in Genomics (TRIG) Working Group, a multi-organizational committee, has utilized R25 grant funding to develop a national pathology resident cancer genomics curriculum. There has been remarkable progress with over 20 innovative international team-based learning (TBL) workshops, creation of online resources and novel use of a national Resident In-Service Exam (RISE) to gauge progress in genomics curriculum implementation. To continue to ensure adequate pathology resident cancer genomics education, and given the rapidly changing field, a major aim of this grant renewal application is to revise, evaluate and further promote the TRIG curriculum and utilize the RISE as an evaluation tool. Another major proposed objective is to adapt the TRIG model to undergraduate medical education. As almost every physician will treat patients with cancer or cancer survivors and assist in cancer prevention and risk assessment, all require some knowledge of cancer genomics. A logical starting point is medical school but there is evidence of a need for educational resources. To fill this gap, utilizing the Undergraduate Training in Genomics (UTRIG) Working Group, a multi-organizational committee made up of medical school pathology course directors and experts in genetics, a national medical student cancer genomics curriculum will be developed along with tools for implementation including rigorously vetted workshops, an instructor handbook and online modules. To gauge progress, the RISE-FIRST exam will be utilized. Given to approximately 400 pathology residents annually during their first month of training, the results can provide valuable information on the current level of undergraduate genomics education in the United States.  "
"9328791","PROJECT SUMMARY Developing functional engineered blood vessels has been a long-standing goal in tissue engineering and as a bridge to treatment of vascular diseases and disorders. A thorough understanding of the complex multi-step mechanisms governing post-natal vasculogenesis is required for success in this field. Although ground- breaking work ranging from in vitro testing to clinical trials has revealed many important players in this process and uncovered one mechanism for vasculogenesis, another observed phenomenon has yet to be recapitulated in vitro. In general, tissues in need of vascular regeneration are hypoxic. Indeed, hypoxia is a key environmental factor driving production of pro-angiogenic factors. Interestingly, observational findings indicate circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are recruited to such hypoxic regions, wherein they attach to the damaged endothelium, egress into the extravascular space, form multicellular clusters, then sprout to anastomose with existing blood vessels and accelerate reperfusion. By incorporating vital microenvironmental factors, such as oxygen gradients and substrate mechanics, into design of an in vitro 3D testing platform, an unprecedented level of biomimicry can be reached and this process can be accurately reproduced. The goal of the proposed work is to develop an in vitro system to study this process and determine the mechanism by which the process occurs, to ultimately design novel therapeutics and advance the functionality of engineered tissues. The aims of the proposed work are as follows: (1) Engineer a hydrogel matrix to study hypoxic cluster- based vasculogenesis; (2) Elucidate mechanisms of hypoxic EPC cluster formation; and (3) Study hypoxic cluster-based vascular network formation through dynamic control of matrix mechanics. These aims bring a multidisciplinary approach to understanding this process, by combining the use of engineering tools with basic science. Upon successful completion of these aims, precise regulation of the cluster-based vasculogenetic process will be possible, thus creating new opportunities in treating vascular diseases and disorders."
"9354523","Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world?s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV."
"9263535","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders (AXD) occur in up to one-third of individuals with alcohol dependence seeking treatment and are associated with poor treatment response in people who have comorbid alcohol use disorders (AUD). Despite the major personal and public health impact of this comorbidity, effective treatments have not been established and there is a lack of adequate research to guide treatment decisions. In recent work we have demonstrated that the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP; Barlow, Farchione, et al., 2011) significantly reduced heavy drinking in comorbid AUD/AXD disorders, but venlafaxine, a drug approved by the US FDA for treatment of anxiety, did not have an effect on drinking, despite decreasing anxiety and depression. In clinical trials that we conducted zonisamide (ZON) administration reduced alcohol consumption in individuals with AUD, as reflected by decreased percent days with heavy drinking; decreased drinks consumed per day, and decreased percent days with any drinking. The current proposal will examine an established transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral intervention for emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders), the UP, relative to ZON, a medication that directly influences alcohol consumption without working through the mechanism of anxiety reduction. The central focus of this proposal is to examine the efficacy of UP and ZON in reducing alcohol consumption in patients with comorbid AUD/AXD, relative to a low intensity behavioral treatment control consisting of Take Control (TC), a novel form of psychotherapy for AUD that we developed in collaboration with the NIAAA, in combination with pill placebo (PLC). We propose a placebo- controlled, double-blind clinical trial with three groups: 1) UP, 2) ZON, and 3) TC+PLC. After screening, all participants will receive treatment for 16 weeks. ZON will be reduced during study weeks 17 and 18, following a post-treatment assessment, and follow-up measures will be obtained one month and six months after the post-treatment assessment. Alcohol consumption will be assessed using both ecological momentary assessment and the time-line follow back procedures. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating scales, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 will be used to measure anxiety and depression. Complementing these assessments are additional scales examining higher- order temperamental variables and core psychopathological mechanisms related to emotional dysregulation that have been shown to contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders and may account for the high amount of diagnostic overlap seen clinically. Further, we will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine the effects of UP and ZON on changes in brain glutamate (Glu), GSH, and GABA levels, and analyze blood samples to measure GSH and other oxidative stress biomarkers. Using MRS to measure changes in these neurochemicals during treatment may lead to a better mechanistic understanding of UP and ZON, and possibly help optimize use of these treatments in patients with AUD."
"9335594","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic inflammation is a major cause of cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Inflammation is a complex topic, with both positive and negative effects on disease and therapy, and if we are to understand the pathological results and therapeutic benefits we need to better understand the mechanisms of where inflammation originates. The big picture in which this proposal is set is to understand the mechanisms of inflammation as they relate to regulated cell death. This application seeks to substantially advance current approaches, concepts, and technology to delve deeply into the inflammatory consequences of cell death and the connections between the cell death mechanisms. We combine biochemistry, cell biology, genome editing, non-animal models of inflammation, protein engineering, and chemical biology to explore linked pro- and anti- inflammatory cell death mechanisms. We propose that a robust and quantitative approach to defining inflammation is an important innovative quality of this proposal. The main goals of this proposal are to 1) compute the difference in inflammatory mediators released as a result of apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis in macrophages, 2) define the mechanism of cytokine release from cells undergoing inflammatory cell death, and 3) understand the activation mechanisms of caspases in pyroptosis, and synthesize highly selective fluorescent probes to allow for direct visualization of specific caspase activation."

"9537720","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exome sequencing (ES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are transformative new tools for discovery of genetic risk factors for both rare and common diseases and offer the potential of personalized genetic risk profiling in a single, cost-effective test. Because of the large number of variant results simultaneously identified, the number of results with potential clinical utility-including those that are unanticipated, and the evolving utility of results over time-use of these technologies challenges existing models of returning results to research subjects and patients. This has generated widespread interest in developing and testing innovative strategies for returning results from ES/WGS studies. Almost all strategies currently being studied, however, focus on returning results to European Americans-despite evidence of differences among racial and ethnic groups for preferences for results, the interpretation of clinical utility, and the impact of receiving geetic results. This situation reflects the broader challenge of involving racial and ethnic minority communities in genetic research in order to ensure parity in the benefits of advances in genomic medicine. Accordingly, it is imperative that we understand the attitudes and preferences of racial and ethnic minorities toward genomic research and specifically return of ES/WGS results, and assess the outcome of receiving ES/WGS and its impact on minority participation. I am choosing to devote my career to further the ethical and scientific translation of genomics to benefit all people, especially underserved racial and ethnic minorities. Through formal training at leading research institutions, mentored research and publications with experts in their respective fields, I will capitalize on my prior training in public health genetics and complete my transition to an independent investigator by (1) acquiring skills in quantitative survey development, conduct, and analysis; (2) acquire skills to work with culturally diverse racial and ethnic minority communities to conduct collaborative research; and (3) broaden my understanding of theoretical and empirical work on group harms and benefits from bioethics, anthropology and the social sciences. To compliment my formal training, I will utilize these skills to conduct two mentored research projects including (1) a survey of healthcare providers and community leaders who serve racial and ethnic minority communities and (2) focus groups with racially and ethnically diverse adults, about participation in genetic research and return of ES/WGS results. In the independent phase of this proposal, I will (1) characterize and describe attitudes of underserved populations toward return of ES/WGS results by using a survey and (2) characterize individual preferences for receiving ES/WGS incidental finding through interviews with participants who are using a newly developed web-based tool called My46. Also using this tool, I will (3) study the outcomes of returning ES/WGS incidental findings to a cohort of African American individuals."
"9324076","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for osteoporosis and fracture due to host, viral and in particular, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated factors. In China, as in other low- and middle-income countries, access to ART for individuals with HIV has increased dramatically over the past decade, however infrastructure for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis is still severely lacking.  Certain ARTs, including tenofovir, exert an especially profound effect on bone. In 2012, tenofovir was made available as first-line ART for individuals with HIV in China. Our prior research suggests that tenofovir therapy leads to higher levels of bone resorption at two years among Chinese individuals with HIV compared with data from non-Chinese populations. However no studies have evaluated the impact of this robust and prolonged bone resorption on bone mineral density (BMD), nor addressed the challenges of developing fracture risk reduction strategies for this population that are targeted and pragmatic.  Our current proposal seeks to bridge these gaps by exploring the application of quantitative ultrasound (QUS), a portable and low-cost method of assessing BMD that has been shown to reliably predict fracture. We will first establish a longitudinal cohort of Chinese individuals with HIV in Beijing, and follow them prospectively over two years to measure change in BMD after initiation of tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz therapy using dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the gold standard for BMD measurement. We will then use latent class analysis to identify subgroups of individuals at greatest risk for bone loss within the overall cohort, and the risk factors that predict categorization into each subgroup. All patients will have concurrent QUS measurements, allowing us to determine whether QUS is capable of identifying the same latent subgroups compared with DXA. Finally, we will perform a mixed-methods assessment of facilitators and barriers to implementation of potential fracture risk reduction strategies in a low-resource HIV-care setting in China, and evaluate feasibility and uptake of components that can be applied in future intervention trials. Our overarching goal is to provide an algorithm for identifying individuals at greatest need for fracture risk reduction, and targeted interventions that can be incorporated into the long-term care of patients with HIV in settings with limited resources.  My longstanding commitment to global health research has prompted me to pursue global health training opportunities abroad to gain hands on experience in carrying out international collaborative research projects. As a Rheumatology fellow and PhD candidate, I assembled a strong multidisciplinary mentorship team at Yale and Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China to strengthen my training. In the current proposal, these two sites will continue to serve as outstanding training grounds to foster my development into an independent investigator in global health with a focus on improving outcomes for musculoskeletal and rheumatic diseases among vulnerable populations in resource-limited environments."
"9371317","Project Summary/Abstract  The K22 applicant, Dr. Steven Sizemore, obtained his Ph.D. in the laboratory of Dr. Graham Casey at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. His dissertation research focused on the fundamental mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis. The candidate's training continued as a Department of Defense CDMRP Breast Cancer Research Program supported postdoctoral fellow at Case Western Reserve University. This work concentrated on identifying the molecular drivers of basal-like breast cancer. Currently, the candidate is a Senior Research Associate at The Ohio State University James Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC). The OSUCCC is ranked by the National Cancer Institute as an ?exceptional? center and provides a vibrant and collaborative environment in which the candidate has continued his training towards his long-term goal of becoming tenure-track faculty at a Research I level university. The candidate's current work, on which this proposal is based, centers on identifying the master regulators of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) metastasis and is supported through a seed grant from the OSUCCC. STS is a diverse collection of cancers of mesenchymal origin. The 5-year survival for patients with metastatic STS is a dismal 16% and there are few treatment options for these patients. The long-term objective of this research is to address the urgent, unmet need for a better understanding of the key molecular pathways that drive metastasis in STS and identify inhibitors of these pathways to improve the treatment options for advanced STS. In pursuit of this objective, the candidate identified the phosphatase subunit PPP2R1B as a suppressor of STS metastasis and one of its phosphoprotein targets, RALA, as a putative actionable target for treating advanced STS. This proposal will thoroughly test the hypothesis that RALA, and the closely related RALB, are important and targetable drivers of STS tumor growth and metastasis that regulate STS progression, at least in part, by controlling exosome production. Specific Aim 1: will test the functional requirement of the RAL isoforms and their effectors in STS growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo by coupling genetic silencing of these isoforms with rescue experiments utilizing specific interaction-deficient RAL mutants. Specific Aim 2: will investigate the essential requirement of the RAL isoforms and their effectors in exosome production by STS cells and determine if these RAL-dependent exosomes control tumor growth and metastasis. Specific Aim 3: will utilize STS cell lines and patient derived xenografts to determine the effectiveness of RAL-targeting inhibitors as innovative treatments for STS. Successful completion of this proposal will identify an important actionable target for improved treatment of advanced STS and identify a novel mechanism regulating cancer exosomes. This award will allow the candidate the protected time required to transition his research from a breast cancer- focus to the understudied field of STS metastasis and acquire the additional training required to become a leader in the field of cancer-associated exosomes."
"9341380","Globally, young women bear a disproportionate burden of common mental disorders especially including depression and anxiety. Lifting this burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires task sharing, which entails using non-specialists and laypersons to deliver mental health services. Several trials of task sharing interventions in LMICs have shown modest improvement. Obstacles to further progress include lack of evidence regarding what conditions should be treated, with what interventions, by whom, and how to overcome access obstacles. This R21 application advances knowledge about task sharing by developing and testing for feasibility a stepped care model for LMICs using primary care (PC) nurses and mental health peers to treat depression and anxiety. It also integrates neuroscience-based prediction models by investigating how low-cost, brief Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) tools can assist in evaluating and targeting stepped care. RDoC is an NIMH initiative to use dimensional, disease agnostic, brain based tools to better understand the key features of mental illness. The research takes place in Tajikistan, a low-income country, where Dr. Weine has currently funded R01, K24, and D43 research on migration and mental health and health. In Tajikistan, women are exposed to separation from their migrant husbands, violence both within and outside of the home, STIs transmitted by their spouses, as well as high mental illness stigma, restricted service access, and severely limited treatment resources. Aim 1 better characterizes the mental health needs, supports, resources, and barriers to care of women with depression (including with co-occurring anxiety) recruited from one primary care clinic in Dushanbe, through qualitative interviews and focus groups. Aim 2 forms an intervention design team that builds on knowledge gained through Aim 1 and on two existing interventions (BRIDGES and Interpersonal Psychotherapy) to develop a novel stepped care model that includes: 1) PC nurse and physician led screening and triage; 2) peer and PC nurse co-led psycho-education and support groups; 3) peer or PC nurse led Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and; 4) PC physician led medication treatment. Aim 3 assesses the feasibility and acceptability of the stepped care model with 45 women who have depression (including with co-occurring anxiety) recruited from a primary care clinic in Dushanbe, and whether brief tools assessing RDoC subconstructs of acute threat and cognitive control, predict or moderate pre-post changes. It builds on Dr. Weine?s strong collaborative partnerships with Tajik mental health and health leaders and researchers at the Prisma Research Center in Dushanbe, as well as the Tajikistan Ministry of Health and the Republican Psychiatric Center. This study will result in an adapted and piloted stepped care model that we hope to test in a subsequent R01 study. It will also result in increased capacity for mental health research that will augment Weine?s K24 and D43 research training program. The study addresses Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal C to foster integration of mental health into primary care, and NIMH Strategic Aim 3 by developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. It will help to build an evidence-based program that can then be introduced into public health services in Tajikistan."
"9545378","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in women are a source of illness, pain, and embarrassment, which can affect work, social interactions, and athletic and recreational activities in women from adolescence to old age. Almost 50% of women will experience LUTS at some point in their lifetime. Symptoms are harmful enough in themselves, but untreated, they can lead to more serious problems such as incontinence, infections, pelvic inflammation and psychological distress. The NIDDK program on Prevention of Lower Urinary tract Symptoms in women Research Consortium (PLUS-RC) is intended to broadly identify and evaluate the relative importance of the risk and protective factors for LUTS by conducting the necessary research studies to establish the scientific basis for future prevention intervention studies for lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions in women. Knowledge of such risk factors can lead to interventional strategies, which may be testable in future clinical trials. Specific aims of the PLUS-RC Scientific and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) are to (1) conduct reviews of literature and meta-analyses of previous publications; (2) with the other PLUS-RC investigators, plan, design, and prioritize new epidemiologic and clinical studies of LUTS and implement an ancillary studies program; (3) provide data coordination and monitoring capabilities in support of PLUS-RC research studies; (4) provide comprehensive and innovative data analyses in support of presentation and publication of results, and construct high-quality datasets, which will be available to other researchers; and (5) provide logistical support for meetings and conference calls of the Steering and Planning Committee, all subcommittees, and an External Expert Panel for the efficient and ethical execution of consortium objectives. We bring together a uniquely strong team with a long history of accomplishment in biostatistics, epidemiology, and the conduct of large multi-center studies, extensive expertise in meta-analysis, observational data analysis, epidemiology specifically related to women's health, skills in behavioral modification and prevention science, and clinical care experience in the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS in women."
"9513819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        This application is to renew the T32 ES09250-25 training grant entitled, Environmental Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis (ECM) which has been under the direction of Dr. Stambrook since its inception in 1986. Dr. Alvaro Puga has been a mentor in the Program since early in its history and has served as Associate Director for the past five-year budget period, a role in which he will continue. The focus of the ECM training program initially was exclusively on environmental carcinogenesis and mutagenesis as its title implied. Since that time, the Program has evolved scientifically and conceptually. It also grew from its modest beginnings to its current optimal size when the NIEHS directed that it be merged with a smaller training program in toxicology. By this merger, the Program became more diverse which has proven to be extremely valuable to the trainees. The investigators have, therefore, made every effort to retain this diversity of disciplines to enhance cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques between the trainees. Thus, the trainees are able to cogently discuss the impact of environmental exposures in terms of genetics and toxicology and ultimately in the context of human disease, including cancer. One of the emphases of the ECM Training Program is to train the fellows to appreciate the mechanistic relationships between environmental challenges and their toxicological and carcinogenic outcomes. The consequence of this strategy has been a robust cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches. To preserve this wide range of disciplines, the Program maintains a participating faculty who derive from seven different departments. Thus, the ECM continues to build on its past successes, with graduates in academic, regulatory and industry leadership positions and it continues to fulfill a national need to train individuals in the impact of environmental exposure relating to biological, oncological and toxicological endpoints and human disease. Since its inception, the Program has emphasized recruitment of under-represented minorities, and has been successful in this endeavor. Institutionally, the Program brings together the research efforts of several laboratories to provide a common focus on exposure and environmental health, and facilitates collaborations between these laboratories. The ECM encourages trainees to engage in research that combines the expertise of several laboratories. These interactions are facilitated by biweekly journal club meetings where trainees alternatively present a topical paper or present their data. Pre-doctoral trainees all have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in a chemical, biological or physical science with superior academic achievements. Many have won awards and recognition while in the Program. Postdoctoral candidates are selected based on proven academic accomplishments and hold the degrees of Ph.D., D.V.M. or M.D., and like pre-doctoral trainees are selected from a national pool of applicants. This renewal application requests pre-doctoral (8) and postdoctoral (4) positions, a size that the investigators find optimal for the mission and goals of this Program."
"9371003","SUMMARY  Kidney stones, of which the most common are calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, affect 7 to 12% of the United States population and are responsible for 3% of all end-stage renal disease cases. Urine oxalate is derived from approximately 50% dietary sources and 50% from endogenous synthesis through various pathways. Though it is well established that approximately 80% of the endogenous oxalate is produced in the liver, the pathways for oxalate production are not well characterized. Our hypothesis is that glycolate is a major source of oxalate and that the renal reabsorption of glycolate leads to renal synthesis of oxalate. Establishing the role of glycolate in renal and liver synthesis of oxalate has implications for patients with the hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria (PH), in which excessive endogenous oxalate production leads to severe recurrent CaOx kidney stones. Establishing these pathways could lead to new treatments to inhibit glycolate oxidation, resulting in reduced oxalate production.  This proposal will 1) test if the metabolism of glycolate contributes to endogenous oxalate synthesis by performing primed, steady state, continuous intravenous infusions of the stable isotope of glycolate, carbon- 13 glycolate, in healthy volunteers. 2) test the hypothesis that glycolate is metabolized to oxalate in proximal tubule cells using a human proximal tubule cell line and freshly isolated human proximal tubule fragments and 3) determine renal reabsorption and metabolism of glycolate using isolated rat kidney perfusions. The roles of the enzyme hydroxyacid oxidase 2 (HAO2) and glyoxylate reductase (GR) will be defined in the context of this conversion.  The mentoring team and training plan associated with this proposal will ensure that the candidate reaches the level of expertise in analytical chemistry, metabolic research, and human and animal studies that are necessary to meet her goals. The candidate's long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program in the field of oxalate metabolism and the clinical disorders associated with it, including the primary hyperoxalurias."
"9328086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a training program focused on translational vision science from an established group of vision scientists. We request funds for six predoctoral students with a training focus in translational vision science to reflect the current strengths of the vision faculty as well as current NEI research priorities. Thi is an exciting time to pursue a career in vision research, as molecular biology and imaging advances have allowed visual outcomes to be monitored in real time. Our vision community has become increasingly focused on translational research with well-known senior faculty who are highly respected investigators in vision research as well as younger investigators clearly on a trajectory for long term success. The training faculty consists of a core group of 6 NEI funded vision scientists and an additional 10 vision scientists who have actively funded research programs in translational vision research. With the arrival of our new chairperson in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Neurosciences, we have greatly increased the collaborations between vision scientists at the University of Minnesota and the clinical faculty in the medical school. Several key elements of our training program in Translational Vision Research include a course designed for trainees, Basic and Clinical Vision Sciences, co-taught by the training faculty in this proposal, and an annual Vision Symposium, where nationally known and in-house experts in vision science present their most recent research along with our trainees and faculty. Trainees will come from one of 4 programs: the Graduate Programs in Neuroscience; Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics; Psychology; Biomedical Engineering, or Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology. Trainees will be eligible for support once they have completed their first year of graduate school and have begun focused research under the mentorship of a grant preceptor, culminating in their thesis research. They will earn a Ph.D. or an M.D./Ph.D. and will be able to receive support from two to a maximum of four years. The diverse research interests of the vision scientists at the University of Minnesota, and the broad-based and collaborative nature in which they study the visual system - from molecular biology to visual perception - makes this an excellent environment for vision research with translatable components. Each trainer directs a successful research program and has demonstrated commitment to teaching and training. In addition, all trainees will be connected to a practicing Ophthalmologist in their research area, as well as expected to attend related grand rounds. An impressive array of scientific and institutional resources is available to the trainees, but their choice of vision research laboratories will be greatly facilitated by access to support from this training grant. As we move toward increasingly collaborative research between our basic and clinically trained faculty members, we believe this approach will maximize our ability to prepare vision scientists with a multi-disciplinary education needed to meet the audacious goals of the NEI - focused on preventing, treating, and rehabilitating blinding eye disease."
"9542608","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephritis is a common and serious manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus for which there is no adequate therapy. Some patients will exhibit a response to current immunosuppressive regimens while others will not; all are at risk for on and off target toxicities. The current proposal is to apply new technologies for high resolution analyses of gene expression and immunophenotype to kidney, blood and urine of lupus patients with active nephritis in order to develop a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and tissue injury, and stratify patients with respect to therapeutic response for more informed clinical decision making. We will explore blood and urine for less invasive surrogate markers for kidney inflammation. Our plan relies of optimization of analytic approaches, informed choice of cellular subpopulations to analyze, followed by two small studies to refine and validate the approach. In the first, we will study kidneys, blood and urine o 20 patients at a time of renal flare in order to dissect patterns of inflammation. In the second we will study cellular subsets in blood of 40 patients who were part of a clinical trial of lupus nephritis to understand changes from baseline profiles of gene expression and function response in those who experienced a full clinical response to therapy and those who failed to respond. Finally, we will use the information from these studies to design a large scale longitudinal study of patients with lupus nephritis. This unbiased re-examination of this unmet medical challenge should identify novel therapeutic targets, inform the generation of new models of disease, and lead to predictors of response that can then be validated in clinical trials We have unique technology resources and a powerful consortium of clinical investigators in the newly established Lupus Nephritis Trials Network that includes: (i) the infrastructure and expertise for clinical study implementation; (ii) protocols and consents for acquisition of blood, urine, and biopsy specimens; and (3) scalability to move from phase 0 and 1 to phase 2 at the appropriate time."
"9353317","Hematopoiesis is a complex, highly coordinated process in which proper function of cell-lineage and  stage-specific gene regulation required in order to instruct stem cells to undergo self-renewal or adopt  specific cell fates, and dysregulation of this process results in development of diseases such as Acute  Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Transcription factors such as CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein ? (C/EBPa) have been identified by our laboratory and others as playing a critical role in this process. Recently, a number of reports have Implicated epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation, in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenels. In this project, we will study the role of lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) In these processes, both with respect to their effects on C/EBPa, as well as on other targets. Including histones. These studies will lead to new understanding of how tissue-specific and lineage-specific gene expression is controlled through acetylation. Furthermore, since KATs work through an enzymatic activity, such studies may lead to development of new therapeutic approaches in AML. Therefore, the Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To investigate the role of acetylation of C/EBPa in granulopoiesis: In this aim, we will investigate how the transcription factor C/EBPa can be negatively or positively affected by GCN5 and TIP60 signaling pathways, respectively, at the post-translational level. We will specifically identify the site(s) acetylated by GCN5 and TIP60, and determine if C/EBPa acetylation is a stage or lineage(s) specific phenomenon. Our initial study suggests that GCN5 might represent a potential drug target for restoring C/EBPa function. Aim 2: To understand the role of two key epigenetic enzymes, the lysine acetyltransferases GCN5 and TIP60, in hematopoiesis and leukemia: Our studies will bridge between vast existing biochemical data on GCN5 and  TIP60 acetylases and chromatin remodeling activities to their in-vivo functions in hematopoiesis.  Furthermore, our studies will answer the question whether GCN5 or TIP60 are indispensable for  hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. This project will interact with most of the other projects in this  program, including investigating the interactions of acetyltransferases and their inhibition on BHS profiles (Project 1) and inhibitors of chromodomain proteins (Project 4). In addition, the project will utilize Core B for leukemic samples used in the project, as well as depend on biostatistic support (Core C). The ultimate aim is to develop new therapies based on these studies."

"9551736","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes. TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. A Clinical Events Committee masked to treatment assignment will adjudicate events. Principal secondary endpoints will include: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) a composite of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent MI, or stroke; and (3) safety."
"9507147","Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that control palate development (palatogenesis). Failure in palatogenesis results in cleft palate, which is one of the most common birth defects in humans. During the final phases of palatogenesis, the palatal periderm (a protective cell layer that prevents premature adhesion) must be removed in order for the medial edge epithelia (MEE) to properly adhere, which is prerequisite for establishment of the fused secondary palate. Previous studies have shown that transforming growth factor-?3 (TGF?3) plays an irreplaceable role in palate development, both in mice and humans, by regulating the fate of the MEE and adjacent periderm cells of fusing palatal shelves. Interestingly, truncated p63 (?Np63) protein levels are elevated in Tgfb3 knockout mice, while mice deficient in dNp63 or Irf6 are born with cleft palate resulting from the failure of the palatal epithelial cells to differentiate appropriately.  Our recent data are the first to suggest that Tgfb3 is expressed in both the MEE and periderm and is necessary for periderm desquamation. Interestingly, p63 (?Np63) protein isoform levels are elevated in Tgfb3 knockout mice, while mice deficient in dNp63 or Irf6 are born with cleft palate resulting from the failure of the palatal epithelial cells to differentiate appropriately. Despite our advances, the mechanisms by which TGF?3 regulates palatal shelf adherence remain largely unknown, because the role of peridermal cells was not recognized, the genetic tools used to study palatal epithelial biology were not appropriate and technologies for direct real time observation of cell behaviors in the fusing palatal shelves were not available.  Based on our preliminary and published data, we hypothesize that TGF?3 plays a cell-type autonomous role both in the periderm and underlying MEE, which is required to induce periderm desquamation during palatogenesis. The details of these mechanisms will be determined through execution of the following specific aims: in Aim 1 we propose to determine the cell-autonomous role of TGF?3 in palatal periderm removal during palatal epithelial fusion. In Aim 2 we will define the mechanisms, which regulate periderm generation and desquamation during palatogenesis, and in Aim 3 we will identify the mechanisms, by which the defective palatal shelf adhesion of Tgfb3-/- mice can be genetically rescued.  Successful completion of the proposed experiments will identify mechanisms by which TGF?3 signaling controls palatal shelf adhesion and fusion; this knowledge may contribute in development of more advanced therapeutic strategies in the future."
"9353794","Abstract/Project Summary  Glomerular disease is the third leading cause of end stage kidney disease in the US, with its related health care costs estimated at $4.1 billion annually. Immunosuppressive (IS) drugs are the primary therapies for most glomerular diseases, but ~20-50% of patients fail to achieve a remission. Unfortunately, in the absence of biomarkers to predict treatment responsiveness, many patients receive prolonged yet ineffective IS therapy, leaving them at high risk for both toxic side effects and disease progression. Since the prognostic factors and specific molecular pathways that are the most critical regulators of the various glomerular diseases are not yet known, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to prevent drug-induced toxicity, and to identify more targeted and effective treatments for glomerular disease. Our long-term goal is to identify prognostic biomarkers and molecular pathways that regulate glomerular injury, and use this knowledge to develop predictive biomarkers and more targeted treatments for glomerular disease. The specific objective of this proposal is to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and novel molecular pathways/targets for each of the four CureGN glomerular diseases by integrating state-of-the-art proteomic and metabolomic analyses of serial plasma samples from pediatric glomerular disease patients. Based on this, we hypothesize that integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses of serial clinically and histologically phenotyped pediatric plasma samples will identify novel biomarkers that predict treatment responsiveness, as well as molecular targets for targeted glomerular disease treatments. CureGN is a prospective observational study to clinically phenotype and collect serial blood and urine samples from 2,400 children and adults with four of the most common types of glomerular disease: MCNS, FSGS, MN, and IgAN. The rationale for this proposal is that integrating proteomic and metabolomic analyses of serial clinically and histologically phenotyped pediatric plasma samples will enable identification and validation of novel biomarkers that can predict glomerular disease treatment responsiveness, as well as novel molecular targets for future treatments. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare sequential pediatric plasma proteomic and metabolomic signatures to identify predictive biomarkers, and to differentiate molecular pathways that are distinctive or common among all four CureGN glomerular diseases, 2) To integrate proteomic and metabolomic data to identify combined predictive biomarkers, and to differentiate molecular pathways that are distinctive or common among all four CureGN glomerular diseases, and 3) To validate candidate biomarkers in independent CureGN pediatric samples. These studies will apply a state-of-the-art integrated proteomic and metabolomic systems biology approach to a large cohort of phenotyped pediatric plasma samples to identify and validate novel biomarkers that can predict treatment responsiveness, and identify new molecular targets for potential future glomerular disease treatments."
"9343069","Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) is the neuropathologicai term for a collection of rare neurodegenerative diseases that correspond to four main overlapping clinical syndromes: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS). There are currently no effective FTLD therapies, although new drugs are reaching the stage where clinical trials are warranted. The overarching goal of this proposal is to build a FTLD clinical research consortium (FTLD CRC) to support the development of FTLD therapies. The FTLD CRC will be headquartered at UCSF and will partner with six patient advocacy groups to manage the consortium. Patients will be evaluated at 13 clinical sites throughout North America, and a genetics core will genotype all individuals for FTLD associated genes. Clinical research projects will focus on specific FTLD syndromes where there is a strong correlation between clinical syndrome and underlying pathology, who are targeted for enrollment in new trials. Research Project 1 will collect cross-sectional data in sporadic FTLD patients using a new FTLD assessment battery, as well as screening all individuals for known FTLD-causing mutations and evidence of systemic inflammation, to prepare for trials of anti-tau and anti-inflammatory agents. Research Project 2 will collect longitudinal clinical and MRI data on familial FTLD (f-FTLD) individuals who carry mutations in MAPT, GRN and C90RF72 and their asymptomatic family members to enable disease prevention clinical trials. Our specific aims are to: 1) build a FTLD clinical trials network to facilitate the design and conduct of clinical trials, 2) determine the clinical, genetic and systemic inflammatory cytokine profile of sporadic FTLD targeted for new trials: semantic variant PPA, FTD with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and PSPS; 3) determine the natural history of asymptomatic and symptomatic f-FTLD patients using novel clinical measures and MR imaging over one year; 4) obtain pilot data using the new tau PET imaging agent PBB3 in FTLD, and other novel FTLD biomarkers and clinical tools that may be employed in future trials; 5) train clinical researchers focused on FTLD therapeutic development."
"9360076","SUMMARY-CORE 3 This Program Project comprises four individual projects, which will: implement evidence-based sequential multiple treatment assignment strategies for patients predicted to have insufficient response to their initial neoadjuvant targeted and/or chemotherapy (Project 1); qualify non-invasive imaging metrics for determining markers of non-response (Project 2); characterize the biology of non-responders to inform treatment selection (Project 3); and develop a portfolio of agents and decision tools for treatment re-assignment matched to biology of non-responding tumors (Project 4). The primary aims of the Leadership and Administration Core are to ensure program integration, collaboration and regulatory advancement by providing project management leadership and administrative support to the Projects and Cores in three areas: Aim 1: Provide project management and administrative oversight of all Projects and Cores. Aim 2: Coordinate scientific meetings and regular web and video conferences to facilitate project-wide communication, scientific interactions, and advancements in regulatory science. Aim 3: Act as a gateway to the existing I-SPY Program infrastructure, committees, and processes to enable the integration of products that emerge from the Program Project into the I-SPY 2 TRIAL through updates to the protocol and regulatory submissions. The leadership of this Core is deeply integrated within the existing structure of the I-SPY 2 network. This will enable the Program Project to efficiently and seamlessly leverage the substantial infrastructure and expertise of the I-SPY 2 network in fulfillment of its overall goals. This includes the various working groups targeting agent selection and review, external advisory boards and importantly, pharma partnership development, which will play an important role in accessing novel agents as part of the switching agent portfolio. A critical role of the core will be to facilitate progress through the regulatory pathway, both for the initial approvals for virtual RCB and treatment switching, but also concerning approval pathways for agents identified via the SMART trial as effective rescue agents in patients with insufficient response to initial standard neoadjuvant or targeted chemotherapy. As demonstrated by the success of I-SPY 2, this is an experienced team capable of leading and managing large, complex clinical trials with integrated biomarker components that has a proven track record for rapidly and successfully integrating new processes and procedures within the I-SPY 2 TRIAL framework."
"9245545","Project Summary The type I interferon (IFN) cytokine family promotes the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is made by many different cells in response to DNA and RNA. Whereas many cells of the immune system make type I interferon, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are a specialized cell type that can produce large quantities of these cytokines in response to nucleic acids in immune complexes, which are abundant in SLE. pDC have been implicated as important type I interferon producing cells in SLE, both in humans and in mouse models. We have made the novel discovery that the signaling adapter BCAP, which is highly expressed in pDC, is required for type I interferon production from these cells. Additionally, deficiency in BCAP in a mouse model of lupus-like disease greatly ameliorates disease. Therefore, BCAP is a potential therapeutic target in SLE to reduce pDC interferon-alpha production. In this proposal, we further examine the function of BCAP in pDC interferon-alpha production and in lupus-like disease. We will explore this idea in two aims: 1) To determine the mechanism by which BCAP regulates plasmacytoid DC type I IFN production, and 2) To determine if BCAP expression in pDC promotes lupus-like disease. Together, these experiments will define a new regulatory mechanism for pDC type I IFN production in vitro and in vivo. BCAP has not previously been implicated in pDC function or in SLE pathogenesis, therefore our proposal tests novel hypotheses focused on determining how BCAP functions in pDC and whether BCAP may be a therapeutic target in SLE."
"9360073","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 4 Women with substantial residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have poor prognosis with substantial risk of early recurrence. Conversely, women who achieve pathologic complete response or `pCR' (complete eradication of tumor) prior to surgery have very good outcomes. The I-SPY2 clinical trial is an innovative multicenter, multi-agent clinical platform trial that uses an adaptive randomized study design to accelerate the development of new agents and paired biomarkers of response in women with locally advanced breast cancer. To date, 10 novel agents have begun evaluation, and 3 have `graduated' having a high (>85%) probability of success in a phase III trial; over 1000 patients have enrolled, with 250 more each year. Despite these advances, may women still fail to reach pCR. Driven by advances in MRI imaging assesments, this Program Project aims to improve pCR rates by modifying I-SPY 2 to include non-invasive identification of patients with insufficient response to NAC, then redirecting their treatment to another, biologically targeted therapy selected based upon the presence of biomarkers of response present in their tumor. In this project, we will use the substantial archived specimens and data sets from I-SPY 2 to identify new biomarkers and develop the framework for evidence-based selection of substitute treatments. Our hypothesis is that tumor characteristics at time of presentation will assist in the identification drug strategies that will successfully convert a ?non-responder? into a patient with a pCR. To achieve our goals of identifying successful drug regimens that can be used to redirect patient's therapies, we will follow a research plan consisting of three specific aims: 1) utilize the I-SPY2 qualifying biomarker evaluation (QBE) framework to identify biomarkers of drug response based upon tumor immune microenvironment analyses, and assign probability scores to each drug-biomarker pair; 2) expand the I-SPY2 predicted drug sensitivity portfolio to single agents or combination therapies not yet within the I-SPY 2 drug portfolio, based on gene expression profiles of responders/non- responders and drug-gene expression databases from breast and other cancer cell lines; and 3) create an integrated drug response prediction matrix from all sources, and establish quantitative and qualitative strategies for the rational, evidence-based selection of agents for reassignment.. We will work closely with the Project 1 clinical team to refine our models in a way that maintains clinical context. We anticipate a unique and important synergy to emerge through collaborations with Project 3, the goal of which is to characterize the dynamics of molecular pathways of resistance under therapeutic pressure. This project will also leverage the broad experience of the investigators and the bioinformatics expertise within the shared cores. The clinical goals of the overall program project are a significant motivating factor for this study, which will result in the development of important new information resources that will find utility within the I-SPY 2+ TRIAL and beyond."
"9353960","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to develop 15-PGDH, and/or its partner genes in the pathways that regulate PGE2 degradation and PGE2 synthesis, as a powerful biomarker for reducing deaths from colorectal cancer (CRC), by enabling personalized strategies to improve risk-based screening and to improve aspirin chemoprevention. Groundbreaking studies from my group have shown that 15-PGDH is a colon cancer suppressor that, by mediating degradation of PGE2, acts as a metabolic suppressor of the oncogenic activity of COX-2. In studies published in Science, we have moreover shown that 15-PGDH acts in the colon, and in other organs, as a negative regulator of the proliferative response of stem like cells to tissue injury. We furthermore have shown that colon 15-PGDH levels vary by 12-fold over the human population, and, in genetics studies, have indirectly linked 15-PGDH deficiency (or deficiency of PGT, a gene that partners with 15-PGDH in the pathway of PGE2 degradation) with increased human risk of CRC. Our first aim is to now directly test colon 15-PGDH as a biomarker for recognizing humans at high CRC risk, who thus need more intensive CRC screening, and to then test our hypothesis that an integrated analysis of expression of the 6 genes that partner with 15-PGDH to mediate PGE2 degradation and synthesis (i.e. a genetic signature of inferred PGE2) will be an even stronger predictor of individuals at high CRC risk. Moreover, in landmark studies, published in Science Translational Medicine, we have shown that 15-PGDH is also determinative of individuals in whom using aspirin prevents CRC, with aspirin only effective in lowering CRC risk in individuals who have high colon 15-PGDH, and ineffective in individuals who have low colon 15-PGDH levels (i.e. effective CRC prevention requires the synergistic activity in lowering PGE2 of a COX inhibitor (aspirin) acting together with high colon 15-PGDH). Our second aim is to now provide a practice changing clinical replication of colon 15-PGDH as a biomarker of sensitivity versus resistance to aspirin chemoprevention in a new, larger, human validation population, and further, to test our hypothesis that the 6- gene signature of inferred PGE2 will be an even stronger predictor for recognizing individuals who will benefit from using aspirin to reduce CRC risk. Last, in studies published the Journal of Clinical Investigation, we have shown that inflammatory pathways potently suppress colon 15-PGDH expression. Our third aim now tests the hypotheses that i) lifestyle factors that are linked to both CRC risk and to inflammatory tone (e.g. obesity, lack of exercise, and dietary red meat) act by regulating 15-PGDH and its 6 partner genes of the inferred PGE2 signature; and ii) that modifying these lifestyle factors can shift the signature of inferred PGE2 toward a profile predictive of greater aspirin sensitivity. We interrogate this hypothesis by i) testing for association of lifestyle factors to human colon expression of 15-PGDH and the signature of inferred PGE2, and ii) functional testing in mouse models for these factors ability to: iia) alter gene expression (inferred PGE2), iib) alter colon PGE2, and iic) potentiate NSAID's activity in lowering colon PGE2."
"9265269","Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to a positive single-strand flavivirus family that has recently emerging pathogens, West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya virus (CHKV), and dengue virus (DENV). It is spread by the Aedes mosquito and any cases of ZIKV infection are asymptomatic and the most common symptoms of infection are rash, fever, and joint pain. However, a number of epidemiology data strongly indicate that newborns of mothers who had ZIKV infection during pregnancy are at an increased risk for microcephaly. Recent animal studies also showed that IFNAR knockout (KO) mice were highly susceptible for ZIKV infection and developed neurological diseases. Furthermore, previous studies of mice infected intraperitoneally showed the brain tropism of ZIKV infection where the virus infected both neurons and glia, producing a variety of intracytoplasmic viral factories, likely referred to what we now know as ?autophagosomes?. Indeed, ZIKV infection of fibroblasts also associates with the formation of numerous double-membrane autophagosomes.  DENV, closely related to ZKIV, also induces an activation of autophagy for its replication, indicating that both ZIKV and DENV increase their replication via the robust induction of autophagy in the host cells. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to investigate how ZIKV induces host?s autophagy for its viral lifecycle. Our preliminary study has discovered a novel ZIKV-mediated induction of autophagy pathway. Specifically, the ZIKV NS4A and NS4B serve as pro-autophagy molecules via their suppression of Akt kinase activity, which increases autophagy and thereby enhances viral replication. Thus, we will study the specific mechanisms of how the ZIKV NS4A and NS4B cooperate to induce autophagy for viral replication (Aim 1) and test whether the increase of autophagy is necessary for efficient in vitro and in vivo ZIKV replication and disease induction (Aim 2). The successful outcome of this study should considerably impact our understanding how ZIKV subverts the autophagic machinery to benefit its replication."
"9381070","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this project is to understand mechanisms by which immature egg cells, or oocytes, become developmentally competent. Mammalian oocytes are stored in the ovary, arrested at meiotic prophase, for extended periods of time (decades in women). Following puberty, oocytes enter a period of growth in which they synthesize proteins needed for the maturation process. They are stimulated to mature by signals from the pituitary. Oocytes undergo many cytoplasmic changes during oocyte maturation, the period between prophase I and metaphase II. These include a dramatic reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in which the ER becomes concentrated in the egg cortex. Ca2+ uptake into the ER also occurs, and that is necessary for the egg to release intracellular Ca2+ from the ER at fertilization, a critical event required for early embryonic development. Oocytes also undergo changes that permit them to undergo cortical granule exocytosis at fertilization, a critical event that renders the fertilized egg impermeable to more than one sperm and thus a polyspermy prevention mechanism. Many questions remain about these events. Aim 1 will investigate whether changes in ER structure and the formation of ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contacts are important for developmental competence, as well as mechanisms that regulate ER reorganization, formation of ER-PM contacts, and Ca2+ uptake during maturation. Aim 2 will identify proteins that are needed for constitutive exocytosis as well as the Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of cortical granules. These experiments will make use of protein degradation methods to study the role of specific proteins, alone or in combination with other candidate proteins, using isolated or follicle-enclosed oocytes. Importantly, we will use a newly developed method for the rapid and acute degradation of endogenous proteins. Oocytes will be injected with fluorescent molecules that allow the visualization of the ER and ER-PM contacts, or with antibodies/siRNAs/morpholinos to specifically deplete proteins. The conclusions reached from these studies will be applicable to understanding oocyte development in women. Currently, the ability to mature human oocytes in vitro is an area of high importance, but methods for maturing oocytes are imperfect. A complete knowledge of all aspects of oocyte development could lead to improved culturing methods that will increase the success of assisted reproduction."
"9307116","Abstract Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mediated by small silencing RNAs such as ~22-24 nt microRNAs (miRNAs) and ~21 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced by Dicer enzymes, is important in every aspect of biology. Making small RNAs with an appropriate length is crucial for their functions. Small RNAs with incorrect lengths, which can be produced if Dicer selects incorrect cleavage sites in precursor RNAs, can cause detrimental effects in cells. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the length of small silencing RNAs produced by Dicer are determined and regulated is significant and is the goal of research in this proposal.  Drosophila Dicer-1 makes ~22-24 nt miRNAs from pre-miRNAs while Dicer-2 precisely produces ~21 nt siRNAs from long dsRNAs derived from virus and transposon. We recently reported that the miRNA length produced by Drosophila Dicer-1 and mammalian Dicer can be changed by its binding partner proteins Loquacious-PB (Loqs-PB) in Drosophila and TRBP in mammals, respectively, but not by their alternative partners Loqs-PA and PACT. However, the molecular mechanism by which Loqs- PB/TRBP, but not Loqs-PA/PACT, changes the length of miRNAs is unknown, and we will aim to better understand it. We will test the hypothesis that Loqs-PB/TRBP, but not Loqs-PA/PACT, binds the unpaired bases at the central part of the pre-miRNA stem and changes their conformation in order to change the miRNA length.  In contrast to miRNAs that have a broader length distribution (~22-24 nt), the length of ~21 nt siRNAs is more precise. The difference in the length between miRNAs and siRNAs is important for their respective functions. However, how Drosophila Dicer-2 can produce siRNAs with such high precision is unknown. Based on our previous and preliminary results, we will test the hypothesis that the phosphate-binding pocket in the PAZ domain of Dicer-2 plays crucial roles to produce precise ~21 nt siRNAs. We also hypothesize that the C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of Dicer-2 additionally contributes to the precision of the ~21 nt siRNA production. We hypothesize that the phosphate-binding pocket and C-terminal dsRBD anchors the terminal monophosphate and body of long dsRNAs, respectively, thereby aligning the RNAs precisely along the RNaseIII active site.  To achieve these aims, we will use Drosophila genetics, reconstituted in vitro biochemistry, and high-throughput sequencing. The proposed studies will reveal the molecular mechanisms by which the length of miRNAs and siRNAs are defined and regulated, which will advance our understanding of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing."

"9349363","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in genomic technology have driven the collection of unprecedented amounts of data from human cancers. Critical challenges include extracting biological insights from this data and then translating these findings into improved patient care. Toward those ends, I performed a meta-analysis on 98 gene expression-linked cancer survival studies. In these studies, investigators measured gene expression in primary tumors surgically excised from patients and then correlated that data with clinical information on the patient's treatment and outcome. While data from over 20,000 patients with 20 distinct tumor types are available in public repositories, no comprehensive pan-cancer analysis has previously been reported. My analysis resulted in the discovery that the up-regulation or down regulation of hundreds of genes is highly correlated with the duration of patient survival across many common human cancers. This gene set provides unique insight into a poorly-understood facet of cancer biology: while the molecular alterations that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells have become increasingly well-characterized, the differences between highly-aggressive tumors and benign, indolent tumors remain largely unknown. My research group will utilize this bioinformatics pipeline as a discovery engine to identify and characterize the genes specifically responsible for cancer mortality. In Aim 1, I describe several single-gene assays and targeted screens that will assess the function of genes whose expression is associated with death from cancer. These assays will determine which of these genes are bona fide oncogenes and which promote tumor metastasis. In Aim 2, I describe experiments to assess the functions of genes whose expression correlates with prolonged survival in cancer patients. These genes could represent novel tumor suppressors or could otherwise inhibit tumor cell dissemination. In Aim 3, I propose several mechanistic experiments to elucidate the biology that connects the expression or repression of the genes identified in this study with patient survival. These functional studies will determine the effects of these genes on known cancer-related pathways, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a developmental program hypothesized to play a crucial role in tumor metastasis. Lastly, in Aim 4, I describe an expanded set of molecular data linked to cancer survival that will be analyzed in order to create a mortality map of genomic features that drive or suppress tumor progression. This broader analysis will be used to identify new cancer-associated genes for future functional studies. Collectively, these Aims will greatly expand our knowledge of the features that differentiate fatal and non-fatal human tumors. Additionally, this work will provide an abundance of data with the potential to improve the stratification of cancer patient risk, and will identify novel targets for drug development to specifically inhibit the growth of the most aggressive cancers."
"9544477","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite increasing adherence to routine screening and advances in therapeutic strategies, colorectal cancer is still a major health problem. Colorectal cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the US. Moreover, the incidence of this disease is projected to increase by 52% by 2030 due to the expansion of the aging population. Yet, very few colorectal neoplasia (pre-cancerous and cancerous lesion) prevention strategies are available other than routine screening. The etiology of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) is complex; however, modifiable environmental factors including diet, the gut microbiota, and inflammation, are accepted as major contributors to colorectal carcinogenesis. Accumulating evidence supports that diet is one of the most important environmental factors that modulate gut microbiota composition and the gut microbiota has been implicated in CRN development. However, the dietary patterns that promote unhealthy changes in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) and the enrichment of CRN-promoting bacteria are still incompletely understood. A better understanding of the CRN-promoting mechanisms, including the interplay between diet and the gut microbiota, would greatly advance current knowledge and serve as a platform for future studies evaluating diet- based CRN prevention strategies via the modulation of the cancer-promoting gut bacterial populations. Most studies have concentrated on specific bacteria or on profiling gut bacterial species associated with CRN. However, the mechanisms by which gut bacteria exert their CRN-promoting effects are not fully elucidated. The main goal of the current proposal is to examine a panel of bacterial genes encoding pro- inflammatory and DNA damaging toxins that may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis and to evaluate if these genes are associated with pre-cancerous lesions (high-risk adenomas) and specific dietary patterns. The innovative aspect of this study is that it focuses on the evaluation of specific toxin-encoding bacterial genes rather than profiling gut bacterial species. Our central hypothesis is that individuals with high-risk adenomas will have a higher prevalence of these toxic genes and that these toxins contribute to carcinogenesis by causing DNA damage and the perpetuation of inflammation. Our study aims to characterize the toxic bacterial gene profile in stool and colonic tissue and to determine if they are associated with high-risk adenomas. We will also assess if presence of the toxic bacterial genes is associated with inflammation (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will examine dietary patterns and the prevalence of these toxic genes during a 1-year period (Aim 2). The significance of this study is that it addresses a gap in scientific knowledge regarding the CRN-promoting toxic bacterial by-products produced by the gut microbiota and their association with specific dietary patterns. The data generated by this study may shed light on the gut microbiota-driven carcinogenic mechanisms and on future dietary interventions for CRN prevention aiming at reducing exposure to injurious bacterial by-products."
"9277747","OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY Barrett?s esophagus is an increasingly prevalent, preneoplastic disorder resulting from acid/bile reflux and chronic inflammation at the GE junction. This application is a renewal of a long-standing multicenter, translational research program from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. The team, which has been highly productive, will now focus on the role of microbiota and the tumor microenvironment in the development and progression of Barrett?s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The group has added additional collaborative sites at MIT, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Munich Technical University, and will utilize heavily a new Microbiome and Metabolomics Core at Penn- CHOP. Thus, the team comprises broad and unique expertise in mouse models, genomics, microbiology and clinical research. The application is built around the hypothesis that the inflammation-dependent tumor microenvironment, modulated by the GE junction microbiome, is critical for early progression of esophageal carcinogenesis. The proposal will utilize both the novel transgenic (L2-IL-1?) and innovative 3D organoid models, along with a cross-sectional study of 100 BE patients. Project 1 will study the role of microbiota and myeloid cells in the L2-IL-1? mouse model of Barrett?s esophagus. This project will incorporate germ-free housing, antibiotic eradication, colonization with defined flora, myeloid cell ablation and correlative human studies. Project 2 is focused on the characterization of microenvironment drivers in BE, and will include FACS/IHC analysis of CAFs and immune cells (MDSCs/Tregs) in BE patients, along with 3D organoids in culture. The role of IL-6 in response to epithelial TP53 mutations and immune cell activation will be defined. Finally, Project 3 will seek to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures related to the microbiome and microenvironment. The study will analyze bile acids, a product of microbes, and minimally invasive tests such as saliva/breath test/tethered capsule sponge to analyze microbes to develop screening/surveillance strategies. Overall, these projects will advance the science of the microbiome and microenvironment in BE that will hopefully lead to translational applications."
"9402331","PROJECT IV: Pathologic Alpha-synuclein Strains & Diverse Synucleinopathies Project IV Leader: J.Q. Trojanowski; Co-Investigators: V.M.-Y. Lee & K. Luk Project IV Summary/Abstract  Here we test the hypothesis that progression of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) without or with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) represent the spread of different a- syn strains in neurons where they are known as Lewy bodies (LBs) and neurites (LNs). We compare these strains to each other and with a-syn strains in multiple system atrophy (MSA) glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI). This will advance insights into how distinct a-syn strains drive clinical and pathological heterogeneity in these diverse synucleinopathies. Since dementia in PDD and DLB frequently is accompanied by Alzheimer's disease (AD), we also will test the hypothesis that a-syn strains from PD/PDD/DLB brains (designated LB-a- syn) induce A? and tau pathologies compared to pathological a-syn from MSA brains (designated GCI-a-syn). Project IV collaborates with Project III, which performs in vitro a-syn strain studies and provides Project IV with a-syn strains from postmortem PD/PDD/ DLB and MSA brains as well as in vitro amplified LB and GCI a-syn strains. Living subjects are studied in Core B and Projects I/II and their brains are obtained through Core C while Core D provides data management/biostatistics/bioinformatics support. Thus, Project IV works closely with all Udall Center Cores/Projects to determine if LB-a-syn and GCI-a-syn strains differentially induce pathological a-syn in neurons versus glia as well as recruit AD-like plaque and tangle pathology, This will be done following intracerebral injections into wild type (WT) mice, human WT a-syn transgenic (Tg) mice (line 61) in a mouse a-syn knock out (KO) background (KO61) and CNP-a-syn (M2) Tg mice in a-syn KO background (KOM2) that model GCIs versus Tg mouse models of A? (5xFAD, Tg2576, APP knock in) or tau (PS19) pathologies. The hypothesis tested in Project IV emerged from studies in this funding cycle using synthetic a- syn preformed fibrils, and we innovate now by using LB-a-syn and GCI-a-syn after showing that they are biologically distinct a-syn strains with GCI-a-Syn being ~1000 fold more potent than LB-a-syn. Hence, we test the novel hypothesis that PD/PDD/DLB versus MSA result from different a-syn strains."
"9360071","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Increasing understanding of the heterogeneity of breast cancer is leading to tailored therapies that hold promise for improving outcomes. The I-SPY2 TRIAL is a phase II, multicenter trial designed to test new treatment strategies for breast cancer and to quickly identify promising candidate therapies for subsequent phase III testing. MRI is used in I-SPY2 to monitor primary tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to provide prognostic information. The overall objective of the Program Project is to develop and implement an adaptive strategy to redirect NAC based on early treatment response indicators. The goal is to improve outcomes for women with stage 2/3 breast cancer who remain at highest risk for recurrence, and minimize chemo-toxicities in women at lowest risk. As a component of the Program Project, Project 2 will systematically develop integrated imaging predictive models that can be used to decide mid-treatment modification of NAC based on individual response. These models will be initially developed using the extensive existing DCE-MRI database in I-SPY2, and augmented over time with imaging data emerging from more recent addition of DWI and PET. Information from Project 3 about molecular determinants of treatment resistance will be used to further refine the prognostic ability of imaging models. We will look more closely at the relationship between measures of residual disease by MRI and histopathology, in order to further improve MRI's ability to serve as a non-invasive surrogate of residual disease. Lastly, recognizing that PET imaging may provide additional insight into drug mechanism of action in combination with MRI, we will begin to expand the use of PET through a pilot study performed at a sub-set of sites using dedicated breast PET (dbPET) scanners. Project 2 leverages the substantial existing data set from the multi-agent I-SPY2 clinical trial, consisting of serial MRIs linked to outcomes for over 1000 subjects receiving experimental treatments. We expect the successful completion of aims to afford more powerful non-invasive imaging methods that will facilitate the personalization of NAC and improve overall outcomes for patients with breast cancer."

In addition to generating basic knowledge, Projects 1-4 of the ?Thymic and peripheral aspects of T cell aging and rejuvenation? Program Project Grant (Program) will provide an array of potential rejuvenation strategies. The Immunological Response & Rejuvenation Strategy Monitoring Core (Core D), located at the University of Arizona, will provide the final experimental pipeline for testing those rejuvenation strategies. Specifically, the global objective of Core D is to assess thymic export and peripheral maintenance of naïve T cells following T cell rejuvenation in aged mice, and determine whether such interventions can improve adaptive and protective immunity against viral infection in old mice.  The Core will provide dedicated personnel with the appropriate infectious disease expertise to ensure consistency and quality control in the execution of study protocols, application of experimental procedures, and animal observations and data collection necessary to meet the Program's major research objectives. This testing pipeline will not only separate candidate interventions by their efficacy, but will also identify potential stages at which some rejuvenation strategies may fail to translate into improved immune function. The use of rigorous in vivo analysis to track recent thymic emigrants, and immunity in response to West Nile virus, a pathogen that shows disproportionally high morbidity and mortality within the elderly, will provide this Program and its Projects stringent testing of a full spectrum of peripheral immune function and protective immunity following T cell rejuvenation in aged mice. Thereby, the Core will deliver rigorous preclinical data, that, together with the Human-Mouse Timeline (generated by Projects 1-4 and other Cores) will enable translational rejuvenation efforts in humans."
"9388749","Summary The benefits to come from producing the wealth of multi-level behavioral, genotypic, and imaging data in this PPG depend on the quality of the analyses of these data. The Statistical Analysis (SA) Core will form a center of expertise and support in Statistics and data analysis for the PPG, with a mission of enhancing scientific progress by ensuring optimal use of data. As optimal results in data analysis are achieved through a combination of expertise in data analysis with expertise in relevant subject matter, the SA Core has been designed to bring statistical experts from the faculty of the Yale Statistics Department together with select data- oriented personnel from Projects 1-5 who are intimately familiar with the science. This collaboration will develop and apply the most powerful and revealing analytic methods, maintaining rigorous statistical validity without artificially limiting the sophistication of the methodology. The individual Projects will perform analyses to achieve their specific aims and the SA Core will assist as needed. The SA Core will also be responsible for performing analyses that use data from more than one project to address integrative aims that span across cohorts, ages, and data types. Several integrative aims are detailed in the SA Core description. For example, we will use longitudinal fMRI connectivity measurements made in the prenatal and neonatal periods from Project 1 and Project 4 to predict autism severity and also to predict response to a novel social value training protocol proposed in Project 5. We will adapt brain connectivity networks from Project 2 derived as maximally associated with sustained attention in school-age children to study neonates in project 1 who are too young for selective attention to be measured effectively. And we will relate neurobiological characteristics of induced pluripotent stem cells from Project 3 to fMRI network connectivity and measures of attention and autism in school age from Project 2. After establishing baseline analyses through careful applications of classical methods such as ANOVA, regression, and mixed-effects models, the SA Core will seek to apply more modern, sophisticated developments in statistical theory and methodology to develop improved analyses. As detailed in the SA Core description, members were chosen to have distinct and complementary expertise in statistical areas expected to be of importance to the projects and integrative aims, such as high dimensional statistics (which applies whenever many variables are measured for each participant as in this PPG), dimension reduction, statistical computing, longitudinal analysis, and network models (which will apply to both brain connectivity networks and genetic networks in this PPG). A collateral benefit of the SA Core is the recruitment of Dr. Zhou and Dr. Negahban, scholars working at the highest levels of statistical research, to the field of autism research. We also anticipate increased participation by graduate students from the Yale Statistics Department, which is currently entering a vibrant period of expansion, in the autism research of the Yale Child Study Center. 1"
"9529766","The Precision Approach to healthCARE enrollment Site (PA CARES) will engage the 2.9 million patients from rural upper Appalachia to suburban and urban environments with diverse sociodemographic characteristics who receive care from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). UPMC, the largest non-profit integrated health delivery system in the US, comprises 22 hospitals, >500 outpatient facilities, 17 senior communities, and a health insurance plan (2.8M members) in a 29-county region of Pennsylvania plus part of Ohio and West Virginia. We will leverage several large-scale participant recruitment and informatics initiatives at the University of Pittsburgh to enroll 175,000 participants in the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Cohort Program. During Year 1, we will rapidly enroll 10,000 participants from our health system-wide Research Participant Registry that currently includes >101K individuals who have consented to be re-contacted about enrolling in research studies. Our ongoing strategic initiatives will support the engagement and enrollment of 165K participants in Years 2-5. Our work with Wondros, a design-thinking-based production company, on a storytelling and messaging program (Pitt+Me?) to engage Pennsylvanians in research will be customized to communicate the PA CARES message to UPMC patients. We will continue partnering with The Chartis Group (project management), TrialSpark (social media-based participant recruitment and eScheduling), and Flipside Media (online e-consent) to ensure the efficient engagement and enrollment of diverse participants at 11 geographically dispersed centers in a variety of UPMC (e.g., obstetrical delivery units, emergency departments, urgent care facilities, clinics, hospitals) and community (e.g., Giant Eagle community pharmacies, Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh, >150 organizations) settings. Our nationally recognized informatics expertise in collecting, harmonizing, merging, and curating data from the extensive UPMC electronic health record (EHR) and diverse research sources and our experience creating a common ontology and data model for linking EHR data in national NIH- and PCORI-funded data networks will enable us to curate and store enrollee EHR and other data and transmit them to the PMI Coordinating Center on schedule. Our informatics tools will also facilitate the collection, tracking, and shipment of biospecimens to the PMI Biobank. Our robust track record documents our ability to efficiently enroll 175K diverse individuals from a single healthcare system using streamlined processes and to contribute to the successful achievement of the broader goals of the PMI, including the advancement of precision medicine."

"9465248","Approximately one out of three 2- to 5-year-old children in the United States has experienced caries (tooth decay). The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and American Academy of Pediatrics provide recommendations for preventive strategies, and recognize that infant, toddler and early childhood oral health is one of the foundations upon which preventive education and dental care must be built to enhance the opportunity for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease. Parents struggle to adopt these preventive strategies at the same time that challenging behaviors emerge in children's psychological development. This combination can make it very difficult to build the foundation of oral health practices that the AAPD recommends. There is a strong body of evidence supporting the use of behavioral parenting strategies in dealing with child behavioral problems. The proposed project introduces behavioral parent training strategies in concert with efforts to address other known parental barriers to provide an effective vehicle to promote dental health with a universal prevention intervention.  This private/public collaboration between Oregon Research Behavioral Intervention Strategies, Oregon Research Institute & The Oregon Community Foundation will leverage resources and competencies to create a commercially viable coordinated oral health prevention intervention program to promote dental health targeted at parents of young children attending parenting education classes and families receiving home visiting services through Head Start. The program includes a video that can be shown in parenting education classes to engage parents on oral health and a mobile/web application to drive behavioral change.  In this Phase I application, we propose developing a coordinated oral health prevention intervention program, ?BeReady2Smile?, including video and mobile/web- application. An initial proof of concept version of this program and reminder set will be developed in the Phase I project and then tested for feasibility/usability among parents of young children. BeReady2Smile will include video content that features demonstrations/content on encouraging brushing, proper loading of toothbrush, brushing duration and frequency, fluoride myths, and limiting sugar sweetened beverages and milk in baby bottles while in bed. BeReady2Smile will also include a mobile application built within a web-based infrastructure, so parents can participate in multi-media educational activities, develop dental health behavior plans, tailor features and receive feedback from the system on a secure website. The long-term goal of BeReady2Smile is to help parents provide the foundation for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease."
"9507087","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to renew our postdoctoral Interdisciplinary Training Program in Biobehavioral Pain Research at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI). Chronic pain is one of the most common and disabling symptoms in our society. Pain is a highly complex phenomenon that involves, genetic, molecular, neurophysiologic, cognitive-emotional, and sociocultural determinants. The treatment of pain remains inadequate in almost every clinical situation and consequently demands programs to create specialized, interdisciplinary training in pain research that addresses the tremendous challenge of developing, evaluating, disseminating, and integrating effective pain treatments into clinical care. The overarching goal of the proposed postdoctoral program is to prepare the next generation of innovative research leaders to work cooperatively within an interdisciplinary team to address the complex problem of pain. To this end, we are again requesting support for four postdoctoral fellows. We expect each of these fellows to stay in the program for two years, unless they receive independent funding (e.g. an F32 grant). To encourage a diverse program, we are requesting support for two fellows (PhDs) who are in the first year of post-graduate research (PGY0), as well as two fellows who have completed their residency following medical school (PGY5). This renewal proposes to emphasize the neuroscience of pain throughout the training. Each faculty mentor is actively funded, engaged in the education of young investigators, and committed to interdisciplinary collaboration. The Program incorporates coursework and mentored research experiences in at least two scientific domains that are synthesized by: 1) an integrated research project, 2) an extramural grant application, and 3) the writing and publishing of papers. The training objectives are to: 1) develop an enhanced foundation in the neuroscience of pain; 2) engender a broad conceptualization of pain that includes, but is not limited to, neurobiologic, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and social processes; 3) develop skills for communicating, networking and collaborating with scientists in other disciplines; and 4) design and conduct an integrative pain research project. Each fellow is to be collaboratively mentored by two core faculty with distinct domains of pain research expertise in either: 1) neuroscience, 2) clinical research and 3) behavioral or social science. Program faculty cut across the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health. Our goal is to prepare the next generation of pain scientists to lead interdisciplinary research teams that will innovatively address the problem of pain using transformative research paradigms."
"9335381","Abstract Tracheobonchomalacia (TBM) is a congenital or acquired deficiency of tracheal and/or bronchial cartilages that presents with dynamic airway collapse, respiratory difficulties, and, in severe cases, acute life-threatening events. TBM prevalence is estimated at 1 in 2,200 children1, and severe cases can result in death or require tracheostomy with ventilation for 2-3 years, a significant burden on the child and family2,3. We recently developed a bioresorbable, patient specific 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) splint to treat TBM, reporting the first case in the New England J. of Medicine4. Three subsequent children with life threatening TBM were saved with the splint and the first child continues to be asymptomatic 30 months post-surgery. However, long term clinical application of the splint requires further engineering to reduce the risk of fatigue failure in addition to understanding how resorption of the splint affects mechanical deformation and remodeling of the airway to improve safety and efficacy of the splint. In addition, the FDA also requires such data for regulatory approval based on our August 22, 2014 meeting with the FDA to initiate a phase I clinical trial for Humanitarian Device Exempt (HDE) approval. We will address these questions in two specific aims using both in vitro and in vivo preclinical model, the Yorkshire pig. The first aim will characterize splint degradation both in vitro and in vivo for up to 2 years. The second aim will use this data to characterize how the splint affects airway mechanics."
"9349382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After decades of excessive growth in health care spending, few would disagree that U.S. healthcare must be reorganized to achieve the same or better patient outcomes at lower cost. As the key decision makers in healthcare, physicians are in large part responsible for growth in healthcare utilization through ordering of imaging, diagnostic tests, procedures, and hospital services. And yet, much remains to be learned about variation in physician practice patterns and the implications of those differences for the outcomes of their patients. More broadly, the body of research quantifying the variation in clinical and economic outcomes across individual physicians is sparse and a greater understanding of the various individual physician and institutional factors that may influence that variation is needed. By combining economic methods with carefully chosen clinical scenarios, I will build a long-term research agenda that seeks to broadly understand factors determining physician practice patterns; the implications of individual practice variations for patient outcomes; and the impact of selected institutional and environmental factors on clinical and economic outcomes of physicians. By linking together a unique set of databases (medical claims of Medicare beneficiaries; demographic and medical training information of the physicians caring for these patients; and malpractice claims of these physicians), the proposed research will comprehensively study the variation and determinants of physician spending, quality of care, and patient outcomes, i.e. the 'anatomy' of physician behavior. In addition to quantifying variation in clinical and economic outcomes across physicians, the proposed research will, for a carefully chosen set of physician activities, assess: (1) how spending, qualit of care, and outcomes relate to physician age, sex, medical training, and practice environment, (2) whether clinical outcomes for physicians that spend more on average are better than those that spend less, (3) how a physician's own malpractice history affects his/her subsequent quality of care, spending, and outcomes, (4) how changes in medical training environments (e.g. mandated reductions in weekly work hours of resident physicians) impact physicians later in their career, and (5) how physician practice patterns respond to the local economic environments in which they practice. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide health policy researchers, physicians, and policymakers the scientific basis for tangible physician-based policies to improve quality of care and reduce wasteful health care spending."
"9360072","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 3 By delaying surgery until after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), it is possible to assess the impact of therapy on breast tumors in real time. Women with aggressive disease who respond well to NAC have a better prognosis than women who fail to respond. There needs to be a way to identify high risk non-responders early in treatment and determine what alternative or additional treatments may be of benefit to them. Prior molecular profiling studies have identified markers that are predictive of chemotherapy response or outcome using pre- treatment biopsies. However, treatment induces significant changes in tumor biology; and some of these changes are associated with response to therapy. Thus, we hypothesize that interrogating the dynamic molecular changes over the course of treatment will enable us to better characterize resistance mechanisms and improve our ability to predict non-response (or sensitivity). In this Project, we will use (or generate as needed) next generation sequencing (mRNA and DNA) and reverse phase protein arrays (protein/phospho- protein) to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of serial biopsies from I-SPY 2 patients treated with graduated experimental agents. In Aim 1 we will evaluate druggable/actionable pathways in residual disease of non-responding patients undergoing treatment with standard or targeted agents/combinations. In Aim 2 we will incorporate early treatment-induced changes to improve predictive models of treatment resistance/sensitivity. In Aim 3 we will leverage this data compendium to develop a dynamic portrait of how key molecular pathways evolve as patients move from pre-treatment through to surgery in the context of treatment and receptor subtype. Our goal is to determine whether the residual disease characteristics identified in Aim 1 are evident at the early treatment or pre-treatment time points, and to assess the stability of early predictive/resistance signals. These efforts will inform both mid-treatment assessments of patient response to therapy and the development of a molecularly rationalized strategy for switching predicted non-responding patients to more effective treatment, developed as part of other Projects within the overall Program Project."
"9349392","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the central innovations of the health information technology (HIT) revolution is the use of electronic reminders to provide clinicians with potentially relevant information to support clinical decisions. On the one hand, electronic reminders can present helpful information to support better patient care. On the other hand, given the limits of human cognitive processing and attention, there is the distinct possibility tha reminders may overburden clinicians with too much information. There is currently little empirical evidence weighing the benefits and burdens of increasing the informational content of systems of electronic reminders. Without a better understanding of how varying the information presented in systems of HIT affects patient care, it will not be possible to build HIT systems - an enterprise with $35 billion in annual investments - to optimize patient care. The long-term goal is to develop empirical methods using data from real health care systems to identify the effect of important design margins of HIT systems on actual patient care and health. The objective in this particular application is to quantitatively measure key characteristics of variation in electronic reminder systems in 130 health care systems within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and then to use these measures to estimate the effect of increasing the informational content of a system of reminders on the quality of primary care delivered. Preliminary data using counts of informational items associated with reminders suggest wide variation across systems of reminders. The same provider caring for the same patient may be required to process 5 or 40 reminder-related pieces of information on preventive care and disease management, depending on the health care system and time. I will achieve this objective by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Quantify differences in sets of electronic reminders across VHA health care systems over time. In addition to preliminary evidence using counts of informational items, I will quantitativel measure other dimensions of variation (e.g., topic breadth, complexity, and comprehensibility) in the informational content of systems of reminders. (2) Estimate the dose response of primary care quality measures to the informational content of reminders, using natural experiments on the set of reminders presented to clinicians. (3) Determine how the dose response to the informational content of reminders depends on patient, provider, and organizational context. Using administrative patient- and provider-level data, external data on provider board scores, and surveys at the organizational level, I will examine how the response to reminders differs across contexts described by these characteristics. The approach is innovative in its use of detailed administrative data, variation in the content of information presented in HIT systems, and natural experiments changing this information content. The proposed research is significant because it represents a first step towards defining the right amount of information in HIT to optimize patient care, given provider cognitive limitations. Progress in this area is needed to enable the evaluation and design of HIT systems to optimize patient care."
"9360240","Project Summary (Duerfeldt Project) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), is a leading cause of hospital-acquired illness in the United States (500,000 cases in 2011) and represents a unique challenge to therapeutic development, as it is both facilitated by and clinically managed with traditional antibiotics. The inability to effectively treat CDI produces ~$5B in excess healthcare costs annually, a number that will continue to rise if new drug targets and treatment strategies are not identified. As a key regulator of virulence in infectious bacteria, and given its roles in mediating protein turnover and bacterial homeostasis, caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) has emerged as a new target for antimicrobial development. Indeed, ClpP represents a unique target, as both ClpP inhibition and activation have therapeutic utility, with each strategy affecting different aspects of bacterial pathogenicity. This provides an opportunity to determine the therapeutic potential of two orthogonal strategies on a single target, a rare phenomenon in drug discovery. The ClpP system in C. difficile, however, has not been characterized, thus impeding its pursuit as a new target to treat CDI. Importantly, C. difficile is unique from typical gut microflora, in that it expresses two isoforms of ClpP (ClpP1 and ClpP2). Our preliminary data and analyses of existing structure-function profiles suggest that the ClpP system in C. difficile is not only unique from commensal organisms, but also distinct from any pathogenic system disclosed to date. We hypothesize that in C. difficile ClpP maintains its evolutionarily conserved role as a major pathogenic regulator but exhibits unique structural and functional characteristics that provide avenues for the development of selective therapeutic agents. A multi-dimensional approach is required to address the proposed initiatives and we have strategically assembled a collaborative network of researchers with expertise in C. difficile microbiology, protein chemistry, protein crystallization/crystallography, molecular biology, and medicinal chemistry. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) characterize the structurally unique aspects of apo- and modulator-bound cdClpP complexes; 2) define the specific roles of ClpP in C. difficile pathogenesis; and 3) integrate screening platforms to identify novel leads for cdClpP specific modulation. The research is significant because new drug targets are required to effectively treat CDI. We expect that our studies will uncover novel ClpP involvement in pathogenicity and reveal distinct structural and functional aspects of the ClpP system in C. difficile amenable to selective regulation. Additionally, our studies will provide novel ClpP inhibitors and activators that will enable medicinal chemistry campaigns towards the selective targeting of this proteolytic system as an anti-CDI strategy. Therefore, this research will significantly advance the basic understanding of a unique ClpP system and enable translationally focused initiatives."
"9337384","Project Summary Abstract This application is in response to RFA-CA15-007. It comprises a two-year planning period to develop a Malawi Center of Research Excellence for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), focused on cancer, injury, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). These three areas of concentration are of major public health importance with immense unmet need. They have been prioritized by our partner institutions in this application: the Malawi College of Medicine (COM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). Following the intent of the RFA the University of North Carolina (UNC) will serve as the high-income country partner institution for the application, based on its decades-long program in Malawi, long history of collaboration with COM and MOH, and deep involvement in cancer research activities specifically within Malawi. The planning grant will seek to engage US and International partners with significant NCD programs in Malawi, such as UCLA and Baylor College of Medicine, and others. This is a multiple principal investigators application with highly complementary expertise: Satish Gopal (UNC/COM; cancer; clinical investigation); Nyengo Mkandawire (COM; injury; clinical investigation); Mwapatsa Mipando (COM; cardiovascular disease; basic science); Dirk Dittmer (UNC; cancer; basic science). In addition, senior investigators and leadership from government and other supported research programs will participate as key personnel and consultants during the planning period, which leverages an impressive pool of faculty within and outside Malawi. The planning is to develop a center will include administrative, developmental, clinical, laboratory, biostatistics, and implementation cores and which may serve as a resource for the region, e.g. in pathology and surgery training. Partners will be invited during the planning period to contribute to a national plan for each of these, based on existing resources and activities across institutions, as well as new resources and activities that are collectively prioritized. Sustainability of the proposed center and its impact will be ensured by strong ownership from collaborating Malawian partners, including support by the highest levels of COM and MOH. We seek to establish active linkages of collaborating partners within Malawi to international institutions and research networks outside Malawi will allow the center to leverage these external relationships to achieve regional importance in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, by catalyzing a broad national movement to address a rapidly growing NCD burden, the center will deliver measurable benefits to the people of Malawi."
"9355666","Abstract TRIM5? is a restriction factor which targets the retroviral capsid during infection which inhibits infection by inducing the abortive disassembly of the viral capsid core. The mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. We provide data demonstrating that dynamic conformational changes in TRIM5? correlate with the ability to inhibit viral infection, and propose to better define these conformational changes to understand the molecular interactions that drive capsid disassembly. In aim 1, we will define the conformational changes that occur in rhesus TRIM5?, human TRIM5?, and a panel of naturally occurring and structurally guided mutations to define the molecular interactions that drive these conformational changes in the context of the recombinant TRIM5? dimeric unit comprising the coiled coil domain and linker 2 region. In Aim 2, we will expand these studies to define how these conformational changes translate to neighboring domains, including the capsid binding SPRY domain of TRIM5?, and also determine how SPRY binding to assembled CA influences these conformational changes. In aim 3, we propose functional validation of the results obtained in the first 2 aims in experiments which will determine how the biophysical and biochemical proteins translate to the ability to perform the individual, measurable steps in the restriction process."
"9403667","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The justice-involved population is a high-needs, health disparity population.1 Individuals released from jails and prisons have a disproportionately high incidence of chronic health conditions, infectious diseases, sexually transmitted infections, substance use disorders, and medical and mental health co-morbidity.2 Since 70 to 90 percent of individuals released from jails and prisons have no health insurance, they are frequent users of high-cost local emergency medical services.3 Lack of health insurance coverage and lack of continuity of health care in the community upon release are associated with increased rates of recidivism, high health care costs, poor health outcomes and a 12-fold increase in the risk of death in the first two weeks after release.4 Poor health within the justice-involved population is a public health issue, a public safety issue and costly for taxpayers. The current project aims to engage justice-involved individuals with health information to enhance their knowledge and use of health services and resources. In this way, the project will empower participants toward improved health literacy, health insurance literacy, self-care management skills, health care decision- making and overall quality of life. The proposed project will make health-related modules available to justice- involved individuals incarcerated in 4 participating correctional facilities. The modules will be deployed using an existing, secure, tablet-based education system. The project has 4 specific aims: 1) Conduct a health needs assessment using the secure tablet platform to determine the health coverage eligibility status and special health information needs of justice involved individuals preparing for reentry into the community; 2) Deliver the health information curricula and training modules through the secure tablet platform; 3) Using pre- and post-training surveys, measure the impact of health information training on the level of health literacy and confidence to improve self-care management skills of incarcerated individuals preparing for reentry into the community; 4) Follow a sample of participants for 6 months after release from incarceration to collect post-release outcomes including: eligibility and status of health care coverage; frequency of visits to a health care provider; frequency of emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations; level of involvement in treatment programs for chronic health conditions, mental health or substance use disorder; level of compliance with medications; and frequency of return to incarceration. Positive results from this project could improve post-release outcomes for study participants, and facilitate the expansion of such programs throughout the criminal justice system."
"9353886","ABSTRACT Amid declining cigarette consumption, sales of non-cigarette tobacco products remain strong. Importantly, the diverse products available in the current tobacco marketplace pose different levels of harm to the user. Combustible products such as cigarettes and cigars are higher on the tobacco risk continuum than non- combustible products such as smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Conceivably, smokers who switch to a non-combustible product may reduce their risk of smoking-related disease. This behavior, however, is significantly more common among whites compared to blacks, who have the highest rates of combustible tobacco use of any racial or ethnic group. Indeed, cigarette smoking rates are declining faster among whites than blacks, potentially driven by e-cig uptake. Differential rates of quitting smoking by switching to e-cigs or other non-combustible products may exacerbate existing health disparities between whites and blacks. Although tobacco use is influenced by several individual, interpersonal, and societal factors, the retail environment is known to play a critical role in shaping smoking behaviors, particularly among racial minorities, whom the tobacco industry has historically exploited. Despite the growing popularity of e-cigs and other non- cigarette tobacco products, little is known about the promotion of these products at the point-of-sale. This project will examine how the retail of diverse tobacco products varies across the U.S. and the extent to which it is associated with use behaviors of community residents. Specifically, this study will 1) investigate the relationship between regional tobacco product sales, tobacco control policies, and community demographics using Nielsen market scanner data and census data, 2) document the association between the local tobacco retail environment and tobacco product use using geocoded data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and store audits, and 3) model smoking-related disparities attributed to changes in tobacco use behaviors using repeated cross-sectional NHIS data and longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study."
"9462492","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common, aggressive and proliferative primary brain tumor in adults despite current therapeutic strategies that combine surgery, radio, and chemotherapy. The high invasive capacity of GBM makes total surgical resection virtually impossible, resulting in an extremely high recurrence rate. The ability to form a new tumor resides in a subpopulation of cells within the GBM called brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). BTICs are undifferentiated cells with self-renewing and pluripotential capacity, with the added ability of forming tumors in vivo. Our group and others have reported that among primary GBMs, those located in close proximity to the lateral ventricles (LV) present multiple distinct features, including increased recurrence at distant locations, which negatively affect patients' survival. The cause for worse outcomes in patients suffering LV-proximal GBMs is not known. Possible explanations may involve the proximity of these tumors to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neurogenic niche in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). In a pilot study, we have determined that human non-cancer CSF repels BTICs migration in vitro. The molecules in the CSF responsible for this effect are not known. Here we propose to study the interactions between BTICs and different fractions of CSF. We hypothesize that CSF can induce a more aggressive behavior of GBM cells. We will perform this research using intraoperative human tissue. Upon completion of this study we will have gained a better understanding of the effects of CSF on GBM cells and will have discovered possible factors within CSF which influence BTICs and cancer progression. Ultimately, we hope to reveal specific targets for therapeutic intervention leading to increased survival in patients with GBM."
"9336986","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein accumulation is a soundly documented feature of all age-related neurodegenerative disorders, however the initiating events that lead to their formation, as well as their relationship to disease, remains unknown. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the conversion of a normally soluble synaptic protein called a-synuclein into insoluble amyloid fibrils that comprise Lewy body inclusions within Parkinson's brain. Our recent data indicated that disruption of cellular degradation capacity through mutations in the lysosomal gene GBA1 contribute to the aggregation of a-synuclein. This suggested that disruption of lysosomal function contributes to the formation of Lewy bodies. Interestingly, we found that when a-synuclein accumulates, it can in turn feedback to inhibit the lysosomal system, thus causing a self-propagating cycle that promotes amyloid formation and growth within neurons. Our preliminary data indicate that a-synuclein inhibits the trafficking of hydrolases and prevents them from reaching the lysosomal compartment; however the molecular mechanism is not known. Experiments outlined in this application aim to delineate how a-syn disrupts lysosomes using cell lines, PD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell models, transgenic mice, and PD brain. Our goals are to 1) define the relationship between distinct a-syn aggregated assemblies and lysosomal dysfunction / neurotoxicity, 2) determine how a-syn affects protein trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases, 3) discover new rescue pathways in PD centered around promoting hydrolase folding and trafficking to the lysosome. These studies will provide new insight into the mechanism of how amyloid aggregates disrupt cellular processes, and identify novel therapeutic pathways for synucleinopathies centered on enhancement of the lysosomal clearance pathway."
"9386376","Bioinformatics is now integral to clinical and biomedical research. Without bioinformatics expertise, health research in Africa will remain suboptimal. In fact, researchers on the continent are stuck with Next Generation Sequencing data that they can barely analyze. The enormous need for bioinformaticians in Africa has attracted attention of funding agencies and there are examples of significant strides being made by the H3Africa initiative of the NIH and the Wellcome Trust. Uganda currently hosts four H3Africa supported consortia/projects namely: the ?Collaborative African Genomics Network? (CAfGEN); the Integrated approach to the identification of genetic determinants of susceptibility to trypanosomiasis (TrypanoGEN); the H3Africa Bioinformatics network (H3BioNET); and the Integrated Bioreproistory of H3Africa Uganda (IBH3AU), all at Makerere University but there is no dedicated bioinformatics degree training program at the institution. To consolidate and sustain these initial gains, and to achieve a critical number of well-trained bioinformaticians in the long-term, sound training programs at African institutions are required. To contribute to the filling of this gap, we propose ?Nurturing Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Capacity in Africa? (BRecA) program, which builds on the momentum of H3Africa supported consortia at Makerere University. BRecA will establish sustainable programs at Makerere University through these Specific Objectives: (1) To establish a Master's program in bioinformatics that will produce a critical mass of bioinformaticians. These will support local researchers in the analysis of high-throughput data. The MSc program will train ten students from Uganda and SSA. (2) To establish a doctoral program in bioinformatics aiming to produce critical thinkers in genomics and bioinformatics who can teach and perform independent research that is responsive to the disease burden on the continent. Two students from Uganda and/or SSA will be trained. (3) To provide postdoctoral training in bioinformatics that will enable two CAfGEN alumni (one Ugandan, one Botswanan) to transition into faculty and/or independent research leaders. (4) To establish a bioinformatics training center that will coordinate and oversee bioinformatics training at Makerere University. This center will be built around research, mentorship, and teaching collaborations, especially with ongoing H3Africa-supported consortia and other collaborations. BRecA leverages highly skilled local and international faculty to produce holistic bioinformaticians relevant to African needs. Our training themes emphasize research on Africa's human genetic diversity and its interaction with important diseases. The projected number of students to be admitted and trained (but not supported by BRecA) will be higher as some will self-sponsor while others may be supported by complementary programs interested in bioinformatics training. From our experience with the Master's program in Immunology that started in 2011 and has admitted approx. 30 applicants per year from Uganda and other African countries, BRecA programs will stay and thrive beyond 2022 after the funding."
"9354429","Center Overview Project Summary/Abstract Clinical trials have established that glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factor modification can reduce the risk of complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, behavioral strategies have been shown to delay or prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk for diabetes. Despite the clarity of evidence, many individuals with diabetes do not meet the recommended goals of diabetes care. There is an unequivocal gap between evidence and real-world diabetes prevention and treatment, and this gap is particular evident in many racial and ethnic minorities. Investigators at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Meharry Medical College propose a renewal to our Center for Diabetes Translation Research ( https://labnodes.vanderbilt.edu/cdtr ) to bridge this gap by building on our success in type II translation research. This renewal proposal is based on a highly productive initial five years and a plan for the next cycle that maintains continuity with our excellent leadership while introducing change to reflect the changing needs of our research base. During the past five years our research base has significantly enlarged (from 23 to 38), been well funded (annual direct costs from NIDDK alone of nearly five million), and published important manuscripts (136 cited). Our P&F program has been extremely successful (8 investigators funded for 30K/year for two years) in that four investigators have already received either a K award or a DP3 award and a fifth awardee has secured a RO1. We believe our P&F program, owing to the ability to leverage institutional matching funds and the ability to extend over two years, has been one of the most successful aspects of the Center. Our enrichment program is extensive and includes collaborations with multiple entities across campus. We propose to build on the excellence of the past five years by maintaining continuity in our core structure and leadership while introducing a new core (Behavioral Intervention Technologies and Services Core) and leader (Chandra Osborn, Ph.D.) to reflect the expanding research base that utilizes technology for behavioral interventions. We maintain a focus on health disparities through our long standing relationship with Meharry Medical College and build on that foundation by introducing a new leader (Consuelo Wilkins, M.D.) to lead our enrichment core. Dr. Wilkins leads the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance (https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/meharry- vanderbilt/) which explicity promotes collaboration between our two institutions to promote clinical and community-engaged collaboration, education and research. These additions build on our theme of reducing health disparities while expanding on our efforts to advance knowledge in behavioral intervention technologies.  "
"9386917","West African Sustainable Leadership and Innovation Training in Bioinformatics Research (WASLITBRe) Training Program Summary. It is evidently clear that NIH has audaciously stimulated and is supporting research in human health and heredity in Africa, which is further, enhanced with informatics tools development and short-term training in bioinformatics. However, the long-term sustainability of the initiatives remain a doubt if effort is not directed to African Universities to develop innovative, future-looking- oriented data science academic education to perpetuity maintain the scientific research leadership in data science. We therefore proposed here to develop a West African Sustainable Leadership and Innovation Training in Bioinformatics Research (WASLITBRe) to support the H3Africa consortium. The proposed WASLITBRe is a collaborative program between Covenant University (CU), Nigeria, University of Bamako (UB), Mali and the University of Ghana/KNUST. The program will have two tracks - a training leading to award of MSc./ PhD, junior faculty (post doctorate) fellowships, and networking and mentorship training in advanced bioinformatics and data science research. Trainees for the MSc/PhD will be selected from pool of graduates with diverse background (clinician, information Science, computer science, mathematics, data Science, statistics/biostatistics, biology, physics and engineering), junior faculty fellowship will be selected from a pool of highly motivated graduates with less than 5 years of research experience post PhD training. The unifying theme of both tracks is that trainee must express and demonstrate interest in bioinformatics and data science research. Our long-term goal is to produce a sustainable network of individuals who are well trained in various aspects of advanced bioinformatics and data science research, ready to assume leadership roles at academic, health care and research institutions in West Africa."
"9301778","ABSTRACT Pediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with an increased risk for a wide range of neurobehavioral and health effects that negatively impact child health, academic performance, and well-being, as well as contribute to chronic health conditions across the lifespan. Minority children, vulnerable to life-long health disparities, bear a disproportionate burden of SDB. Importantly, independent of race, children who reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at a more than 3-fold increased risk for SDB, suggesting that exposures in the home and neighborhood environment contribute to SDB, perhaps by stimulating adenotonsillar hypertrophy and airway mucosal inflammation. An improved understanding of the environmental factors that contribute to pediatric SDB is urgently needed to identify interventions for reducing sleep health disparities. To address this need, we will leverage our extensive experience with community and school-based environmental health research to recruit a sample of 300 children, ages 5 to 9 yrs from predominantly low income households attending Boston Public Schools. Children and their families will participate in a clinic and in-home exam, with collection of novel and low burdensome sleep and environmental measurements. We will focus on the role of indoor irritants and allergens while also considering factors such as indoor temperature, humidity, noise, outdoor pollution, respiratory illnesses, and neighborhood and family characteristics. SDB and sleep duration will be assessed with overnight oximetry and 7 day sleep monitoring using a validated device that quantifies movement and sound during sleep. Bedroom dust will be assayed for allergens and endotoxin, and indoor environmental air quality monitors will measure NO2, PM2.5, temperature, humidity and noise. Standardized questionnaires will characterize contextual factors, including social and family characteristics, and child's behavior. We will rigorously characterize atopic status, lung function, and second hand smoke exposure. Primary analyses will quantify the associations between environmental exposures and SDB prevalence and severity and will evaluate the potential effect modification by factors such as atopy. Longitudinal analyses will explore short and longer term variability and the impact of day to day differences in the environment on SDB and sleep. Secondary analyses will further consider the role of environmental factors on sleep duration and sleep continuity and the impact on SDB-related behavioral outcomes. These unique data will identify modifiable factors that contribute to SDB, essential for developing effective environmental control measures aimed at narrowing sleep health disparities."
"9530801","Insulin resistance is an important risk factor for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Vice versa, heavy alcohol  consumption induces insulin resistance that is associated with progression of hepatic fibrosis in  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Insulin is the key hormone that regulates lipid and glucose  metabolism; it is also an important regulator of inflammation. Thus, hepatic insulin action is likely a key  player in the pathogenesis of ALD, yet the mechanisms through which impaired insulin action predisposes  to ALD remain poorly understood. We and others have previously demonstrated that insulin signaling within  the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) controls hepatic glucose production (hGP), very low density  lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis and innate immunity through the  autonomic nervous system. Based on our pilot data that demonstrate that in a rat model for binge drinking,  i.e. short term alcohol consumption impairs glucose tolerance and induces insulin resistance that is due to  impaired hepatic insulin action. Binge drinking markedly impairs hypothalamic insulin action, defined as the  ability of hypothalamic insulin to suppress hGP and adipose tissue lipolysis. Thus, the major hypothesis  proposed in this proposal is that some of the metabolic and innate immunity defects induced by alcohol are  caused through brain effects disrupting autonomic control of both metabolism and innate immunity. In  support ofthis novel paradigm we find that a central cause ofthe impaired hypothalamic insulin action is  decreased insulin signaling in the hypothalamus likely due to increased inflammation, ER stress and   expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase l b (PTPIb), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. Here we  propose to delineate the mechanisms through which chronic alcohol consumption impairs insulin action,  disrupts hepatic carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism and generates a pro-inflammatory  environment within the liver that predisposes to ALD."
"9385865","ABSTRACT ? Project 1: Impact of co-occurring ADHD symptoms on early risk factors and routine screening  for ASD in primary care Approximately 40-60% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also have co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or elevated symptoms of ADHD, which are associated with a range of adverse clinical outcomes compared to those of children with ASD alone. These impairments include greater emotional difficulties, tantrums, conduct problems, more severe ASD symptoms, greater difficulty interacting with peers, and poorer adaptive behavior. Critically, the presence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms is also associated with later diagnosis of ASD, thus limiting access to crucial early intervention. Despite these adverse trajectories of children with ASD+ADHD, very little is known about how the co-occurrence of these clinical conditions develops in early childhood. The overall goal of Project 1 is to characterize both the risk factors for and the early emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and to understand how these symptoms impact early detection and progression of ASD. This is significant from a public health perspective since this knowledge could help reduce existing disparities in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project will take advantage of existing infrastructure and expertise to screen and monitor the population of young children seen in pediatric primary care clinics within the Duke University Health System (N ~ 2800 patients annually). In doing so, we will be able to prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and simultaneously collect data on ADHD and related behaviors starting as young as 18 months. Information related to pre- and post-natal risk factors will be obtained from children's electronic health records. We will then monitor and characterize the progression of both ASD and ADHD symptoms across development, identifying how ADHD symptoms impact ASD screening and diagnosis and later developmental outcomes. Data from Project 1 will enable the development of more effective strategies for early detection of children with ASD and co-occurring ADHD symptoms, which could reduce the delay in early detection and increase access to early treatment."
"9345361","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional biomedical research training programs fail to adequately prepare trainees for the full diversity of careers that they will ultimately experiene in the biomedical workforce. The UR Broadened Experiences in Scientific Training (URBEST) program will therefore provide a flexible, autonomy-supportive learning program that allows pre- and post-doctoral trainees to better prepare themselves for diverse career paths. Unlike traditional graduate curricula, which often have rigidly defined course requirements, the URBEST program will establish highly flexible educational pathways, curricula and experiential learning opportunities that allow trainees to meet their own self-defined learning needs. Foundational instruction in leadership and professionalism will be combioned with access to educational programs and aligned experiential learning opportunities in three URBEST Training Pathways. As trainees progress through these Pathways, they will participate in common, shared experiences that will include training in the Communication of Science, an Annual Retreat, and a Career Stories seminar series. Internship and externship programs will provide hands- on experiences relevant to diverse careers, both within the University and in partnership with a broad range of private sector companies, government and science policy organizations. URBEST will also implement mentoring practices that better support diverse career outcomes. We will mentor our mentors through: (a) a Program Orientation Session that will delineate the goals of the URBEST program, (b) instruction in Autonomy Supportive Mentoring and the use of Individual Development Programs (IDPs) and (c) a Faculty Development Workshop Series that will promulgate best mentoring practices. We will also mentor our mentees, using approaches that are expected to encourage diverse career options, and we will actively facilitate the on-boarding of trainees in their first position post-UR. First, a URBEST Trainee Network will be established to provide a robust community of scholars that trainees can leverage for peer mentoring support during their time at UR, and for long-term support throughout their careers. Second, an Alumni Mentoring Network will be established, and trainees will be partnered with UR alumni in career sectors of interest. Third, we establish an Extended Individualized Career Mentoring Program to provide continued mentoring support for URBEST trainees after they leave UR. Finally, we will rigorously evaluate our program, and disseminate our model. A comprehensive evaluation and assessment of the URBEST program and its participating trainees and faculty will be structured around three key areas: (1) trainee and faculty participation, (2) URBEST curriculum, and (3) assessment of URBEST trainees. Short-, intermediate- and long- term measures of progress will be evaluated in all areas. In addition, continuous program assessment will be used improve and refine URBEST, and to ensure that it accomplishes its goals. Finally, we will develop a plan for the sustainability and dissemination of our training model."
"9209201","Project 3: The metabolomics of tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock ABSTRACT:Tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock (HS) deprive cells of oxygen and delay waste removal, provoking biochemical adaptation to promote cellular survival. The loss of equipoise immediately potentiates trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) and inflammation, acutely impacting morbidity and mortality. Investigation has spanned decades, but the precise metabolic response to tissue injury and HS remains undefined.  Mass spectrometry based (MS)-metabolomics for the study of trauma allows enhanced understanding of the consequences of a rapidly evolving metabolic state following organ-specific injury patterns and varying degrees of hemorrhagic shock. In addition to the simultaneous measure of hundreds of analytes, heavy-isotope labeling experiments, in animal models, define dynamic alterations in primary metabolic pathways, directing testable hypotheses for specific treatment targets translatable to patient care. Novel metabolomics stimulate new hypotheses within areas of longstanding investigation, such as bacterial metabolites as mediators of acute pathology following gut ischemia/reperfusion. Collaborative, tiered analyses of metabolomic details confirm the responses contributing to deadly post-injury systemic consequences, such as TIC and hyperfibrinolysis. Distinct metabolites then become targets for metabolomic-based resuscitation (MSR), aimed at improving immediate post-injury survival, vs. conventional resuscitation. We hypothesize Tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock instigate discrete metabolic changes that cause systemic pathology. MSR will improve early morbidity and mortality after injury by preventing these metabolic consequences. Specific Aim 1. Delineate metabolic responses to organ-specific trauma and HS. Evaluate the efficacy of conventional resuscitation in preventing post-injury metabolopathies that cause systemic pathology. Specific Aim 2. Design metabolomic-based systems resuscitation (MSR) strategies supporting protective adaptations and correcting metabolopathies following polytrauma and HS. To compare post-shock physiologic outcomes between MSR and conventional resuscitation strategies. Specific Aim 3. Investigate the contribution of gut bacterial metabolites to post-shock cell energetics, coagulopathy, inflammation and distal organ injury. Impact: Discrete metabolopathies associated with organ-specific injury, shock, the gut microbiome and the metabolic response to resuscitation strategies. In-vivo isotope labeling provides description of unrecognized metabolic mechanisms and will support novel resuscitation strategies, to be administered in the field, that prevent TIC, hyperfibrinolysis and cardiopulmonary collapse, thereby improving trauma patient survival."

"9334855","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of Washington Urinary Stone Disease Clinical Center (UWCC) seeks to advance the field of urinary stone disease (USD) research through participation in the Research Network and by taking a comprehensive aim at the problem of ureteral stent burden. In the United States, USD affects 1 in 9 adults, exerting a substantial burden related to pain, lost work, and healthcare expenditures that add up to $10 billion per year. The per capita disability from USD in the United States is higher than any other nation, potentially reflecting the cost and side effects of intensive treatment. A team of investigators with broad experience in urology, pediatrics, nephrology, health services, bioinformatics, pharmacogenetics, pain medicine, and biostatistics across the University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and the VA Puget Sound Health Care System will address this complex problem, harnessing the extensive patient care and research infrastructure of these institutions. The clinical activity of 6 hospitals will be harnessed to provide the platform for sufficient sample sizes to address two main facets of USD. Our specific aims include (1) to determine the effectiveness of a short message service (SMS, or text) reminder-optimized, fluid-intake intervention on kidney stone recurrence in urinary stone formers; (2) to characterize the symptom burden of ureteral stents and to evaluate strategies that reduce ureteral stent-related pain and discomfort; and (3) to identify novel mechanistic candidates associated with stent-related pain and urinary bother. Our interrelated aims set the stage for future USDRN-wide trials to move top study designs and tools into translational applications, including those for disease prevention, drug targeting of severe stent-related problems, and biomarker development. We envision that our proposed strategies will move USD prevention and treatment beyond a trial-and-error approach, informing clinically relevant intervention and prevention decisions at both an individual and a population level."

Her long-term goal is to establish an independent academic career in translational research to identify mechanisms of tumor-mediated immune suppression, develop strategies to overcome this suppression, and test these strategies in early phase clinical trials. Her immediate goal is to generate data for a successful R01 application examining mechanisms of lymphoma-associated monocyte and tumor crosstalk that promote treatment resistance in lymphoma. Mayo Clinic has a strong cancer research program and a long track record of training successful translational and clinical researchers. Dr. Lin is supported by Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE to ensure adequate access to resources to complete the proposed project. Dr. Lin's K22 career development plan includes gaining competency in working with animal models and strengthening practical laboratory experience to establish an independently funded research program. In her current work, Dr. Lin has found that monocytes are commonly immune suppressive in many cancer types and contributes to aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. Focusing on lymphoma as a tumor model, she has found that lymphoma-associated monocytes (LA-CD14) are not only immunosuppressive but also directly promote lymphoma resistance to chemotherapy. In this K22 proposal, Dr. Lin will examine mechanisms of LA-CD14 and lymphoma crosstalk that promote treatment resistance. This will be achieved through two specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism of LA-CD14 mediated promotion of lymphoma resistance to chemotherapy. 2) Determine the mechanism of LA-CD14 mediated protection of lymphoma from anti-tumor immunity. Successful completion of this project will provide the foundational data for an R01 application to study specific strategies to re-sensitize lymphoma to chemo-immunotherapy. The NCI K22 award will provide critical support for Dr. Lin's transition from a mentored researcher to an independent investigator."
"9360000","  Project Summary/Abstract Human ring chromosomes are abnormal structures formed by intrachromosomal fusions, creating a circular chromosome. Ring chromosome syndrome is a debilitating disorder resulting in severe drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectually disabilities (IQ <70), and developmental delay. Ring chromosome patients and families deal with life-long challenges of prolonged seizures, learning and memory issues, severe psychological disruption, and a feeling of powerlessness, resulting in a great deal of stress and strain. Clinically this disorder affects multiple organ systems including the brain (microcephaly, early onset epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities), the eye, the immune system, and growth. Our laboratory and others, have focused on mapping and characterizing the molecular and cytogenetics of ring chromosome structures; however, to date no published studies have focused on investigating the cellular neuropathology due to lack of appropriate models. To investigate this disorder, we have created a large biobank of cell lines from ring chromosome 14 (r(14)) patients and family members. From these cell lines, we have produced the only model available by generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells, which provide the foundation for studying this devastating disorder that lacks alternative models. In our preliminary work, we find that by differentiating ring chromosome iPSCs toward a forebrain fate we can generate populations of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) that can be further differentiated into post-mitotic neurons. Neuronal precursor cells harboring the ring chromosome 14 have reduced cellular growth and decreased expression of key telencephalon neuronal markers. Interestingly, a number of genes located on chromosome 14 are involved in neuronal differentiation or maintenance, leading us to postulate that the ring structure modifies expression of this key gene responsible for in vitro cortical cell generation. We have also begun to generate an in vitro cerebral cortex organoid model, which will be important for studying the early embryonic events perturbed in a R(14) developmental model. Mammalian genomes are organized in distinct architectures which allow for the orchestration of proper gene and epigenetic regulation. Our proposed studies will identify ring chromosome 14 orientation in the nucleus, epigenetic marks on chromosome 14, and establish a 3-dimensional (3D) cerebral cortex developmental model for studying phenotypes of Ring chromosome 14 syndrome. We hypothesize that the altered higher order chromosome structure resulting from ring formation disrupts normal chromatin compaction, looping, localization within the nucleus and ultimately gene regulation. The proposed work will provide important tools for studying R(14) syndrome, and yield a comprehensive view of the role a ring chromosome has on DNA positioning, chromatin modifications, and in vitro neuronal development. In addition, this innovative model should provide a strong foundation for future work fully characterizing 3D organoid development in R(14) and provide essential reagents (neuronal tissues) to study the neural circuits and electrophysiological patterns in R(14) patient samples."
"9343065","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the inhibition of synaptic vesicle fusion by monomeric alpha-Synuclein (alphaS). This research will establish the foundation for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). There is growing consensus that monomeric alphaS is a central regulatory component of synaptic vesicle trafficking. Although the formation of Lewy bodies, mediated by the aggregation of alphaS into insoluble fibrils, is commonly associated with PD, high levels of alphaS have also been shown to disrupt normal vesicle trafficking and markedly inhibit neurotransmitter release without the formation of alphaS aggregates. Our approach will involve quantitative studies of the biophysical and mechanical properties of synaptic vesicle membranes for which we will combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with a panel of complementary biophysical experiments. A precise understanding of the native interactions between monomeric alphaS and synaptic vesicle membranes will position us to evaluate the protein's role in vesicle trafficking defects as they relate to PD. Limited biophysica data have yielded conflicting views on how alphaS over-expression inhibits vesicle trafficking and fusion in the absence of fibril formation. In multiple model systems from yeast to rodents, an overabundance of alphaS has been shown to stall proper synaptic vesicle cycling at the plasma membrane. One view is that this pathology may be driven by interactions between alphaS and other synaptic or plasma membrane proteins (e.g. SNARES). We propose an alternate view based on recent work both from our labs and others. According to this view, alphaS can directly alter the physical properties of lipids within membranes - namely membrane rigidity and phase. This is achieved in the absence of specific interactions with other proteins. We therefore reason that alphaS might have an intrinsic capacity to control synaptic vesicle fusion. This hypothesis is motivated by our preliminary data and published result from biophysical experiments, which show that alphaS reduces a membrane's rigidity, can alter membrane curvature, and can inhibit fusion of synthetic (otherwise protein-free) lipid vesicles. Our proposed research intimately combines computational modeling with experimental x-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy to bridge a critical gap in understanding how alphaS creates physical barriers to vesicle fusion. The proposed research avenue will provide critical information about PD associated trafficking defects. Ultimately, our work will lead to better understanding of normal and abnormal functions of alphaS and position the community to develop new therapeutic strategies that exploit the native state of the protein (i.e., restoring proper vesicle trafficking."
"9292329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African Americans (AA) who are more than three times more likely to develop glaucoma when compared to Caucasians. Changes associated with the progression of glaucoma can have a serious negative impact on an individual's quality of life, independence, and everyday functioning. Accumulating research indicates that pressure-reducing eye drops can significantly delay or prevent the onset of disease; however, such preventative efforts have been found to be limited due to problems with poor medication adherence. Lacking are available health promotion interventions that minimize this important health disparity. Thus, in our research program, we demonstrated this health disparity for glaucoma medication adherence (Dreer et al., 2012). Next, we conducted several follow-up studies in order to develop a culturally relevant and informed, health promotion-based intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among AA's. As part of the intervention development process, we conducted several focus groups with AA glaucoma patients to elicit the salient barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence, and then formed a community-based participatory research team comprised of AA's with glaucoma (Dreer et al., 2013). The resulting intervention was based on a multi-component empowerment framework that includes glaucoma education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving training to improve glaucoma medication adherence. We recently pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention among AA's. Findings revealed significant improvements in objective medication adherence (Dreer et al., under review). Therefore, we now propose to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients in a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT).  The patient population for the RCT will consist of 240 adult AA's with glaucoma and who are aged = 21 years who seek services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Glaucoma Clinic within the Department of Ophthalmology. The RCT will have two treatment arms; patients will be randomized following eligibility determination and written informed consent. The usual care only arm will consist of the standard medical care for glaucoma (medicine, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these). The second arm will consist of usual care as just described plus the culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The primary outcome (objective glaucoma medication adherence) and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline before intervention initiation and at 3, 7, and 12-month in-clinic follow-up visits by a research interviewer masked to subjects' randomization. The practical question to be addressed is does a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention improve glaucoma medication adherence among a high-risk segment of the population? Information from this project will be particularly useful for AA's with glaucoma, their families, and eye care providers."
"9541115","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a major anti-cancer barrier that inhibits malignant transformation of precancerous cells, in which the p53 signaling plays a central role. Previous studies have shown that p53 induction in precancerous cells is attributed to the ATM-mediated DNA damage response (DDR). Several protein kinases in the DDR, including ATM, CHK1 and CHK2, phosphorylate p53 at multiple serine/threonine sites, which has long been considered to stabilize and activate p53. However, we and other groups found that phosphorylation-deficient p53 mutant exhibited similar protein stability as the wildtype p53, suggesting that DDR-induced phosphorylation events may not be the only major factor for the p53 induction in response to oncogenic stress. The goal of this application is to unravel the oncogene-induced p53 response in mechanistic detail. P53 is tightly controlled at physiological levels by ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. Much has been studied on the p53-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Mdm2, ARF-BP1, and COP1, little is known about the deubiquitination of p53. In a genome-wide screen using a cDNA library of ubiquitin specific peptidases (USPs), we searched for potential USPs for p53 deubiquitination. Intriguingly, as many as 16 USPs significantly inhibited p53, while only 4 USPs moderately increased p53 activity. This result indicated that USPs probably modulate p53 activity primarily through promoting p53 inhibitors, such as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Since all of the p53-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases are also degraded by auto-ubiquitination, a potential mechanism is that USPs negatively regulate p53 levels via deubiquitination and stabilization of the p53- targeting E3 ligases. This is true in the previously identified USP7-Mdm2-p53 regulatory loop, and is also supported by our current finding that USP4 inhibits p53 by deubiquitination and stabilization of ARF-BP1. Furthermore, p53 is induced upon oncogenic stress even in the absence of detectable DNA damage, suggesting a DDR-independent induction of p53. In this study, we show that oncogene-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) inactivate the enzymatic activity of USPs through oxidation of crucial cysteine residues in their catalytic pockets, resulting in destabilization of the p53-targeting E3 ligases and consequential stabilization of p53. Based on these results, we propose that USPs function as redox sensor to translate oncogenic stress into the p53 signaling during cancer initiation."
"9145761","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited inability to synthesize cortisol. More than 90% of cases are caused by deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21), which occurs in the severe classic form in ~1:16,000 births. Infants with classic CAH are susceptible to life threatening adrenal insufficiency. Additionally, the adrenal cortex overproduces cortisol precursors, particularly 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), which are further metabolized to androgen precursors (e.g., androstenedione) and subsequently to testosterone. Severely affected girls are born with ambiguous external genitalia. Inadequately treated patients are exposed to high levels of sex hormones which promote rapid somatic growth and accelerated skeletal maturation leading to premature epiphyseal fusion. Adult heights in classic patients average ~ 7 cm below the population mean. Patients are treated by replacing glucocorticoids (usually with hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (with fludrocortisone). Both under-treatment and over-treatment with glucocorticoids put patients at risk for short stature, the former owing to premature epiphyseal closure induced by abnormal secretion of sex steroids, and the latter to glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of growth. Excess glucocorticoid exposure also puts CAH patients at risk for excess weight gain and metabolic syndrome. This project will test whether pharmacologic blockade of sex steroid synthesis in prepubescent children with CAH improves these problems. The study drug, abiraterone acetate, is a prodrug of abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor approved for treatment of prostate cancer. The study population includes prepubescent children with classic CAH owing to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, girls 2-8 and boys 2-9 years old. Subjects will be treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone throughout each study. In a Phase 1 study, we will determine the minimum effective dose of abiraterone acetate that normalizes androstenedione levels. During the 7-day Treatment Period, up to 3 cohorts of 8 subjects each will receive, in succession, 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg/d of abiraterone acetate, until 7/8 subjects have normalized their morning androstenedione concentration on Day 7 of abiraterone administration. In a Phase 2 study, we will assess the utility of abiraterone acetate as adjunctive therapy to minimize excessive androgen secretion and allow more physiologic glucocorticoid replacement. This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of abiraterone acetate (dose determined in Phase 1) versus placebo for 24 months. We will randomize 54 subjects (36 to abiraterone and 18 to placebo), aiming to have 48 subjects completing the study. The primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving abiraterone will have slower skeletal maturation (i.e., advancement in radiologic bone age). The secondary hypothesis is that subjects who receive abiraterone will require lower mean daily hydrocortisone doses to normalize androstenedione. Exploratory hypotheses are that subjects receiving abiraterone will have lower increases in weight, height and BMI, and consequently less insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR, than subjects receiving placebo."
"9341947","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathies: Approaches to Treatment. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are a heavy public health burden and therapy is woefully inadequate. We are proposing therapy-directed studies for disorders associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations, especially mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke like episodes (MELAS-3243), and for mendelian disorders, including the mtDNA depletion due to TK2 deficiency and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiencies. In Project # I, Dr. Darryl De Vivo, P.I. will continue to characterize the natural history of MELAS, correlating clinical course in probands and carriers with cerebral and muscle biomarkers assessed by MRSI and 31P- NMR. He will seek new biomarkers by applying metabolomics (collaboration with Dr. Vamsi Mootha, Harvard University and MIT, Boston, MA). Project #2 (Dr. Eric A. Schon, P.I.) will concentrate on pharmacological approaches to mtDNA-related disorders by evaluating the effectiveness of compounds affecting heteroplasmic shifting or functional rescuing through modulation of mitophagy and quality control. Project # 3 (Dr. Michio Hirano, P.I.) will use pharmacological and gene therapy of thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency in mice that faithfully recapitulate the human disease. A molecular bypass therapy is showing promising preliminary results, with amelioration of the abnormal phenotype and extension of the lifespan not only in mice but also in a few human subjects. In TK2 knock-in mice he also plans to test gene therapy using adeno- associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver human TK2 and restore enzymatic activity. In Project # 4 (Dr. Catarina Quinzii, PI), Dr. Quinzii will test genetic and pharmacologic therapies for CoQ10 deficiency in vitro through ADCK3 overexpression and exposure to analogs of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, a precursor required for CoQ10 biosynthesis. She also proposes to compare efficacies of oral and intrathecal administration of CoQ10 and idebenone in preventing or delaying the molecular and biochemical abnormalities, and the clinical onset of the disease in the Pdss2kd/kd and in the newly available Coq9X/X mutant mice Core Unit A (the Administrative Core) (Dr. Salvatore DiMauro, Director; Dr.Michio Hirano, Co-Director) will provide direction, administration, and external consultation. Core Unit B (the Technical Core) (Dr. Ali Naini, Director) will provide technical service (tissue culture), diagnostc tools (histochemistry, biochemistry, molecular genetics), and manage shared equipment for the project as a whole."
"9340116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C evolve at a rapid pace, the decision to treat immediately or defer for the promise of future therapy has become increasingly complex. Treatment considerations must balance multiple patient characteristics, preferences, and treatment efficacy data, much of which fraught with uncertainty. Decision analytic modeling can augment traditional clinical studies by elucidating the comparative benefits and harms of treatment timing in different patient populations. The active integration of treatment priorities and challenges as directly elicited from patients and providers during the modeling process can ensure the relevancy of such analyses to key stakeholders as well as the effective dissemination of results. Such data could be highly useful in communicating tailored, patient-oriented estimates of risks and benefits of HCV therapy between health care providers affected patients, thereby improving informed medical decision making. Additionally, a clearer understanding of data uncertainty in the current literature could lead to rational priority setting for future research in hepatitis C care and treatment. I have developed a strong foundation in biostatistics, epidemiology, and decision-analytic methods through the completion of a Masters of Public Health, as well as through broad analytic experience within highly rigorous research environments at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Northwestern University, and now the University of Chicago. Through this K99/R00 proposal I will further develop my expertise in complex disease modeling, and examine, within the context of provider and patient interaction, how medical decision-making can be better informed by stakeholder engagement as well as better understanding of data uncertainty. Through Aim 1 I propose to develop a community partnership through the creation of a Patient and Stakeholder Advisory Board (PSAB) in order to inform the design of a decision-analytic model, identify the factors impacting decision-making surrounding hepatitis C treatment, review and monitor model outputs and optimize the dissemination of results. This will be achieved through systematic process throughout the course of the award and will utilize nominal group techniques, focused surveys and open discussion. I will then use the knowledge gained from this partnership to adapt and further develop a published state transition model of HCV natural history and treatment (Aim 2) that may serve as a platform to evaluate clinical questions requiring sequential decision-making between current and future therapies. I will use this model to examine the comparative effectiveness of immediate versus deferred treatment for different subpopulations of patients afflicted with hepatitis C (Aim 3). Using advanced sensitivity analysis techniques and value of information analyses, I will identify areas of future research in hepatitis C natural history and treatment that would have greatest impact on overall clinical outcomes (Aim 4). The proposed analysis addresses the specific research priorities of the Department of Health and Human Services Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, & Treatment of Viral Hepatitis to advance research in care for the diverse populations living with viral hepatitis, and is fully aligned with the mission of Section 6301(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to strengthen data-driven, patient-centered outcomes research. To ensure the success of this proposed K99/R00 project I have assembled a highly experienced and expert team of mentors and scientific advisors, including my mentor Dr. David Meltzer MD, PhD, and co-mentor Dr. Donald Jensen, MD, who will provide training in advanced analytic methodologies such as complex model building, value of information analysis, and qualitative methods, as well as content expertise in hepatitis C natural history and treatment. The University of Chicago is a world-class research institution, and the Department of Medicine and Section of Hospital Medicine have committed resources and support based on the strength of this proposal, as well as my own potential to contribute meaningfully to the field of comparative effectiveness research in hepatitis C. The K99/R00 award will provide a critical mechanism, through high intensity advanced training, expert mentorship, and analytic platform building to achieve a rapid transition to independence and to establish a career in patient-centered decision-analytic outcomes research."
"9394448","Project Summary: Nutrients affect tissue stem cell lineages in all organisms. Interorgan signaling allows the impact of diet or physiological factors on one organ to be communicated to stem cell lineages elsewhere. Circulating levels of most energy substrates and metabolites vary with diet, and many of these activate G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are associated with metabolic diseases, cancers and other disorders. It is therefore essential to investigate how GPCR signaling links metabolism to stem lineage processes in vivo. Adipocytes have key metabolic roles, and obesity increases the risk for many diseases. Among them are cancers, which share similarities with stem cells. Signaling pathways that control normal stem cells are often deregulated in cancers (e.g. diet-dependent pathways), and cancers and stem cells have large proliferative potential and generate differentiated cells in deregulated or controlled ways, respectively. The goal of this proposal is to study how diet controls adipocyte metabolism and how GPCR signaling mediates its effects on stem cell lineages using the Drosophila germline stem cell (GSC) model. Drosophila has highly conserved adipocyte metabolism and well characterized stem cells. One can readily identify GSCs and quantify self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation and survival along their lineage. GSCs and their progeny divide and grow faster on a rich diet, partially via insulin, steroid hormone, and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in the ovary. Adipocytes contribute to the GSC response to diet, as adipocyte-specific disruption of amino acid transport or TOR causes distinct GSC lineage phenotypes. Our unpublished data show that diet also regulates metabolic pathways in adipocytes, and key adipocyte enzymes influence GSC number, proliferation, and differentiation, survival of their daughters. In addition, our results show that distinct G proteins regulate GSC fate and division, and progeny survival, suggesting that GPCR signaling actively modulates the GSC lineage. We will test our hypothesis that key diet-dependent metabolic pathways in adipocytes control the levels of metabolites (or other downstream factors) that act directly on the ovary (or indirectly, through intermediate organs) to modulate the GSC lineage through the following aims: 1) To determine how macronutrients and diet-dependent hormones impact key adipocyte metabolic pathways; and 2) To probe the role of G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in the GSC lineage. Relevance: Obesity is prevalent in the western world and results in the abnormal function of fat cells, which in turn increases the risk for many diseases, including cancers. We propose to take advantage of powerful research tools in fruitflies to investigate how metabolic processes in fat cells normally generate signals that affect the function of stem cells in other parts of the body. Because of the high degree of evolutionary conservation of molecules and biological processes between fruitflies and humans, this work will likely provide valuable insights into diseases resulting from metabolic abnormalities in fat cells."
"9357734","Abstract  With the support of this K01, Dr. Amy Bei will pursue her career goal of conducting cutting-edge tropical diseases research in the United States and overseas, in close collaboration with resident scientists in malaria endemic countries. Dr. Bei's research focuses on applied international public health, and lies at the intersection between population genetics, genomics, epidemiology, molecular genetics, and immunology. She will use a translational systems biology approach to study the impact of antigenic diversity on immune evasion and vector transmission. The mentorship and training proposed here will facilitate her transition to an independent researcher, working towards the goal of an effective, diversity-transcendent vaccine for malaria.  As an established member of two scientific communities, Dr. Bei contributes to the activities of the Harvard Malaria Initiative at HTHCSPH and the Broad Institute, which provide the technical innovation and scientific resources needed to augment her growth as a scientist, and to those of the greater malaria research community of Dakar, Senegal, which is represented by the Institute Pasteur Dakar, University Cheikh Anta Diop, National Malaria Control Program, and PATH: MACEPA. While based at Le Dantec Hospital in the laboratories of Drs. Daouda Ndiaye and Souleymane Mboup, Dr. Bei has guided both malaria training and research activities for the past 5 years. Dr. Bei will assess the impact of genetic diversity on the development of immunity and dynamics of vector transmission in malaria endemic West Africa, while gaining expertise in the analytical tools needed to process complex genomic and transcriptomic data. She will conduct these studies under the expert guidance of U.S. mentor Dr. Dyann Wirth, Department Chair of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, a leader in malaria biology with extensive experience in studying parasite genetics, elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance, and developing advanced genomic approaches; Senegal mentor Dr. Daouda Ndiaye, Chief of the Laboratory of Parasitology-Mycology at Le Dantec Hospital, a recognized leader in infectious diseases research on antimalarial drug resistance and malaria parasite diversity; co-mentor Dr. Carole Long, Chief of the Malaria Immunology Section, LMVR, NIAID, NIH and director of the Malaria Vaccine Reference Center; and co-mentor Dr. Rick Fairhurst, Chief of the Malaria Pathogenesis and Human Immunity Unit, LMVR, NIAID, NIH. Both co-mentors have extensive expertise in performing longitudinal cohort studies, standardizing immune and drug resistance assays, and evaluating malaria vaccines.  Antigenic diversity plays a major role in immune evasion, potentially compromising the development of natural or vaccine induced protective immunity. In Senegal, parasites with identical genotypes are found to increasingly infect multiple individuals in the population. This unique observation provides an unprecedented opportunity to test if individuals develop variant-specific immunity to the parasite genotypes to which they have been previously exposed. Alternatively or additionally, such persisting parasite genotypes may preferentially transmit to the mosquito vector or may be overrepresented in asymptomatic reservoirs. Such hypotheses can only be tested in a disease endemic setting in which patients can be monitored longitudinally, parasite genotypes can be tracked spatiotemporally in real-time, and robust correlates of immunity and transmission can be measured ex vivo. Dr. Bei will assess the effector function of naturally acquired IgG to specific parasite genotypes in growth inhibition assays (GIAs), variant surface antigen (VSA) recognition assays, and opsonophagocytosis assays, over time in a Senegalese longitudinal cohort, as well as the parasites' transmission potential for Anopheles mosquitoes. The proposed studies require the cohesion of cutting-edge genomic technologies, a well characterized longitudinal cohort to follow infection evolution and immunity development, standardized assays to serve as in vitro correlates of immune protection and transmission, and strong ties to endemic country scientists and institutions. Dr. Bei is uniquely positioned to combine these critical requirements to investigate the implications of parasite diversity on the development of protective immunity. Ultimately, this knowledge will be essential to developing a diversity-transcendent malaria vaccine."

"9339736","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a non-coding region of C9orf72 was recently identified to be the most common genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontal temporal dementia (FTD). The leading hypothesis for the disease mechanism is gain of toxicity from the expanded repeats, with two non- mutually exclusive mechanisms: 1) RNA foci formed by hexanucleotide repeats that could sequester RNA binding proteins and disrupt RNA processing; and 2) accumulation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) produced by repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RAN translation). Furthermore, the repeats are transcribed in both sense and antisense directions. How exactly or to what extent these different products contribute to disease is not established. In this project,  propose to combine new genomic, biochemistry and cellular and mouse modeling tools to determine the molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis and identify candidate targets for therapeutic development. I will define a C9orf72 repeat expansion-dependent RNA signature in human neurons derived from a large number of patient fibroblasts, including alterations in both RNA expression and alternative splicing using genome-wide sequencing approaches. I will determine whether decreasing sense and/or antisense repeat- containing transcripts by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment reverses the RNA signature in C9orf72 patient neurons. I will also decipher the functional contribution from repeat-containing RNAs and RAN translation-encoded poly-dipeptides by genome engineering control cells with individual potentially toxic product. I will identify specific RNA-binding protein(s) associated with either sense or antisense hexanucleotide repeats in intact cells using an in vivo RNA tagging system, and determine whether loss of function of any of these contributes to the RNA signature in C9orf72 neurons. I will then decipher the damaging pathways in neurons by manipulating the candidate gene changes, perturbed pathways and RNA-binding proteins. Finally, I will determine whether the repeat expansion in glial cells have toxic effects on neurons through a non-cell autonomous mechanism by combining mouse modeling for identification of cell type-specific, age- and repeat length-dependent RNA changes caused by C9orf72 repeat expansion in vivo, and co-culturing of iPSC- differentiated neurons with astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Overall, I believe that my proposal has the potential to test several key hypotheses regarding C9orf72-mediated pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and identify a disease- dependent molecular signature that enables the development of therapeutic strategies."
"9334869","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the United States and worldwide, remains a major global public health concern. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), age-dependent and intraocular pressure (IOP)-related neurodegeneration of the optic nerve comprises 74% of all types of glaucoma. Glaucoma-related visual loss, even in the presence of normal visual acuity, can lead to significant functional visual impairment and substantial secondary risks to health including depression, falls and motor vehicle accidents. Approximately 3% percent of the world population aged 40 years and older has glaucoma. Worldwide, women comprise 59% of those affected by glaucoma, due in large part to their greater longevity. Women are also at risk for visual loss from glaucoma because they are 24% less likely to be treated for this condition, and some data suggest that women report greater functional loss from glaucoma than men. These sex differences underscore the importance of investigating sex-specific risk factors for glaucoma. To that end, this application builds on a conceptual model and preliminary epidemiological data to explore the novel idea that early loss of estrogen might contribute to early aging of the optic nerve in women and thereby increase women's risk of developing glaucoma. Clinical, epidemiological, and basic science studies indicate that estradiol has neuroprotective effects on the optic nerve. The training and research proposals in this application are aimed at fostering the career path of an independent clinician-scientist who will lead a scholarly program of research that examines factors associated with optic nerve aging and the role of sex steroid hormones, particularly estradiol, in the degeneration of the optic nerve and risk for glaucoma. A proposed five-year program of training and research includes: 1) applying MPH-level training in epidemiological and biostatistical methods to examine the impact of early oophorectomy on glaucoma risk in a large epidemiological cohort study of the health consequences of oophorectomy; and 2) applying training in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, clinical imaging and sex steroid hormones to a mechanistic, translational study aimed at comparing measures of optic nerve aging, as indexed by thinning of the retinal nerve fiber by optical coherence tomography and decreased light sensitivity by visual field testing in women who underwent early oophorectomy and age-matched controls. This work will guide further research in early glaucoma screening and treatment of women with early natural menopause (approximately 6% of women) and early bilateral oophorectomy (37% of women who undergo bilateral oophorectomy). This training and line of research will provide a foundation for future studies investigating the effects of aromatas inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators and other anti- estrogen treatments on the optic nerve. More broadly, this work serves as a foundation for a future line of investigations int sex-differences and non-hormonal mechanisms of optic nerve aging and risks for glaucoma."
"9388883","PROJECT SUMMARY  The present application builds on recent research in our laboratory showing that social visual engagement?the  way in which infants visually explore, engage, and ultimately learn from and adapt to their surrounding world?  is (1) tightly coupled to genetic variation, with concordance in identical toddler twins equal to 0.91; (2) highly  phylogenetically conserved, with infant rhesus monkeys exhibiting patterns of early eye-looking that are strikingly  homologous to human infants; and (3) pathognomonically impaired in infants later diagnosed with ASD, with  differences observed from at least month 2 onwards in initial and replication cohorts. The present application will  build on these findings to study pivotal transitions in early infancy that set the stage for future attainment of social-  communicative milestones. We will investigate early infant transitions from reflex-like to volitional social adaptive  action in the first 2 months post-partum (Aim 1); the emergence of reciprocal and contingent infant social  interaction (Aim 2); and the cascading consequences of very early infant social engagement?or the disruption  thereof in ASD?on later, long-term social-communicative outcomes (Aim 3). Finally, we will connect these  measures to concomitant changes in developing structural and functional brain networks (in Projects III and V),  to the emergence of spoken communication (in Project II), and to response to early social interaction therapy (in  Project IV). A cohort of 250 infants will be enrolled, consisting of infant siblings of children with autism who are  at High Risk for developing ASD (HR-ASD, N=150) as well as infant siblings at Low Risk of developmental delays,  with Typical Development expected by virtue of having no familial history of ASD (LR-TDx, N=100). Data will be  collected longitudinally and prospectively, beginning in the first week after birth. This project directly addresses  several of the aspirational goals for autism set forth by the NIH Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee,  with emphasis on understanding the unfolding developmental trajectories, underlying mechanisms, and  biological signatures of ASD."
"9282256","PROJECT SUMMARY Consumption of alcohol products imposes substantial costs on individuals and society. Alcohol is among the top three leading causes of preventable disease and death in the U.S. The economic cost of excessive drinking was estimated $223.5 billion in 2006 due to lost productivity, healthcare, criminal justice, and other costs. Policymakers have enacted myriad policies to reduce consumption and consequently harms including taxation, Sunday sale bans, outlet density limits, alcohol control systems and age limits, among others. But the findings with respect to the effects of these policies are often mixed with some studies finding large effects while others find marginal or no significant effects. The inconsistency in the findings across studies is not surprising: Evaluating these relationships is empirically challenging in large part due to concerns about selection and heterogeneity. This study exploits a rare natural experiment to estimate the effects of alcohol policies on consumption and harms while simultaneously addressing selection and heterogeneity. Individuals select into neighborhoods, and hence policy environments, based on preferences for health and other unobserved factors. As a result, selection may bias estimates of policy effects when using observational data. Such bias may even undermine longitudinal studies if policy changes are influenced by changes in preferences. Because random assignment to neighborhoods is generally infeasible, evidence from natural experiments is desperately needed. An additional concern with respect to inference is heterogeneity. Alcohol policies may not affect all individuals equally and so may average out to small or null effects, thereby yielding misleading conclusions. An emerging literature suggests that risk preferences may play a role. Risk preferences vary considerably and have been linked with health behaviors. And perceptions of the risk from substance use are correlated with attitudes toward control policies. It seems likely then that individuals with greater risk tolerance might be differentially impacted by policies. However, this has not yet been examined empirically. Our innovative study will exploit a unique natural experiment, compulsory reassignment of military personnel to new installations and hence different alcohol policies, to examine the effects on consumption and harms as well as whether risk preferences moderate these relationships. Military personnel's compulsory relocations are a result of the military's needs and so exogenous to individuals' health-related behaviors. To leverage this natural experiment, we utilize three waves of the Department of Defense Survey of Health-Related Behaviors, which collects detailed data on substance use and harms. Importantly, the survey also collects information on individual's risk preferences, which allows us to explore the important yet vastly understudied issue of how preferences moderate responses to policy efforts. While there is often a trade-off between causality and generalizability with natural experiments, military personnel exhibit the same troubling patterns of substance use as civilians, potentially indicating that generalizability may be a limited concern. This study will have a high impact because it addresses one of the most critical and costly health issues and because it is highly innovative in both its utilization of plausibly exogenous variation in policy environments and in its focus on the role of risk preferences in understanding heterogeneity in policy effects. The findings will yield important policy implications not only about ?what works?, but also ?for whom? it may work best."
"9450748","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished work we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic mapping on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 5] Developed methods to ultrastructurally interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to JSRD, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in any proven JSRD gene lead to collapse of the ciliary transition zone by correlating genetic mutations with ultrastructural ciliary defects. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations within a mechanistic framework, and a model that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development."
"9093793","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Prostate gland is an accessory reproductive endocrine organ in males, which expels proteolytic solution in the urethra during ejaculation. In humans, the prostate is located immediately below the base of the bladder surrounding the neck region of the urethra, and is associated with many human diseases, including benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, and malignancies. The high morbidity of these disorders and related complications are a significant burden on our current healthcare system, and will become even greater for our nation in the coming decades due to a rapid increase of the aging population. Despite the intense research efforts that have been made in past decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders are still poorly understood. Emerging evidence has shown that stem cells are required to maintain and repair tissues throughout ones' lifetime. Recent studies also demonstrate that certain urogenital sinus cells carry out biological properties to commit to prostate cell fate at the embryonic stage of prostate development.  The Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in development, morphogenesis, and organogenesis. Wnt growth factors activate different intracellular targets through either the canonical or the non-canonical pathways. The canonical signaling pathways are mainly mediated through ß-catenin. The Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway has been shown to be critical in the development of the prostate at the perinatal stage. Genetic interactions between Wnt/ß-catenin and androgen signaling pathways have been identified in the early development of the prostate. Axin2 is a direct transcriptional target of ß-catenin and is upregulated after activation of Wnt signaling. Recent studies have shown that Axin2 positive cells have stem/progenitor cell properties in a variety of mouse tissues. In this new R01 application, we will use the novel mouse models and other state-of-the-art experimental approaches to identify the Wnt/ß-catenin responsive stem/progenitor cells in the prostate, which has never been investigated in the field. Three specific aims are proposed here to test our central hypothesis: Wnt/ß-catenin signaling plays a essential role in prostate development and regeneration through its downstream responsive cells, and that aberrant activation of these responsive cells in the prostate directly contribute t prostate pathology. The proposed study seeks to gain innovative information on prostatic stem/progenitor cells, and may lead to new directions and challenges to current paradigms."
"9444701","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of hemimegalencephaly Abstract Somatic mutations, in which a fraction of the cells in the body have a deleterious mutation, is well recognized in cancer but only recently appreciated in neurological disease. In the setting of a somatic mutation in a population of progenitor cells, all daughter cells inherit te mutation and are able to express the resultant phenotype as a function of the differentiation program. We recently identified the first de novo somatic mutations in the developing brain in the condition hemimegalencephaly, (HME) a catastrophic focal epilepsy condition associated with a malformation of cerebral cortical development (MCD). HME is one of the most severe MCD syndromes, characterized by massive hamartomatous overgrowth of either of the two cerebral hemispheres. Cerebral hemispherectomy is a frequent treatment for the refractory epilepsy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. By comparing DNA from diseased brain with DNA from blood/saliva, we identified de novo somatic mutations in PIK3CA, AKT3 or MTOR, part of the mTOR pathway. Mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions sampled during surgery, and some in codons known to activate the protein. However, the pilot study was based on a limited sample size. The goal of this application is to expand upon our initial findings, and elucidate the genetic, developmental, signaling and cell biological mechanisms of HME, particularly in the context of mammalian cortex development. We will combine next-generation sequencing of diseased brain from HME patients with advanced bioinformatics, complete clinical correlated neuroanatomy, and mouse modeling to help advance our understanding of the mechanism of this important disease. We will: 1] Test for de novo somatic mutations in a larger retrospectively and prospectively collected cohort of HME patients. 2] Correlate genetic disease burden with clinical, imaging, and histopathological findings (phenotype). 3] Test how these de novo mutations alter progenitor cell functions in the developing cerebral cortex. The goal of the experiments is to determine how mutations in these genes lead to disrupted cortical development, why these lesions are epileptogenic, and whether repurposing approved medications might benefit patients, with relevance to other focal dysplasias and focal epilepsies."
"9321184","The purpose of this K12 Career Development Program is to increase the number and effectiveness of pediatric investigators with knowledge and skills in pediatric diabetes research by recruiting promising junior pediatric faculty and training them to be independent physician-scientists. The program is designed to ensure that the most qualified individuals completing subspecialty training can successfully stay in academic medicine. At both the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (PENN), we have strong, collaborative and interactive clinical and research programs, and a long and successful tradition of developing the career of physician scientists. We have assembled a group of 32 scientific mentors, 20 from CHOP and 12 from PENN, who were chosen using the following criteria: rigorous science and productivity in areas germane to diabetes, a strong reputation for successful mentoring with collaborative research interactions, a consistent record of extramural funding, and proper programmatic balance. To meet the intent of this K12 Competitive Renewal Application, the Program will identify Scholar candidates who have demonstrated a commitment to pursue a career in diabetes research, from inside or outside the CHOP/PENN environment. Working with a mentor(s), Scholars will design a program approved by the Advisory Committee, which includes participation in a core curriculum, didactic coursework in patient-oriented research, and a clinical or translational research project. Scholars have access to a comprehensive array of research core facilities and resources, and an opportunity to exchange ideas with other investigators in both formal and informal settings. During our previous funding period, we trained five clinician investigators that all remain productive in translational diabetes research, and have been promoted (or anticipate promotion within the term of the K12) to the rank of Assistant Professor in Pediatric Endocrinology. Three of these Scholars have completed Master's Degree Programs in either Clinical Epidemiology or Translational Research. All have successfully competed for research funding to augment their career development plans, with three of them having competed successfully for their own individual K grant awards. This competitive renewal K12 application in diabetes research for pediatric endocrinologists seeks to build on the success of our current program, and establish the critical funding mechanism to attract, train, and develop the next generation of outstanding clinical and translational researchers in the field."

"9383080","Abstract Mouse models of cancer are easy to use, reproducible, and have manageable costs. Mice can also be genetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine models, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse. Unfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will ultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient resources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients? response to therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each of the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One critical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our group and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor microenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and induces therapeutic resistance. Our long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will better cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model with both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such, it will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which is destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better maintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic resistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel immune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated stem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells. We will perform extensive histological and molecular profiling to confirm this model reflects primary tumor. Finally, we will (i) evaluate the models ability to predict patient response to disease in a retrospective study and (ii) assess the use of this model to evaluate novel immunotherapies using a novel CAR T-cell construct targeting ovarian cancer cells."

"9340284","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is caused by inherited deficiency of the protein dystrophin. The overall aim of this project is to build towards rational clinical trials of gene therapy in DMD, following recent studies showing unprecedented protection of muscle fibers by a single dose of a novel vector in dystrophic mice and dogs. To minimize the risk of an immunological reaction against the transgene product, we have substituted utrophin for dystrophin. A systematically optimized, synthetic utrophin minigene is used with a muscle-targeting vector, AAV9, to achieve systemic gene transfer in newborn animals. In mdx mice following subsequent growth to maturity, the histological appearance of the treated muscle is restored to normal; in Aim 1 we now test whether this level of muscle fiber protection will correct muscle function in a wide range of clinically relevant assays. We use appropriate methods to study locomotor activity of the mice, types of movement, voluntary running times and distances, as well as forelimb and hindlimb muscle strength in grip tests. We assay for normalization of the CPK following exercise. Finally, we establish the function of the recombinant utrophin in isolated muscles, including the diaphragm and the heart, post mortem. To address the major safety issue facing potential subjects in clinical trials, in Aim 2 we turn ou attention to the immune response, using a unique disease model afforded by a naturally occurring deletion in the dog. The index mutation was identified in a German Short Haired Pointer (GSHPMD), and was shown by our lab to result from a homologous recombination event between ferritin-like pseudogenes flanking the entire canine dystrophin gene. We systematically investigate the immunological response to recombinant dystrophin and utrophin in this model to rigorously test the hypothesis that in the absence of central (thymic) immunological tolerance, host T cells will invade AAV-transduced muscle fibers, thereby eliminating recombinant dystrophin expression and causing a clinically severe myositis that exacerbates the clinical course of GSHPMD. We further hypothesize that central immunological tolerance will protect muscle fibers transduced with recombinant utrophin, thereby facilitating therapeutic efficacy. Finally, in Aim 3 we conduct a dose-finding study of systemic vector delivery in the dystrophic dog to estimate the appropriate dose for later use in a preclinical tria of efficacy. This will require the use of unprecedented titers of AAV in individual dogs, based on our studies thus far in mice, and will include screening tests for vector toxicity."

In Aim 2, Dr. McCollum will direct a team of CHWs to recruit 2,200 rural Bangladeshi children with World Health Organization-defined non-severe pneumonia in order to develop and validate a risk score predictive of oral antibiotic failure and appropriate for CHWs. The research described in this application will serve as the foundation for independent funding proposals for intervention trials using pulse oximetry in rural Asian community care programs as a diagnostic pneumonia tool and as a validated instrument to assess pneumonia severity."
"9408807","Project 2: Nuclear export and translation Summary Transport of HIV-1 RNAs from the nucleus and their regulated expression in the cytoplasm are critical steps of the viral lifecycle. Domains present in viral RNA have been shown to regulate these events; namely, the export of unspliced transcripts requires the Rev responsive element, RRE; alternative conformers of the 5?-leader region dictate translation vs. packaging fates; and the recoding of genetic information that allows the production of fixed ratios of viral proteins relies on the frameshifting signal. While elucidation of these RNA structures, and thus mechanisms regulating these events, are closer to realization, studies carried out in CRNA 1.0 have established that both nuclear export and translational regulation are more multifaceted than previously thought. Several major discoveries were not previously predicted or envisioned: the cytoplasmic Gag:RRE interaction; the presence of transcriptional start site heterogeneity, and its consequence on maintaining separate pools of 5?-leader structures; and the presence of a structural equilibrium between an inactive stem-loop and an active, frameshift-permissive pseudoknot conformation. Based on these CRNA discoveries, this project aims to gain a complete structural and mechanistic understanding of both nuclear transport and translational regulation in HIV-1 by combining structural studies with visualization, biochemical and virologic experiments. Our aims for understanding nuclear export will be to determine the high resolution structures of the RRE nuclear export signal, the biological significance of Gag:RRE interactions, and the nuclear export properties of various HIV-1 RNAs. Our aims for understanding translational regulation will be to determine structures for the monomeric and the spliced env mRNA forms of the 5?-leader, and the structures involved in the process of programmed ribosomal frameshifting. !"
"9341357","Alexander disease (AxD) is a homogeneous disorder from a genetic perspective, with over 95% of patients accounted by mutations in a single gene, GFAP, and no other genes currently associated with the disease. Despite this genetic homogeneity, patients exhibit a wide range of clinical phenotypes, with ages of onset ranging from fetal through the seventh decade of life, differing distributions of lesions, varying degrees of leukodystrophy, and mild to severe courses. Using cell culture and animal models we have found that a key factor in pathogenesis is the subsequent accumulation of GFAP protein above a toxic threshold. The accumulation of GFAP results from a combination of both increased synthesis and decreased degradation. By engineering mouse strains that are exact genetic mimics of the human disease, and placing the GFAP mutations on different genetic backgrounds, we have discovered marked differences between strains in the levels of GFAP accumulation, and corresponding measures of disease severity, that follow from expression of mutant GFAP. These data strongly suggest the presence of one or more genetic modifiers that influence the induction of GFAP in response to injury. In addition, results from our collaborators studying Drosophila models of AxD implicate nitric oxide as a key mediator of glial-neuronal toxicity, and one that is amenable to both genetic and pharmacological investigation. Recent experiments from our lab also demonstrate deficits in adult neurogenesis, a new phenotype that has not previously been studied in AxD. In Specific Aim 1 we will perform expression QTL analysis to identify genetic modifiers that regulate GFAP accumulation in AxD, with a focus on hippocampus and corpus callosum. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that one particular gene, encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), is a key modifier of the overall AxD phenotype in mice. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine whether the deficit in adult neurogenesis results from the expression of mutant GFAP in neural stem cells or mature astrocytes. These studies promise novel insights into the genetic influences on disease severity in AxD, will test the validity of a target that may be amenable to therapeutic interventions, and will identify the cellular origin of the newly identified deficit in adult neurogenesis."

"9388887","PROJECT SUMMARY  In humans, recent discoveries point to the importance of early-emerging and highly-conserved, quantitative  mediating social phenotypes to advance understanding of the brain-behavior pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum  Disorders (ASD). Thus, intact early, subcortically-guided, reflexive visual engagement performance is followed  by a failed transition to cortically-guided, voluntary or reward-driven transition in early infancy. Our NHP brain-  behavior studies suggest that 4-8 weeks of age (? 2-9 months for human infants) represents a critical period for  the refinement of social skills, paralleled by fine-tuning of neural connections in social visual engagement  pathways. Here, we propose a new generation of NHP studies that capitalizes on a remarkable convergence of  findings yielded by current Emory ACE 2012 and related work and will include behavioral and neural measures  similar to those used for human projects (P-I and P-III). 15 newborn male monkeys (Macaca mulatta) living with  their mothers in large, socially complex, groups at the YNPRC Field Station will be used to: (a) characterize  social visual engagement and neuromotor development (Aim 1); (b) trace development of early cycles of social  contingency, adding a strong focus on mother-infant reciprocal behaviors given the apparent criticality of social  contingency in moving social-communication development forward and identify early social predictors of later  social competency (Aim 2); and (c) map the unfolding maturation of neural networks mediating changes in  perception and attention to social stimuli, in mother-infant contingency cycles, and in the development of social  competency, using longitudinal, non-invasive neuroimaging methods, and identifying early neural predictors of  later social behavior outcomes (Aim 3). Data analyses will include new mathematical tools for optimal non-  uniform sampling, developmental profiling, and inference of statistical causality to quantify the unfolding of social  engagement between infant-mother, infant-peer, and infant-other adults (DMAC). This will allow us to (a) obtain  developmental curves for each animal and detect potential outlier cases for follow up studies, (b) test temporal  causality to address critical questions: Can early neurobehavioral measures in infancy predict social competency  and detect abnormal social behaviors later in the juvenile period? Are the neurodevelopmental changes driving  the behavioral changes, or vice-versa? The data will yield a critically needed NHP model of early social  development for ASD that we will be used to (a) assess how genetic variations as well as molecular and/or  experimental manipulations of social neural networks alter social development, and (b) validate efficacy of  potential therapeutic treatments for attenuating social deficits in ASD."
"9338316","Type 1 Gaucher disease (GDI) is the most common form of the disorder with an incidence of 1 in 50,000  births. The underlying problem is accumulation of glucocerebroside due to a lysosomal enzyme deficiency,  which may cause oxidative stress and inflammation contributing to the onset of symptoms. Standard texts  state that GDI does not involve the brain. This view is now being challenged based on imaging, postmortem,  and clinical studies. For example, individuals with GDI have an elevated risk of Parkinson's disease,  indicating brain involvement. Current therapies significantly improved outcomes, but do not completely  return glucocerebroside levels to the normal range nor completely resolve symptoms or prevent continuing  tissue injury. Thus, additional treatments that target oxidative stress and inflammation have the potential to  ameliorate both systemic and brain symptoms and may alter disease progression. Our central hypothesis is  that relative to healthy subjects, GDI patients exhibit increased systemic and brain oxidative stress and  inflammation. Further, we hypothesize that antioxidant/anti-inflammatory therapy can improve oxidative  stress/inflammation in GDI patients. We propose the following aims to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1 we  will compare in GDI patients and healthy subjects oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in plasma and  blood using bioanalytical methods and in brains using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In Aim 2 we will  study GDI patients to: a) determine if oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) improves plasma, blood and brain  measures of oxidative stress and inflammation; b) evaluate correlations between plasma/blood NAC,  cysteine, and glutathione (GSH) concentrations with brain GSH levels; and c) characterize NAC and GSH  pharmacokinetics using validated bioanalytical methods and construct models linking pharmacokinetics with  biomarkers. Impact: our results will lead to a greater understanding of GDI pathophysiology; identify  potential biomarkers for use in diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and therapy; provide information  needed to determine if phase III clinical trials of NAC or other antioxidants/anti-inflammatories are warranted;  and guide study design and sample size estimation."
"9324079","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Peck is board certified in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics and has received postdoctoral training in tropical medicine and epidemiology. He has demonstrated a longstanding commitment to patient- oriented research in resource-poor countries. He has lived in Tanzania for the past seven years, where he has become fluent in Kiswahili, developed collaborations with Tanzanian scientists, trained a local study team, and authored 15 first or senior author peer-reviewed publications. The candidate's work has focused on the epidemiology and of HIV, hypertension, and kidney disease which forms the basis for the proposed research. Career Development Plan: The candidate's long-term goal is to become an independent physician investigator focused on the prevention and treatment of chronic non-communicable diseases in Africa. To achieve this goal, the candidate will pursue the following objectives during his K01 training: 1) To gain experience conducting a large clinical study on hypertension in HIV infected adults in Tanzania with rigorous follow-up and data collection. This will require Dr Peck to direct a multidisciplinary team including nurses, physicians, data managers, and laboratory technicians; 2) To better understand translational immunology through coursework and mentored laboratory experience; 3) To gain training and experience in advanced epidemiological and statistical methods through coursework and analysis of his own research data. Environment: The proposed research and training will take place at the Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (Mwanza, Tanzania) and Weill Cornell Medical College (NY, NY). The partnerships between these institutions provides a unique collaborative environment with the infrastructure for both large clinical studies and translational research. Both institutions are whole-heartedly committed to the career development of Dr. Peck and have made significant financial commitments to him. The candidate has assembled an outstanding mentorship team with expertise in clinical epidemiology, infectious diseases, hypertension, nephrology, immunology, and biostatistics. Research: The proposed research builds upon Dr. Peck's prior work in Tanzania on HIV, hypertension, and renal disease. In Aim 1, he hypothesizes that HIV-1 immune suppression decreases the risk of hypertension and that ART-related immune reconstitution of CD4+ T cells increases hypertension rates. There are animal studies suggesting that CD4+ T cells play an important role in the development of hypertension. The proposed study would provide critical human data to support this novel hypothesis. In Aim 2, he proposes that renal damage as evidenced by albuminuria at the time of ART initiation will predict future onset of hypertension in HIV-infected adults. This is based upon the candidate's prior research showing that 44% of HIV infected adults in Tanzania have albuminuria, as well as international cohort studies showing an association between albuminuria and new onset hypertension. Aim 1: To prospectively determine the incidence and predictors of hypertension in a cohort study of 500 recently diagnosed HIV-infected adults and 300 matched HIV-negative controls during 4 years of follow-up. We estimate that 300 (60%) of the HIV-infected patients will initiate ART within one month of HIV diagnosis and study enrollment. Two hundred (40%) will not be ART eligible and will be followed for a median of two years prior to starting ART. The Aim 1 hypothesis is that the incidence of new-onset hypertension will be 6% per year after ART initiation in HIV-infected patients and this will be at least 3-times higher than the incidence in either the HIV-negative controls or the HIV-infected patients prior to ART initiation. Further, hypertension onset after ART initiation will be preceded by persistently elevated serum markers of inflammation (hsCRP and IL-6) and rising CD4+ T-cell counts. Cox proportional-hazards models will be used to determine the independent contribution of systemic inflammation, ART drugs, adiposity, diet, and exercise to incident hypertension. Aim 2: To determine the association and temporal relationship between renal damage and incident hypertension in HIV-infected adults after ART initiation in a nested case-control study. From the cohort described in Aim 1, we will study the first 60 HIV-infected patients who develop hypertension after ART initiation and 120 matched HIV-infected controls who initiate ART, but do not develop hypertension. The hypothesis is that pre-ART urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios will be 2-times higher among cases than controls. We will quantitate other measures of renal disease including estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and T-cell mediated renal inflammation (by measuring urine-cellular mRNA). We will also examine the temporal relationship between renal disease, CD4+ T-cell counts, and serum markers of inflammation. Controls will be matched to cases by age, sex and duration of ART."
"9358369","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are Parkinsonian disorders with predominant tau pathology at autopsy. A common non-recombining haplotype at the microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT) locus on chromosome 17q21 increases the risk of PSP and CBD and recently our genome-wide association efforts identified variation in additional genes/loci (STX6, EIF2AK3, SOS1, KIF13B, and MOBP/Appoptosin). In addition, other genes, as yet undetected, likely contribute to susceptibility to PSP and CBD. This study aims to resolve the disease-associated genetic variation within the exome and whole genome sequence data from PSP and CBD patients, to determine the pathological consequences and mechanisms underlying these complex neurodegenerative diseases characterized by tau pathology, thus identifying potential therapeutic targets. For Aim 1, we will analyze a unique dataset consisting of over 600 exomes and 2400 whole genome sequences derived from pathology-confirmed PSP patients and 350 exomes from CBD patients. These data will be compared to the 5000 control exomes available through the Alzheimer's sequencing project for single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis. In Aim 2, we will expand our analysis of this cohort and specifically analyze structural variants (SV) and copy number variations (CNV) that contribute to PSP and CBD using a range of analytical software programs which we have extensively tested to achieve optimal sensitivity for each type of variation. For Aim 3, we will use the available exome and whole genome sequence data to assess the association of genetic variation on tau toxicity and pathology with Core C, by assessing tau burden in different brain regions and microgliosis as a surrogate of neuronal cell loss. On-going efforts have shown that using quantitative pathologic measures can help distinguish subtypes of PSP. For Aim 4, we will determine the effect of significantly associated variants/genes identified. We will examine mRNA expression, RNA-Seq data, in vitro functional studies to characterize the effect of the observed mutation on tau aggregation and microtubule assembly, and the effect of these genes/variants on tau protein levels and isoforms in postmortem brain tissue. In summary, the combination of whole exome and whole genome sequence data from pathologically-confirmed and highly-phenotyped patients with an in-depth analytical plan focusing on SNV, CNV, SV and quantitative traits, provides a unique opportunity for novel gene discovery. Identifying novel genes for tauopathies is a critical step towards a better understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying this group of disorders and may help identify prognostic biomarkers for these devastating disorders."
"9402391","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Excessive alcohol consumption resulting in disease and increasing the risk of traumatic injury contributes significantly to the public health burden in the United States. The skeleton is a significant target organ for the deleterious effects of alcohol because it suffers alcohol-related damage in two distinct ways; both directly from excessive alcohol consumption, and indirectly due to the increased risk for traumatic injury caused by alcohol drinking behavior. Fracture nonunion is a condition where a bone fracture injury fails to heal normally requiring surgical intervention and alcohol consumption has been shown to contribute to the risk for this serious clinical complication. Currently, clinical options for patients with a non-healing fracture such as surgical grafting of autogenous or de-mineralized bone preparations each have serious limitations. Obtaining autogenous bone graft is effectively a separate surgical procedure at risk for another set complications and de-mineralized bone preparations are unreliable. Normal fracture healing is a regenerative process that utilizes stem cells to rebuild new bone at the injury site. However, we currently do not understand how alcohol affects the activity of stem cells at the fracture site. We believe that alcohol consumption negatively affects stem cell activity that is critical to successful fracture repair. The goal of this investigation is to understand if alcohol affects mesenchymal stem cell differentiation toward chondrocytes following bone fracture injury and if decreased MSC to chondrocyte differentiation may underlie alcohol related inhibition of fracture callus formation and fracture union. Because young people are more likely to suffer traumatic injury, it is important to understand the effects of episodic or binge drinking on fracture repair as binge alcohol consumption is the prevalent pattern of alcohol drinking in both adolescent and young adult populations. The fact that about 40% of the orthopaedic inpatient population is intoxicated at the time of hospital admission underscores the significance of understanding the impact of binge alcohol consumption on the fracture repair process. We believe that the data obtained from this proposal will lead to a better understanding of why alcohol consumption negatively impacts the fracture repair process and how we can improve the prognosis for orthopaedic trauma patients with bone fracture injuries complicated by concomitant alcohol consumption though the use of stem cell technology."
"9407260","Project Summary/Abstract There is a need for new inexpensive tools to discover potential concussive events or mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) on the playing field. As we discover more about the long term effects of concussions, sub- concussive blows, and the importance of rest following a concussive event, the need for tools to identify concussions is becoming an increasing public concern. Many of these nominally ?mild? injuries lead to poor neurological outcomes that adversely affect an individual's quality of life ? i.e. second impact syndrome, post concussion syndrome, and long lasting neurocognitive deficits such as learning disabilities, memory problems, and emotional or behavioral changes. Despite increasing public awareness of this issue, TBIs are difficult to identify as athletes commonly hide the signs and symptoms, only 10% of cases result in loss of consciousness, and other mTBI signs and symptoms may only last for fifteen minutes or fewer. Recognition of TBI's during sports activities is very important because individuals with TBI's are much more vulnerable, given further impacts, to more severe brain injury until they are healed. Additionally, while recent research indicates that younger athletes are more likely to sustain an mTBI and are more vulnerable to long term effects, there is little actual data linking clinical outcomes with biomechanical assessment for pre-teens and adolescents. Since there is currently no helmet or safety gear that is protective against concussion during athletics, many resources are being put into concussion education and risk management. Risk management is currently centered on the macro scale with strict return to play guidelines and league rules or state laws that prohibit full contact practices more than three times a week for example. The proposed solution uses a unique design to provide a mouthpiece with better accuracy and/or lower cost than currently available commercial products that can be used in all sports. The solution will provide a sideline alert of a potential concussion for further clinical evaluation and head impact dosimetry. The research team assembled for this project includes a commercialization partner with current custom mouthpiece products and deep industry ties, a successful engineering team, and a research group that has performed previous mouthpiece impact sensor studies."
"9349379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An extraordinary aspect of complex multicellular organisms, such as mammals, is the diversity of different types of cells that arise from the same genome. Each type of cell, or cell state, differs drastically in morphology, function, and physiology and must be carefully regulated during both the development and the daily life of the organism. This includes both tight control of cell state transitions and the stabilization of cell states against external stimuli and internal disturbances, including genomic mutations. Underlying specific cell states are networks of expressed genes. Although it is now commonplace to measure the expression of every gene within a population of cells with a single experiment, little is known about how the individual genes within a large network function together. This is especially true in complex human diseases, such as cancer, where the population of cells from a single tumor can contain many different cell states. The objective of this project is to both identify and to functionally dissect networks of interacting genes that stabilize melanocytes and early- stage melanomas against transitions into more advanced disease states. The central approach is microRNA- based detection of functional gene networks. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed from the genome but do not encode for proteins, rather regulating the translation and stability of mRNA networks. It has recently been shown that miRNAs serve as excellent tools for identifying networks of genes that regulate cell state transitions. These co-regulated networks of genes are enriched for genetic interactions, which can be identified using mapping techniques recently adapted for mammalian cells from their previous extensive use in single cell organisms. In the first aim of this application, these methods will be used to investigate the relationship between different melanoma driver mutations (those changes to the genome that initiate melanoma progression) and the networks of genes that stabilize against further progression, testing the hypothesis that different initiatig events result in distinct multigenic barriers to tumorigenesis. MiRNAs known to advance melanoma will be introduced into a panel of mouse melanocytes with different driver mutations. When progression is induced, the network of genes targeted by the miRNA will be experimentally determined and their individual function and genetic interactions investigated. In the second aim, the miRNA-targeted networks that correlate with human melanoma progression in both expression and function will be tested using primary patient samples and reconstituted skin culture. In the third aim, populations of tumor cells will be analyzed on the single cell leve. Each cell will be assayed for its ability to progress or to transition into a therapy-resistant cel state, and the miRNA profiles associated with each transition will be measured. Collectively, these approaches will improve our knowledge of the networks of genes that work together to prevent melanoma progression, increasing our potential to conduct meaningful personalized therapies for this deadly disease."
"9396295","Project Summary/Abstract Control over the enantioselectivity of photochemical processes has remained an open problem despite the inherent promise of light-driven methodologies to deliver a broad range of medicinally-relevant scaffolds. Indeed, absorption of a photon energetically enables substantial increases in molecular complexity (commensurate with modern pharmaceuticals) without the generation of any additional waste. The key challenge, to reign in the substantial energetic input and direct it towards selective formation of a single enantiomer, has been met with limited success by the synthetic community. Triumph in this arena would represent a major step forward for our collective ability to synthesize biologically important compounds, enabling the next generation of life-saving pharmaceuticals and diagnostic probes to be developed, while cutting costs and reducing waste for existing manufacturing processes. This proposal outlines a novel strategy to circumvent the central challenges in this sphere by employing a combination of hydrogen-bond donor and primary amine organocatalysts to selectively activate substrates for photochemical transformation. This dual catalytic reactivity manifold has been fabulously successful in the past for the generation, stabilization, and enantiofacial control of myriad cationic intermediates, and extension into photochemical reaction space will further the synthetic potential of the strategy immensely. The research plan outlines a specific line of attack for identifying an appropriate catalyst system to enable enantioselective pyridinium photochemistry, accessing densely functionalized aminocyclopentenone motifs which are in turn poised for synthetic elaboration to a wide variety of bioactive molecules. The key strategic underpinning is the ability to induce a bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of the substrate upon complexation with the catalyst pair via both covalent and non-covalent interactions. Advances in LED technology in recent years put this specific scientific advance within tangible grasp, and the implementation of the catalytic strategy outlined herein is poised to deliver on the promise of enantioselective photochemistry. Moreover, enantioinduction will in turn allow for mechanistic information to be gleaned. By extracting precise structure-activity relationships, a glimpse behind the rate-limiting photoexcitation step can be obtained. Overall, the proposed research will enable facile access to complex medicinally relevant compounds in a methodologically novel and efficient fashion while substantially increasing scientific knowledge."
"9445928","Project Summary/Abstract Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and facet joint osteoarthritis (FOA) result in a combined collective cost of over $40 billion per year in interventions because of their strong association with chronic low back pain (cLBP). A large proportion of these costs are for interventions without significant improvement in patient quality of life. A major reason for this clinical problem is due to the limited understanding of the etiological process for both IDD and FOA that is needed to develop a clinically valid method for phenotyping patients into groups, such as mechanical, inflammatory or heightened pain sensitivity. The overall goal of this research is to define phenotypes of IDD or FOA that lead to cLBP. The objective of this project is to conduct the first and largest longitudinal analyses of biomarkers ever performed in the lumbar spine by capitalizing on extant data from two large existing cohorts: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (development cohort) and Genetics of Generalized Osteoarthritis Study (external validation cohort). The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) cLBP is a heterogeneous diagnosis that can result from mechanical, inflammatory or pain sensitivity sources and these sources can be identified by biomarkers 2) there is a subgroup of individuals that can be identified with biochemical and quantitative sensory biomarkers with heightened pain sensitivity and 3) there are risk factors that can be identified to predict incidence and progression of lumbar spine disease with and without symptoms. The findings from this study would lead to the development and testing of pharmaceutical, behavioral, physical or surgical interventions by biomarker identified lumbar spine phenotypes. In Aim I, we will demonstrate the degree to which biochemical biomarkers predict the incidence or progression of radiographic IDD and FOA. In Aim II, we will determine longitudinal relationships between pain and quantitative sensory biomarkers and symptomatic radiographic IDD or FOA.In Aim III, because imaging and cLBP can be discordant we will identify combinations of risk factors (i.e., demographic, clinical, self-reported and biomarkers) that differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic IDD and/or FOA. To achieve these aims, we will conduct the largest (n=4,167) longitudinal study to date of biomarkers from two large community based studies with and without lumbar spine IDD or FOA. Specimen collection, lumbar spine radiographs, and LBP were consistently measured in both studies. The multidisciplinary team includes collaborative and productive researchers with expertise in OA, cLBP, epidemiology, rheumatology, biomarkers, IDD biology and biostatistics. The Principal Investigator is a New and Early Stage Investigator with advanced training as a musculoskeletal epidemiologist and a physical therapist with a productive history of scholarly activity and funding in low back pain and lumbar spine research."
"9526226","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to establish an estimate for the prevalence of FASD in a large, diverse and multicultural U.S. urban setting - San Diego, California. Through an established collaboration with the San Diego Unified School District, the San Diego Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities, and the San Diego County Child Welfare Agency, we will employ methods that will specifically address the major barriers to developing accurate prevalence estimates including reliable and valid evaluation of physical characteristics in an age range when features are most easily recognizable, comprehensive assessment of neurobehavioral performance in children just entering school-age, and detailed information on prenatal alcohol exposure. We will establish a prevalence estimate of FASD including FAS, Partial FAS and ARND in the City of San Diego metropolitan area among a cross-sectional sample of children in the first grade age range in elementary school (5-7 years of age) and those children in the same age range and geographic area receiving special services for developmental disabilities or child welfare services. In addition, we will determine risk factors for FASD in this population, enhance capacity to make valid and reliable diagnoses of FASD by training new expert diagnosticians and through the use of 3D facial imaging, and promote study recruitment and retention through the implementation of an evidence-based intervention among children identified with FASD. We will assess participation bias among parents and caregivers in the school sample to determine if there is evidence of differential recruitment among those with higher levels of prenatal alcohol use. We also propose to host the Data Access and Coordinating Center for all projects included in the CoFASP consortium through the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, San Diego."
"9353313","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this program is to develop more effective and less toxic therapies for the treatment of leukemia. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but progress towards improving outcomes for patients have been more limited. We will evaluate the efficacy and mechanistic basis for a set of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AML. Specifically, we will investigate the modulation of apoptotic threshold in Project 1; inhibition of a specific ubiquitin ligase, CRL4-CRBN, by lenalidomide to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation; targeting lysine acetyltransferase activity to alter he function of transcription factors that are critical for AML biology in Project 3; and targeting key epigenetic regulators, BET bromodomain proteins and DOT1L, in Project 4. In addition to hypothesis-driven investigation of the biological mechanisms relevant to each therapeutic approach, we will investigate the therapeutic potential of these approaches using common assays and models. These therapeutic approaches will be investigated both individually and in combinations with existing therapies and each other. We will test molecules in vitro using dynamic BHS profiling, developed by Dr. Letai (Project 1) to examine the impact of candidate small molecules on apoptotic threshold. We will test molecules in vivo using both murine models developed by Dr. Bradner (Project 4) and primary human AML samples in xenograft models (Dr. Griffin, Core B). The most promising treatments will be brought forward to clinical trials in Core D. We will prospectively identify the subgroups most likely to respond by deep genetic and molecular characterization of AML samples used for pre-clinical and clinical studies. In aggregate, these studies will lead to the advancement of novel therapies for the treatment of AML, identification of genetic subgroups that are most likely to respond to novel treatments, and insights into the biological mechanisms of action for novel therapeutic strategies."
"9545386","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a HIV Research and Training Program (HRTP) between the University at Buffalo (UB) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). The HRTP will build on a recently completed AIDS International HIV Research and Training Program that was focused on re-initiating postgraduate training at the Master's level in HIV clinical pharmacology research at UZ. Scientific breakthroughs in HIV prevention and treatment research have produced evidence suggesting that interventions involving early access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are highly effective in preventing HIV sexual transmission and vertical transmission during pregnancy, childbearing and delivery. Government and academic leaders in Zimbabwe have identified HIV Clinical Pharmacology Research as a key component of national planning for ARV access and HIV therapeutics to implement these scientific breakthroughs. The UB-UZ HRTP will focus on novel aspects that integrate clinical pharmacology research with: 1) ARV adherence, 2) clinically important pharmacokinetic drug interactions (e.g. anti-tuberculosis drugs, anti- malarials, hormonal contraceptives and traditiona medicines), 3) ARV disposition during pregnancy (secondary to WHO Option B+ implementation) and in infants, and to determine in utero ARV exposure, and 4) bioequivalency testing for generic ARV products prior to widespread implementation. These research areas integrate well with other NIH funded projects and regional capacity building. The HRTP will broaden the training focus to include masters, doctoral and post-doctoral trainees and emphasize a curriculum that provides an HIV Clinical Pharmacology Research Skills Toolbox for HRTP trainees to gain the skillset that will be required to be an independent researcher. HRTP trainees will gain focused clinical pharmacology research training at UB in an internationally recognized HIV Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory that complements the UZ Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory program. The UB-UZ HRTP has strong support from the UZ College of Health Sciences and the Ministry of Health. The HRTP will benefit from an expert Training Advisory Committee and a complement of highly motivated faculty that will provide the curriculum, structured research training and program evaluation that will assure a highly productive, efficient HIV research training initiative."
"9538464","PROJECT SUMMARY: This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide a promising early-stage investigator, Dr. Foster, with the knowledge and skills requisite to become an independent clinician-investigator in the field of childhood obesity. Dr. Foster's interest is in applying the novel, community-based approach of positive deviance to develop effective and sustainable solutions to early childhood obesity. Dr. Foster will actively participate in a variety of training activities in the fields of health disparities, positive deviance, behavioral intervention mapping and statistical analysis of clinical trials. He will apply the knowledge and skills learned to the execution of an innovative research project on early childhood obesity in a Hispanic population at high risk for obesity. The training activities address gaps in Dr. Foster's knowledge and skills, and the research project addresses a significant gap in understanding related to community-based approaches to early childhood obesity. Early childhood obesity tracks into later childhood and even adulthood with associated increased risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Significant disparities exist with Hispanic children experiencing much higher rates of early childhood obesity compared with white children. Very few effective interventions exist for early childhood obesity that can be widely implemented in communities, particularly Hispanic communities. Therefore, the need for research on community-based, sustainable solutions is great. The core idea of positive deviance is that in every community, there are individuals who have found a way to succeed despite an adverse environment and with the same resources as their peers. In other words, this proposal seeks to define the solutions that already exist in communities. Once those solutions are defined and characterized, this project evaluates ways of modeling or coaching other community-members on those effective solutions for childhood obesity, using a model of parent mentors. Parent mentors have been shown to be an effective means of addressing complex behavior change in other problems such as asthma or being uninsured. The hypotheses are 1) positively deviant behaviors and strategies can be defined in a Hispanic community at high risk for early childhood obesity and 2) those strategies and behaviors can be spread in the community using parent mentors. The training will occur in an exceptional research environment for community-based research in San Antonio, and the mentorship for Dr. Foster is provided by highly experienced, senior faculty. Dr. Foster will utilize the training and research aims to develop his career as an independent investigator doing patient-oriented research and make a positive difference in the community he serves."
"9324043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Traumatic  brain  injury,  both  from  direct  trauma  to  the  brain  and  as  a  sequela  of  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic  infarction  are  associated  with  a  significant  rate  of  morbidity,  mortality  and  cost  to  both  patients  and  the  healthcare  system.  Hemorrhagic  infarcts  (such  as  aneurysmal  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  and  intraventricular  hemorrhage)  are  rare  but  devastating  complications  of  arterial  rupture.  Despite  significant  effort,  there  has been  little  improvement  in  the  outcomes  of  patients  with  aneurysmal  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  (aSAH)  or  intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Given the predictable temporal course of these brain injuries, they are ideal candidates for biomarker identification. A biomarker for detection o 'at risk' patients and a prognostic indicator  of  delayed  neurological  deficit  would  vastly  improve  current  treatments  and  increase  our  understanding  of  underlying  pathological  events.  This  information  would  immediately  lead  to  the  implementation  of  new  therapeutic  strategies.  Research  over  the  last  several  years  has  identified  extracellular RNAs  (exRNA)  as  a  potential  source  of  biomarkers.  New  technology,  such  as  next  generation  sequencing  (NGS),  has  made  it  possible  to  sensitively  and  quantitatively  assay  small  amounts  of  RNA  contained  in  clinically  attainable  volumes  of  biofluids  such as  CSF  and  blood  plasma.  In  the  first  two  years  of  this  grant,  we  propose  to  sequene  the  exRNA  (miRNA  and  total  RNA)  from  both  the  CSF  and  plasma  of  patients  who  present  with  aSAH and the plasma and CSF from premature infants born with IVH. aSAH samples were collected daily~ the  volume of sample available will allow us not only to sequence the total RNA including miRNAs, but will permit  us to explore unique enrichment strategies in years 3-5 of this grant~ we will examine specific RNAs associated  with microvesicles in both CSF and plasma. We have both the daily clinical evaluations of these patients as well as their outcomes (25 subjects in all).  We  will  use  these  samples  to  identiy  RNA  markers  that  predict  onset of vasospasm and the severity of delayed neurological deficits. We also have CSF and plasma samples  collected  every  other  day  from  premature  infants  with  grade  III-IV  IVH  that  had  reservoirs  put  in  place  to  evacuate  blood  and  excess  CSF.  We  also  have  the  clinical  outcomes  from  the  infants,  whether  or  not  they  developed  hydrocephalus,  the  need  for  a  permanent  shunt,  and  an  18  month  assessment  of  developmental  delays or disabilities. In years 3-5, we will continue to collect samples in collaboration with both of our clinical partners. At that time, we will switch from our discovery platform, the Illumina HiSeq 2000 that has high depth of sequencing coverage, to the Illumina MiSeq for validation.  Once  the  discovery  phase  is  complete  and  potential  biomarkers  identified,  validation  can  be  carried  out  on  the  MiSeq's  faster  fluidics,  imaging,  and  shortened run times without changing chemistries between the discovery and validation phases."
"9388794","PROJECT 2 ? SUMMARY Atypical, rapid early brain enlargement is a distinct neurophenotype that is observed in 15% of males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This phenotype has been labeled ?autism with disproportionate megalencephaly? (ASD-DM) because head and brain growth is disproportionate to height. Evidence from the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project suggests that a higher proportion of children with ASD-DM are minimally verbal at 3 years of age. By 5 years of age, children with this phenotype have made fewer gains in IQ than their counterparts with ASD and normal brain size. At school age, a higher proportion of ASD-DM have IQs in the range of intellectual disability. A short-term goal of this project is to confirm that ASD-DM have a poorer prognosis than other children with ASD. The long-term objective is to fully understand the cognitive processes and neural systems underlying these deficits so that targeted interventions can be developed to improve the prognosis of children with this phenotype. To accomplish these objectives, a new cohort of 2-3.5-year old children will be recruited with aid from the Recruitment and Retention Core. Four groups, ASD with normal brain size (ASD-N), ASD with disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM) and typical development (TD) with normal or enlarged brain sizes will be evaluated. Children will be assessed longitudinally at two time points, once at study entry (2- 3.5 years of age) with a follow up visit two years later (4-5.5 years of age). In the first aim, a comprehensive behavioral evaluation that includes both standardized assessments and well-validated eye-tracking tasks that test specific cognitive processes of attention, memory, and language will be conducted. The eye-tracking tasks are expected to be more sensitive to subtle phenotypic differences than standardized measures and could guide development of targeted interventions. In the second and third aims, further evaluation of the neural underpinnings of the disproportionate megalencephaly phenotype will be carried out. Structural and functional MRI and auditory event-related potentials will be utilized to interrogate the neural basis of the impairments observed in this phenotype with emphasis on neural systems involved in attention, language, and memory. Identifying the neural systems that are involved in the behavioral deficits will provide clues not only to underlying etiologies, but will also provide neural targets that could be used as biomarkers for measuring treatment response in future studies. Participants in Project 2 will be invited to participate in Project 3, which aims to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in order to investigate cellular mechanisms underlying megalencephaly in ASD. The Data Management and Statistics Core will manage data from both projects and will facilitate inter-project analyses. Accomplishing these aims will enable the research team to develop targeted interventions for this clinically meaningful phenotype that is present early in development and is easily identifiable in the first years of life."
"9548377","Aging is associated with a decrease in movement and cognition, and understanding the neurophysiological bases of these behavioral deficits will be key to increasing healthspan. Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra are key central mediators of voluntary movement and reward-related behavior, and the function of these neurons is known to decline with age. Unfortunately, little is currently known about how normal aging affects the specific intrinsic channels and synaptic inputs that are responsible for dopamine neuron excitability and function. Our lab has developed reliable methodology for making electrophysiological recordings of dopamine neurons in brain slices from mice of advanced age, thus a comprehensive investigation into the effects of aging on ion channel physiology in these neurons is now possible. We will combine electrophysiology, behavior, gene expression analysis, and optogenetics to elucidate the effects of aging on ion channel signaling and dopamine-mediated behaviors. Furthermore, we will use dietary restriction (an established healthspan- increasing intervention) to identify the ionic mechanisms that counteract age-related deficits in behavior. Our central hypothesis is that age-related deficits in movement and reward-related behaviors can be attributed to specific ion channel conductances in substantia nigra dopamine neurons, and that these deficits can be attenuated by dietary restriction. Aim 1 is to determine the relationship between age-related deficits in specific ion channel currents and cell firing. We will also relate (in individual mice) our electrophysiological findings in single neurons to previously obtained locomotor behavioral data. Aim 2 is to determine the effects of aging on excitatory inputs from the hypothalamus to dopamine neurons as well as reward-related behavior. For this aim we will employ optogenetics to study identified glutamate inputs in a brain region-specific manner. Aim 3 is to determine the effects of aging on dopamine autoreceptor-mediated neurotransmission. Aim 4 is to determine the effects of dietary restriction in aging mice as an intervention that can counteract age-related decline of ion conductances in dopamine neurons and related behaviors. These studies will provide the first detailed understanding of the relationship between aging, dopamine neuron activity, and dopamine-mediated behaviors, and determine the protective effects of dietary restriction on these parameters."
"9544358","Our objective is to establish the feasibility of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based, left atrial (LA) regional blood flow analysis technology to predict stroke and abnormal brain MRI findings in patients with and without a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib), and to predict LA regional blood flow noninvasively following LA appendage (LAA) closure. Afib is a powerful risk factor for stroke and silent brain infarction (SBI), defined as evidence of brain infarction on imaging with no clinical symptoms. SBI accounts for cognitive decline associated with Afib, including cognitive impairment and dementia, in stroke-free individuals. Currently, there is an ongoing paradigm shift in our understanding of the mechanisms of stroke and SBI in patients with a history of Afib. A new paradigm is that alterations in LA structure and function during sinus rhythm are causally related to thromboembolism, and Afib is not mechanistically responsible for the thromboembolic events. This paradigm shift has uncovered an unprecedented opportunity to identify a high-risk subgroup by evaluating abnormal LA structure and function in a larger population, beyond patients with a history of Afib. Nevertheless, it remains unclear as to how abnormal LA structure and function during sinus rhythm, a solid mechanics process, alter the LA regional blood flow, a fluid mechanics process, to cause intracardiac thrombosis. Our central hypothesis is that LA regional blood flow in sinus rhythm can predict stroke and abnormal brain MRI findings more sensitively and specifically than LA structure and function in patients with or without a history of Afib. To quantify the three-dimensional (3-D) LA regional blood flow, we will use a CFD technology based on the patient-specific cardiac structure and function defined by cardiac CT. This technology can noninvasively estimate the 3-D regional blood flow within the left atrium as well as the LA appendage, the most common site of intracardiac thrombus, which would otherwise require invasive transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We will apply the CFD technology to patients in the Johns Hopkins Cardiac CT Registry who underwent multidetector cardiac CT since 2004. We will determine the association of LA regional blood flow with subsequent stroke and abnormal brain MRI findings over 10 years. To quantify abnormal brain MRI findings, we will use an atlas-based brain MRI analysis, which is robust to ischemic changes and atrophy seen in our study population. We will also evaluate the feasibility of virtual LAA closure in silico by removing LAA from the pre-LAA closure CT to predict post-LAA closure LA regional blood flow noninvasively, which cannot be performed by any traditional imaging techniques. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers to predict stroke and SBI in patients with and without a history of Afib, whereas the current guidelines allow risk stratification only in individuals with Afib; 2) it will provide evidence for studies to evaluate prophylactic OAC or LAA closure to reduce the risk of stroke, SBI, and cognitive decline; and 3) it will provide a new technology to guide catheter-based/surgical LAA closure based on patient-specific LA structure and function."
"9526229","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the presence and rate of glaucoma progression influences treatment decisions, the methods currently available to detect and monitor progression are imprecise and do not allow clinicians to make accurate assessments of the status of their patients. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the time needed to detect glaucoma progression. We developed an individualized model to detect progression that uses structural and functional data jointly. The specific aims are 1) To determine whether an individualized approach to identify glaucoma progression leads to earlier detection of progression compared to current methods based on population statistics, 2) To determine which combination of structural and functional parameters identifies glaucoma progression at the earliest point in time, and 3) To determine the shortest period of time needed for our individualized approach to detect glaucoma progression. Specific aims 1 and 2 will use the data prospectively collected in two large multi-center NIH-funded studies: the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. These studies are ideally suited to achieve these aims because of the large sample of longitudinal structural and functional data. For specific aim 3, we will prospectively collect data from glaucoma patients seen at our institution. Our central hypothesis is that combining structural and functional data within the framework of an individualized model will improve our ability to detect glaucoma progression more rapidly. The dynamic structure-function model is innovative in that it is individualized and robust to assumptions about the nature of glaucoma progression. We hypothesize that our individualized dynamic structure-function model will lead to the detection of progression at an earlier point in time compared to other currently available methods. We also hypothesize that different combinations of structural and functional tests will lead to the detection of glaucoma progression at an earlier point in time compared to other combinations. Finally, we hypothesize that our individualize approach will reduce the amount of time needed to detect glaucoma progression. This project will have a significant impact on the clinical management of glaucoma patients, providing clinicians with an accurate and precise method to detect glaucoma progression. This work is also highly relevant for determining clinical trial endpoints when assessing the effectiveness of new medical or surgical treatment for glaucoma."
"9355706","Project Summary: Investigating Organ Formation and the Emergence of Complexity in the Visual System Using Comparative Developmental Approaches  The visual system has long been at the heart of research into the evolution of complexity in the animal kingdom. Even Darwin in On the Origin of Species addressed the evolution of the vertebrate eye as a unique and difficult case in the study of evolution. Despite a long history of research in Drosophila and vertebrate models, we still understand surprisingly little about how complex organ systems like the visual system are generated. For example, we have long known that Pax6 and other retinal determination network genes are essential to eye development in both Drosophila and vertebrates, suggesting a common origin for all visual organs. However, differences in gene regulatory network connectivity support independent evolution of parts of this canonical network. This highlights our lack of understanding of how networks change and how they relate to the complex tissues they underlie. Here we propose to leverage comparative developmental biology to better understand how gene regulatory networks, protein function, cell fate, and tissue movements evolved to generate the complexity and diversity within photoreceptive systems found across the animal kingdom. The power of comparative approaches is that they can reveal non-obvious and conserved mechanisms found common to organ formation. Recognizing these mechanisms not only deepens our basic understanding of complex organ development, it can generate new disease candidates and practical new models for human health. First, we will investigate how complex morphologies of visual organs develop by evaluating cell behavior and tissue morphogenesis during eye vesicle formation in the cephalopod Doryteuthis pealeii. Second, we will identify conserved mechanisms generating cell type diversity within the retina, specifically focused on Notch signaling in neuroepithelial tissues. Lastly, we will evaluate the core retinal determination gene regulatory network across the animal kingdom using both functional and bioinformatics tools to identify conserved network connections. This work will be the most in depth analysis to date of the relationship between gene regulatory networks to cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis across multiple species. Our current lack of understanding of this relationship generates a barrier to translate research in model organisms to effective disease treatment efficiently and this work will shed light on better approaches to these translational steps."
"9388743","Abstract This project will image 150 children (~ aged 12) with and without autism spectrum disorder to reveal the changes in functional brain organization that relate to autism severity and associated behavioral measures. The children will represent 3 distinct groups of 50 kids each (high risk children with autism, high risk siblings without autism and low risk healthy controls) and we will contrast these groups to understand the major functional network changes associated with autism. We will also develop connectome based predictive models to relate individual functional connectivity profiles to autism scores (using ADOS-2 social affect as the primary measure and RRB as a secondary measure) and examine the extent to which the models localize to specific networks including the executive control, the salience, and the default mode networks. The connectivity input data will be of unprecedented quality and extent (at least 20minutes of resting-state data providing highly reliable single subject data). In addition to the resting-state, we will include data collected during continuous performance tasks (an attention task: gradCPT and a selective social attention task previously characterized with eye-tracking data). Sex differences will be of specific interest in understanding network changes with autism severity. We will also identify the altered networks associated with ASD and provide these networks for exploratory analysis in project 1 (infants) and project 4 (fetal brains) to examine the extent to which these networks are altered early in development. The neural characterization performed in project 3 will be on a subset of the subjects studied in this project and thus we will have direct neural characteristics to relate to the connectivity changes we will quantify. This will be one of the first times neuronal structural features have been related to macroscopic connectivity data."

Trainee project topics include electrode development; stimulation pattern design; neural motor control mechanisms; neural biomaterials, protection, and repair; deployment of interventions to individuals with neurological disorders; neuroreahabilitation; modeling and simulation; and brain-computer interfacing."
"9290138","Project Summary Nationwide, Mexican-American adults over age 30 have the highest prevalence of periodontal disease of all racial/ethnic groups (67% vs. 43% fornon-Hispanic Whites)(Eke, Dye et al. 2015). Poor oral hygiene is one risk factor for this common, preventable disease. However, few interventions focus on improving oral hygiene in this high-risk group, many of whom are also low-income and lack access to dental care. Social support has been targeted successfully in social and behavioral interventions to improve dietary behaviors, physical activity, and chronic disease management among Mexican-origin adults, but it has not been studied extensively in an oral health context. In addition, the role of social support differs for men and women with other health behaviors, supporting the need to study differences between men and women. This study addresses these gaps by developing a bilingual (English/Spanish) oral health behavior-specific social support scale for use in future intervention research. Developing such a measure will enable more precise assessment of the role and perceived impact of different sources and types of social support on daily hygiene behavior, dental care utilization, and oral health outcomes. Our experienced, multi-disciplinary team proposes a two-phase mixed methods study that will: 1) qualitatively explore the relevant social influences on oral health behavior for lower income Mexican-origin young adult men and women to understand structural and functional aspects of social support; 2) develop and pilot test an oral health behavior-specific social support scale, and 3) quantitatively assess the scale?s psychometric properties and association with oral health status and behavior. Phase I proposes semi-structured interviews with 25-40 men and 25-40 women from the target population of Mexican- origin young adults, to explore dimensions of social support in an oral health context as part of scale item generation and refinement. Cognitive interviews will be conducted to assess scale content and understanding of item and response option wording and order of the draft scale with 40 different adults from the target population, before it is piloted with 200 adults. Phase II will quantitatively validate the scale. Surveys will be conducted with 500 men and women, and a subset of >250 will also receive a dental exam. Phase II analysis will include cluster and factor analysis of the new social support scale, calculate the Cronbach?s alpha to assess internal consistency, and assess scale and subscale validity (content, face, construct, concurrent, divergent, and discriminant validity) and reliability. Sex-stratified analyses will examine associations with self-reported oral hygiene behavior (brushing, flossing, rinsing), dental care utilization, multiple self-rated oral health status indices, and clinically-assessed oral health status (tooth loss; caries; periodontal disease). This study will yield a culturally-sensitive social support scale that will advance understanding of potential pathways through which social relationships affect oral health behavior and outcomes for young adults of Mexican-origin, at high risk for oral disease, findings important for future theory-informed, evidence-based randomized controlled trials."
"9552381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in science and biotechnology have led to an explosion of data from the plethora of rapidly developing high throughput analyses. While these advances have led to major improvements in the therapy of several refractory malignancies, most advanced cancers remain incurable. The Southwest Early Clinical Trials (SECT) Consortium consists of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, and is strategically and geographically placed to lead, collaborate on and execute phase I clinical trials in the NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network in broad patient populations, including in several underserved regions. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Study, in an efficient and collaborative manner, the safety and clinical activity of new agents or hypothesis-driven novel combinations. 2. Molecularly profile patients (host tissues) and their malignancies to optimize selection of potentially relevant therapy for each patient, based on identified molecular aberrations, where appropriate. 3. Develop clinically relevant pharmacodynamic markers of response. 4. Mentor junior faculty, trainees, and research personnel, as applicable, in the leadership, conduct, analysis, and reporting of ET-CTN and other clinical trials. 5. Provide scientific and administrative leadership within ET-CTN, including active participation in project teams, research design and protocol development, authorship/co-authorship of Network group publications, and participation in scientific, administrative, or ad hoc committees, as well as participation in the NCI Central IRBs and attendance at ET-CTN and IDSC meetings. In addition to established proficiency in clinical trial accrual, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic assessment, the SECT Institutions have an unparalleled combination of resources that include access to large patient populations with extensively genotyped tumors, established biorepositories, state of the art clinical genomics capabilities, and expert bioinformatics. Led by three experienced principle investigators with complementary skills, the SECT consortium is poised to execute a new paradigm for early experimental therapeutic clinical trials, with the goals to validate the right pathways, target thee pathways with the right drugs, and test these drugs in the right patients.         RELEVANCE:  Early oncology clinical trials have traditionally focused on defining the maximum tolerated dose for phase II development. Recent development of novel targeted agents demand a different approach that includes: 1) testing in a molecularly profiled population; 2) evaluation f intermediate biologic endpoints; and 3) determination of the optimal biologic dose for Phase II studies."
"9344635","The development of our general methodology has been rooted in the rigorous mathematical framework of the Volterra-Wiener approach to nonlinear system analysis and its various extensions over the last 35 years [9-16]. This methodological framework was selected because: (a) it is mathematically rigorous and allows practical identification of the system dynamics from input-output data without requiring prior knowledge of the internal organization of the system; (b) it is applicable to a very broad class of nonlinear dynamic biomedical systems (i.e. those with finite memory); (c) it yields models that represent the system function under broad (natural) operating conditions and allows predictions for arbitrary input signals (within the experimental range of frequencies/amplitudes); (d) it is robust in the presence of noise commonly found in biomedical time-series data. This remarkable set of attributes has been validated over the last 35 years. The development of practical methods that achieve high estimation accuracy with modest experimental and computational requirements has been achieved for single-input/single-output and multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) systems [14-60], although certain challenges remain with regard to compactness and interpretability of large-scale MIMO models, as well as the modeling of multi-variable nested-loop configurations. These issues represent the next generation of modeling challenges (as formulated in the Specific Aims) and attain rising importance as we begin to recognize the potential utility of these models for clinical purposes."
"9331767","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Placental dysfunction, most commonly manifested as preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction, is an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in both the developing and developed world. It is thought that placental dysfunction arises from abnormal trophoblast differentiation and/or invasion, events that occur in the first trimester of pregnancy, but become clinically apparent only in the late second and third trimesters. Optimal surveillance and management of placental dysfunction, as well as the development of effective therapies, have been hampered by the lack of methods for early and accurate identification of pregnancies at risk for this disorder. This project aims to develop such a method. The goal of Aim 1 will be to identify candidate Extracellular RNA biomarkers for prediction of clinically relevant placental dysfunction from a high-risk cohort. Aim 2 will focus on validation of these biomarkers in an average-risk cohort. Aim 3 will include development of a CLIA certified assay and application of this assay in a pilot randomized control trial to assess the clinical and cost impact of screening  general obstetric population for risk of placental dysfunction, and referral of screen-positive patients to a higher level of surveillance. This project is a collaboration between academia (UCSD) and industry (Sera Prognostics) and will leverage existing and in-progress resources, including the Placental Dysfunction Clinic at UCSD, the plasma and serum biobank collected from average-risk pregnancies at Sera Prognostics, and the UCSD Obstetric Registry. The research team includes investigators with diverse and complementary strengths, including expertise in maternal fetal medicine, clinical research, epidemiology, genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and clinical assay development. The immediate application of a simple and accurate method to predict risk of clinically relevant placental dysfunction to obstetric care will be to enable targeting of clinical resources to high-risk cases, while sparing low risk patients unnecessary anxiety. Longer term benefits will arise from using this method to increase the safety and power of clinical trials of candidate therapies by targeting high-risk patients, thus enhancing the detection of any therapeutic effects and subjecting only the patients most likely to benefit to potential risks associated with the therapy."
"9408806","Project 1: Nuclear gene expression Summary The long-term goal of this Program is to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate HIV-1 nuclear gene expression and to use this knowledge as a springboard to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. A major barrier in HIV-1 biology is that many of the RNA structures and protein-RNA interactions that regulate gene expression in the nucleus are unknown. These processes appear to be combinatorial in nature, and thus systems-level approaches must be combined with functional biochemistry in order to elucidate molecular events that determine patterns of HIV-1 gene expression. Our team (Al-Hashimi, Bieniasz, Cullen, Hargrove, Kutluay, Rouskin, Swanstrom and Tolbert) will use cross-disciplinary expertise in virology, chemical biology and structural biophysics to determine mechanisms of splicing and transcriptional control. We will build on the successes of CRNA 1.0 that include: 1) mapping for the first time binding sites of specific splicing regulatory proteins on the HIV-1 genome; 2) quantitation of the HIV-1 alternative splicing using a novel next generation sequencing platform; 3) identification of novel cis RNA elements that control HIV-1 splicing and 4) determination of the 3D structures of novel HIV-1 RNA splicing elements both free and bound to a regulatory protein. Motivated by these new discoveries, this project will overcome critical barriers that have stymied pursuit of the understanding of HIV-1 splicing regulation. In CRNA 2.0, we will A) reveal how regulatory protein factors and RNA elements cross talk to establish HIV-1 splicing patterns; B) elucidate 3D structures of RNA and protein-RNA complexes that regulate HIV-1 splicing; C) determine the mechanisms by which RNA structure affects splicing; and D) develop novel strategies to target HIV-1 RNA with small molecule inhibitors.## # #"

"9351190","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since newborn screening (NBS) began in the 1960's, technological advances have resulted in its use in an increasing number of disorders. Recent developments in whole genome sequencing and its simpler corollary, whole exome sequencing (WES), now afford the opportunity to comprehensively define the variation within an individual's genome in a rapid and affordable manner. Many challenges arise with the clinical application of genome-scale sequencing and in deriving practical benefit to infants and children. Its utility in NBS has yet to be demonstrated and its application in the pediatric population requires special examination, not only for potential clinical benefits, but also for the unique ethical challenges it presents. In this proposal, we outline a highly interdisciplinary approach to  identifying, confronting and overcoming the major challenges that must be met in order to implement deep sequencing technology to enhance current newborn screening in a diverse pediatric population. Overarching Aim 1 will evaluate the utility of WES as a diagnostic tool to extend the utility of current NBS. Using diverse cohorts of infants and young children with known conditions identified through NBS, we will examine the sensitivity and specificity of WES. We will also utilize WES in cohorts of children with known conditions not currently screened for as potential candidates for NBS in the future. Overarching Aim 2 will develop and assess a framework for analyzing WES in a clinically oriented framework based on principles of ethics and evidence-based medicine. We will develop strategies to guide clinicians, clinical laboratories and patients/families in their decisions regarding the inevitable incidental findings that will be detected in ways that respect the child and protect his/her future autonomy, while also respecting parental interests and rights. Overarching Aim 3 will explore ethical, legal and social issues (ELSl) involved in informed decision-making and develop best practices regarding return of results after testing. We will develop novel decision support tools and evaluate their usefulness in parental decision making, and examine the burdens placed on clinicians as this new technology is deployed in the vulnerable and special population that are newborns and their families."
"9539476","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing CKD health: Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2) trial Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities with respect to prevalence and clinical outcomes. Measures such as glycemic control in persons with diabetes, blood pressure control, and reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can help delay CKD decline and decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality; however, many individuals with CKD are not benefiting from these scientific advances. This lack of translation may be due in part to very low levels of CKD awareness among providers and patients leading to inadequate primary care provider self-efficacy for delivery of CKD care and poor patient engagement to participate in healthy lifestyles and adhere to medication regimens. To address this need, our multi-disciplinary team has developed and piloted two interventions that increasing awareness among providers and patients and translate that knowledge into more optimal CKD care. The provider intervention is a CKD registry tailored to the entire healthcare team that provides point-of-care decision support regarding CKD management and outside-of care summaries of CKD relevant clinical data to optimize delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care via outreach and population health. The patient intervention is a comprehensive self-management support program that includes low-literacy educational materials, linguistically/culturally tailored automated telephone self-management support (CKD-ATSM), health coaching, and reminder text messages. Our team has successfully piloted both interventions in a pilot feasibility study (NCT01530958) in one academic clinic that serves a low-income, multilingual population. We have since refined the interventions to integrate the registry with the electronic medical record and to include mobile texting in the self-management program. We are now poised to study the effectiveness of the refined interventions on health outcomes among a large diverse, low-income population using the Chronic Care Model framework of health care delivery. We propose a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial entitled Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2), in which we will randomize 60 providers and 400 patients with CKD in 6 federally qualified community health centers to receive the provider intervention (CKD registry) or usual care and the patient self- management support intervention (CKD-ATSM) or usual care. We will assess the impact of the provider intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 1); the patient intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 2); and their interaction (Aim 3) on patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CKD decline); provider behavioral outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy for CKD management); and patient behavioral outcomes (e.g., CKD awareness, participation in self-management behavior). If one or both KARE-2 interventions are effective at improving health among high-risk patients, they can be disseminated to other delivery systems to change the way CKD care is delivered in the US, leading to reductions in CKD-associated morbidity and mortality."
"9384325","Project Summary/Abstract  The discovery that GRP78, traditionally regarded as a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal protein, can relocalize to the cell surface under pathological stress such as cancer, changes the paradigm on how this protein exerts its pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions in cancer. Cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) is emerging as a novel co-receptor controlling cell signaling, proliferation, survival, metastasis and renewal. Its mode of function does not require ATP, thus distinct from its ER foldase activity. Furthermore, since csGRP78 is preferentially expressed in cancer cells but not in normal organs, csGRP78 represents a new target as well as mediator for cancer-specific therapy. Agents including drug-conjugated peptides, toxins and antibodies have been developed targeting csGRP78 and have shown robust activities in blocking its oncogenic functions, suppressing tumor growth in both xenografts and spontaneous tumor models, and synergizing with standard chemotherapy. Of note, monoclonal antibody targeting csGRP78 has completed Phase I/IIa clinical trials with positive response. Despite these exciting advances, how ER stress induces csGRP78 expression and how csGRP78 exerts its biological function are largely unknown. During the past grant period, we discovered that inhibition of the ER stress-inducible proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase protein SRC (c-SRC) potently blocks cell surface expression of GRP78 and other ER lumenal proteins containing the KDEL ER retention motif in a wide variety of cancer cells. We have identified novel binding partners of GRP78 on the cell surface including CD44 and CD109 with established functions in cell motility, invasion, signaling, proliferation and survival. Based on these exciting findings, we propose the following two integrated aims. Aim 1 will investigate how ER stress causes relocalization of GRP78 from the ER to the cell surface. We will test a new concept that a major pathway whereby cancer cells export ER chaperones bearing the KDEL motif to the cell surface is triggered by SRC activation and its subsequent activation of ASAP1, GBF1 and Arf1 leading to blockage of Golgi to ER retrograde. We will also investigate additional SRC downstream effectors and SRC/Golgi-independent routes for csGRP78 expression in exceptional cases. Aim 2 will address how csGRP78 regulates its cell surface partner proteins and their signaling pathways. We will study their physical and functional interactions through biochemical, mutational, as well as confocal and single molecule super-resolution imaging approaches. We will focus on CD44 with established roles in cancer invasion and stemness and perform in vitro and in vivo tests utilizing established human breast cancer cell lines with differential metastatic potential, as well as novel ex vivo culture of patient-derived circulating tumor cells exhibiting metastatic and cancer stem cell properties. We will also study novel mechanisms of csGRP78, through interaction with CD109, in regulating TGF-?-mediated tumor suppressing as well as tumor promoting functions. Collectively, these studies will reveal novel mechanisms for SRC and csGRP78 in tumorigenesis with wide clinical implications."
"9388805","PROJECT SUMMARY  Parent-mediated interventions often target social communication in young children with ASD, although to date  studies yield inconsistent effects. One reason for the limited evidence may be the considerable heterogeneity  in both parent and child characteristics that affect the fit of intervention to family and ultimately influence  treatment outcome. For parents, these factors might include stress associated with the uncertainty of their  child's diagnosis, caregiver expectations for the intervention itself, and a parent's own style of interaction that  may be influenced by milder but qualitatively similar ASD characteristics, known as the broad autism  phenotype (BAP). For children, these factors might include nonverbal DQ, language, or sensory impairment.  The fit between type of intervention and optimal outcome for parent and child is an understudied, yet essential  component of early intervention that may be susceptible to the influence of heterogeneity in the parent and  child. One approach to addressing this variability is to implement an adaptive intervention approach that seeks  to capitalize on heterogeneity among children and parents. Utilizing an adaptive treatment design, the current  study tests the optimal sequence of intervention delivery and specific parent and child characteristics that may  moderate treatment success in three 10-week stages of intervention. The first phase will randomize parents  and children to a parent education condition, consisting of a parent support and education group focused on  social communication development, or to a parent mediated and therapist delivered condition involving  coaching of the parent with their child in social communication strategies. Phase 2 involves re-randomizing  parents and children to maintain the same treatment arm, or change to the opposite arm to test the optimal  sequence of intervention delivery and specific parent and child characteristics that may moderate treatment  success. In the final phase, dyads are randomized to different maintenance arms, each comprised of 5  sessions with one involving skype and text contact, the other in -home visits, to explore how best to maintain  treatment gains once the active intervention phase is complete. This study has the potential to dramatically  improve child social communication outcomes by individualizing and personalizing parent intervention  approaches with very young children, a high priority need of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Council and  NIH."
"9341957","Project Summary  Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a lipophillic molecule composed of a benzoquinone ring and a  hydrophobic decaprenyl tail. In the mitochondrial respiratory chain, CoQ10 transports electrons  from complexes I and II to complex III. It is also an antioxidant, co-factor for pyrimidine  biosynthesis, and modulator of apoptosis. Human CoQ10 deficiency is a genetically and  clinically heterogeneous disease. Response to therapy is variable. Our studies of cultured  fibroblasts from patients carrying mutations in PDSS2, COQ2, ADCK3, and COQ9, have  revealed correlations between level of CoQ10 and oxidative stress; <15% and >60% residual  CoQ10 are not associated with oxidative stress, whereas 30-50% residual CoQ10 is associated  with oxidative stress, mitochondrial hyperpolarization followed by depolarization and cell death.  In cell lines with primary CoQ10 deficiency, incubation of CoQ10 deficient fibroblasts for 1 week  with 5mM CoQ10 (but not short-tail ubiquinone analogs) improved bioenergetics indicating  pharmacokinetic constraints and dose of CoQ10 may limit efficacy in CoQ10 deficient patients.  Based on our studies, we hypothesize that: 1) genotypic heterogenity contributes to the  phenotypic variability of CoQ10-deficiency; 2) levels of oxidative stress, respiratory chain  deficiency, and apoptosis differ depending on the severity CoQ10 deficiency, and 3) CoQ10  and its analogs have variable efficacy in CoQ10 deficiencies. To test these hypotheses, we  propose the following two specific aims: Aim 1) To test genetic and pharmacologic therapies for  CoQ10 deficiency in vitro by assessing ADCK3 overexpression and analogs of 4-  hydroxybenzoic acid, as approaches to rescue endogenous CoQ10 biosynthesis defects; Aim 2)  To test therapies in two mouse model of CoQ10 deficiency by comparing efficacies of oral and  intratechal administration of CoQ10 and idebenone in preventing or delaying the onset of the  disease in the Pdss2 kd/kd and Coq9X/X mutant mice."

"9354198","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is of utmost importance to identify the circuits underlying learning and memory in order to understand not only the mechanisms of memory but also the how these mechanisms become dysregulated in memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human and rodent lesion studies have suggested a role for the hippocampus (HPC) in long-term memory, specifically the subregion CA1. CA1 is preferentially activated when a memory must be retained over a long period of time, and studies have shown that a large proportion of CA1 neurons are reactivated in repeated exposures to the same environment. However, no previous studies have been able to assess the long-term (> 1 month) involvement of individual CA1 neurons in learning and memory, or in AD, since all previous transgenic lines have lacked an indelible label. In this application, the contribution of individua CA1 neurons to the encoding of an experience and to the retrieval of a corresponding memory will be investigated by utilizing a transgenic line, the ArcCreERT2 mice. This mouse line allows for the indelible labeling of cells expressing the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1 and allows for a comparison between the cells that are activated during the encoding of an experience and those that are activated during the retrieval of the corresponding memory. In combination with optogenetic reporter lines, these studies will assess the long- term involvement of CA1 neurons in memory encoding and retrieval. To fully characterize the role of CA1 neurons in memory, we will selectively express the blue light activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or the yellow light activated outward proton pump archaerhodopsin (Arch) in populations of CA1 neurons during encoding. Using optogenetics, we will then test the hypothesis that a subpopulation of CA1 neurons is sufficient and necessary for the retrieval of a corresponding long-term memory. Next, the role of CA1 in memory encoding and retrieval will be delineated in AD mice by utilizing a triple transgenic design in which CA1 neurons, initially labeled during encoding, can be optogenetically modulated in control and AD mice. In vivo, we will test the hypothesis that optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons during memory retrieval will improve expression of a memory in AD mice. Finally, optogenetic manipulations will be used in order to mimic a deep brain stimulation-like protocol in control and AD mice in order to improve overall cellular function, cell survival, and memory retrieval in AD mice."

The Lysosomal Disease Network (LDN) has created a community of clinical investigators, patient advocacy groups (PAG), and other interested parties, to become a synergistic research and educational consortium advocating advancement of treatment for these diseases. In the past three decades, lysosomal diseases have been a test bed for some of the most innovative therapeutic modalities. In the past 4 years of NIH funding, the LDN has accelerated knowledge acquisition in the field - with 33 MyNCBI cited publications, and 12 more in press/review/preparation-and furthered the development of therapeutic options. For the next 5 years, this proposal describes 9 longitudinal studies of natural history and/or treatment, and 5 pilot studies for novel ideas under the central theme of discovery in ultra-orphan diseases. Because central nervous system (CNS) disease is the most difficult to treat and measure, there is a major emphasis on quantitative analysis of CNS structure, function and biomarkers for relevant conditions: mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), mucolipidosis IV, Batten disease, gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff and GM1 gangliosidosis diseases), globoid cell leukodystrophy. Projects will (a) evaluate immune modulatory factors affecting treatment response in Pompe disease; (b) assess bone disease in MPS, (c) correlate renal structure and function in Fabry disease; (d) search for undiagnosed Fabry disease in high-risk populations; (e) determine outcomes of newborn screening for Krabbe disease; and (f) shorten the diagnostic odyssey. Productivity is assured by a new performance-based model, with proposals initially vetted for rigorous statistical significance, and reimbursement to investigators governed by DMCC data submission.

"9329403","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a complex disease with multiple risk factors/causes, and a broad spectrum of complications. The rational development of novel clinical treatments for diabetes will require interdisciplinary approaches to integrate multiple daa sources, build predictive models, and develop new technologies that will together reveal the multifactorial underpinnings of the disease. Such approaches are well-developed in engineering, but they have not been widely applied to diabetes, in part because of a lack of people skilled in both engineering and biomedical research. To develop such an interdisciplinary workforce, we propose to create a novel Integrated Training in Engineering and Diabetes (ITED) program to attract both predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows with engineering and quantitative physical science backgrounds to work on research problems at the interface of engineering and diabetes. Vanderbilt University is an ideal location for this program because of the close integration and proximity of the Schools of Engineering and Medicine, the outstanding environment for diabetes research, and the long-standing tradition of collegiality and collaboration across the Vanderbilt campus. The overall goal of the program is to provide talented individuals from engineering backgrounds with state-of-the-art training in diabetes research, which will give them a broad perspective of both basic biomedical research and associated clinical challenges. Twenty-five faculty preceptors, equally distributed between those with an engineering background and a diabetes research focus, will work together to offer a wide variety of research opportunities in engineering and diabetes research. Our program includes: a) a novel dual mentor plan where each trainees performs interdisciplinary research in two labs, b) an efficient didactic program that provides trainees with the necessary knowledge base in a compact time-frame that promotes timely completion of their degree, and c) interactions with other trainees, faculty, and visiting scientists. Two experienced mentors, one from engineering and one from a diabetes research background will supervise each trainee. This interdisciplinary approach will require the trainees to spend significant time in each of the mentors' labs. A broad educational program for predoctoral trainees will leverage existing courses in the Schools of Engineering and Medicine, supplemented by research seminars, a monthly ITED Journal Club, and an annual ITED Retreat. Postdoctoral trainees with engineering degrees will be specifically recruited to this program, and will participate in all ITED activities We do not expect the postdoctoral trainees to have a background in diabetes research, so they will achieve competency through didactic instruction. Support for 4 predoctoral trainees and 2 postdoctoral trainees is requested based on the research resources of the 25 faculty preceptors. A Steering Committee that represents the breadth of participating investigators will select trainees based on their academic and research performance, and their promise as independent investigators. The program will provide RCR training and actively seek to support disabled individuals and those from minority groups."

Researchers can use the same probes to examine microorganisms, cells, and mice as they do in patients to visualize and characterize the biology of disease, monitor its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Over 4000+ PET probes have been developed to help answer a variety of biological questions, but only the glucose analog [18F]FDG is routinely used for molecular imaging diagnostics in patient care. There is still an unmet need to develop additional probes which can annotate other key aspects of cancer biochemistry, including those in which the diagnostics share common targets with drugs, to truly establish it as a key technology for realizing improved treatment and monitoring in personalized medicine. The clinical translation of next generation PET probes is hampered by a lack of multi-site infrastructure to robustly, reliably, and cost-effectively support their supply to fulfill the initial data generation required to determine safety and efficacy in humans. This is often a key issue in bridging the ?gap? between proof-of-concept research and FDA approval; Pharma and Biotech, who face increasing pressure to use diagnostics to develop drugs more efficiently, require significant validation studies and a reliable supply to realize the value of a novel PET probe to their clinical program and invest in future studies. Thus, early clinical studies in this gap are currently relegated to single-site production, or must undergo a cost- and-time-prohibitive assimilation into a commercial radiopharmacy before they've been clinically vetted. To facilitate a paradigm shift in the enablement of novel PET probes for the clinical trial community, a fundamental change in production ideology and infrastructure re-imagining is required. Creating a network of academic radiochemistry cores that standardize and share synthesis, purification, formulation, and quality control protocols through automation and cloud-based applications for clinical production serves to reduce barriers to translating PET probes from the preclinical research environment to first-in-human studies, as well enable rapid dissemination of PET probes across multiple sites to spur and de-risk academic and industry collaboration. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish and deploy a novel, low cost, scalable approach to the clinical translation of a next generation PET probes for cancer, starting with candidate probe [18F]CFA, with potential commercialization as a predictive response biomarker for cancer immunotherapies in solid tumors (i.e. CTLA-4/PD1 blockade), a pharmacodynamic biomarker for dCK inhibitors, and a predictive response biomarker for chemotherapy nucleoside prodrugs."
"9355148","The asbestos-related malignancy, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), is often detected in late stages with little chance for survival. Biomarkers are needed to (1)determine which patients have been asbestos exposed (AE) (2) distinguish AE and non-MPM malignancies from MPM patients and (3) determine which MPM patients are at highest risk for early recurrence or death. The EDRN Mesothelioma Biomarker Discovery Laboratory will refine and validate three novel MPM blood/effusion based markers (FBLN3, SOMAmer 13 classifier, HMGB1 Isoforms) and investigate whether immune- oncologic gene expression differences in the cellular component of the circulating blood microenvironment can stratify AE and MPM from other control cohorts. All of these in Phase I/II discovery studies have yielded AUCs > 0.9. An in-house, novel Luminex based assay (Soma 14 NYU MPM) consisting of 13 slow-off-rate-modified-aptamers (SOMAmers) and a newly constructed FBLN3 SOMAmer will be assembled and technically validated using identical specimens that were used to discover these 14 analytes. Diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in both plasma and pleural effusion will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of Hawaii/Cedar Sinai Medical Center, using 202 NYU pleural effusions, will evaluate a unique, technically validated, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for HMGB1 and its isoforms to differentiate MPM from non-MPM benign and malignant effusions. The HMGB1 effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow University Hospital. Finally we will refine and validate our buffy coat/PBMC MPM profile of 5 immuno- oncology genes which in Phase II studies can separate non AE individuals vs AE individuals vs MPM with AUCs of 1.0. These studies could lead to 3 novel platforms which individually or combined could significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM."
"9330838","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When children have kidney dysfunction, their decline is more rapid than adults, and they develop many other complicating medical conditions that threaten their life expectancy. The majority of young adults with a history of kidney failure in childhood suffer significant comorbidities, with as much as a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease and 30- to 150-fold higher mortality compared to their age matched peers. The ability of physicians to identify when kidney function decline accelerates or the early onset of cardiovascular disease is currently limited. Recent advances in the laboratory techniques available to study the nature and variety of urine proteins (urine proteomics) have led to the discovery of highly discriminant biomarkers of varied diseases, and also suggested new potential targets for therapy. However, these techniques have not been applied to study progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children. Analysis of urine has several advantages over blood serum or plasma: urine can be obtained easily and in much larger volumes. Also, urine sampling can be frequent and repeated. As urine is a filtrate of serum, it has a comparatively simpler composition. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-14-011 for the Chronic Kidney Disease Biomarkers Consortium (CKD BioCon) (U01), proposes to utilize recent advances in state-of-the-art urine proteomic profiling as well as the comprehensive careful characterization of and collection of biosamples from children with CKD in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) cohort over the last decade, to perform the first large-scale discovery and validation of novel urinary biomarkers of CKD progression in children."
"9397109","Project summary  Microtubule (MT) motors such as kinesin-1 and dynein play critical roles in the cell by orchestrating the movements of proteins, organelles and cytoskeletal elements. In neurons, kinesin transports cargo towards the synapse while dynein takes it back to the cell body. This bidirectional transport is possible because the motors interact with the MT cytoskeleton in different ways. Kinesin walks towards the plus-end of MTs, while dynein walks towards the minus-end. For a cargo bound to both types of motors, as is often the case, the direction of travel will be dictated by which type of motor is more active. For example, if kinesin is more active than dynein, the cargo will move towards the synapse. By locally controlling the relative activity of these two motors, the cell can steer cargo to its proper destination. However, it is not well understood this regulation of motor activity occurs. Just as the MT surface dictates which direction the motors travel, it may also play a role in modulating their activity. In axons, motors move along MTs decorated with a gradient of the MT-associated protein Tau. It has been proposed that Tau spatially controls MT traffic by differentially regulating motor activity. In this model, the presence of Tau promotes the relative activity of one type of motor over the other. Using single-molecule imaging, the motility of the two motors on MTs coated with different concentrations of Tau will be measured. Then, the mechanism by which Tau affects motors will be determined using a variety of synthetic obstacles and Tau mutants. Finally, the study will be extended to multi-motor cargo bound to both kinesin and dynein and determine how Tau affects bidirectional transport. Together, these experiments will reveal the role that Tau plays in regulating bidirectional cargo traffic."
"9467195","Project Summary/Abstract  There exists a dire need for new and more effective drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), especially in mental health. The pace of approval for new chemical entities is anemic, with an average of just three compounds per year entering the market over the last 15 years. Unsurprisingly, clinical trial failure rates for CNS drug development remain greater than 90%, and many more programs fail during preclinical development. Given the immense personal, societal, and economic burden that psychiatric disorders place on the United States, better drug discovery and development paradigms must be implemented. BrainXell is addressing this issue by introducing new in vitro model systems with high relevance to the human brain that are composed of normal cultured human neurons of various types. This proposal focuses on one of these types, cortical glutamatergic neurons, which is central to many psychiatric and neurological disorders.  In our Phase I project, we developed a novel and proprietary cocktail to expand cortical glutamatergic progenitors, allowing generation of 5×103 glutamatergic neurons from a single induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC). This expansion method exhibits a clear advantage over traditional approaches that use growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF), as glutamatergic progenitors expanded under such conditions often change their differentiation potential. We have also optimized the cell dissociation process and neuron cryopreservation medium, which yield cell viability >90% after dissociating into single cells and >70% after thawing. Together, these studies provide the technical basis to accomplish the same goal: manufacture large-scale, high-purity cortical glutamatergic neurons.  This technology developed in Phase I will be fully commercialized in Phase II. We will produce multiple large lots of normal neurons to validate our protocol. Our procedures will be augmented with new equipment to ensure consistency between vials and lots. The characterization and quality control procedures for the resulting product will be optimized and expanded to provide customers with a complete data set and clear quality criteria for the neurons. Continuing our focus on product performance for our customers, we will generate ?best practice? protocols for the end user that give guidance for culturing neurons in a range of systems. Because glutamatergic neuron production will be offered as a service, we will also test our methods on outside iPSC lines derived from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Finally, we will populate our product pipeline by developing protocols to produce glutamatergic neurons specific for superficial (layer II/III) cortical layers."
"9333349","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The small intestine bears similar morphology of crypts and villi throughout its length, yet marked regional differences in function are well known. The clinical relevance of these differences is highlighted by the region specific location of many human diseases throughout the bowel. Understanding the mechanisms that result in regional specific intestinal stem cells (ISC) is required to develop therapeutic approaches for restoring regional specific function. Our preliminary data supports the concept that patterning of the intestine occurs early in development and is maintained throughout life at the level of the ISC. Using our recently developed in vitro methods to culture human ISC-derived enteroids (hENO) and conditions that regionally pattern human ES/iPS-derived organoids (HIOs), combined with unique transplantation models, we will determine if intestinal regional identity (rID) is stably maintained by specific transcription factors together with a unique chromatin state within individual ISC. To test this hypothesis, we will define the molecular and cellular carriers of intestinal regional identity, determine whether human hENOs and HIOs maintain stable rID after transplantation and identify the network of molecular determinants of regional identity."
"9559745","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): New microscopy technologies will be developed and made available to biomedical researchers to bridge understanding of biological systems across gross anatomical and molecular scales. Project technology development efforts take on two important challenges: addressing the mesoscale range - from a few nanometers to 100 microns, required to see complexes in the context of cellular aggregates in tissues - and developing/advancing capabilities to enable multimodal imaging, that is, correlated imaging across a range of instruments (and their varying capabilities), to allow combining of data from the same specimens, providing new understanding of processes related to disease mechanisms. To achieve these two goals, activities will be in four related technology thrusts: probe development in Core 1, specimen development in Core 2, imaging instrument development in Core 3, and development of software tools to refine, integrate, analyze, and share microscopy data in Core 4. Core 1 will focus on labeling strategies for various new genetic or enzymatic probes. Core 2 will refine specimen-preparation protocols and materials to provide more suitable samples for examination. The combined outcome of these first two cores will be to streamline imaging using correlated microscopy by creating specimens better suited to a range of imaging modalities and enhancing the palette of in-situ markers to facilitate tracking areas of interest in related images and achieve their co-registration. Tracking methods, to be developed by activities of Cores 2 and 3, will be used to connect data in databases using new data analysis tools of Core 4, developing new tools for segmentation and annotation of images. Core 3 advances the imaging capabilities of multiple microscope types to deliver information not only with greater sensitivity and accuracy but more rapidly and seamlessly across scales. The work of all Cores, but especially the instrument development Core 3, will enable more sophisticated use of a next generation microscopes and their application to important biomedical research challenges. Core 4 develops software tools and infrastructure to refine, integrate, quantify, interpret, and add value to image data derived from the new instruments. The coordinated work among the four cores and collaborator projects will enable biomedical researchers to image wider, see deeper, increase contrast and differentiate complex structures, and observe complex phenomena at higher resolution and at faster time scales. Thus we will propel biomedical research requiring traversal of now difficult to navigate spatial scales, thereby facilitating new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease processes."
"9438037","Severe temper outbursts (STO) represent extreme, dysregulated reactions to frustration that can be the source of significant impairment. Despite this, little is known about the adolescent outcomes of children who exhibit STO. The primary aim of the proposed work is to examine psychopathology, and frustration reactivity and regulation in a unique sample of adolescents who exhibited STO in childhood. The second aim is to test the putative contribution of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) structure and functional connectivity assessed in childhood to these adolescent outcomes. To accomplish these aims, the proposed investigation will recruit 169 adolescents, ages 12-17.9, who participated in a previous study conducted by the PI when they were between the ages of 5 and 9.9 years. We expect to obtain data from ~90% (n=152). Functional and structural MRI data are available for 118 children (70% of the sample). Consistent with the RDoC framework, adolescents will be assessed across multiple domains. First, clinical diagnoses will be determined through semi-structured interview. Second, symptom severity will be further assessed through self-report questionnaires. Third, the impact of frustration on cognitive processing will be examined using the Affective Posner task, which has been used in previous studies to demonstrate altered frustration responding in clinically irritable youth. Finally, cortisol reactivity to frustration will be assessed using a novel social frustration paradigm. Fulfillment of study aims has the potential to advance our understanding of STO in childhood as a risk factor for adolescent pathology. Further, this investigation lays the foundation for a subsequent study to evaluate the associations between brain measures and psychopathological outcomes when these children are young adults."
"9350155","Project Summary/Abstract Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common tumor-like condition in men over the age of 50. 50% of men between the ages of 51-60 will suffer from BPH-associated symptoms increasing to 90% in men older than 80 years. However, BPH remains poorly understood from a mechanistic basis. BPH treatment involves the use of ?1-adrenergic blockers (?-blockers), 5?-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) or the combination of the two. Although BPH patients are treated fairly uniformly, for a large subset of patients these types of treatments either fail to ease symptoms, or symptoms become worse resulting in surgical intervention. To date there is little understanding of what causes progression of BPH from asymptomatic to symptomatic to therapy resistant. Although various systemic stresses such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are seen in BPH patients, there is little understanding of how these comorbidities contribute to the progression of the condition. Our laboratory recently discovered that the loss of response to 5ARI therapy and progression to surgery in BPH patients may be associated with stress factors including activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor expression, suggesting mechanisms similar to the responses seen in autoimmune inflammatory (AI) conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. AP-1 factor family members play a role in the mediation of cellular response to oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that obesity and diabetes will give rise to distinct patterns of inflammation and associated AP-1 factor expression. As such we have proposed two aims to address our research question: (1) to determine inflammatory infiltration and associated AP-1 factor expression and (2) to determine the effects of autoimmunity on inflammatory infiltration, AP-1 factor signaling and prostate pathobiology. We will define the role of systemic stresses due to autoimmunity and diabetes in regulating AP-1 transcription factor responses in BPH and will also determine if the usage of drugs utilized in the treatment of AI disease will attenuate the progression of BPH. The data from this study will allow us to explore some of the factors believed to contribute to the progression of BPH and determine if drug regimens that affect such pathways alter the progression of the disease."
"9515379","Because of the growing epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes, we need more effective and sustainable prevention and treatment strategies for these serious disorders. Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, which limit our ability to develop fully effective and safe therapies to treat these metabolic diseases. In this application, we strive to develop a new class of antidiabetic therapeutics based on a structurally novel class of bioactive lipids we recently discovered called Fatty Acid esters of Hydroxy Fatty Acids (FAHFAs). Characterization of one family of FAHFAs, Palmitic Acid esters of Hydroxy Stearic Acids (PAHSAs), revealed that these lipids possess a remarkable range of activities that improve glucose metabolism and reduce inflammation. PAHSAs stimulate insulin secretion and GLP1 secretion, improve systemic insulin sensitivity (i.e. they are insulin sensitizers), and reduce proinflammatory cytokine secretion in adipose tissue of obese mice. As natural compounds, PAHSAs were not designed for a particular target. Instead, these lipids utilize multiple pathways through at least two G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This powerful combination of beneficial activities and receptor targets uniquely positions PAHSAs as an exciting new class of compounds for the treatment of diabetes. In Aim 1, we will design, synthesize, and test PAHSAs and PAHSA analogs to enhance solubility, biological activity, and metabolic stability. This process will be iterative as we synthesize PAHSA analogs we will test them in biologic assays and metabolic stability studies in Aims 1 and 2 and use this information to design the next generation of analogs with improved properties. In Aim 2, we will investigate pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of PAHSAs and PAHSA analogs to determine which compounds have the ideal stability, oral availability, safety, and activity. The information from these experiments will also assist in the design of new PAHSA analogs in Aim 1. Then in Aim 3, we will determine the roles of GPR40 and GPR120 in mediating PAHSA biological effects in vivo using knockout mice and biologic assays in tissues from these mice. A clear mechanism of action is required for drugs moving into the clinic, and the finding that PAHSAs target two intensely pursued anti-diabetic GPCR drug targets will amplify interest in developing PAHSA-based drugs. We will also perform broad target screening since PAHSAs might have additional receptors or pathways. The combination of the data obtained in Aim 3 will provide a comprehensive understanding of the contribution of GPR40, GPR120, and other PAHSA targets to PAHSA biology in vivo. This application will provide the structural, pharmacokinetic, toxicology, and mechanistic data needed to develop PAHSAs or PAHSA analogs into novel anti-diabetes therapeutics."

The landscape of the HIV epidemic is changing rapidly, and there is a critical need for multi-disciplinary research to optimize recent and forthcoming advances and to address new challenges in HIV prevention. Social and behavioral research is paramount to the development, evaluation, and implementation of cutting-edge approaches to preventing HIV and its consequences. In this innovative iteration of CAPS, the Developmental Core will coordinate a wide range of resources and services that will (1) stimulate innovative, timely, high-impact, multi-disciplinary research that addresses current and emerging issues in HIV prevention and treatment; (2) build the number, effectiveness, and diversity of investigators trained to conduct high-impact HIV research; and (3) nurture a scientific environment that fosters innovation, partnerships and interdisciplinary collaborations to address emerging issues in the HIV epidemic. Examples of new directions proposed in this application are a reinvigoration of our pilot grants program to include a Multi-Principal Investigator pilot grant mechanism to foster team science and trans-disciplinary collaborations, an award for outstanding service to our robust internal peer review program, and a new focus on increasing the effectiveness of mentors. Through careful coordination with the other CAPS cores, the Developmental Core seeks to optimize the innovation and impact of HIV prevention science while attracting, supporting, and retaining diverse new investigators dedicated to ending the HIV epidemic and associated health and social disparities."
"9349367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software."
"9469020","Project Summary/Abstract The rationale for this project is based on the need for improved strategies for functional and aesthetic reconstruction of craniofacial defects caused by trauma, tumor removal, infection, congenital malformations, or other diseases. Due to many tissue types in close proximity and a nearby bacteria-filled oral cavity, repair of craniofacial tissue is complex. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop novel approaches and to improve upon existing strategies for craniofacial bone tissue repair by utilizing a scaffold to promote soft tissue healing and space maintenance of the defect, local antibiotic release to combat infection, and tissue growth of specified geometry at a distant site within the body to eliminate donor-site morbidity associated with autograft for repair. The proposed research will test the fundamental hypothesis that local release of antibiotics will eliminate local infection, restore soft tissue healing at the defect site, and allow robust bone growth at a distal site. The proposed research will be accomplished through two specific aims: 1) To manufacture and characterize properties of space maintainers utilizing different antibiotic-loading methods to understand kinetics of antibiotic release and to ensure mechanical properties are adequate for mandibular implantation and 2) To evaluate the effects of an antibiotic-releasing space maintainer on mandibular infection in an in vivo large animal model while bone is grown adjacent to rib periosteum in a 3D printed bioreactor. The space maintainers will be evaluated via mechanical testing (compression, 4-point bending, screw pull-out) and microcomputed tomography (microCT) (for pore size and porosity). The released antibiotic concentration will be evaluated via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bacteria will be utilized to determine minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotic. In order to evaluate the effects of the space maintainer in vivo, the mandibular site will be swabbed (for identification, testing of potential antibiotic resistance) and will be analyzed by microCT for bone growth and histology for tissue and cell types. The tissue grown in bioreactors will be analyzed by microCT and by histology for bone growth, with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and via compression and screw pull-out testing. Blood drawn at several time points will be utilized to detect systemic markers of infection, oral swabs will be cultured, and vitals (such as heart rate and temperature) will be monitored. Upon completion of these studies, the expected outcomes are the successful fabrication of a space maintainer capable of antibiotic release with robust mechanical properties, the successful utilization of 3D printed bioreactors in a large animal model, and the successful development of a large animal model with sustained, yet localized, mandibular infection. In addition to improving upon existing strategies, this work will broaden our understanding on the interplay between bacteria, immune response, antibiotic delivery, and bone growth. Moreover, the proposed system provides a therapeutic approach for complex defects of large or unusual sizes that cannot utilize traditional autograft tissues due to shape or size constraints."
"9321082","Project Summary Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity was not detectable genome-wide at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq and exome-Seq have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than what was previously thought. In collaboration with Dr. Weissman's group in the Genetics Department at Yale University, it is now feasible to perform multiple integrative assays from the same single tumor cell. However, rigorous computational methods are still lagging behind, in order to solve the computational challenge and determine true heterogeneity rather than noise. Here we propose a user-friendly bioinformatics platform that is optimized to integrative multiple types of single-cell NGS data, in particular, transcriptome, exome and CpG methylome data that are all obtained from the same cell. Specifically, in this study we will first construct and validate in parallel three new NGS bioinformatics pipelines to enable single-cell based RNA-Seq, exome- Seq, and CpG methylome data. We will then develop and validate an integration pipeline to analyze multiple types of high- throughput data, exemplified by the RNA-Seq, exome-Seq and CpG methylome single-cell data. To test the software suite, we will first obtain data sets from erythroleukemia cell line K562. We will then utilize this bioinformatics suite to investigate heterogeneity in Myeloid Leukemia patient samples provided by hematologist Dr. Stephanie Halene at Yale Stem Cell Center. Beyond deciphering tumor heterogeneity, this user-friendly bioinformatics platform is expected to be used widely by the single-cell sequencing community."
"9236889","SUMMARY  Cytochrome c (Cytc) plays a central role in mitochondrial respiration and type 2 apoptosis. We have developed new protocols to purify mitochondrial proteins while maintaining their physiological regulatory properties and posttranslational modifications, and we discovered that Cytc is phosphorylated on distinct tyrosine residues in heart and liver tissue. Recently, we have mapped two more phosphorylation sites on Cytc purified from cow and rat kidneys, Thr28 and Ser47, which are the primary focus of this grant application. Supported by strong preliminary data it is our overall hypothesis that Cytc phosphorylation regulates the two main functions of Cytc, mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis. Our long term goal is to understand the regulation of Cytc by cell signaling pathways under normal and pathological conditions. As a first step towards our goal we will test four specific hypotheses: 1) to test the hypothesis that kidney Cytc can be phosphorylated on Thr28 and Ser47, and that these modifications affect the basic properties of the molecule; 2) to test the hypothesis that Cytc Thr28 and Ser47 phosphorylation affects mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis; 3) to identify kinases and phosphatases that control Cytc phosphorylation; and 4) to demonstrate the physiological effect in mice. Phosphorylated Cytc will be isolated from cow and rat kidneys and phosphomimetic mutant Cytc will be overexpressed and purified from bacteria, followed by structural characterization using mass spectrometry, spectroscopic methods, and protein crystallography (Aim 1). Phosphorylated and phosphomimetic mutant Cytc will be subjected to a comprehensive set of functional analyses including in vitro respiration and apoptosis measurements, and by in vivo studies with phosphomimetic Cytc stably expressed in Cytc knockout cells (Aim 2). We will next lay the ground work to explore the signaling pathways and identify kinases and phosphatases that act on Cytc using affinity purification/mass spectrometry techniques (Aim 3). Finally, we will reintroduce phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutant Cytc into Cytc knockout mice to study the effect of Cytc modification and regulation at the animal level (Aim 4). We expect that this research will reveal that Cytc, a protein that makes life and death decisions, is subject to regulation by cell signaling, opening new opportunities for the understanding of mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis, and to control it in pathological conditions in which respiration and apoptosis are dysregulated."
"9355160","Project Summary/Abstract The recent development and implementation of second-generation, deep sequencing technologies has provided an unprecedented opportunity to characterize genomic changes in cancer. However, the enormous data output from these sequencing platforms also presents a formidable statistical and computational challenge to separate and validate the minority of cancer-causing driver mutations from the overwhelming majority of irrelevant bystander passenger mutations. Computational analysis plays a critically important role in making biological sense out of the mountains of genomic sequencing data. In this proposal, I propose to continue my research work as an expert in cancer bioinformatics, to develop computational tools to narrow down the candidate cancer-causing disease mutations involved in the development and progression of cancer. My bioinformatics work will focus on three research areas: (i) identification of genes causing familial disposition to cancer susceptibility, (ii) detection and characterization of large structural alterations in cancer, and (iii) identification of cancer genes using mouse cancer model system. My short term goal is to develop bioinformatics tools to develop bioinformatics tools to identify cancer-causing disease mutations using genome sequencing data from human patients and mouse cancer models. My long term goal is to characterize these driver mutations further, generating molecular targets to improve diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment of cancer. In my first aim, I propose to develop a bioinformatics pipeline to identify cancer predisposing germline mutations from patients with strong familial history of cancer using whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing data. This aim tests the hypothesis that cancer predisposing mutations can be weighted and validated from enormous sequencing data sets using statistical and bioinformatics methods. In my second specific aim, I will develop bioinformatics algorithms to detect and characterize large structural variants in human cancer. This aim tests the hypothesis that integrative analysis of different genome sequencing platforms can be further refined and validated the full structure of complex genomic alteration. In my third aim, I will develop algorithms to identify the genes that accelerate the development of cancer in mouse cancer models. This aim tests the hypothesis that the computational algorithms and statistical approaches can identify genes predisposing animals to develop cancer and can predict their relevance to human cancer. Successful completion of this groundbreaking new informatics research as a Research Specialist will shed new light on the molecular basis of many cancers, will contribute to active cancer research at Ohio State, and will continue significant recent progress in developing new genomics technologies and analytical methods in studies of human cancers."
"9355256","Diabetes affects more than 8% of Americans with an annual cost of over $245 billion in USA. Although medical therapies are available, there are diabetic patients who are refractory to medical therapies or cannot be treated medically due to side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia.  Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been applied or under investigation for treating epilepsy, therapy- resistance depression, obesity and heart failure due to its inhibitory or excitatory effect on autonomic functions. In this project, we propose to apply VNS to treat diabetes and further we propose to apply VNS only during the postprandial periods. The novel concept of VNS for glycemic control is based on the facts that autonomic imbalance is common in diabetes and VNS is capable of improving autonomic imbalance. A hypoglycemic effect has been observed with VNS of appropriate parameters in our preliminary studies and further VNS has been shown to increase glucagon-like peptide-1 and inhibit plasma ghrelin.  The specific aims of this project are 1) to derive a most effective method of VNS in reducing blood glucose in a canine model of diabetes by systematically optimizing VNS parameters, location and duration; 2) to investigate the effects of the optimized VNS on gastrointestinal motility and hormones; 3) to investigate the chronic effects of VNS on glycemic control and its safety profile. The implantable pulse generator from CVRx will be used to explore the therapeutic potential of VNS for diabetes.  The novelties of this project include: 1) a novel application of VNS for diabetes; VNS has been applied for treating obesity but little was reported for diabetes. Low frequency VNS will be used for improving autonomic imbalance and gastrointestinal dysmotility therefore reducing blood glucose 2) VNS will be delivered only during food intake which prevents tachyphylaxis; 3) a novel concept of treating obesity by improving autonomic functions; 4) The involvement of incretin hormones with VNS is new.  A competitive team has been assembled to include expertise in neuromodulation, gastrointestinal motility, clinical management on diabetes, medical device and software development."
"9388884","PROJECT SUMMARY  Five years of research in the Emory ACE have provided compelling evidence for a causal link between  early deficits in social engagement and later deficits in speech and language in infants at risk of autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) across every stage of vocal development, beginning in the first months of life.  Developmental progressions in vocal behavior are found not only in the infant, but also in the caregiver,  and progressions in both infant and caregiver are disrupted by autism, suggesting that detection and  intervention targeting spoken communication in ASD should be grounded in measuring and  manipulating social contingency in dyadic interactions early in life, attending to the mother as well as  the child. Extending our research to explore these findings, Project II will identify developmental  progressions in social contingency between infant and caregiver, discover active ingredients and  developmental windows of opportunity for key mechanisms of social interaction that scaffold early vocal  development and the emergence of speech and language, and determine how these differ in autism  and typical development. A new cohort of 150 high-risk infants and 100 low-risk controls from 0 to 30  months will allow us to analyze effects of sex, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The first  specific aim is to identify pivotal transitions in vocal behavior and social contingency in both infant and  caregiver over the first three years of life. Based on automated analysis of home audio recordings  sampled longitudinally at monthly intervals, we map out developmental progressions in patterns of  infant-directed and adult-directed vocal behavior, and identify periods where there are significant  changes in typical development and delays or deviations in autism. The second specific aim is to  identify mechanisms responsible for pivotal transitions, in infant and caregiver. By measuring  differences in acoustic cues and timing patterns in infant/adult-directed speech over development, we  identify active ingredients of vocal signaling that mediate transitions, and test whether  infants/caregivers are producing/responding to signals appropriately. The third specific aim is to  evaluate the performance of developmental trajectories of social contingency and vocal behavior as  biomarkers of risk and predictors of treatment response and outcome. Combining results across  Projects I-IV, we test the hypothesis that measures of early social contingency are more effective at  predicting speech and language outcome in infants at risk of ASD than measures of early vocal  production. We predict that treatment paradigms targeting social contingency between infant and  caregiver are more effective at promoting speech development than those that target speech  development in the infant alone. This research addresses all four aims of the NIMH Strategic Plan."

"9385114","Abstract The goal of the Histology and Molecular Pathology Core is to provide a common facility and expertise for the broad spectrum of morphologic studies that may be required for interpretation of studies of various models of kidney disease and their response to interventions. Additional major functions of this Core include providing tissue samples from existing archival specimens from various kidney disease models that may be used for exploration and characterization of expression patterns of various novel target molecules (tissue microarrays). The Core also aims to develop approaches and enhance existing morphologic techniques to improve the ability of center investigators to localize specific molecules in tissue sections, and to interpret their significance based on the spatial localization and relationship to patterns of injury (e.g. mass spectrometry imaging). The principal morphologic techniques provided by the Core include routine histology, including special stains, and selected immunohistochemistry stains and novel RNA scope in situ hydridization. In addition, electron microscopic analysis and selected morphometric techniques, including glomerular size, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, GBM width and foot process effacement are provided. Laser capture microscopic dissection for special studies of selected renal structures is also offered, with mass spectrometry and/or PCR for molecules of interest in the selected regions. Confocal Z section imaging of selected renal structures for detailed spatial analysis can also be performed by the Core. We already have successfully developed mouse and rat kidney tissue array samples from a wide range of experimental models for assessment of key novel molecules and their response to interventions. We have begun development of in situ mass spectroscopy techniques to optimize spatial resolution of mass spectra in kidney tissues, and propose to fully develop this technique for identification of key molecules in kidney diseases. Thus, the Core will continue to offer both state-of-the-art and standard morphologic assessments, together with development of novel approaches to assess specific molecules in tissue sections, and to interpret their significance based on the spatial localization and relationship to patterns of injury."

"9385863","ABSTRACT ? Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.  "
"9423372","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The human-associated microbiota has recently been established as a critical determinant of health and disease. It has attracted wide interest across medical disciplines with the promise of novel microbiota-targeted therapies that can effectively shift the microbiota toward a health-promoting state. The microbiota is noted for its exceptional complexity, with intricate metabolic networks governing microbial symbiotic and competitive interactions. The simultaneous use of multiple ?omics technologies for characterizing the microbiota has been recognized broadly by the research community as a powerful approach because it can expose the interactions between the various components of the microbiota and link microbiota composition and function, a key requirement of targeted therapy development. However, the success of this approach depends on the development of computational and statistical methods for identifying the high-order interactions in the microbiota that are relevant for influencing disease risk and for bridging multiple high-dimensional ?omics data streams. We aim to address this methodological gap by developing, evaluating, applying and distributing a new set of tools for performing meaningful analysis and integration of ?omics data for human microbiota studies. We will frame the development of our tools around two of the most powerful and widely-used technologies for characterizing the human-associated microbiota: (1) sequence-based microbial taxonomic profiling for characterizing microbial community composition and (2) spectroscopy-based untargeted metabolomic profiling for characterizing microbial community function. We will first develop and evaluate a method for integrating multi-omic data streams that leverages publicly available databases of microbial metabolic pathways. Next, we will develop a method for mapping associations between composition and clinical outcomes through the lens of microbiota functional profiles. We will then apply our methods for identifying microbial communities and their phenotypes associated with clinical endpoints in a large cohort. Finally, our methods will be released to the human microbiota research community as an open-source software package. The work we propose will build analytic tools that perform functional integration of multiple ?omics data streams and evaluate complex relationships with clinical outcomes. This represents a novel framework for identifying microbiota-health associations and their functional underpinnings in a manner that embraces the complexity of this system. The significance of this work lies in its potential to help translate experimental and human subjects studies of the microbiota into targeted therapies that shift the microbiota toward a health-promoting state."
"9536500","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gene regulatory mechanisms that program cell differentiation from proliferating precursor cells are fundamentally important for development, tissue homeostasis and cancer. Using the dramatic cellular differentiation program of spermatogenesis as a model stem cell lineage, we seek to understand the unique, cell-type specific transcription program initiated in the spermatocyte stage that sets cells up for terminal differentiation. Here we will investigate how cell-type specific transcriptional activators and repressors we have discovered in Drosophila, and the chromatin modifying complexes and transcription machinery they recruit, together specify the transcription program required for male gamete differentiation. We will investigate how both somatic specific and spermatid differentiation transcripts are kept silent in proliferating precursor cells and probe how testis-specific TAFs (homologs of components of the general Pol II transcription machinery), and a testis specific form of the normally repressive MuvB/dREAM complex work with the transcriptional co-activator Mediator to activate expression of meiotic cell cycle and spermatid differentiation genes. We will investigate how a testis-specific Rest-like Zn Finger protein expressed at the onset of spermatocyte differentiation acts in this context to block inappropriate spermatogonial and somatic differentiation programs in spermatocytes. Defects in either of these latter two gene regulatory mechanisms results in arrest of spermatogenesis at the G2/M transition of meiosis I and failure to initiate spermatid differentiation. Our work on the mechanism of action of cell-type specific transcription activating complexes and master transcriptional repressors in the Drosophila male germ line will provide paradigms for understanding how development programs terminal differentiation of specialized cell types. In addition, understanding the mode of action of the meiotic arrest gene circuitry of Drosophila may illuminate mechanisms underlying meiosis I maturation arrest infertility in man."
"9208476","Project Summary  Ataxic dysarthria, associated with cerebellar disease, represents approximately 10% of all motor speech disorders. Abnormal speech rhythm and articulation are common in ataxia. As a result, speech intelligibility and naturalness may be severely impaired. Little empirical evidence is available to drive effective speech therapy for ataxia dysarthria. The hypothesis that propels this project is that hand gestures that convey rhythmic cues (beat gestures) have the potential to augment abnormal speech rhythm and articulation through entrainment. In task dynamic theory, rhythmic entrainment is the time-varying spatiotemporal task-specific coordination among structures or processes. But speech rhythm is language-dependent, and so it is uncertain whether native (L1) and nonnative (L2) speakers can exploit rhythm similarly. Moreover, the potential for entrainment in the presence of sensorimotor impairment is uncertain. The long-term goal of this project is to develop rehabilitation strategies, grounded in task dynamic theory, that capitalize upon rhythmic entrainment to improve intelligibility and speech naturalness in bilingual speakers with dysarthria. Rhythmic entrainment of hand and articulatory gestures is well documented in monolingual speakers. No studies have explored rhythmic entrainment of beat gestures in L2 speakers with or without dysarthria. Task dynamic theory holds that both rate and rhythm are task-specific control parameters that influence behavior. Our preliminary data suggest that effort is another parameter. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the effect of rhythmic entrainment on intelligibility in L2 speakers with ataxic dysarthria, and the extent to which rate and effort are control parameters that influence entrainment. The specific aims of this project are to determine the effect of three rates of beat gestures, the effect of increased effort (realized as clear speech), and the interaction effect, on intelligibility, speech naturalness, and acoustic metrics in L1 and L2 speakers with and without ataxic dysarthria. Data will be obtained using a single-case experimental design. Baseline measures (Phase A) will be followed by training of beat gestures coordinated with speech (Phase B) using a randomized, multiple- baseline design replicated across 12 talkers. Probes on outcome measures (perceptual and acoustic) will be gathered at each session in conversational and clear speaking styles in three beat gesture rate conditions: no gesture and two imposed rates. The 12 talkers will be equally divided into L1 English and L2 English (L1 Spanish) talkers, and those with and without ataxic dysarthria. The multiple baseline, replicated AB design with the start of the B phase (training) staggered across participants is the strongest of the single-case experimental designs used to investigate the functional relationship between treatment and outcome scores. Rhythmic entrainment in L1 and L2 speakers with dysarthria is an unexplored area of study that offers a unique opportunity to develop novel rehabilitation strategies, grounded in task dynamic theory, for a large, underserved population."

"9341983","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will be a campus-wide effort at UC Irvine to broaden the training of biomedical PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. The NIH Biomedical Research Workforce report concluded that graduate training should no longer focus exclusively on preparing scientists for academic research. Faculty, students and administrators at UC Irvine agree that we must recognize and nurture non-academic career paths for PhD trainees. To accomplish this objective, we propose a program called UCI-GPS (UC Irvine Graduate Professional Success) that will encourage students and postdoctoral fellows to prepare for a variety of career options. The program leadership will include faculty, students, staff, and non-academic partners. The proposal has four Specific Aims: (1) EXPLORE: Increase awareness and interest in science-related careers outside academic research; (2) TRAIN: Improve communication and other skills needed to pursue alternative career paths; (3) EXPERIENCE: Provide hands-on experience through internal and external internships; (4) TRANSITION: Build networks that allow trainees to prepare for and transition to science-related careers. The program will transcend department, program, and school boundaries. Students in ten different PhD programs, and postdoctoral fellows in participating departments, will gain access to a diverse menu of professional development activities. A system of professional development credits will encourage participation in activities, including: Seminars and Workshops: PhD degree holders in various science-related professions will visit campus to give lectures and meet participants; Courses: fee waivers will allow participants to gain access to valuable online courses to develop key skills sought by employers; participation in existing classes that specifically develop oral and written scientific communication skills will be expanded; Networking: quarterly mixers will be established to facilitate professional connections in workforce sectors of interest; a mentoring program will also be established; Internships: qualified trainees will have the opportunity to serve as interns for one month or more in diverse work environments outside the academic research laboratory, with support from graduate fellowship funds. Program activities will focus on developing skills that are not generally acquired during academic research training. We will track outcomes of UCI-GPS trainees and an external evaluator will monitor the program impact. The Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators of the UCI-GPS program have a strong track record of graduate training and mentorship, with complementary expertise in different disciplines and experience in the private sector. Together with other key stakeholders on the UCI campus, the UCI-GPS leadership is committed to increasing the percentage of PhD trainees who make successful transitions to science-related careers. This goal aligns with our industry partners who seek a better-trained biomedical workforce."
"9554079","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project encompasses a multi-disciplinary team of basic scientists and clinical investigators dedicated to finding effective new therapies for patiens with cancer. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center is a truly comprehensive biomedical research campus with strong collaboration between the experienced investigators including faculty from the respective Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Health, Nursing, and Engineering. Investigators in our Experimental Therapeutics Program have been engaged in phase l/ll cancer studies for decades. Our patient population supports robust accrual to NCI-sponsored early clinical trials. Each clinical trial engages a team of scientists with incorporatio of near real-time pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics correlative studies. We have collaborated extensively with other centers dedicated to experimental therapeutics. After defining the safety profile and clinical characteristics of novel agents, our investigators pursue the subsequent development of strategic combination regimens. While our data has been utilized in supporting new drug approvals by the FDA, we explore hypothesis-driven therapeutic trials. We do not simply test drugs. The future of molecular-targeted therapy, genomic profiling of a patient's tumor and the identification of relevant predictive biomarkers wil be explored in clinical studies designed with CTEP. In addition to vigorous pursuit of novel therapeutic agents, our multi-disciplinary team has been heavily engaged in educating the next generation of translational scientists dedicated to experimental therapeutics. Our junior faculty and post-doctoral trainees are provided with the opportunity to lead phase I clinical trials. Our principal investigators include medical oncologists, hematologists, radiation oncologists, gynecologic oncologists, and surgical oncologists. The emphasis is on mentoring allowing the junior investigators to chair the studies under experienced supervision. Basic scientists are invited to join each team in developing the letter of intent, designing the clinical trial, and the engaging in the scientific discovery of developmental therapy. Early clinical trials represent a longstanding emphasis of our research mission to improve patients' lives.         RELEVANCE: This research project will identify new treatments for cancer patients. New agents that appear to be promising in the laboratory studies are introduced to cancer patients whose options are limited with standard treatment. In giving these new agents to cancer patients, the physicians observe the effects on the condition of the patient. Patients have blood drawn to test the safety and the effectiveness of these new treatments. If an agent is promising, further studies will be planned based on this information."
"9338225","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The relative price of fruits and vegetables (F&V) is high, making purchasing of these healthy foods an economic hardship for many shoppers. Government subsidies coupled with public-sector and private-sector initiatives to incentivize the purchasing of F&V have recently been proposed. It would be difficult, however, to determine a reasonable and appropriate pricing of F&V, without first experimentally assessing the impact of price reduction on consumer demand, consumption, and profitability. The proposed study examines the main and sustained effects of 50%, 25%, and 12.5% discounts, versus 0% discount, on purchasing of F&V by overweight and obese (25 < BMI ? 40) shoppers in six stores of a Manhattan supermarket chain. Recruitment will be for 400 shoppers from within these stores to obtain an estimated 300 completers. After a 4-week baseline period (no discounts), participants will be randomly assigned to receive a 50%, 25%, 12.5%, or 0% discount during a 32-week intervention period, with a 16-week follow-up period (no discounts). The discounts will be automatically activated after 4 weeks through the participant's loyalty scan card, which will also track all purchases. The primary aims are to measure the effects of the four discount levels on purchasing and consumption of F&V during the intervention period and the health outcomes at the end of the intervention period. Additionally, a primary aim is to measure the sustained effects of the discounts on these outcomes during the follow-up period. It is expected that the larger the discount on F&V, the greater the increase in purchasing and consumption of F&V, especially for those with relatively low incomes. These increases in F&V purchasing and consumption are expected to lead to improved health outcomes, such as weight and fat loss as well as reduced cardio metabolic risk factors. Demand curves for purchasing and consumption of F&V will be drawn for all the discount levels to help select optimal discount levels. The study findings should help to inform government policymakers on the appropriate subsidies to consider for promoting healthy food choices."
"9409301","Abstract Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pose a serious threat to public health. These organisms cause infections that are associated with high mortality rates, have the potential to spread widely, and are resistant to all ?-lactam agents and most other antimicrobials leaving virtually no treatment options. Much CRE increase has been due to the spread of CRE that produce the carbapenemase ?Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase? (KPC) enzyme. KPC in health care settings is a significant challenge as mortality for patients infected with KPC was 23 percent in 7 days, 42 percent in 30 days, and 60 percent by the end of their hospitalization. To reduce the risk of KPC outbreaks and minimize associated healthcare costs, we propose to develop an ultra-sensitive point-of-care (POC) test for quantifying KPC in about 4 hours from rectal swabs using a POC cartridge. The test will confirm that Klebsiella pneumoniae is present, viable and capable of producing KPC enzymes when exposed to a carbapenem, and it will also indicate the KCE concentration to medical professionals which can provide unique insight for treatment options. The proposed KPC guanine- amplified immunoassay will quantify ultra-low levels of KPC in ~4 hours from rectal swabs using a POC cartridge. Rectal swab samples will be exposed to a carbapenem antibiotic along with nutrients, and incubated for 2.5 hours at 35O C to produce KPC if Klebsiella is present, viable and carbapenemase-producing. The test will quantify low levels of KPC using a novel signal amplification platform in a sandwich immunoassay that replaces single optical labels with millions of electroactive guanine-rich oligonucleotide tags bound to microbeads. Capture antibodies bound to immunomagnetic beads will magnetically separate targets from nonspecific materials. Detection limits can be adjusted by changing the size of the microbeads and/or the length of the oligonucleotides. KPC enzyme levels will be quantified from voltammetry signals using a commercial-off-the-shelf 96-well biosensor micro-plate and electrochemical reader (potentiostat). The feasibility of the Guanine-amplified immunoassay is supported by a US Navy project which detected 3 cfu/mL of E.coli O157:H7 and a US Army project for simultaneously detecting E.coli, cryptosporidium and norovirus. Independent testing by demonstrated a 3 - 5 log reduced level in detecting C. parvum antigens from Guanine?s immunoassay compared with commercial ELISA kits. In Phase I we will develop a Guanine-amplified immunoassay for quantifying low level KPC enzymes produced by CP-Klebsiella pneumoniae exposed to carbapenem antibiotics within 4 hours from rectal swab samples (Mo 0-8), adapt the KPC Guanine-amplified immunoassay to operate in a cartridge for automated POU (Mo 6 - 10), and evaluate the KPC Guanine- amplified immunoassay versus Modified Hodge Test, PCR and culture (Mo 10 -12). In Phase 2, expanded testing will be used in applications to the FDA for certification. An automated instrument will also be developed to operate the cartridge at the POC for rapid, ultra-sensitive, multiplex quantification of KPC and other CRE.

"9348415","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At present, few synthetic systems can achieve robust, on-demand spatial and temporal control of micro or nanovesicle permeabilization in biological environments. We propose to build upon proof-of-principle experiments establishing the feasibility of such a membrane permeabilization system and to apply this technology towards: 1) triggering drug release in tumors and 2) capturing tumor microvasculature contents via a remote loading and retrieval approach. Several methods for cargo release driven by external stimuli driven have been proposed; whereas to our knowledge the concept of remote capture and retrieval of microvessel contents using triggered permeability in nanovesicles has not yet been explored. So far, essentially all biocompatible approaches for externally triggered membrane permeabilization from nanocarriers comprise systems that release their contents when the surrounding temperatures are raised by a few degrees above body temperature via direct or indirect heating. However, such mechanisms are not amenable to trigger-side release modulation and the narrow thermal operating window precludes carrier stability at physiological temperatures. Furthermore, the lack of stability in physiological conditions prevents more demanding applications of these materials such as triggered release at later time points as well as remote loading and recovery. Here, we propose a fundamentally new controlled release system based on porphyrin- phospholipid doped (PoPD) liposomes transiently permeabilized directly by near infrared (NIR) light, a clinically-applicable stimulus that has negligible actuatin in the off state and minimal interference with biological tissues. The ability to open and close nanovesicles in the body with precise spatial and temporal control could lead to entirely new approaches to treating and understanding cancer. We synthesized a novel light-absorbing monomer esterified from clinically approved components that gave rise to highly stable porphyrin bilayer. Remarkably, rapid and complete cargo release was induced upon brief exposure to mild NIR irradiation using an optimal porphyrin-phospholipid (but not free porphyrin) doping. Unlike previously described systems, release occurred in the absence of bulk solution photothermal heating or chemical reactions. In physiological conditions in vitro, NIR irradiation induced a 25,000 fold increase in the release rate of actively loaded doxorubicin, orders of magnitude greater than previously described triggered release methods. Induced permeability could be used for both unloading and loading cargo, and could be modulated by varying porphyrin doping, irradiation intensity and irradiation duration for highly tunable manipulation of permeabilization. This project has three specific aims. Aim 1: Develop micro and nanovesicles that open and close on demand in response to NIR light; Aim 2: Use near infrared light to deliver cancer therapeutics to tumors; Aim 3: Sample tumor microvasculature contents using a capture and retrieve strategy."
"9478419","Summary/Abstract Current systems of care are not meeting the needs of older individuals with multiple chronic health conditions. Compared to individuals without multimorbidity, they receive more conflicting medical advice and experience worse quality of life, more physical disability, more adverse drug events, and higher mortality. They often face competing and conflicting care demands. The best care aligns with individuals' personal values about health and wellbeing. Unfortunately, individuals with multiple chronic conditions are often unaware of how their personal values could impact their treatment choices. Personal values can be left out of patient discussions with providers and family caregivers who help manage their chronic illnesses. Patients with multiple chronic conditions need tools to help them define personal values and apply them to choices about chronic illness management. In this project, experts in chronic disease care, health information technology, and human-centered design will build and test a personal health library for individuals with multiple chronic conditions that illuminates connections between personal values and chronic illness management. Our approach restructures health information towards the needs and capabilities of individuals with multiple chronic conditions. It moves from disease-focused information and care to supporting an awareness of what matters most to individuals. We build on our preliminary work in personal values for health and wellbeing in these individuals. Through a human-centered design process engaging individuals, we will design and test a personal health library with interactive visualizations of personal data aimed at enhancing self-awareness of the connections among values and chronic illness care. Data on personal values for health and wellbeing will be elicited directly from individuals including home photographs. Data on self-management of chronic illness will come from the electronic health record. Patient control and stewardship of the interactive personal health library will be essential, given the potentially sensitive nature of combining personal values, photos and electronic health record data; our design process will elicit preferences and requirements about information control from participants.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to RFA NIDDK RFA-DK-14-503, we propose to develop a public web portal that will aggregate data on human genotypes, phenotypes, and annotations relevant to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits, automate the analysis and interpretation of these data, communicate the results clearly and comprehensively to scientists across biomedical disciplines, and provide an organizational infrastructure for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in T2D (AMP T2D), a new consortium aiming to empower a wide range of biomedical investigators to use human genetic analysis to accelerate biological understanding and development of new treatments for T2D. As Director of the Data Coordinating Center and Chair of the Steering Committee of the T2D-GENES Consortium, the applicants (Altshuler and Boehnke) have been leaders of the T2D-GENES Consortium, which built a prototype T2D portal that provides access to results and explanations of underlying methods. This prototype includes data on 13,000 exome sequences, 80,000 samples genotyped on the exome array, and meta analyses of 25 genome-wide association studies, allowing users to fetch, filter, sort, and view results from these studies via an intuitive interfae. To expand the portal's data, we will work with the AMP T2D consortium to identify high-quality datasets relevant to T2D, related phenotypes, and functional annotations; develop an administrative and computational infrastructure to collate, store, and manage these datasets; and ensure the data are deposited in this infrastructure. To automate analyses of the data, we will form a group to identify best-practice methods and, where needed, develop new ones; build a software platform to run a series of complex analyses and store their inputs and outputs; and implement these codified statistical methods on the platform. To communicate the results, we will gather user requirements for portal functions; develop a web-based platform and software widgets to facilitate these functions; and design user-friendly queries, visualizations, text, and other features to serve these functions, instantiating them on the portal. To enable collaboration within AMP T2D, we will help define goals for communication and engagement; instantiate standard operating procedures and personnel; and perform administrative functions to support the consortium."
"9349383","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apicomplexan parasites are important human pathogens, and cause diseases ranging from life-long asymptomatic infections with Toxoplasma gondii in about a quarter of the world's population to nearly a million deaths annually due to malaria. To decipher their biology and treat the diseases they cause, we must understand the signaling pathways unique to these successful pathogens. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are attractive targets for intervention because they are conserved among apicomplexans, absent from the genomes of their animal hosts, and essential for the parasite life cycle. Prior work has shown that CDPKs regulate various processes necessary during the T. gondii life cycle, including the calcium-regulated secretion of specialized organelles required for motility. Although we have identified key enzymes responsible for phosphorylation in T. gondii, we know little about the substrates, and even less about the consequences of these modifications for parasite entry, survival and release from the infected host cell. The proposed study will map essential signaling pathways regulated by apicomplexan CDPKs and inform their potential as therapeutic targets. The three specific aims of this application will address differen aspects of CDPK biology, by identifying the role of individual kinases, characterizing the substrates they regulate, and determining the function of these substrates. The first aim uses a chemical-genetic strategy established by the investigator to specifically inhibit and study the function of two CDPKs in the parasite life cycle, and extends this strategy to the four remaining members of the kinase family. These experiments will allow us to compare the cellular processes regulated by each of the conserved CDPKs in T. gondii. The second aim exploits our ability to label and identify the targets of specific parasite kinases, to map the substrates of tw CDPKs previously shown to be essential for parasite entry and exit from host cells. The final aim will use quantitative mass spectrometry and genetic manipulation-guided by CDPK targets we already identified and those identified in the second aim-to measure phosphorylation changes in vivo and determine the function of selected CDPK targets. Together the second and third aims will characterize components of the pathways regulated by CDPKs, and establish the molecular basis for their essential function. The goal of this study is to map essential signaling networks regulated by apicomplexan CDPKs and inform their potential as therapeutic targets. Newly identified substrates of individual kinases are likely novel components of these pathways. This is relevant because we do not know the function of ~40% of apicomplexan proteins or the pathways in which they participate. Furthermore, this study provides the basis for comparing CDPK functions across apicomplexans, to uncover how this kinase family regulates the behavior of different organisms."
"9357389","Parkinson?s Disease: Predicting the Future It is poorly understood why some patients with Parkinson?s have an aggressive disease course. The pace of progression varies considerably, ranging from a manageable functional decline to an accelerated course that leaves patients rapidly wheelchair bound or with dementia. This is a source of anguish for patients and caregivers. In clinical trials, this variation obfuscates drug effects. Many genetic variants have been linked to susceptibility, but the genes modulating disease progression have not been well established. Our initial studies indicate multiple coding and noncoding variants predictive of a hyper-accelerated motor or memory decline.  We hypothesize that genetic variants will powerfully predict the progression of Parkinson?s. We will directly address this question through high coverage, massively parallel, targeted sequencing of ten cohorts from North America and Europe that were longitudinal characterized with exceptional granularity over the course of up to twelve years. 3,939 patients with Parkinson?s disease and over thirty thousand clinical assessments will be analyzed using Cox and mixed random and fixed effect models. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variants in susceptibility loci and familial genes that predict cognitive or motor progression. Furthermore, novel putative progression loci emerging from our exome-scale search will be evaluated. In Aim 2, we will replicate and verify forwarded genetic variants in independent populations.  This study will establish the first progression genes for Parkinson?s disease, clarify prognosis, and shift the way we design clinical trials. Rare variants that disrupt protein function will inform on the underlying mechanism and reveal clues for therapies. More generally, these data will contribute towards a precision medicine poised to transform healthcare."
"9523081","Project Summary Understanding how microbes adapt to a novel environment is essential to our understanding of how microbes respond during acute infection or long-term disease. Specifically, the genetic architecture underlying the constraints on producing and maintaining molecular variation within bacterial genomes directly influences the population's potential for adaptation and eventual evolutionary fate. Upon colonization, competition for resources within populations drives adaptation, which can result in cooperation, innovation, or interference among individuals within the population. Previous studies have shown that microbial subpopulation structure can be established as a potential adaptive outcome in heterogeneous environments, but have yet to investigate the long-term stability of this structure and the genetic framework that allows subpopulation structure to be maintained. To bridge this gap of knowledge I propose to: (i) conduct genetic and environmental manipulations of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 in order to determine the importance of biofilm formation for establishment of subpopulation structure, (ii) isolate individual clones from E. coli populations experiencing different degrees of starvation to identify how nutrient limitation affects the stability of subpopulation structure, and (iii) analyze spent media from these clones to define the different nutrient utilization strategies within and among populations. In addition to the populations created for the specific purpose of this study, sampling will also occur from 320 long-term E. coli populations which will have been maintained up to 6 years and over 17,000 generations at the conclusion of this fellowship, generating a well of opportunity for future research questions through which I aspire to establish a career as an independent investigator."
"9355626","Abstract  Maladaptive renal repair following acute kidney injury (AKI) can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) causing tubular atrophy, capillary rarefaction, and interstitial fibrosis. Hypoxia is a known pathogenic factor in the development of CKD and can trigger autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that recycles intracellular constituents for energy reutilization. We have showed that protracted metabolic perturbation in the injured kidney leads to a prolonged autophagic response and contributes to tubular atrophy and vascular dropout. We now propose to extend these findings by performing studies in the following aims. Aim 1 will examine metabolic perturbation and tubular epithelial autophagy during the development of CKD resulting from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We will use our novel autophagy reporter mice to quantify autophagy levels and monitor the autophagic process in relationship with metabolic perturbation. Mice will be treated with a precursor of acetyl co-enzyme A to directly test whether replenishing metabolites prevents tubular autophagy. Next, we will test whether sustained epithelial autophagy can lead to tubular atrophy by taking genetic and pharmacological approaches to alter autophagy levels and examine their effects on tubular atrophy. In Aim 2, we will study molecular regulation of autophagy by FoxO3a and further explore our newly discovered mechanism that links hypoxia to autophagy via activation of FoxO3a through inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation and degradation of FoxO3a. We find that the stress-responsive transcription factor FoxO3a is activated in renal tubules of the kidney with maladaptive repair. Infection of primary cultures of renal epithelial cells with adenoviruses expressing constitutively activated FoxO3a results in activation of the autophagic pathway. The effect and regulation of sustained autophagy by FoxO3a in the diseased kidney will be investigated by performing deletion, overexpression, and rescue experiments. Biochemical and genetic approaches will be applied to understand FoxO3a prolyl hydroxylation via a PHD-mediated reaction that requires oxygen and ?- ketoglutarate. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that tubules with sustained autophagy have reduced Vefga expression, which contributes to capillary rarefaction. Vascular dropout creates further metabolic perturbation to tubules, thus setting up a self-perpetuating, vicious cycle. We will delete Vegfa specifically in renal tubules using a doxycycline-inducible system and examine the interdependence of tubules and peritubular capillaries. Furthermore, we will study whether down- regulation of tubule-derived Vegf is a result of general catabolic consequence from prolonged autophagy and/or due to transcriptional repression by FoxO3a. The goals of this project are two-fold. The first goal is to understand the pathogenesis during the transition from AKI to CKD by focusing on tubular autophagy in the kidneys with metabolic disturbance. The second goal is to understand the molecular regulation of epithelial autophagy by investigating hypoxia-induced FoxO3a activation."
"9545142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The function of the cochlea is to transduce complex sound pressure waves into electrical signals. Organ of Corti vibration is based upon a complex interplay between passive mechanical structures and active OHC- based processes. While laser Doppler vibrometry has added tremendously to our understanding of cochlear physiology, this technique is limited. Only motion from one point on the basilar membrane can be measured, and this provides only a surrogate measure for what is actually responsible for the sense of hearing: deflection of the IHC stereociliary bundle. Thus, these measurements alone cannot explain how the cells and tissues within the organ of Corti work collaboratively to develop cochlear amplification. Vibratory measurements of all of the structures within the intact organ of Corti are needed to understand this process. We have developed a novel technique, volumetric optical coherence tomography vibrometry (VOCTV, pronounced voctive) that overcomes these limitations because it can image directly through the mouse otic capsule bone and simultaneously resolve vibrations at every voxel. Thus, we are at the cusp of understanding how the active and passive mechanics of the cochlea drive IHC stimulation, i.e. the input received by the brain. Our preliminary data demonstrate that frequency-dependent differential motion within the organ of Corti exists. We hypothesize that these movements are mechanically coupled to tilting of the OHC-Deiter cell junction, that the tilting varies with the passive stiffness of the HC, and that the tilting is enhanced by OHC electromotility. This hypothesis is important because, if true, it means that OHC electromotility improves hearing not by increasing vertical displacements of the organ of Corti, but by converting vertical displacement of the basilar membrane into radial fluid movement that can stimulate IHCs. Our studies will explicitly measure the role of the OHC by comparing the in vivo vibratory patterns of wild-type mice (normal OHC stiffness, normal electromotility), prestin 499 mice (normal OHC stiffness, no electromotility), and prestin null mice (decreased OHC stiffness, no electromotility). Aim 1 is to use our existing 1D-VOCTV system to study mice positioned at two different angles to measure both vertical and radial displacements throughout the organ of Corti. Aim 2 is to develop the optical technology and software to perform simultaneous 3D vibratory measurements for every voxel (3D-VOCTV). Aim 3 is use 3D-VOCTV in living mice to measure transverse, radial, and longitudinal motion. If our hypothesis is true, wild- type mice will demonstrate significantly largr radial and/or longitudinal displacements of the OHC-Deiter cell junction compared to dead wild-type, live prestin 499, and live prestin null mice. In addition, the frequency tuning of these displacements should be less sharp in prestin null mice compared to prestin 499 mice. The data obtained with this grant will likely explain the basis for the unique and highly structured anatomy of cells within the organ of Corti. The state-of-the-art technology developed with this grant is likely to become the new standard for making in vivo vibratory measurements."
"9227603","Summary Mapping protein interaction networks of the cell is the ultimate goal of systems-level proteomics. Recently, proximity-based approaches using the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA* have been developed to determine protein interactions directly in live cells, overcoming some of the conceptual and technical limitations of other protein-protein interaction assays. This application aims to develop a new general technique that combines the advantages of proximity-based biotinylation and split protein complementation to detect novel proteins that interact with known signaling complexes. To accomplish this, pairs of split BirA* fragments that restore enzymatic activity only when brought into close proximity will be defined and validated in cell-based biotin ligase assays. Candidate positive split BirA* fragments will then be used in vivo to identify novel proteins interacting with signaling receptors and planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes that are spatially segregated in the Xenopus embryonic neural plate, a new model of PCP. Xenopus embryos are uniquely suited for these studies, allowing rapid analysis of protein localization and function through a combination of biochemical, embryological and cell biological approaches. These studies will provide a versatile general platform to map protein interactions in different experimental settings, will advance our understanding of PCP signaling mechanisms and help establish a new vertebrate PCP model. Since PCP proteins have been implicated in neural tube defects, ciliopathies, polycystic kidney disease and metastatic cancers, the proposed research is relevant to human health and will advance the knowledge necessary for preventing PCP- associated diseases and congenital abnormalities.   1 "
"9365496","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: During early human pregnancy, placental extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) remodel the uterine spiral arteries (UAR) to promote utero-placental blood flow and fetal development. Impaired UAR underlies pregnancy disorders, e.g. fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia (PE), which result in maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality. Conversely, excessive UAR, as in placenta accreta, impairs vasoregulation after delivery. Despite the importance of UAR to successful pregnancy little is known about UAR regulation. Using the baboon as a nonhuman primate translational model, we have shown that advancing the surge in estradiol (E2) from the second to the first trimester suppressed UAR and EVT expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, we propose that: (a) the low level of E2 in the first trimester promotes EVT VEGF expression and UAR and (b) the increase in E2 in the second trimester suppresses UAR by inhibiting EVT VEGF. Because E2 suppression of UAR was simply associated with a decrease in EVT VEGF expression, it is not known whether VEGF mediates this process. Therefore, in Aims 1A,B we propose to use contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU)/microbubble (MB) targeting to deliver the VEGF gene to the placental basal plate of E2-treated baboons and the sFlt-1 gene which suppresses VEGF bioavailability to untreated baboons to test the hypotheses that VEGF: (a) mediates the E2-induced suppression of UAR and (b) promotes UAR during normal pregnancy. A defect in UAR impairs placental function, leading to an increase in placental sFlt-1 expression/decline in VEGF availability and consequently disruption of maternal systemic vascular function. Therefore, in Aim 1C, blood flow dynamics will be determined in baboons to test the hypothesis that the E2-induced increase in sFlt-1/decrease in VEGF bioavailability results in maternal systemic vascular dysfunction. Because placental dysfunction and vascular defects in pregnancy disorders occur in a fetal sexual dimorphic manner, in Aim 1D UAR and maternal vascular function will be determined in pregnancies with male and female fetuses to test the hypothesis that fetal gender impacts the latter processes. Although E2 typically upregulates VEGF, E2 decreased EVT VEGF expression. The divergent roles of E2 on VEGF expression may reflect expression/action of estrogen receptor (ER)? versus ER?. Therefore, in Aim 1E we will culture baboon EVT to test the hypothesis that ER? mediates E2-induced suppression of EVT VEGF expression, migration and invasion. The proposed study is highly significant as it focuses on the regulation of UAR which when defective underpins abnormal pregnancy. The experimental paradigm and targeted delivery of VEGF/sFlt-1 genes via CEU/MB are novel cutting-edge approaches that will establish the role of VEGF on normal and abnormal UAR in a primate with substantial translational application to humans. Elucidating the role of VEGF on UAR will represent a major scientific advance and provide a basis for therapeutic application of VEGF targeting in disorders of human pregnancy."
"9407702","Project Summary  Glycosylation is one of the most prevalent and important post-translational modifications of proteins, yet it is also one of the most difficult to study. No single method nor analytical platform can give complete information about the glycosylation in a protein sample, and the analytical methods in current use include both ESI and MALDI single and tandem mass spectrometry, at least four types of liquid chromatography, iterative enzyme analysis, glycan-binding experiments with fluorescence read-out, and new methods such as ion mobility spectrometry. There is currently no software platform that can integrate even two of these different data channels. In this project we propose to build a software product called GlycoForm that will be capable of analyzing, visualizing, and integrating glycosylation data over multiple channels. GlycoForm will be able to identify released glycans to the level of detail warranted by the evidence and quantify them using either mass spectrometry or fluorescence signals. The software will include both an interactive user interface for expert inspection, and also customized and automated glycosylation reports for sharing and archiving. The initial release of GlycoForm will handle single and tandem mass spectrometry, chromatographic elution time, and glycan-binding experiments; other data channels will be added later in response to customer demand."
"9408193","Evolution of an Adaptable Prosthetic Foot Design for Normalization of Biomechanics  During Community Participation Summary/Abstract The vision of this project is to improve the functional physical mobility of people with lower extremity amputations so that they can more fully and confidently participate in a wider range of activities. This will enhance their personal satisfaction thereby improving their quality of life. People using prostheses have significant mobility disability compared to their potential, partly because commercially available prosthetic feet are unable to meet their day-to-day needs. Also, research has shown a high incidence of falls reported by amputees, often due to the prosthesis or environment. Current prosthetic feet are designed and optimized for level-ground forward walking. Consequently, prosthetists align the prosthetic foot to a single preferred position for this activity. During everyday activities, including quiet standing, feet move about in different positions. When the prosthesis user ambulates around their community, they are faced with many obstacles that do not conform to the level-ground forward walking paradigm. Thus there is a need to fundamentally rethink prosthetic foot design to restore adaptability to body-ground position. The innovative approach pursued in this project is to develop an Adaptable Foot prototype which restores spontaneous adaptability through biomimicry allowing the prosthesis user to ambulate over various terrains. The novel, spontaneously adaptable foot allows a range of alignments relative to the ground during postures and gait. This is achieved by specific linkages that respond to environmental forces with predictable results, moving the center of rotation so that it aligns to the resultant forces. Rather than incorporating compliant surfaces, which can cause postural and gait instability and higher energy cost of gain, the Adaptable Foot restores adaptability without sacrificing stability. During the Phase I effort, the project team will evolve an Adaptable Foot prototype to pass engineering benchmarks that indicate the prototype is ready for extended community use and evaluation. Computer simulation will be used to enhance the design of the existing foot and inform engineering aspects of foot prototypes. Rapid prototyping and conventional prosthetic manufacturing methods will be integrated to create proof of concept foot designs for standardized performance tests and questionnaire feedback. Finally, standardized materials testing devices will provide data on energy return and failure modes."

In this application, we propose a TL1 program that builds upon our previous successes and addresses current unmet needs. The overall program goals are to: 1) Assemble interdisciplinary teams of outstanding mentors who will guide trainees in team science-based translational research and career development, 2) Recruit a highly promising and diverse pool of predoctoral and post-doctoral trainees to take full advantage of Frontiers' TL1 training program and team mentorship, 3) Offer a tailored and rigorous program of clinical and translational research training that provides opportunities for trainees to acquire the skills and experience needed to pursue a research-related career, and 4) Implement a comprehensive evaluation of TL1 trainees, their mentors, and the training program using metrics that encourage coordinated evaluation across CTSA hubs. We propose two training tracks within this TL1 program: 1) a 1-year predoctoral training track for clinical doctoral students (4 positions); 2) a 2-year post-doctoral track for clinician scientists (6 positions). The predoctoral track is designed to help clinical doctoral students start on the clinical translational research (CTR) pathway early in their training while the postdoctoral track is designed to help clinicians procure productive faculty research positions in which they will be able to compete for more advanced training grants or pursue their own independent funding. We have identified a strong pool of candidates for both tracks and will bring these trainees together into a rich, interdisciplinary, supportive learning environment. Our innovative and competency-driven training program will be enhanced by interdisciplinary research experiences within research clusters that are already practicing the principles of team science. Each TL1 trainee's experience will be driven by an Individual Development Plan (IDP), which will delineate specific, achievable scientific and career goals. Each objective is linked to specific research, education, and training activities. Training opportunities include formal coursework, workshops, research experiences, opportunities to interact with experts at other institutions, and other activities designed to deliver what scholars need to know, when they need it, in a manner that is convenient and readily accessible.

"9393598","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of my proposal is to understand the molecular mechanism of calcium-triggered synaptic exocytosis. I will use single-molecule approaches to investigate how Munc18-1, complexin, synaptotagmin, NSF, and ?-SNAP regulate synaptic SNARE assembly and disassembly. SNARE proteins assemble via multiple intermediates to drive fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Key regulatory proteins target these intermediates to activate and/or inhibit SNARE assembly, enabling synaptic exocytosis to be triggered by the calcium influx induced by an action potential. After fusion, NSF and ?-SNAP disassemble the fully assembled SNARE complexes to recycle SNARE proteins, which is required for frequent neuron communication. The precise, rapid SNARE assembly and disassembly is central to calcium-triggered synaptic exocytosis and underlies our thinking, memory, emotions, and actions. Malfunctions in this process cause various neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the mechanism underlying the regulated SNARE assembly and disassembly is poorly understood. We have developed a unique single-molecule manipulation approach based on high-resolution optical tweezers to investigate dynamic SNARE assembly and disassembly. We have identified several intermediates of SNARE assembly and characterized the energies, and kinetics associated with these intermediates as well as the fully assembled SNARE complex for the first time, paving a new road to study SNARE regulation. We will expand our single-molecule approach to address several key questions: (1) What is the essential role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly and disassembly? (2) Whether and how complexin and synaptotagmin activate and/or clamp SNARE assembly in a calcium-dependent manner? (3) How NSF and ?-SNAP recognize and disassemble only the fully assembled SNARE complexes, but not the partially assembled SNARE intermediates essential for membrane fusion? Our research will provide unique insights into the mechanisms of regulated SNARE assembly and disassembly, calcium-triggered exocytosis, and associated diseases."
"9164116","Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this proposal is to investigate the functional roles of Suv420h1 histone methyltransferase and the associated H4K20me3 modification in the regulation of tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. Among the multitude of epigenetic changes, the loss of H4K20me3 is a hallmark of cancer. Reduced levels of H4K20me3 correlate with cancer progression and poor therapeutic response in many human cancers. Although abundant literature suggests that H4K20me3 is associated with tumorigenesis, it remains unknown whether changes in Suv420h1 expression and H4K20me3 modification play a causal role in tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. Recently, I have discovered that MYC actively suppresses Suv420h1 expression to prevent the formation of H4K20me3 and block the induction of senescence. Senescence is known to be is a critical barrier to tumorigenesis as well as a key determinant of therapeutic response. Thus, I hypothesize that Suv420h1 is a critical tumor suppressor in MYC-driven tumorigenesis by modulating gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and driving senescence induction. Consequently, suppression of Suv420h1 and downregulation of H4K20me3 accelerate tumorigenesis and also contribute to therapeutic resistance. In order to causally and mechanistically test this hypothesis, I will integrate multiple genomics technologies to interrogate how Suv420h1 regulates chromatin accessibility and gene expression and further test in vivo using the well-established MYC-driven lymphoma models. I will test three specific aims. AIM 1) Investigate how modulation of Suv420h1 activity influences the gene expression and chromatin accessibility of Eµ-myc lymphoma; AIM 2) Examine in vivo whether modulation of Suv420h1 expression influences tumor initiation in Eµ-myc lymphoma; and AIM 3) Determine whether modulation of Suv420h1 influences therapeutic sensitivity in MYC-driven lymphoma. With the successful implementation of this proposal, I will reveal the critical role of Suv420h1/H4K20me3 in tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. To ensure the success of the proposed studies and my career development, I have assembled an impressive team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in cancer biology, epigenomics, and molecular imaging. The training and the guidance will contribute substantially to my transition to be an independent investigator."
"9227307","Project Summary Prolonged-exposure (PE) therapy is the treatment of choice for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite its efficacy, a significant number of individuals will not benefit from it or might drop out before the completion of all sessions. This underlies the importance of findings ways to enhance the efficacy of PE in order to improve the life quality of individuals suffering from PTSD. It is now widely accepted that extinction learning paradigms used in fundamental studies are useful laboratory analogs to PE. Studies in healthy controls have suggested that elevated estrogen levels benefit extinction learning by promoting its consolidation and thus enhancing its recall when tested later for it. This is also being reflected by changes in the activation of brain regions forming the fear extinction network, including the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). It is still unknown whether estradiol (E2) administration can modulate the activation of the fear extinction network in oral contraceptive (OC) users and which E2 dose could yield the best results. The R61 phase of the current study will aim to establish which of two E2 doses (placebo (Plc), 2mg or 4mg) can best engage the fear extinction network in healthy women using OC by exposing them to a validated fear conditioning and extinction protocol. Functional fMRI (BOLD signal) and psychophysiological measures (skin conductance responses ? SCR) will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1) E2 administration will enhance extinction recall (indexed by lower SCR) in a dose-response manner; 2) E2 administration will increase vmPFC and decrease dACC and amygdala activations during recall in a dose-response manner. Once the optimal E2 dose has been identified, the R33 phase will examine the impact of E2 administration (relative to Plc) in conjunction with 5 PE sessions in OC users women having significant symptoms of PTSD. Participants will be exposed to the fear conditioning and extinction protocol before and after PE. BOLD signal, SCR as well as symptom severity will be used before and after treatment to test these hypotheses: 1) During extinction recall, both groups will show lower SCR at post- relative to pre-PE, with E2+PE group showing the strongest effect. 2) Extinction-induced activations will be higher in the vmPFC and lower in the dACC and amygdala in post relative to pre-PE, with E2+PE group showing the strongest effect. 3) Information flow between the extinction nodes will improve following therapy (indexed by dynamic-causal modeling), with stronger effects in the E2+PE group. 4) PTSD symptom severity will be lower in the E2+PE group relative to the Plc+PE group following treatment, as well as at the 3 and 6-month follow-up assessments. 5) PTSD symptom reduction will correlate with BOLD and SCR changes observed during extinction recall. Our findings will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying effective exposure treatment for fear-based symptoms, and will reveal how E2 could be an adjunct to enhance the efficacy of extinction-based therapies such as PE."
"9531731","PROJECTSUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Yale Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Training Program?directed by Profs. Cynthia Brandt and Michael Krauthammer? is based in the Yale Center for Medical Informatics (YCMI) and other academic units at Yale, reflecting the diversity of Yale?s collaborative Biomedical Informatics research environment. Our training focuses on the following informatics areas: 1) health care/clinical informatics, 2) translational bioinformatics, and 3) clinical research informatics. Active research projects span a broad spectrum, from clinical decision support, to the development of new statistical and bioinformatics approaches in translational genomics, to computational modeling of disease processes. The scope of Biomedical Informatics activities is growing rapidly at Yale, with emerging opportunities in interdisciplinary projects tackling large biomedical data sets. Accordingly, the grant features mentors with expertise in Data Science, a curriculum with an elective focus on Biomedical Data Science, and provides training in interdisciplinary research. Predoctoral training is carried out primarily in Yale?s interdepartmental PhD program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB), which was inaugurated in 2003 and recently accepted its fourteenth class of students. Postdoctoral fellows with a doctoral degree in the health professions or in an area of science other than informatics may enroll in one of two research-oriented graduate programs: studying for an MS or PhD degree in CBB or for a Master of Health Science (MHS) degree in Yale's Clinical Informatics Track. For postdoctoral trainees who already have a doctoral degree in informatics or a closely related field, degree training may not be needed or appropriate. Postdoctoral training involves defining one or two research projects which can be carried out independently, under faculty supervision. Depending on their specific backgrounds and interests, postdoctoral fellows are encouraged to take part in in a variety of other activities, including participation in institutional computing activities in both the clinical and bioscience arenas. The overall goal is to provide all trainees with the necessary background and experience that will allow them to pursue productive academic and research careers in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science. We are requesting support for 9 predoctoral trainees and 6 postdoctoral trainees."
"9364071","PROJECT SUMMARY Distributed health data networks (DHDNs) that leverage electronic health records (EHRs) (e.g., eMerge, pSCANNER, PEDSnet) have drawn substantial interests in recent years, as they a) eliminate the need to create, maintain, and secure access to central data repositories, b) minimize the need to disclose protected health information outside the data-owning entity, and c) mitigate many security, proprietary, legal, and privacy concerns. Missing data are ubiquitous and present analytical challenges in DHDNs. However, very limited research has been conducted to address missing data in such settings. When applying to a distributed environment, the current state-of-the-art approaches for handling missing data require pooling raw data into a central repository before analysis and hence require individual-level data sharing, which may not be feasible for a number of reasons, including institutional policies prohibiting such sharing, high regulatory hurdles, public privacy concerns, and costs/overhead of moving massive amounts of data. A large body of research has demonstrated that given some background information about an individual such as data from EHRs, an adversary can learn (from ?de-identified? data) sensitive information about the individual and improper disclosure of individual-level data may have serious implications. The proposed research will address the challenges associated with handling missing data in distributed analysis and fill a crucial methodology gap. We propose the following specific aims: 1) develop privacy-preserving distributed methods for handling missing data in horizontally partitioned data; 2) develop privacy preserving distributed methods for handling missing data in vertically partitioned data; 3) develop a user-friendly toolkit to allow researchers to handle missing data for distributed analysis in health data networks; and 4) evaluate and validate the methods and tool kit using the UCSD obesity patient data prepared for pSCANNER, and data from PEDSnet in addition to simulated data. The proposed approaches will enable using data across multiple sites and will not require pooling patient-level data into a central repository. They can be scaled up to handle massive amounts of data in DHDNs, because the decomposed computation can be parallelized to all participating parties. The results of our study will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in missing data methodology for DHDNs. The privacy-preserving software toolkit will enable researchers to use more complete data in their research by leveraging information from multiple sites without compromising patient privacy, and help lower regulatory and other hurdles for collaboration across multiple institutions and build the public trust. As such, it will encourage more institutions and healthcare systems to become part of a clinical data research network and more patients to participate in clinical studies, which will improve the validity, robustness and generalizability of research findings and offer substantial benefits in areas including, but not limited to, precision medicine and informatics practice."
"9398462","Abstract The emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) is an ongoing public health concern. The conditions that lead to the emergence of new virus genotypes are poorly understood. In mosquitoes, temperature profoundly impacts virus transmission via replication rate and the likelihood that virus will disseminate from the midgut and ultimately be transmitted. Yet, there is a gap in the literature on the effect that extrinsic incubation (EI) temperature has on virus diversification in the mosquito. Therefore, we plan to study the role that temperature plays in arbovirus evolution during the EI period. First, we will determine the extent to which EI temperature impacts Zika virus (ZIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV) vector competence in Aedes and Culex mosquitoes respectively, and following this use RNA-seq to identify how the consensus genome changes in response to the temperature of EI. Next, we will assess temperature driven single-nucleotide variants and conduct population genetics analysis to determine the extent of the EI temperature?s effect on viral population diversity. This may provide a temperature specific model of viral evolution. Last, we will validate our temperature driven, viral evolution model by comparing it to locally transmitted WNV field isolates. The outcome of these studies will provide insight to arbovirus evolution and potentially be used to predict environmental conditions that may lead to evolution and selection of novel virus genotypes that cause severe outbreaks. Hypothesis: We hypothesis that when arboviruses such as WNV and ZIKV undergo extrinsic incubation in their respective vector, a high temperature of incubation drives viral population diversity, leading to mutant haplotypes being transmitted. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims Aim 1. Determine the extent in which the temperature of extrinsic incubation impacts ZIKV and WNV vector competence in mosquitoes and identify any temperature driven consistent and predictable consensus genome changes. Aim 2. Determine how the temperature of extrinsic incubation influences ZIKV and WNV population diversity within mosquitoes. Aim 3. Characterize the effects of temperature on WNV evolution in Fort Collins from 2013-2017."
"9349365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive functions, and in particular cognitive control functions, contribute to or are affected by numerous psychiatric and neurological conditions. Understanding how brain network dynamics support cognitive control function is crucial for clarifying the basis of resilience to injury and identifying opportunities for substantive advancements in intervention. While network science (e.g., graph theory) has led to enlightenment in the organization of the brain and basis of human cognition, elucidating translational implications requires an explicit focus. I propose to do so. I aim to apply recent innovations in dynamic network analysis (recent extensions of graph theory) and network control theory in neuroimaging data to examine the basis of cognitive control function in health and dysfunction in stroke. The program integrates approaches from cognitive neuroscience, network science, and control theory. The goal is to produce a theoretical advance in the use of noninvasive brain stimulation treatments for cognitive dysfunction. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) Quantify structural and dynamic brain network properties underlying cognitive control function in health and dysfunction following stroke 2) Use network control theory to intervene in brain networks that support cognitive control There are two main components of this project: (1) the analysis of network structure and function underlying adaptive cognitive control and (2) the use of network control theory applied to diffusion tractography data to (a) discriminate between network mechanisms of cognitive control and (b) facilitate cognitive control recovery in individuals that have suffered from stroke. This would provide a substantial advance in our knowledge of how cognitive control processes exert their influences across brain networks. While some research has begun to emerge in this area, I propose to use state of the art techniques within dynamic network analysis in conjunction with well-validated behavioral measures. This will serve as an important benchmark for work outside of the current application. It will also begin to characterize reference states underlying adaptive task performance that will be used to guide later control theory-based approaches to brain stimulation. Here, network control theory will be used to target noninvasive brain stimulation on an individual basis. This could lead to a substantive advance in our understanding of the variance in responsiveness to noninvasive brain stimulation and lead to a control theory based framework for intervention in cognitive control dysfunction. More broadly, the outcome this work will provide a step toward true integration between network neuroscience and systems engineering-based translation in neurological and psychiatric populations. These fields are developing rapidly, but an explicit focus on cognition and integration with the physical sciences will be required to conceptualize potent opportunities for intervention. This project offers the first opportunity to establish this intersection and promote a new interdisciplinary conversation between the fields represented."
"9388795","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 3 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex condition characterized by important changes to the brain and behavior. 15% of boys with ASD have disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM), or enlarged brain relative to body size. An increase in brain size often precedes the first clinical signs of the disorder, suggesting that understanding the mechanisms leading to brain overgrowth could provide a window of opportunity to intervene and possibly prevent disease onset. Here, the research team will use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology to model ASD-DM and investigate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. They will obtain skin fibroblasts from 40 individuals in Project 2 and derive human iPSCs from: A) 10 ASD subjects with megalencephaly, ASD-DM; B) 10 ASD subjects with normal sized brains, ASD-N C) 10 Typically developing (TD) subjects with megalencephaly, TD-DM, and D) 10 TD subjects with normal sized brains, TD-N. Following iPSC generation, they will differentiate each of the iPSC lines into neural progenitor cells (NPCs), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and microglia (the primary immune cells in the brain that maintain homeostasis). The overarching goals of their project are two-fold: 1) to investigate whether ASD-DM is due to an increase in cell proliferation, increase in cell survival, improper elimination of damaged cells, and/or a combination of all; and 2) to identify therapeutic targets by understanding the underlying cellular and signaling mechanisms involved. In Specific Aim 1, they will identify the cellular mechanisms underlying ASD-DM by investigating changes in the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis of iPSC-derived NPCs, OPCs, and microglial cells. In Specific Aim 2, they will investigate the functional activity of microglia in ASD-DM by directly differentiating each of the iPSC lines into microglia and assessing their phagocytic capacity by co-culturing them with mixed neuroglial cultures derived from the same lines. This will test their hypothesis that microglia are compromised in ASD-DM, failing to eliminate damaged cells and synapses and contributing to brain overgrowth. In Specific Aim 3, they will identify the underlying regulatory signaling mechanisms that lead to the changes at the cellular level. They will differentiate the iPSCs into NPCs, OPCs, and microglia, sort them by flow cytometry using antibodies specific for each cell type, and perform RNA-sequencing to identify gene networks and signaling mechanisms that are significantly regulated in each condition. Using these mechanistic insights, they will identify therapeutic targets to directly test in the in vitro models. Their overall goal across the projects is to collect imaging, behavioral, and mechanistic data on the same cohort of subjects. In Specific Aim 4, they will correlate the cellular and mechanistic data obtained in Project 3 with the imaging and behavioral data from Project 2 to identify broader trends and characteristics specific to ASD-DM. This comprehensive body of data will be a valuable resource for the broader research and medical communities in identifying predictive biomarkers of ASD and/or ASD-DM and potentially more tailored therapies."
"9338312","Approximately 85% of individuals with Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type I, II, or VI report weekly pain and  50-60% have significant limitations in their activities of daily living due to MPS related musculoskeletal  disease despite treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thus there is a critical need to identify  additional therapies to alleviate the burden of musculoskeletal disease in order to improve the health and  quality of life of individuals with MPS. However, disease progression needs to be quantified to be able to  determine efficacy of new therpies. The proposed study is a multi-institutional, 5-year, longitudinal study of  musculoskeletal disease in MPS. The long-term goal is to identify and test new therapies for  musculoskeletal disease in MPS. The objective of this proposed study is to quantitatively describe the  progression of skeletal disease and identify biomarkers that either predict disease severity or could be used  as therapeutic targets in individuals with MPS I, II, and VI. Our central hypothesis is that skeletal disease will  progress over time and that biomarkers of inflammation, and bone and cartilage turnover, will predict the  severity of skeletal disease over time. Specific aims are 1) to characterize the progression of skeletal  disease from childhood into young adulthood and 2) to identify prognostic biomarkers of inflammation, bone  remodeling, and cartilage turnover that can predict the progression of skeletal disease and impaired physical  function. To achieve these aims, participants will be evaluated annually with measures of bone health (dualenery  x-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computer tomography, hip and spine x-rays), physical  function (muscle strength by Biodex and hand grip dynamometer, range of motion testing, and  questionnaires of physical function and pain), and laboratory measurements of biomarkers of bone turnover,  cartilage breakdown, and inflammation. A database of standardized measurements of musculoskeletal  disease in MPS will allow the field to efficiently move forward with therapeutic clinical trials in patients with  MPS."
"9329995","Project Summary/Abstract  The nervous system comprises an immense number of diverse cell types organized into defined neural circuits. Defects in neural wiring are associated with numerous neurological disorders, thus investigating the basis for normal circuit formation is critical for understanding how these disorders arise.  To form properly wired circuits, neurons must be able to discriminate between correct and incorrect potential partners. To achieve this, neurons express membrane-bound cell adhesion molecules, which serve as molecular signatures and promote recognition between partners. However, given the tremendous number of possible synaptic partners, mechanisms must be in place to diversify the repertoire of molecules available to a neuron. Furthermore, given that dendrites and axons navigate an incredibly dense neural environment, mechanisms must be used both to promote synaptic connections between partners and to prevent connections between inappropriate partners.  My studies of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 2 (Dscam2) in Drosophila somatosensory circuitry have potential to shed light on these challenges to synaptic specificity. Dscam2 encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms, Dscam2A and Dscam2B, and my results suggest that isoform diversity is critical for somatosensory circuit development. Dscam2 isoforms have been previously shown to bind homophilically to mediate repulsion between neural processes. Thus, Dscam2 isoforms could prevent or permit synaptic connections, based on cell type specific alternative splicing. I propose to determine the role of Dscam2 in patterning somatosensory axons, and central synaptic target dendrites, and to determine the role of isoform diversity in somatosensory circuit assembly and somatosensory-evoked behaviors."
"9388813","PROJECT ABSTRACT Research shows that a stable diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be made by trained professionals at 18-24 months2,3 and yet the median age of diagnosis in the US is 4-5 years of age5. Lower income, minority, and rural families receive a diagnosis up to 1.5 years later6,7 and more likely miss the window of opportunity for early intervention (EI). One of the greatest challenges we face, in spite of scientific advances and investments, is how to bridge the healthcare science-to-service gap and address health disparities in access to evidence-based EI for children with ASD. Doing this would be the best solution to improve lifelong outcomes, reduce costs to society, and change the landscape of autism. In response to RFA-MH-17-008, the Autism ACTION Network?a new interdisciplinary network of 8 institutions?will blend clinical effectiveness and implementation research designs to study individual and combined effects of 2 evidence-based interventions in real world settings: 1) engage families to access resources and support when they first learn their child has signs of ASD using an evidence-based intervention8 that integrates motivational interviewing and problem- solving education (MI+PSE); and 2) coach families to embed evidence-based intervention strategies for toddlers with ASD in everyday activities using the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model9. Building on existing infrastructure, we will infuse mobile technology using the Autism Navigator® collection of web-based courses and tools. Families will be recruited by screening in community-based primary care and EI systems in 3 diverse regions in 2 states: Florida and Massachusetts. In Phase 1, we will compare the effectiveness of adaptive interventions that use MI+PSE with and without ESI in a 2-stage Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design on family engagement in EI, parent use of intervention strategies in everyday activities, and child outcomes of social communication, active engagement, autism symptoms, developmental level, and adaptive behavior. In Phase 2, we will construct an adaptive intervention to optimize the effects of MI+PSE with ESI based on the SMART and study the feasibility of implementation in two new service systems in California--Kaiser Permanente Healthcare System and the National Black Church Initiative. This network brings a unique interdisciplinary team with expertise spanning early detection, maternal mental health, clinical trials, health disparities, implementation science, and policy. Our dynamic technology platform has ambitious dissemination aims of informing a community of change agents committed to impact at the population level. This research network can build the capacity of community-based systems to provide earlier and widespread access to cost-efficient, community-viable treatment and be ready for immediate and rapid implementation across the US. Findings will advance science by providing researchers with a method for rapidly deploying evidence-based practices, enabling research at younger ages?accelerating genetic, neuroscience, and intervention research?and lead to transformative changes in workforce development and healthcare delivery."
"9546379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological Fe-S clusters are nanoparticles containing 2-8 Fe atoms that are held together primarily by bridging S atoms. Proteins that contain Fe-S clusters serve a wide variety of essential tasks in living systems, including catalysis of chemical reactions, sensing the chemical environment, signaling to and repair of DNA, and the maintenance of molecular structure. Our main goals for this proposal center on four key questions:      How do Fe-S clusters react with small molecules? How do they catalyze reactions, how do they work as nitric oxide and oxygen sensors, and what happens when they decompose?     What are the steps in assembly of the hydrogenase active site `H-cluster'?     How does the larger protein environment affect access of small molecules to Fe-S sites?     How does chemistry at an Fe-S cluster affect tertiary protein structure and interactions with DNA?     The expected outcomes from our research include:     Information about the catalytic intermediates of enzymes that fix nitrogen (nitrogenase) or produce hydrogen (hydrogenase)     Information about reaction intermediates when Fe-S cluster proteins react with signaling molecules NO and O2, and changes that occur as the cluster sensor transduces the signal to affect DNA     Information about side chain contributions and gas channels in gas-processing enzymes that process or are inhibited by small molecules such as N2, O2, CO, and NO.     The approach to gain this information is spectroscopy.     Using photolysis/FT-IR, NRVS, and resonance Raman spectroscopy, this work will characterize how  nitrogenase (N2ase) binds the inhibitor CO, as well as the structures of its complex with N2 and  more reduced intermediates, elucidate when and how hydrides bound at the active sites of the  hydrogenases (H2ases),     Using time-resolved spectroscopies on a variety of time-scales, we aim to define intermediates and final products for reactions of NO and O2 with [4Fe-4S] clusters in various proteins, including the  `WhiB' proteins from the tuberculosis-causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis.     We will develop a new technique. 61Ni synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy, that should have broad applications to Ni enzymes and to chemistry in general."
"9544516","Project Summary: The proposed University of Utah School of Medicine (UUSM) Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC) brings together 22 investigators whose research activities are focused on various aspects of iron and heme metabolism and non-malignant hematology. Iron plays an essential role in many biological processes including heme synthesis, oxygen transport, cellular respiration and DNA synthesis. Malregulation of iron homeostasis, either from deficiency or excess, results in disease. Heme is a key component of hemoglobin and other hemoproteins, but heme also plays a regulatory role in a number of metabolic pathways. Disorders of heme biosynthesis are responsible for an important group of human diseases, namely the porphyrias. The proposed Utah Center for Iron and Heme Disorders (CIHD) will support the activities of 22 investigators whose research projects focus on the roles of iron, porphyrins and heme in eukaryotic metabolism. The activities of center members encompass both basic and clinical studies designed to identify disease mechanisms. To accomplish our goals, we propose to provide an Administrative Core and four Biomedical Research Cores. The majority of the cores are already present and have been adjusted to the needs of the CIHD. These include: a Mutation Generation and Detection Core, which provides cutting edge genome editing through CRISPR and TALEN reagents; a Zebrafish Core, in which conditions have been optimized to generate zebrafish with engineered genomes for both gene discovery and genetic and chemical screens; a Metabolomics Core, which provides metabolomic phenotyping and molecular identification; and an Iron and Heme Core, which can assay and quantitate metals, porphyrins, heme biosynthetic enzymes and iron-binding and other proteins. The services provided by these cores will enable individual investigators to: 1) identify the role of genes in hematopoiesis or iron overload; 2) determine the effects of gene modification or mutations on metabolism in cultured cells or biological fluids; and 3) identify on a biochemical level the effect of mutations or treatments on heme synthesis on levels ranging from gene to protein to products. The Administrative Core will provide budgetary and scientific guidance to CIHD activities. Core recharge fees will be used to enhance and expand Core operations. The Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) and Enrichment Programs are designed for trainees and young investigators in the fields of nonmalignant hematology and for senior investigators who wish to enter this field. The 22 members of the CIHD are drawn from both the University of Utah and other institutions, with half of the members belonging to institutions outside of Utah. The goals of the CIHD are to be a national resource for studies involving iron and heme and to inspire the next generation of investigators focused on iron, heme and nonmalignant hematology."
"9340289","Project Summary Down Syndrome (DS) model mice have three abnormalities in synaptic functions that can explain the cognitive deficits in DS: Decreased long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhanced long- term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic synapses, as well as enhanced inhibitory transmission at GABAergic synapses. Our recent published work indicates that all three observed synaptic dysfunction should be caused by the hyper-phosphorylation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) seen in DS mice. Our recent unpublished work indicates an intriguing possible mechanism for the cause of CaMKII hyper-phosphorylation in the DS mice. Importantly, this mechanism could also be targeted by pharmacological intervention.  As a proof of principle, this project will focus on two aspects of the overall question: (Aim 1) Testing the underlying cause for CaMKII hyper-phosphorylation in DS mice (using a new mutant mouse line that has been generated in the lab and that is incompetent for the proposed underlying mechanism); (Aim 2) Restoration of normal LTP by genetic reversal of T305/306 hyper-phosphorylation in DS mice (using a CaMKII T305/306AV mutant mouse line currently available to the lab).  Future studies will test restoration of the other synaptic dysfunctions in DS, restoration of cognitive behavioral tasks, and restoration also by pharmacological means.  Notably, while it may seem preposterous to propose a reversal of cognitive impairments in a very complex syndrome by a rather simple intervention, there is actually prior precedent for success: In a model of a different genetic condition that causes cognitive impairments, Angelman Syndrome (AS), CaMKII is also hyper-phosphorylated, and even heterozygous T305/306AV mutation was sufficient to restore both normal LTP and spatial learning. In contrast to AS, the hyper-phosphorylation of CaMKII in DS could be targeted also pharmacologically (if our hypothesized underlying mechanism is correct). Thus, this project will not only provide significant further insight into the mechanism underlying normal synaptic functions and their impairments in DS, but also has tremendous potential for directly opening a new therapeutic avenue for restoring cognitive functions in patients with DS."

"9338317","This gangliosidosis project will include two studies: 1) Continuation of LDN6713 Natural History of  Hexosaminidase Deficiencies and Other Gangliosidoses for patients of all ages with a gangliosidosis  disease; 2) Syner-G treatment regimen (synergistic enteral regimen for the gangliosidoses) for patients with  infantile or juvenile forms of the gangliosidoses. Pediatric patients may simutaneously participate in both  studies. The Syner-G regimen is a combination, multi-targeted combination therapy for treatment of the  gangliosidoses, using FDA approved therapies that have demonstrated safety in children: miglustat,  ketogenic diet to minimize gastrointestinal side effects of miglustat and optimize seizure management, and  pyrimethamine for patients with mutations responsive to pyrimethamine. The infantile and juvenile forms of  gangliosidosis are lethal during childhood. This gangliosidosis project provides a method for systematically  gathering serial prospective, retrospective and natural history clinical data, including data on treatments tried  by the patient. The ability to participate in the Syner-G treatment protocol, or other clinical treatment trials  that may become available, allows for participation of patients who may otherwise be excluded from a  natural history study.  Specific Aim 1: To characterize and describe disease progression and heterogeneity in the gangliosidosis  disorders. This natural history study (LDN 6713) seeks to develop quantitative methods to delineate disease  progression for the gangliosidosis disorders (Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, and GM1-gangliosidosis diseases) to  better understand the natural history and heterogeneity of disease. Such quantitative methods will also be  essential for evaluating any treatments that may become available in the future, such as gene therapy.  Specific Aim 2: We hypothesize that a combination, multi-targeted therapy for pediatric gangliosidoses, using  miglustat with the ketogenic diet?and pyrimethamine for patients with responsive mutations?will create  synergisms that improve neurodevelopmental outcomes of therapy compared to data reported in previous  natural history studies, and previous studies using monotherapy with miglustat."
"9393553","Project Summary/Abstract: The goal of the project proposed in this application is to replace retinal neurons that are lost to disease or injury with new neurons by stimulating the resident glial cells of the retina, the Müller glia (MG), to undergo neurogenesis. Diseases ranging from glaucoma, macular degeneration, and Retinitis Pigmentosa, destroy various neuronal populations in the retina and result in visual impairment or blindness for millions of people around the world. Sight is arguably the most important sense humans possess, and there are currently only very limited clinical options to restore vision once the cells in the retina have degenerated. Amazingly, many non-mammalian species have the ability to regenerate their retinal neurons from MG and restore visual function after damage. Recent discoveries elucidating the mechanisms by which these species repair their retinas have led to my proposed project to reproduce MG-mediated retinal regeneration in mice. Generating immature retinal neurons from MG has recently been achieved in young mice using transgenic MG directed expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1. In my preliminary studies, I have found that the combination of MG-specific Ascl1 expression and the addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor enables MG to generate new neurons in a damaged adult mouse retina. This exciting finding now opens the way for many additional studies to investigate the long-term viability and functionality of the regenerated neurons. The following three proposed Aims will 1) determine whether the MG-derived neurons are stable for longer periods of time, 2) determine if they retain some of their glial characteristics, and 3) determine if there are methods for more effectively maturing these MG-derived neurons. Using state-of-the-art imaging techniques, such as super-resolution Zeiss Airyscan confocal microscopy, and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy I will address the extent to which the MG-derived neurons achieve mature neuronal morphology and connectivity. Using whole-cell electrophysiology and measuring the MG-derived neuron's response to light will address neuronal functionality and maturity. Lastly, using single-cell mRNA-sequencing on FACS-purified MG-derived neurons will address the extent to which the MG-derived neurons develop a pattern of gene expression similar to known mature retinal cell neuronal types, or whether they retain some degree of glial gene expression. By utilizing these techniques to characterize the neuronal state of the cells, the experimental paradigm can then be modified, as described in the Research Strategy, to determine if MG-derived neurons can be driven to a more mature state. The proposed study highlights and expands upon the only known protocol for generating new neurons in the adult mammalian retina, and presents a unique opportunity to expand the field of regenerative medicine and push it closer to a potential clinical therapy."
"9409573","Project Summary  Highly successful prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs have reduced the number of infants acquiring HIV from their mothers. In 2013 there were 1.3 million women living with HIV who gave birth to 199,000 HIV-infected and approximately 1 million HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants. In South Africa, where a 30% infection rate is reported among pregnant women at antenatal clinics, the HIV epidemic continues to be a significant public health burden on women and children. Maternal HIV infection may disrupt normal development of the infant gut microbiome, affecting the development of the immune system and contributing to the higher morbidity and mortality of HEU infants. In addition, since microbiota influence communication between the gut and the brain, changes in the infant gut microbiota related to maternal HIV infection may help to explain the delayed neurodevelopment sometimes observed in HEU infants.  This proposal builds on the infrastructure and data of a recently funded study designed to measure the effects of in utero and perinatal exposure to ART and HIV on the developing infant brain. The existing study follows 210 infants, 140 HEU and 70 HU. At 38 to 41 weeks gestational age (GA), the infants will undergo neuroimaging, including structural imaging for brain morphometry, diffusion for brain connectivity, and spectroscopy for brain metabolism, and neurodevelopmental assessments at 9 and 19 months of age.  This proposal seeks to expand the current study, adding an additional neuroimaging time point (at 12 months), infant gut and maternal breast milk microbiome measures and breast milk oligosaccharide composition. We will acquire infant gut microbiome samples at 5-7 days, 3 and 12 months. In addition, breast milk samples will be acquired at 5-7 days and 3 months for microbiome analysis, and human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) composition analysis at the first two time points. We hypothesize that abnormalities identified in neuroimaging measures in HEU infants will be related to reduced gut microbiome diversity. The goals of this study are to describe the maturation of the infant brain and gut microbiome composition, and to examine the relationship between maternal breast milk HMO and microbiome composition, gut microbiome diversity and neuroimaging measures. We seek to identify differences related to maternal HIV-infection that will provide insight into increased risks of HEU infants and reveal potential areas for targeted intervention to improve health and neurodevelopmental outcomes.  This project extends the existing collaboration between Drs van der Kouwe (Massachusetts General Hospital), Meintjes (University of Cape Town (UCT)) and Laughton (Stellenbosch University), to include Dr. Lars Bode from University of San Diego who is an expert in HMO composition, as well as three UCT-based early stage investigators, Drs Holmes, Kaba and Robertson. The study aims to expand and strengthen local capacity and interdisciplinary collaboration focused on locally relevant health problems."
"9225296","The rate of heroin-related overdose deaths more than tripled in the United States during 2010-2014. The mediating mechanisms underlying this increase are unknown. The recent surge in heroin-related overdose deaths was preceded by a quadrupling in prescription opioid-related overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010. Evidence suggests that non-medical use of prescription opioids is a risk factor for heroin initiation. Some have hypothesized that efforts to prevent non-medical opioid use and opioid overdose resulted in decreases in prescription opioid supply that led individuals to substitute heroin. However, analyses to date have relied on population-level trends, rather than individual-level changes in opioid exposure, and have not demonstrated a conclusive relationship.  Opioid prescribing guidelines and a number of initiatives and programs have targeted patients prescribed high dosages of opioids, given evidence demonstrating an association between high opioid dosage and risk of overdose. Specifically, several programs focus on tapering individuals receiving high dosages to mitigate risk. However, the outcomes of such tapering programs are poorly understood.  The purpose of this study is to understand if patients who are tapered from high dosages of opioids are experiencing heroin-related overdoses in greater numbers than expected, and if so, why this transition to heroin use occurs. Analysis of OptumInsight medical claims records for ~58 million Americans during 2001 to 2015, representing all 50 states, will be complemented by qualitative interviews of several patient groups (surgical and pain clinic patients in a large regional health system, and Veterans in primary care) experiencing a prescription opioid taper. The specific aims are:  Aim 1. To describe trajectories of opioid prescribing histories prior to heroin overdose events among patients included in a national sample based on medical claims data.  Aim 2. To examine the association of opioid prescribing history as well as patient and other treatment characteristics with heroin overdoses and to examine the time during and after an opioid dosage taper or discontinuation as high risk for adverse heroin-related events in a national sample of medical claims data.  Aim 3. To understand patients' contemplation of, attitudes towards, and potential motivation for (e.g., opioid withdrawal or craving vs. pain relief), heroin use after a prescription opioid dosage reduction or discontinuation based on qualitative interviews.  This study will have a secondary aim of studying other potential intended and unintended outcomes of reduced opioid access, including prescription opioid overdose, suicidality, and use of other medications. This study will lead to new knowledge that will aid efforts to identify those patients at greatest risk for heroin overdose."
"9558162","DESCRIPTION:    The overall goal of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center (IDG KMC) is to evaluate and organize (via the Data Organizing Core, DOC), present and visualize (via the User Interface Portal, UIP) and rank (in cooperation with the IDG Consortium) all prospective disease-linked proteins, as potential druggable targets for four protein superfamilies: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), nuclear receptors (NRs), ion channels (IC) and kinases. By combining data extracted from multiple sources, coupled with algorithmic processing, prediction and human curation, the emerging knowledge will be associated with the appropriate proteins. The KMC will link disease, pathway, protein, gene, chemical, bioactivity, drug discovery and clinical information elements from databases, literature, patents and other documents in the DOC Target Central Resource Database. TCRD will serve as primary source for the IDG Query Platform, the UlP-developed system that will enable scientists to access, visualize and analyze IDG-specific data.  Coordinating DOC and UIP activities, the Administrative Core, AC, will assist with human curation by organizing class-specific External Target Panels to categorize proteins into 4 classes (Tclin - clinical; Tchem    - manipulated by chemicals; Tmacro - manipulated by macromolecules; and Tdark - the genomic dark    matter). Tissue and cellular localization for both disease and protein will serve as central filtes for ranking.  The specific aims of the KMC are based on the demonstrated experience of the Oprea-Sklar team at the University of New Mexico (data capture, processing, mining and modeling), and the Simeonov-led team at NCATS (software development, visualization and modeling), supported by teams based in Denmark, Florida and UK. Using automated tools, we performed disease-protein associations for each protein superfamily, obtained preliminary stratification (e.g., Tclin 22%, Tdark 30%), and designed Specific Aims that enable us to further annotate this genome subset. It is expected that within 12 months, the TCRD-based IDG Querly Platform will be operational, which may dramatically improve the target prioritization process for the research community at large and the IDG Consortium, in exploring dark matter for GPCRs, NRs, ICs and kinases."
"9388748","SUMMARY The Clinical Characterization Core (CC Core) has been carefully designed to support the science proposed in the five individual Projects while also advancing the ACE Center?s integrative mission: utilizing interdisciplinary approaches to answer critical questions about underlying mechanisms and biological pathways implicated in the expression of ASD-related symptoms across developmental epochs spanning fetal and neonatal, infant and toddler, as well as school aged periods. The overarching purpose of the CC Core is to provide the recruitment and scheduling infrastructure across all five ACE Projects, as well as comprehensive clinical characterization for all participants. The CC core draws on a highly trained group of clinicians and support staff who have extensive knowledge and long-standing experience working with individuals with ASD and their families. Centralizing the recruitment, scheduling, and clinical characterization efforts across Projects will ensure cost effectiveness, while capitalizing on expert clinical and technical skills. The CC Core will perform, assist, train, and support the implementation of a comprehensive set of characterization procedures. Moreover, the CC Core will train both pre and post-doctoral fellows. Clinical staff will consult as well as assist Project personnel in evidenced based strategies to use while working with children with ASD in order to increase the success rate of participant completion during experimental procedures. The Core?s objectives include: (1) supporting the various projects in executing highly complex daily operational and organizational tasks including recruitment and scheduling; (2) promoting synergy across projects via facilitation of enrollment in all eligible studies; (3) providing well-characterized cohorts of participants to the various project areas at the highest possible level of expertise, validity, and reliability; (4) maintaining reliability and validity, as well as other standards of clinical care, education, and training; (5) making available behavioral, diagnostic, and psychometric expertise to all Core users; (6) making data readily available to other investigators and to comply with NDAR requests. Via advancing these objectives, we will ensure cost effectiveness and quality control is maximized."
"9348666","Although voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) have been studied extensively for their roles in neurons, heart, and hormone-secreting cells, the especially broad array of abnormalities in Timothy syndrome (TS) implies unexpected roles for VGCCs during development. TS is due to a gain-of-function mutation in CACNA1C, the gene encoding the pore-forming ?1C subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel CaV1.2. Intense focus on TS has centered on how the mutant channels lead to cardiac arrhythmias or autism, but almost no studies have examined CaV1.2 contributions to accompanying phenotypes such as syndactyly. Unraveling these CaV1.2 contributions will be fruitful, since these TS phenotypes include multiple common birth defects, implying that dysfunctional CaV1.2 signaling generally is a frequent cause of developmental abnormalities. Moreover, the consequences of dysfunctional CaV1.2 in birth defects demonstrates that CaV1.2 has important, but understudied roles in normal development. Here we propose three Aims: 1: Test the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through TS mutant CaV1.2 affects interdigital apoptosis; 2: Test the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 controls bone development; and 3: Test the hypothesis that the developing mouse limb displays electrical signaling properties that regulate CaV1.2.  To complete these aims, we have generated various knockin, knockout, and tissue-specific gain-of-function and loss-of-function mouse models, with which we obtained preliminary data demonstrating roles for CaV1.2 within the developing limb and within developing bone. Further, we have developed methods that build upon multiple technologies to permit live Ca2+ imaging in ex vivo limb cultures isolated from mouse embryos. These methods will provide an unprecedented characterization of parameters such as properties of spontaneous and evoked Ca2+ transients, resting membrane potential, dynamic changes in membrane potential, action potentials, and VGCC currents in developing limbs.  Successful completion of these Aims will define novel roles for CaV1.2 in the development of tissues other than brain, heart, and endocrine tissue, thereby revealing mechanisms for many of the unexplained TS phenotypes. Because CaV1.2 anchors a large molecular complex, these studies will serve as a platform for future investigation of the roles of CaV1.2-associated proteins and their downstream signaling partners in development and whether their dysfunction also contributes to birth defects. The availability of clinically used agents that target CaV1.2 offers the opportunity to exploit the knowledge gained from the proposed experiments for new treatment paradigms."
"9389961","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative therapy for many patients with hematologic malignancies and marrow failure states. Key obstacles to the success of HSCT include collecting optimal numbers of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) capable of multilineage and durable engraftment, control of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and treating disease recurrence both before and especially after HSCT. I have focused my career over the last 20 years on overcoming these three obstacles to HSCT through the use of a bench-to-bedside and back again research approach. My research program over the next seven years will use our strengths in preclinical modeling, cancer genomics and the design and execution of early phase clinical trials to (1) develop novel methods to target the hematopoietic niche for optimal HSPC mobilization and chemosensitization of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) target the interferon gamma receptor (IFN?R) and IL-6R signaling pathways via use of selective and balanced JAK1/2 inhibitors to mitigate GvHD while maintaining graft vs. leukemia (GvL) after allo-HSCT, and (3) design and test novel AML and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) immunotherapeutics. Successful HSCT requires the infusion of a sufficient number of HSPCs that are capable of homing to the bone marrow cavity and regenerating durable trilineage hematopoiesis in a timely fashion. In our first research area, we will use new strategies to enhance HSPC mobilization and leukemia chemosensitization via targeted modulation of the CXCR4/CXCL12, VLA-4/VCAM-1 and/or CXCR2/Gro-? axes. Managing the threat of GvHD while maximizing the beneficial GvL effect would broaden the scope and usefulness of allo-HSCT. In our second major research area we will perform preclinical and clinical studies to determine if targeting IFN?R, IL-6R, and/or JAK1/JAK2 can mitigate GvHD while maintaining GvL after T cell replete allo-HSCT. Finally, since many patients with AML die from progressive disease after relapse, our third research area will develop and translate into early phase clinical trials novel bi- and tri-specific monoclonal antibody reagents for the treatment of AML relapse before and after HSCT. We will complete ?first-in-man? phase I clinical trials of MGD006, a CD123xCD3 Dual Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) bispecific antibody-based molecule and AMV564, a CD33xCD3 Tandem Diabody, in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. While these trials are ongoing we are identifying novel targets for immunotherapy in AML and testing the efficacy of new retargeting agents that engage either T cells, NK cells or other immune effector cells to kill AML blasts expressing CD123, CD33, or the novel targets. Finally, since no targeted therapies currently exist for T-ALL, we are developing allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) to CD7, a T and NK cell marker that is highly expressed in T cell malignancies and in up to 40% of AML cases. To prevent normal T cell fratricide and alloreactivity, we are using the CRISPR/Cas-9 system to delete CD7 and the TCR? chain from donor T cells prior to transduction with the CD7 CAR."

"9376872","Project Summary Falling costs of generating genomic data and computational advances in discerning health-affecting variants therein are bringing personalized molecular medicine closer to reality. Progress has also been made on establishing guidelines (e.g., by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics) for the interpretation of sequence variants. However, the crucial step of systematically and accurately interpreting their clinical implications remains an unsolved problem. Specifically, clinical interpretation is technically challenging for several reasons, including: 1) the enormous number of variants in individual genomes, making it difficult to pinpoint causal variants, 2) limited functional/clinical data at the gene and variant levels, 3) discovery of novel clinical variants is a tedious low-throughput process using traditional laboratory and clinical approaches, and 4) conventional bioinformatics tools tend to have insufficient precision based on limitations imposed by linear sequence analysis alone. As a result, clinical genomics is still far too costly for routine clinical use. To meet the urgent need of high precision clinical variant interpretation, our proposal aims to 1) build upon existing clinical knowledge (ClinVar) from ClinGen efforts, 2) utilize rich human variation data in public databases (e.g., ExAC and dbSNP), and 3) leverage existing and upcoming sequencing data from large disease cohorts and small family studies; all to support developing/employing a cross-cutting computational/experimental strategy for clinical variant discovery at a massive scale across a broad spectrum of human diseases. We hypothesize that variants clustering in 3D spatial proximity to known pathogenic variants have high probabilities of affecting protein function. We hypothesize further that many pathogenic variants in databases such as ExAC remain undetected/hidden due to their recessive nature or their rarity that limits statistical power for detection in association analyses. To test these hypotheses and to establish a database for functionally important variants associated with human diseases, we propose to develop a software system called ClinPath3D to detect and characterize clinically relevant pathogenic variants. Essentially, it will utilize protein structures and variant pathogenicity potential to identify 3D spatial pathogenic variant clusters (PVCs) (Aim 1). We will then apply ClinPath3D to interpret rare variants of unknown significance (VUS) from the ExAC, dbSNP, and other variant databases using pathogenic variants obtained from ClinVar as nucleation points for clustering, all with a view toward discerning disease variants in the general population (Aim 2). Finally, we will use large sequencing data sets (CCDG, TopMed, UK100K) to statistically assess variant enrichment in specific disease cohorts and will further improve positive results by experimentally characterizing 50-100 high-priority variants in kinases and 50-100 in transcription factors (Aim 3). Results from these studies will contribute to clinical advancement in two key ways: (1) methodological improvement of identifying pathogenic/functional variants in patient genomes and (2) the building of a comprehensive database of clinically relevant variants across a broad spectrum of disease types."
"9385425","Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP ?learns? complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods."
"9356343","Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded aggregated proteins in neurons. Since neurons are permanently postmitotic, efficient intracellular protein degradation systems are critically important for normal neuronal function. Recent evidence suggests that disruption of lysosomal degradation pathways directly contributes to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. We have previously shown that loss of function of lysosomal ATPase PARK9 (ATP13A2) leads to zinc dyshomeostasis, lysosomal dysfunction and a-syn accumulation. In addition, we and other found that PARK9 localizes to multivesicular endosomes and regulates exosome biogenesis. Here, we propose to further analyze the physiological role of PARK9 in generation and secretion of exosomes and how loss of PARK9 function contributes to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. First, we will test the hypothesis that PARK9 plays an important role in the formation of intraluminal vesicles by recruitment of zinc-dependent FYVE proteins to early endosomes. Second, we will examine if a-syn secretion via exosomes and lysosomal exocytosis contributes to PARK9-mediated neuronal dysfunction. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that PARK9 is protective in synucleinopathies by overexpressing PARK9 in mouse models that accumulate a-synuclein. We will also examine propagation of a-synuclein in PARK9 knockout and transgenic mice. These findings will also provide further mechanistic insights into PARK9 loss of function in the context of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome as well as more general forms of syncleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in terms of cell- to-cell transmission of a-syn that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders."
"9237757","Project Summary/Abstract: Biodegradable Matrices for Bone Healing More than 6.5 million orthopaedic procedures require the use of grafts to repair bone defects every year in the US alone. Repair of large bone defects is a challenging problem in reconstructive surgery. Several bone graft options including autografts, allografts, and biodegradable porous scaffolds have been routinely used in the clinics with limited success. For example, tissue ingrowth is limited to the surface in bone tissue engineering scaffolds (BTE) because of poor access to cells and nutrients within scaffolds. The porosity that is necessary to support tissue ingrowth in BTE scaffolds results in sub-optimal mechanical properties of these materials for orthopedic applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop BTE scaffolds which will fulfill the requirements of both porosity necessary for tissue ingrowth and vascularization, and optimal mechanical properties necessary for load bearing. In addition, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteointegrative properties will improve the success of bone graft materials. Our ongoing studies and publications have demonstrated the feasibility of developing mechanically strong non-porous composite scaffolds from materials with differential degradation profiles that result in the progressive formation of interconnected pores within the composite material allowing tissue ingrowth over a period of time (1, 2). Likewise, using spirally structured scaffolds we have shown that geometry can be designed to promote cell proliferation, infiltration, and homogenous mineralized matrix deposition throughout the scaffold architecture (3-6). These mechanically stable initially non-porous scaffolds were able to support bone ingrowth due to evolving porous architecture via matrix degradation in rat calvarial defects and rabbit segmental bone defects without inclusion of growth factors and cells. Based on these findings we hypothesize that by altering scaffold composition and geometry we will be able to create BTE scaffolds with programmable mechanical strength and porous structure to better serve the bone healing requirements at load bearing sites. The research project will have the four following phases: Aim 1: To optimize material composition and geometry to achieve necessary mechanical stability and progressive degradation for load-bearing bone-healing applications. Aim 2: To understand the effect of scaffold degradation on human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) adhesion, infiltration, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralized matrix production. Aim 3: To assess in vivo biocompatibility and dynamic pore formation within the scaffolds. Aim 4: To evaluate the bone healing ability of scaffolds with different geometry and mechanical strength in a critical size segmental defect in the rabbit ulna."
"9349372","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has witnessed an explosion of activity and interest in recent years, as certain biological structures that were previously extremely challenging to solve have become much more tractable using the technology. Some structures, like icosahedral viruses and ribosomes, are now being solved to near-atomic resolution on a routine basis. The capabilities imply that atomic-level structural information is potentially achievable for many long sought-after protein targets, thus opening doors for exciting discoveries in structural biology. However, the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired data makes certain targets extremely challenging to study using the technique, and the resolution will be limited to large domains, at best. In this application, one of the major challenges in single-particle cryoEM will be addressed with the development of a methodology that would enable routine structure solution of small (<100 kDa) macromolecules and macromolecular complexes. In parallel, the existing technological infrastructure, together with methodological improvements, will be applied to an outstanding problem in biology - the cryoEM structure of the human IKK complex, a central regulator of NF-?B based transcription regulation and a key target for drug design. Despite previous efforts using X-ray based techniques, the structure of IKK, and a rational structure-based model of its activation, remains elusive. The utilization of cryoEM to solve the structure of IKK will bypass the difficulties associated with specimen crystallization, while building on the inherent advantages of single-particle techniques, specifically in their ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies. This work will provide groundwork for future functional analyses that will be performed in collaboration with research groups in the immediate vicinity of the laboratory and is expected to a broad impact on drug design efforts aimed at the IKK complex."
"9389173","Summary Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is part of the continuum of ovarian dysfunction ranging from infertility with a high FSH level to early menopause before age 45 years, and affects 5-10% of women. Using next generation sequencing in women with familial POI, we have identified novel, heterozygous, stop gained mutations in two families. The first was in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor transport protein eIF4ENIF1, which causes menopause 20 years earlier than the population average. The second was in POLR2C, the third largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, which appears to cause earlier menopause in each generation. We will now apply unique DNA sequence analysis software developed at the University of Utah to discover novel gene mutations in sporadic POI and familial POI cases. In addition, we will examine the familial segregation of POI and comorbid disease. Finally, we will use a mouse model of the eIF4ENIF1 stop gained mutation to identify genes important for oocyte growth and meiosis. Specific Aim 1 will determine the breadth of genetic mutations in large populations of women with POI that have undergone whole exome sequencing. We will use novel software (VAAST, pVAAST and Phevor) developed at the University of Utah and controls recruited for health in old age to prioritize variants in two POI cohorts with replication in a third (n~300). The software identifies rare, damaging variants in genes that have a strong relationship to the POI phenotype. Specific Aim 2 will identify familial cases of POI in the Utah Population Database, the most extensive genealogical database in the U.S. The inheritance pattern, associated phenotypes and comorbid diseases will be analyzed in familial POI to determine its effect on overall health and to determine families at risk for POI. Specific Aim 3 will determine the mechanism of ovarian insufficiency in carriers of the eIF4ENIF1 stop gained mutation using a mouse model. The differentially translated mRNA in polysomes in the presence of the stop gained mutation compared to wild type will be determined. The differentially translated mRNAs in the eIF4ENIF1 stop gained mouse model will highlight the genes important for oocyte development and meiosis, and will inform the search for gene mutations in Specific Aim 1. The work will address two research gaps by illuminating our understanding of the genetics of the reproductive aging transition. It will also address fertility as a marker of overall health by identifying diseases associated with decreased ovarian reserve and POI. We will then be able to use family history and associated disorders to identify women at risk for POI. New gene mutations and pathways will inform software algorithms such as Phevor, which will use the new information to prioritize variants discovered in next generation sequencing to determine the genetic cause of POI in additional women. Early identification will bring the potential to preserve fertility and create targeted treatment options for these women."
"9528124","While the epidemic of HIV in the US has leveled off for many age groups, from 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) (13-24 year old) more than doubled. In 2010, YMSM accounted for 72% of new infections among people ages 13 to 24, and 30% of all new infections among MSM. The success of treatment as prevention in reducing the number of new HIV infections among youth, and particularly YMSM, relies on HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment (both for treatment and prevention), adherence and viral suppression among those with HIV. The UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech) aims to impact the HIV epidemic by conducting innovative, interdisciplinary research on technology-based interventions across the HIV prevention and care continuum for adolescents and young adults in the United States (US). The iTech also creates an infrastructure to share and disseminate best practices in technology-delivered HIV interventions to other ATN projects and programs serving adolescents. The iTech overall goals seek to decrease the impact of HIV on the lives of adolescents and young adults in the US, particularly YMSM, by providing: 1) treatment as prevention for those without HIV but at risk; 2) earlier identification and treatment for those infected but undiagnosed; 3) interventions to address structural determinants that decrease access to and uptake of prevention and care services; and 4) treatment interventions to encourage adherence for youth dealing with substance use, mental health related issues, stigmatization and disenfranchisement. The necessary resources and support for HIV/AIDS investigators addressing these goals will be provided by the iTech Cores: 1) Management (Hightow-Weidman); 2) Analytic (Rosenberg/Muessig); and, 3) Technology (Sullivan/Hightow-Weidman). To accomplish our Overall Goals we have developed the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To provide scientific leadership with expertise and experience in technology-based research to address fundamental questions related to the HIV prevention and care continuum, guide our overall research strategy and foster collaboration and synergy both within our iTech and with the broader ATN scientific community. Aim 2: To support the development and assessment of innovative technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for at-risk or infected youth aged 15-24 years. Aim 3: To support the overall ATN scientific agenda by participating on the ATN Executive Committee and collaborating with other U19 awardees stimulating new synergistic and responsive grants applications and research to respond to emerging issues in this field. Aim 4: To develop and nurture partnerships that will ensure community input at all stages of conceptualization, design, implementation, and interpretation of the research. Aim 5. To develop, mentor and train clinicians and researchers to stimulate innovative HIV/AIDS research focused on technological innovation across the care continuum."
"9363434","Dynamic molecular interactions among cell adhesion proteins, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeleton give rise to tissue-level mechanics, but delineating the mechanism of emergence of spatiotemporally regulated tissue mechanics remains a challenge. This proposal addresses this problem utilizing an integrated cross-scale approach that quantifies molecular scale protein movement and protein-protein association as well as tissue mechanics using cell tracking and quantitative metrics from fluid mechanics. Specifically, the assembly of the paraxial mesoderm from motile mesodermal progenitors is examined. The proposal seeks to elucidate a regulatory mechanism in which Fibronectin fibrillogenesis is confined to the surface of the paraxial mesoderm despite the presence of Fibronectin and its primary Integrin receptors throughout the tissue. Fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) in live embryos revealed a protein complex containing Integrin ?5 and Cadherin 2 and genetic experiments indicate that this complex represses Fibronectin matrix assembly within the mesenchyme of the paraxial mesoderm. On the surface of the paraxial mesoderm, Integrin ?5 is de-repressed and Fibronectin matrix coats the tissue surface. Aim 1 is to define the role of Integrin ?V, the other main Fibronectin receptor, in this process using FCCS and genetic mosaics. In addition, fluorescent timer fusion proteins are used to reveal the patterns of adhesion protein turnover in vivo, and a FRET/FLIM assay is used to examine Integrin conformation in live embryos. Aim 2 is to identify other components of this protein complex using co-IP and Mass Spectroscopy. These proteins will be further characterized by in vivo FCCS, gene knockout and systems analysis of cell motion in the mutants."
"9353556","Preventing, delaying, or reversing aging-related thymic involution is a widely sought-after therapeutic goal with the potential to significantly improve immune function and health-span in aging humans. Thymic involution initiates in childhood, and is progressive thereafter, continuing to produce T cells that develop in a deteriorating microenvironment and raising the possibility that the process of involution itself may produce sub-functional T cells. Studies of involution that compare old with young mice investigate only the end stage of involution. The thymus is also highly sensitive to many kinds of stress. The very different life histories of mice in a controlled environment and humans living in the world could significantly influence the rate and degree of thymus involution, and the capacity for rebound. There is accumulating evidence that changes in the expression of the FOXN1 transcription factor may directly regulate initial involution. Our preliminary data show that the Atf3 stress response gene is suppressed by FOXN1, up-regulated in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) with aging, and may mediate some key aspects of thymic involution. These data directly implicate stress as a potentially important aspect of involution that is understudied in animal models, but may impact efforts to modulate involution in humans.  This project is based on the premise that developing mouse models of thymic involution and immunosenesensce to include parameters that more accurately mimic the human condition will generate more relevant data for devising therapeutic strategies in humans. Based on this premise we propose to use novel computational approaches to generate a data-driven comparison of human and mouse thymic involution, to test whether a mouse strain with accelerated involution better mimics the effects of thymic involution on peripheral T cells in humans, and to investigate the effects of stress on age-associated involution. We will also test the hypothesis that the TEC response to repeated stress compromises the capacity for rebound with aging, and that the Atf3 stress response gene is up regulated with aging and promotes key aspects of thymus involution. These experiments will directly address the differences between mouse and human lifespan and life history, to develop and test new models for investigating thymic involution and its effects on peripheral T cell changes with aging. Together with Projects 3 and 4 and Cores A-C, the human-mouse comparisons will generate the Human-Mouse Timeline that will be not only a key resource to the Program, but a valuable reference for the community. This and other aspects of this Project will synergize with other Project outcomes and inform the design and interpretation of interventions testing in Core D."

"9548422","Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA) signaling pathways play a prominent role in  regulating behavioral responses to cocaine. Therefore, studies aimed at understanding how the miRNA  system operates are directly relevant to drug abuse research. Recent studies also indicate that the  translin/trax RNAse complex plays a key role in miRNA processing. Furthermore, we have found, in  preliminary studies, that translin knockout mice display reduced locomotor responses to cocaine.  Accordingly, we plan to define: 1) the role of the translin/trax complex in regulating miRNA processing, and  2) its role in regulating responsiveness to cocaine. Accordingly, the specific aims of the proposed project are  to:  I. Identify direct miRNA targets of the translin/trax RNAse complex and determine its role in their processing.  Although the translin/trax complex has been implicated in processing miRNAs, it is still unclear which specific  miRNAs it targets directly. Accordingly, we plan to use a highly efficient UV-crosslinking procedure (PAR-  CLIP) to identify RNAs that bind directly to the translin/trax complex in intact cells.  II. Determine the impact of translin deletion on signaling pathways that regulate responsiveness to cocaine.  As translin and trax are expressed in striatal neurons, a major site of cocaine action, we plan, in this set of  studies, to conduct both candidate-based and screening approaches to identify alterations in striatal  signaling pathways caused by translin deletion.  III. Determine whether deletion of translin from striatal neurons mediates altered responsiveness to cocaine.  Our initial studies demonstrating that translin deletion impairs the locomotor response to cocaine were  performed in conventional ko mice. Accordingly, we plan, in this set of studies, to generate and use translin  conditional ko mice to test the hypothesis that deletion of translin from D1R- and/or D2R-positive neurons  mediates this behavioral phenotype."

These labs are the sole laboratories responsible for surveillance of manufactured foods under the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program (MFRP), and also for testing of foods when implicated in foodborne outbreaks. The MA SPHL is committed to producing the highest quality results from the testing performed at the lab, and therefore are committed to maintaining a quality management system that assures that. By maintaining accreditation to the ISO 17025 standard, both laboratory management and the FDA can be assured of the quality of the results generated here at the lab. Over the next two years, the MA SPHL will complete all required routine surveillance of manufactured food samples, and report all results to eLEXNET. The lab will complete annual proficiency tests, all review of SOPs, internal audits and external assessments by the accreditation body as described in the standard. MA SPHL will take a continuous quality improvement approach to ISO accreditation. The enclosed scope of accreditation covers ten methods. Throughout the next two years, and with collaboration from the MFRP officials in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) Bureau of Environmental Health (BEH) Food Protection Program (FPP), MA SPHL will evaluate additional methods for inclusion to the scope if there is a need for this testing in the future."
"9345368","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global economic climate has reshaped the job markets for which we are preparing biomedical doctoral students. At the same time, most research programs have traditionally focused on preparing students for postdoctoral training and careers in academia. Wayne State University (WSU) doctoral graduate placement data parallels the national trend, which shows that less than 25% of PhD students ultimately obtain tenure-track faculty positions. Our recognition of this gap has motivated us to design an innovative initiative whose specific purpose is to transform our biomedical doctoral training such that both faculty and students recognize, appreciate and celebrate diverse career opportunities. The long-range goal is to institutionalize these practices so that our students become the next generation of innovators and leaders in science. The intended outcome of our program is to place students in diverse careers in addition to academia, and to educate the biomedical community that such diverse careers are viewed as desirable and successful outcomes of doctoral research training. WSU's Graduate School is leading this initiative to transform biomedical graduate education centrally across academic units and disciplines. Trainees will be prepared for a dynamic and evolving job market to meet the needs of the 21st century economy. These skill sets will be developed in partnership with local employers to provide mentored internships to ensure alignment between the expectations of diverse employers and the skills of our trainees, in keeping with WSU's urban location and urban mission. In addition to specific partnerships, students will have the opportunity for cross-training to develop a variety of skills allowing them to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams and to solve complex problems in an institution with urban motifs and research emphasis."
"9544495","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC) brings together 28 investigators whose research activities are focused on various aspects of nonmalignant hematology and whose work is highly dependent on one or more of the four biomedical research cores proposed in this application. The central theme of our CHSCC is the regulation of human and murine hematopoiesis at the level of hematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor (HPC) cells. The goal of the investigations of members of this center is to leverage different components of the hematopoietic system to improve the advancement of the clinical utility and efficacy of HSC/HPC-based therapies. We believe that in order to attain these goals, we must understand basic biological processes that affect hematopoietic stem cell behavior both in vitro and in vivo in a basic science laboratory and to eventually establish clinical trials that transfor these findings into translational efforts. The proposed CHSCC membership in this application draws from a group of well-funded investigators with a diverse but complementary experience in experimental and clinical stem cell transplantation, signaling in and regulation of HSC and HPC, developmental emergence of fetal hematopoiesis, gene transfer, interactions between HSC and the hematopoietic niche, mobilization, homing and engraftment of HSC, modulation of function of freshly isolated and ex vivo manipulated HSC, and functional status of HSC after exposure to ionizing radiation. The cores proposed in this CHSCC submission evolved from existing shared facilities and have been adapted to the current needs of this program. These include: Experimental Mouse Resources, Optical Microscopy, Angiogenesis, and Flow Cytometry cores. All cores will support the basic and translational studies that underlie the mission of the CHSCC and will facilitate development of new discoveries into human trials. The program also includes a Pilot and Feasibility Project to be funded in part through Institutional funds in order to enhanc the training of young investigators and enhance their ability to successfully compete for extramural (e.g. NIH) funding. Furthermore, to ensure continued scientific growth and progress, the proposed center has a well-developed enrichment program to advance the development of both young and established CHSCC members. Together, the CHSCC represents an important assembly of critical cores needed to promote and enhance the basic and clinical work in progress and to provide support that we believe is needed over the next five years."
"9354446","The goal of the Community Outreach and Health Disparities Core (COHDC) is to encourage and facilitate effective diabetes translation research among investigators who seek to decrease risks for diabetes and its sequela among vulnerable minority populations, especially African Americans. Through our work, we expect to increase collaboration, perform quality intervention research, and increase the rate of positive behavior change among patients and at-risk persons. We will work with investigators that have funded research projects and support those that are seeking funding for projects in development. African Americans carry a disproportionate diabetes burden and are usually hard-to-reach and/or engage in research focused on evidence-based methods to reduce this burden. Hence, community-engaged research strategies must be used to encourage and facilitate reach and engagement, through implementation of infrastructural, organizational, and behavioral models, and evaluation of effectiveness through use of appropriate and sensitive measurement tools. Besides the diabetes statistics, our work is driven by the obesity epidemic, a risk factor for diabetes, because it is so pervasive in our region (Southeastern United States). Planning and conducting translational research requires many different skills, and very often investigators do not have all the skills needed. The COHDC brings together an experienced, multi-disciplinary team that can support translational research with minority and underserved population."
"9231603","PROJECT SUMMARY Transcription factors play an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation during development. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors TWIST1 and TWIST2 are critical regulators of cell fate and differentiation during vertebrate development. These factors are mutated in several diseases that lead to craniofacial, digit, and other defects making it important to understand how these bHLH factors function and the underlying causes associated with their disease phenotypes. bHLH proteins form dimers with their HLH domains and bind to DNA sequences called E boxes with the basic DNA binding domains of the dimer partners. Although much is known about DNA binding and dimer formation, very little is known about the cooperation between the two domains for proper bHLH function. A glutamic acid in the DNA binding domain is predicted to play a critical role based on three pieces of evidence. There is a lack of amino acid variation at that position in bHLH protein alignments, bHLH crystal structures predict the glutamic acid makes direct contacts with DNA, and patients with amino acid substitutions in either TWIST1 or TWIST2 in that residue have disease phenotypes. The experiments in this proposal are designed to test the hypothesis that missense mutations of the conserved glutamic acid residue in the Twist DNA binding domain alter E-box regulated transcription due to disrupted protein-protein interactions. The simple nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is an excellent model genetic system for elucidating Twist function because the organism contains only one Twist-related protein, HLH-8, and HLH-8?s partner protein and downstream target genes are conserved with human TWIST1. Even though this organism is an invertebrate and can?t have craniofacial or digit defects, the conserved Twist pathway suggests that aspects of the cellular mechanisms will be conserved as well. In Aim 1, missense mutations in HLH-8 that mimic human disease alleles in the conserved glutamic acid will be characterized in C. elegans. The goal will be to understand the specific cellular defects of the mutants. Preliminary studies indicate that some of the mutants can still bind DNA to turn on target genes. These mutants will be the focus of the research in the second aim. In Aim 2, the C. elegans mutants will be used in modifier genetic screens designed to identify new proteins that cooperate with HLH-8 and, by analogy, may be potential therapeutic targets for Twist-related human diseases. The projects in the proposed work are suitable for students so the research will have a profound impact on the education of undergraduate and graduate students. The broad goal of this research is to elucidate HLH-8 function and target gene regulation. Due to the relatedness between the human and C. elegans Twist proteins, information learned will be relevant to understanding human TWIST1 and TWIST2 and disease pathology."

"9323570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is now diagnosed in 1 of 68 children with recent reports citing as many as 1 in 50 children in the United States. The average age of diagnosis is more than 4 years. There is a need for a reliable biomarker-based test for earlier diagnosis of ASD in young children to improve outcomes such as cognition, social function and communication. This will subsequently decrease the financial and emotional burden on families and society. In 2012, Stemina began a self-funded Phase I equivalent study of plasma samples from nearly 400 ASD, Developmental Delay (DD) and Typically Developing (TD) children. From these studies, we developed computational models based on metabolic biomarker differences in ASD and TD children that could differentiate ASD from TD patients with an accuracy of about 80%.  Stemina seeks funding to enroll 1500 patients in a well-defined clinical study to develop a biomarker-based diagnostic test capable of classifying ASD relative to other developmental delays at greater than 80% accuracy. In addition, we propose to identify metabolic subtypes present within the ASD spectrum that can be used for personalized treatment. The study will include ASD, DD and TD children between 18 and 48 months of age. Inclusion of DD patients is a novel and important aspect of this proposed study from the perspective of a commercially available diagnostic test. Our ultimate goals are to: (1) enable early diagnosis and treatment; (2) elucidate metabolic differences in subtypes of ASD patients to properly match the best available treatments for each patient from an individual biochemical perspective; and (3) identify biochemical alterations in patients across the spectrum that will provide targets for novel therapies. We will employ the innovative metabolomics approaches that we developed in Phase I, including coupling orthogonal chromatographic separation methodologies with both non- targeted and targeted high resolution mass spectrometry. Our study objectives will be to confirm biomarkers that were discovered in Phase I, expand those biomarker profiles for metabolic subtypes, and optimize the ASD test accuracy by creating panels of biomarker subtypes that will better describe this heterogeneous syndrome. Based on our Phase I data, we believe this clinical study will also allow us to confirm specific metabolic biomarkers of subtypes of ASD. This innovative approach to characterizing ASD will allow physicians to suggest the most appropriate treatment based on the individual metabolism of the patient."
"9379354","PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in North America and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Radiation therapy (RT) plays an integral part in the treatment of breast cancer with more than half of all breast cancer patients receiving radiation sometime during the course of their treatment. The conventional view of RT has largely focused on the effect of RT on the tumor cells themselves. However, recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for the immune system in determining the response of tumors to RT. Further, multiple studies have identified the bacterial and fungal microbiomes as key regulators of systemic immune responses in various in states of inflammation including post-chemotherapy immunogenic cell death and asthma respectively. The microbiome consists of trillions of organisms and a multitude of different species that can either support or suppress an ongoing immune response and our preliminary data suggests that targeting intestinal bacteria reduces the efficacy of RT whereas targeting gut fungi can enhance the efficacy of RT. The objective of this research proposal is to address the mechanism(s) by which intestinal bacteria and fungi shape the response to RT. The proposal tests the hypothesis that the composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiome regulates RT-induced immune responses and that the efficacy of RT can be enhanced in vivo by targeting specific species with the fungal microbiome. To evaluate this hypothesis, the following Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Characterize the effect of antibiotic- or antifungal-induced intestinal dysbiosis on the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy; Aim 2: Define immune mechanism(s) of bacterial and fungal microbiota regulation of tumor responses to RT; and Aim 3: Examine the role of specific intestinal fungi in modulating the efficacy of RT. We will accomplish these aims using focal RT delivered with an advanced small animal irradiator in a murine model of breast cancer and studying the effects of RT in the setting of bacterial or fungal dysbiosis using a combination of flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR and ELISA to determine the changes in the immune profile of tumors. We will also determine the role of specific fungal species in mediating the RT-mediated anti-tumor immune response. The significance of this research is that it will provide insights into the tumor immune responses to radiation that may lead to new microbiome-based therapies for the treatment of breast cancer and the multiple other solid tumors in which RT plays an integral therapeutic role."
"9346649","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed Digestive, Metabolic and Kidney Disease Research Education Program (DMKREP) are: 1) to expose 1st and 2nd year medical students early in their career decision making to state-of- the-art basic and translational research specifically in digestive, metabolic and kidney diseases, and 2) to reinforce these experiences longitudinally through education and mentoring emphasizing careers in academic science provided by an integrated academic Learning Community (LC) focused on the scientific principles and practice in these fields. The DMKREP employs an immersion model of medical student training and education, which reflects the Medical College of Wisconsin's four-fold mission of education, discovery, patient care and community engagement. These goals will be achieved through three integrated programs: First, students will receive rigorous, hands-on, fundamental research experiences within the research laboratories of NIH-funded MCW investigators in the fields of digestive, metabolic, and kidney diseases over a 10-week summer period. Second, the DMKREP participants also will be matched with a clinical mentor in a congruent area of digestive, metabolic or kidney disease. Students will be encouraged to shadow their clinical mentor in the outpatient clinic or hospital setting to gain early exposure to the clinical aspects of the disease they are studying in the laboratory. Third, participants will b integrated into the DMKREP's LC, which aims to engage the students throughout the remainder of their medical school education. The LC will sponsor monthly meetings with participating students to encourage continued progress on research projects (including work towards Honor's Research) and to foster continued learning in research and career development topics relevant to the mission of the DMKREP. The participants themselves will become part of the LC throughout their medical education program, as they encourage and interact with each other and subsequent groups of matriculants as they enroll in the DMKREP each summer. The overarching goal is educate and train a diverse workforce to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs in digestive, metabolic and kidney diseases that impact on human health."
"9328974","Project Summary/Abstract  Some of the most influential relationships children have are with their parents and their teachers. Yet, much of the literature has considered family and teacher relationships as separate and have not examined the joint effects of the two in a substantive way. Fewer still have considered the possible role of heritable characteristics of the child in helping to shape the child's relationships within the family and with teachers, although children's emotionality has been shown to influence their relationship with their parents and their teachers. Parent- child relationships have been shown to be influenced by heritable factors in children, and there is a growing body of literature showing how child heritable influences may also impact their teachers, with a small subset of that research focusing on teacher-child interactions and only one that has considered links between the two contexts. The main research question of this proposal is to examine the mechanisms by which children's emotionality impacts their relationships with parents and teachers. This proposal will use a genetically-informative parent-offspring adoption design to examine the following three aims: (1) examine how children's emotionality may impact their relationships with their parents and later adjustment, and consider the role of gene-environment interplay, (2) examine how children's emotionality may impact their relationships with their teachers and their later adjustment, using a gene-environment interplay framework, and (3) examine how genetic influences on child emotionality may influence their relationships with their parents and with their teachers. Advanced longitudinal analytic strategies will be used including Structural Equation Modeling to achieve the study aims. Elucidating the mechanisms by which family and teacher relationships influence the emotionality and later adjustment of the child could potentially assist prevention and intervention programs to effectively target aspects of these contexts.  By addressing each of the above research aims, I will refine a conceptual model using a behavioral genetic framework integrating the family, classroom, and children's emotionality. To better prepare myself for my career conducting longitudinal research examining gene-environment interplay and child emotionality in the family and classroom context, I am seeking additional training to: (1) gain expertise in developmental behavioral and molecular genetics, (2) hone my advanced developmental methods skills, (3) develop an integrated model of family, classroom, and child emotion development that includes gene-environment interplay, (4) strengthen my manuscript and grant writing skills, and (5) responsibly conduct research in a research area new to me, behavioral and molecular genetics. My career goal is to conduct interdisciplinary research with the objective of understanding children's emotion development and on the evocative effects of children on their parents and teachers. This dissertation research will lay the foundation for a career-long research program investigating child driven effects and gene-environment interplay."
"9388746","One of the markers of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in infants and toddlers is impaired selective attention to faces1-6 (Preliminary Study, PS#1). This impairment diminishes their ability to learn from and interact adaptively with others in real-world environments.7 Attentional selection in the social domain relies, in part, on one?s ability to encode reward values of people and store these values in long-term memory as stable values.8- 10 The ?stable? values (henceforth, ?values?) are learned over the course of repeated learning opportunities, and once acquired, they are signaled rapidly, preferentially directing gaze to encoded faces of importance (high- value, HV) based on their hedonic or informative properties in the past.11 Automatic responses based on values stored in long-term memory are essential for survival when decisions have to be made rapidly (e.g., mother versus stranger). Learning about values is subserved by the reward learning system in the brain involving basal ganglia (BG) circuitry.11 This circuitry is implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD12, 13 and extant evidence suggests that individuals with ASD exhibit specific impairments in learning the reward value of social stimuli such as faces.14 (PS#2) Based on this evidence, we propose that limited attention to faces in toddlers with elevated autism symptoms (ASD+) is, in part, driven by impaired value learning in the social domain, affecting their ability to rapidly and preferentially select HV faces and ignore low-value (LV) faces in the complex real-world environment. Consequently, they exhibit diminished spontaneous attention to faces in general, and when they look at faces, they may distribute their limited attentional resources between high- (e.g., mother or therapist) and low-value (stranger) individuals in a trial-and-error fashion. We further hypothesize that reinforcing attention of children with ASD+ toward specific faces through social value training (SVT) will increase their attention to these faces in real-world environments. Here we propose to test a novel SVT in the ASD+ group at 18 months (n=48). In the proposed pilot study, ASD+ toddlers will undergo SVT using a gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigm. SVT will be administered over a two-day period and the training effects will be assessed by changes in visual attention to HV faces as compared to LV faces between baseline, post-baseline (day 3), and a long-term follow-up (1 month) using two tasks: a laboratory selective attention (LSA) task and real-world selective attention (RWSA) task. We will also evaluate acceptability and feasibility of the value training and contribution of sex, nonverbal developmental level, and severity of autism symptoms to response to the training. Taking advantage of the overlapping cohorts between Projects 1 (neonatal imaging) and Project 5, we will examine if characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity at birth predict response to training in the ASD+ toddlers. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to directly target a marker for ASD by engaging the reward learning system and to evaluate functional integrity of neonatal connectome as a potential predictor of response to training at 18 months."
"9349374","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial persisters underlie many types of chronic bacterial infections and are a major public health problem. Bacterial persisters are a manifestation of bacterial individuality in which a subgroup of cells tolerates antibiotics, despit being genetically susceptible. The proposed research will develop techniques to isolate persisters in order to characterize their physiological state. To this end, a novel method for comprehensively analyzing population heterogeneity in protein abundances will be developed. This method will use large libraries of native, genomically-encoded proteins with C-terminal fluorescent tags for the important persistent pathogens E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. This method will also use developed culturing and fixing techniques with highly-automated flow cytometry to robustly analyze the protein abundance distributions for thousands of different proteins under conditions that increase persistence. These distributions will be analyzed to facilitate the rational pooling of fluorescently-tagged strains for a novel selection strategy to identify predictive proteins for persistence. The selection strategy uses fluorescently activated cell sorting (FACS) of the top fraction of cells with the highest protein abundances in a pooled library. The sorted cells will be treated with high concentrations of antibiotics in a persister assay, thereby enriching the frequency of cells harboring tagged proteins that predict persistence. After multiple iterations through the selection scheme, DNA- sequencing will be performed to determine the identity of the predictive tagged proteins. These protein markers will be validated by FACS and persister assays, and will be used to isolate pure persister populations. Powerful systems biology techniques, including RNA-seq and in vivo protein occupancy display, will be applied to pure cultures of persisters to characterize their physiology at the systems level. The developed techniques will provide deep insight into bacterial persistence and heterogeneity, and the findings will accelerate development of new antibiotic treatments."
"9479630","1 Introduction to Application  2 The Washington State Public Health Laboratories (WA PHL) were among of the first four laboratories  3 that formed the GenomeTrakr network by entering into a Research Cooperative Agreement (RCA) with FDA-  4 CFSAN in late 2012. In 2013, the WA PHL received a MiSeq instrument, obtained the support of Dr. Zhen Li  5 through the ORISE Fellowship and started receiving reagent support for the sequencing of food/environmental  6 bacterial isolates.  7 The whole genome sequencing (WGS) work performed at WA PHL for GenomeTrakr has the overall  8 objective of building a stronger international rapid surveillance system for pathogen trace back sample  9 collection and sequence cataloging through a publicly available database of food and environmental pathogen 10 isolates. Through this work, WA PHL will continue to expand and improve the outcome of disease cluster trace 11 back to specific sources and will contribute towards the effort of monitoring compliance with FDA?s rules on 12 safe food-handling practices to enhance preventive controls for food safety. The specific aims of this project 13 are 1. To sequence up to four hundred (400) foodborne related bacterial, viral and/or parasite pathogen 14 isolates, 2. To increase collaboration and share live isolate cultures upon request and 3. To actively participate 15 in GenomeTrakr network activities. The overall objective of this work will be possible only if the entire 16 GenomeTrakr network continues to contribute to this goal (through the participation of WA PHL as well as 17 other laboratories). In addition, the successful linkage of current foodborne disease clusters and/or outbreaks 18 to a food or an environmental source hinges upon obtaining WGS data from both food/environmental sources 19 and clinical isolates. As a PulseNet Western Region Area Laboratory; WA PHL also perform WGS on clinical 20 isolates obtained from patients with foodborne disease, therefore; serving as a conduit for the linking of clinical 21 clusters with a source. WA PHL actively shares cluster information with appropriate collaborators locally and 22 nationally to speed foodborne illness outbreak investigations and prevent additional foodborne illnesses and 23 deaths. 24 The GenomeTrakr work is revolutionizing the way in which microbiology is performed at WA PHL and 25 other public health laboratories by providing higher resolution and certainty in molecular epidemiology 26 investigations of disease clusters; by furthering the database of genomic antibiotic resistant markers; and by 27 providing alternative methodologies for the way in which pathogens have traditionally been characterized 28 (serotyping, virulence markers, resistance typing, etc) in the laboratory. Participants of this project have 29 collectively generated massive amounts of data that is publicly available for other researchers to harness for 30 additional applications."
"9401842","PROJECT SUMMARY  Congenital heart disease remains the most common birth defect and the major cause of birth defect-related deaths in the world, and originates at least in part from genetic defects altering the development and maturation of the heart. Despite substantial progress, there are still huge knowledge gaps in basic understanding of mechanisms controlling this process. While the roles of key cardiac-specific transcription factors in heart development have been carefully studied, the significance of protein modifiers in this process has not been recognized. The overall goal of this project is to uncover the essential role of NEDD8, a novel ubiquitin-like protein modifier, in heart development and maturation. NEDD8 modifies protein targets in a way similar to ubiquitination, termed neddylation. Neddylation requires NEDD8 specific E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Through regulating the function of protein targets, neddylation participates in diverse cellular processes and pathophysiological events. However, whether neddylation plays any role in cardiac development is completely unknown. By targeting a subunit of the only NEDD8 E1 activating enzyme (NAE1), our pilot studies uncover a critical role of neddylation in maintaining the structural integrity and function of neonatal hearts. The importance of neddylation in the heart is connected to its novel function in regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling, a conserved and crucial pathway that controls heart development. Therefore, this project is to test the central hypothesis that NAE1 regulates embryonic cardiac development through sustaining CM proliferation in a YAP-dependent manner. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will establish the functional importance of neddylation in embryonic heart development. Using a newly created NAE1 knockout mouse line, we will thoroughly characterize the impact of NAE1 deficiency on a series of concordant and sequential cardiac morphogenic events. The cardiac phenotype will be linked to defects, if any, in CM differentiation and proliferation. Moreover, we will identify novel pathways under the regulation of neddylation in the developing heart. In Aim 2, we will delineate molecular mechanisms by which neddylation controls CM proliferation, with a focus on the Hippo-YAP pathway. We will determine the effect of NAE1 deficiency on Hippo-YAP signaling in vivo and dissect molecular mechanisms of how neddylation controls this pathway. We will also test whether reactivation of YAP signaling rescues NAE1 inactivation-induced CM proliferation arrest. Given the extensive preliminary data gathered, the strong and experienced mentoring team, as well as the high caliber of the training plan, this proposal is likely to prove successful. Completion of this study will provide the applicant comprehensive training in various aspects of cardiovascular biology, which forms the basis of setting his long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician scientist. The proposed study will, for the first time, establish the essential role of neddylation in cardiac development, offering novel mechanisms underlying the development of CHD, one of the most important causes of birth-related morbidity and mortality worldwide."
"9484520","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Embryonic morphogenesis requires coordinated communications among diverse cell types. Dysregulation of these interactions results in birth defects. Signaling among cells in vivo occurs in the context of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and both the chemical and mechanical properties of the ECM regulate cell signaling and progenitor cell fates. Mechanisms whereby components of the ECM regulate embryonic morphogenesis are not well understood. In the course of the studies supported by our first R01, we made the intriguing discovery that synthesis of the ECM glycoprotein fibronectin (Fn1) is dynamically regulated during mouse embryonic development, and that the expression of Fn1 is highly enriched in distinct embryonic progenitors important for cardiovascular morphogenesis. Fn1 is a highly conserved vertebrate glycoprotein encoded by a single gene in mice and humans, and previous studies showed that Fn1 is required for cardiovascular development. Therefore, we hypothesized that different cellular sources of Fn1 played distinct, biologically significant roles in the development of the cardiovascular system. Preliminary data presented in this grant demonstrate that Fn1 synthesized by the neural crest (NC) is essential for the development of the aortic arch arteries (AAAs), a system of blood vessels that routs oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Fn1 mRNA and protein become highly induced in NC cells surrounding the pharyngeal arch arteries as these blood vessels mature into the AAAs, and we show that Fn1 synthesized by NC cells around the pharyngeal arch arteries regulates the differentiation of NC cells into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We present evidence suggesting that Fn1 synthesized by the NC regulates NC-to-VSMC differentiation in a cell- autonomous manner by signaling through integrin ?5?1 and regulating actin polymerization, which in turn, regulates the translocation of the myocardin-related transcription factor B (MRTFB) from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. In the nucleus, MRTFB can directly activate the transcription of smooth muscle genes, and we show that a deletion mutant of MRTFB that constitutively localizes to the nucleus rescues smooth muscle differentiation in Fn1-deficient NC cells. In this renewal application we propose to determine the mechanisms by which Fn1 regulates NC-to-VSMC differentiation and the role of tissue biomechanics in this process by addressing the following Specific Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that Fn1 regulates the differentiation of NC cells into VSMCs by signaling through integrin ?5?1; 2) To test the hypothesis that Fn1 and tissue biomechanics regulate NC-to-VSMC differentiation by modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear localization of MRTFB; and 3) To test the hypotheses that EIIIA+ and EIIIB+ forms of Fn1 regulate NC-to-VSMC differentiation and that the induction of Fn1 in NC cells surrounding the endothelium of the pharyngeal arch arteries is mediated by SMAD2-dependent signaling."

We are encouraged to be part of the culture that helped dwindle the incidence of Multiple Organ Failure, MOF, in a decade. An experienced Administration Core will execute this program as before. By combining salient discoveries in each previous project, breakthroughs in point of care research, enabled by SIMP Core and guided by clinical data in the HS Core, we identify the most important questions and testable hypotheses. Projects 1, 2 and 3 anchor themselves on coagulative functionality, proteomics and metabolomics on matched patient samples and then continue to derive experimental approaches Project 1 The leadership team consisting of Drs. Moore, Silliman, Sauaia and Banerjee examine fibrinolytic phenotypes that contribute to acute mortality. They hypothesize that hemorrhagic shock predisposes to hyperfibrinolysis, but tissue injury causes fibrinolysis shut-down, due to regulation of plasminogen/plasmin. The hypotheses are tested in animal models of shock and with high content data on patients. Project 2 The leadership team consisting of Drs. Silliman, Banerjee, Hansen, Moore, Sauaia and Dziecatowskowa designed these aims to investigate novel regulators of plasmin found in post traumatic plasma. They focus on proteins containing (kringles, calponin or fibronectin) domains that become abundant after blood storage, or in conditions of hemorrhagic shock versus tissue injury, and appear to be novel regulators of human plasmin. Project 3 The leadership team consisting of Drs. D'Alessandro, Peltz, Banerjee, Silliman, Moore, and Sauaia designed these aims to specifically understand anionic contributors to plasma acidity (Aim1). They hypothesize that trauma and hemorrhagic shock instigate different metabolic changes resulting in systemic pathology, which can be identified by metabolomics analysis. They assess the role of elevated succinate and glutamine metabolism (Aim2) and potential microbially generated metabolites, for Next-Gen resuscitation therapy. These aims will lead to pragmatically attenuating acute mortality and survivor morbidity within the next decade, are supported by an active HS core that verifies scientific mechanisms and a SIMP Core and Administration Core that ensure capability."

"9385850","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is known that parents have the opportunity to significantly influence their children's weight status; however, limitations exist within the literature exploring the use and impact of food-related parenting practices on child weight status. Specifically, the bulk of research exploring the impact of food-related parenting practices on weight-related outcomes has: focused on highly controlling parenting practices - failing to account for the impact of a much broader scope of food parenting; relied on retrospective measures of food-related parenting practices; and focused on parent's ?usual? use of specific food-related parenting practices ? failing to account for potentially important differences across shorter time frames (within- or between- day) or across contexts. Finally, momentary mechanisms that influence the use of particular food-related parenting practices remain unclear. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a novel method that utilizes hand-held devices to capture information on behaviors as they unfold in their natural environment, moment-by-moment, to capture dynamic changes in behavior over time and across contexts. Use of EMA could provide an opportunity to elucidate temporal relationships between momentary variables (e.g., stress, child behavior) and use of food-related parenting practices. The proposed mixed-methods study will utilize in-depth interviews to identify a broad scope of food-related parenting practices and the momentary factors that influence them. Parent responses will then inform the development - and adaptation of measures for use within an EMA protocol. Finally, an EMA study (n=50) will explore within- and between-parent fluctuations in food-related parenting practices and will identify momentary influences on parents' use of food-related parenting practices. Knowledge gained and data collected from the proposed research will lay the foundation for a future R-01 application focused on leveraging EMA embedded within a longitudinal study to gain a comprehensive understanding of the use and impact of food-related parenting practices on weight-related outcomes in children. This proposed research also fits within the broader context of the applicant's career development goals. The overarching goal of this 4-year training program is to establish the candidate as an independent investigator focused on pediatric obesity prevention. Specific training activities include: gaining experience in data collection, management and interpretation of data collected via EMA; developing the multi-level modeling statistical analysis skills necessary to analyze data collected via EMA; and improving content area knowledge child development and the role of parent-child interactions in the development of eating behaviors. Together, the proposed training aims and research activities will allow the candidate to, 1) build on her previous training and research which, to date, has focused on utilizing traditional survey methods to explore the role of parents in adolescent weight-related outcomes, and 2) expand her expertise to include novel EMA data collection methods and associated analytical skills, and a focus on understanding the development of obesity in young children.  "
"9395205","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A significant cause of brain injury is the disruption to the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. Following a physiological stress, such as after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), NO functions as both an important regulator of the cerebral blood flow and a potential neurotoxin. In the U.S., approximately 2.2 million individuals suffer a TBI annually; and, the annual cost of treatment is $76 billion. The role of NO in the pathogenesis of brain injuries remains poorly understood because of the complex biological characteristics of NO and the fact that most investigations NO provide discrete endpoint data rather than detailing the temporal evolution of neuronal degeneration post insult. The ability to monitor these quantities with higher temporal resolution may lead to better understanding of the relationship between NO and TBI, potentially leading to treatments that enable partial restoration of physiological blood flow and prevention of secondary injuries. An in situ sensor that continuously measures the behavior of NO and its byproducts in real-time with high temporal resolution would allow for close monitoring of the evolution of a TBI and its likelihood to cause irreparable harm.  The proposed research aims to develop a sensing platform that can continuously monitor NO in real time without compromising the accuracy of the measurement, the superb temporal resolution, and the flexibility across various media. Magnetic complex colloids will be use to translate chemical signals in cell cultures to observable morphological responses, namely changes in magnetoresistance and optical transparency. This objective will be accomplished in two aims. In Aim 1, the goal is to develop a system of magnetic complex colloids whose responses to NO or its byproducts will lead to the change in the magnetoresistance that is then measured in real time. Specifically, NO-responsive surfactants will mediate the reaction and alter the interfacial tensions, causing the magnetic complex colloids to change their morphologies and magnetoresistance. The sensor developed in Aim 1 will be used to measure the bioactivity of NO generated from cell cultures in Aim 2. Namely, mouse macrophages will be activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-? (IFN-?) to produce NO, while mouse fibroblasts will serve as the negative control. Bio-inert responsive surfactants will be used to ensure the lack of cytotoxicity. Cell vitality and NO production will be evaluated continuously as a function of time.  The proposed studies will provide a unique handle of continuous measurement of the behavior of NO, which may lead to new strategies for treatment and prevention of secondary brain injury. Furthermore, the proposed sensors that can non-invasively translate chemical signals to magnetic readings have the potential to be broadly useful for a number of other sensing applications."

Over the past 15 years, Vanderbilt scientists studying diabetes and diabetes related problems (e.g., obesity) have increased their capacity to plan and conduct community-engaged and translation research. The purpose of the Diabetes Community Engaged Research Core (D-CERC) is to continue to support and enhance the capacity of the diabetes research community. To accomplish this, we have three specific aims: 1) Create an environment that fosters community-engaged diabetes translation research through building networks of investigators, actively engaging community and government organizations, and support the research through expertise-based consultations; 2) Achieve integration with existing research services provided within Vanderbilt and at partner institutions; and 3) Enhance community-engaged research services by continuing to provide health geography services to investigators, and adding web-based process evaluation as a new service. In this application, we describe 10 grants or contracts that were supported by the D-CERC during the current funding cycle. These include community-engaged research projects on diabetes and obesity. The health geography core provided services to seven of these projects. Five of the projects included a web-based process evaluation page which is a proposed service for the upcoming funding cycle. In addition, we briefly describe nine sources of support for community-engaged and translation research that the D-CERC will help investigators navigate and utilize. The extension of the health geography core will continue to develop and maintain map and data layers, geocode the addresses of study participants, create maps for investigators, and create data layers for multi- level linear models. The process evaluation service will take the Process Analysis Web System (PAWS) and create a web site template, refine the software and development tools, create a well-documented user's manual, and make this available to the research community. One of the main tasks of the D-CERC is to coordinate our work with the Community Outreach and Health Disparities Core (COHDC) at Meharry Medical College. Drs. Schlundt and Hargreaves will meet regularly to insure that investigators are making use of the services of both cores, to track service utilization, and to report periodically on progress."

"9296665","Abstract Zika virus is a burgeoning global threat. This R21 project responds to NOT-AI-16-026 Interest to Highlight High-Priority Zika Virus (ZIKV) Research Areas. Adenoviral (Ad) vectors are arguably one of the most potent vaccine vectors available today. For example, we demonstrated in a head to head comparison against licensed influenza protein vaccine, replication-defective Ad (RD-Ad) vaccines mediated superior protection against heterologous influenza challenge. In direct comparison in non-human primates, RD-Ad vaccines were more robust than DNA or vaccinia vaccines. While RD-Ad vaccines can be potent when compared to other vaccines, RD-Ad vaccines are actually not the most potent type of Ad vaccine. Most are RD-Ads that are deleted for their E1 gene to block replication primarily to avoid the Ad from causing an actual adenovirus infection in the recipient. An E1-deleted Ad vaccine infects a cell, delivers its one copy of an antigen gene, and express 1X of this protein. In contrast, replication- competent Ads (RC-Ads) retain their E1 gene and can replicate their DNA and antigen genes they carry 10,000-fold in an infected cell. RC-Ads can produce 100's of times the amount of protein and drive substantially stronger immune responses than E1-deleted vectors While RC-Ad are potent, fully replication- competent vaccines can cause frank adenovirus infections in vaccinees or healthcare workers. New Single-cycle Ad (SC-Ad) Vaccines. To harness antigen gene replication and amplified immune responses, but avoid the risk of Ad infection, we recently developed SC-Ads. SC-Ads are engineered to allow them to still replicate their DNA and antigen genes like an RC-Ad, but they cannot produce infectious Ads. In head to head comparisons, SC-Ad required 33 times less vector than RD-Ad to drive the same level of protein expression. When RD- and SC-Ads expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) were used for single intranasal immunization, 100-fold lower doses of SC-Ad were needed to generate hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies than RD-Ad. This suggests that a single production of SC-Ad may be able to vaccinate 100X as many people than RD-Ads. After single intranasal immunization, SC-Ads generate antibodies against HA or against Ebola glycoprotein that rise over months and remain elevated for more than 6 months (and counting). We therefore propose that SC-Ad vaccines are a promising vector platform to combat the emerging Zika virus epidemic. Further, we propose deploying this vaccine as a mucosal vaccine will provide a simple needle-free platform for global vaccination in the face of this potential pandemic. We will test SC-Ad utility against Zika virus in the following aims: Aim 1. Generate and Test SC-Ad Vaccines to Drive Immune Responses against Zika Virus. Aim 2. Test the Ability of SC-Ad Vaccines to Protect Against Zika Virus Challenge in Squirrel Monkeys. Successful testing of the SC-Ad platform against Zika virus will provide key preclinical data to begin translating this new robust vaccine platform for deployment as a simple global vaccine."

The exhibition and programs will focus on current research on the developing brain, up to age 5, and will reach a national audience of adult caregivers of young children and their families, with a special emphasis on Latino families. The project will be developed biculturally and bilingually (English/Spanish) in order to better engage underrepresented Latino audiences. The exhibition and programs will be designed and tested with family audiences. The exhibition project, Wired to Play: Family Learning in Support of Early Brain Development, has four goals that primarily target adult caregivers of children up to age 5:  ? Foster engagement with and interest in neurodevelopment during early childhood  ? Enhance awareness of how neuroscience research leads to knowledge about healthy development in early childhood  ? Inform and empower adult caregivers to enrich their children?s early learning experiences  ? Reach diverse family audiences, especially Latino caregivers and their families A collaborative, multidisciplinary team of neuroscience researchers, experts in early childhood education, museum educators, and OMSI personnel with expertise in informal science education and bilingual exhibit development will work together to ensure that current science is accurately interpreted and effectively presented to reach the target audiences. The project will foster better public understanding of early brain development and awareness and confidence in caregivers in using play to enrich their children?s experiences and support healthy brain development. Visitors will explore neuroscience and early childhood development through a variety of forms?multisensory hands- on interactive exhibits, graphic panels, real objects, facilitated experiences, and an accompanying website. Following the five-year development process, the exhibition will begin an eight-year national tour, during which it will reach more than one million people."

"9558367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asymmetric divisions, in which a polarized cell divides to produce daughters with different fates, contribute to cell fate specification during development as well as stem cell maintenance. The proposed project addresses the molecular mechanisms of spindle positioning and cytokinesis during asymmetric divisions in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. As in other systems, asymmetric division in the C. elegans one-cell embryo relies on a conserved pathway in which the PAR polarity proteins regulate the distribution of components of a non-canonical G protein signaling pathway. We identified LET-99, a member of the DEPDC1 family, as a new player in this pathway. LET-99 is localized in an asymmetric cortical band pattern by the PAR-3 and PAR-1 proteins. LET-99 in turn restricts the cortical localization of the positive regulators of G protein signaling, GPR and LIN-5, to certain regions of the cell cortex. The asymmetric localization of these intermediates is an essential feature of spindle positioning, because GPR and LIN-5 associate with regulators of the microtubule motor dynein to generate the asymmetric cortical pulling forces that move the spindle. Once the spindle is positioned, it signals back to the cortex to determine the plane of cleavage. How the PAR proteins promote asymmetry of spindle positioning factors, and how the G protein pathway is integrated with other signaling mechanisms, remains to be elucidated. The experiments proposed in Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanisms by which the PAR proteins regulate LET-99 asymmetry. The hypothesis that PAR-1 directly phosphorylates LET-99 to inhibit its localization at the posterior cortex will be tested using in vitro kinase assays followed by in vivo transgenic studies. PAR-3 inhibits LET-99 localization at the anterior via a separate mechanism, which will be investigated using a combination of live-imaging and genetic analysis. LET-99 interacting proteins will also be tested for a role in LET-99 cortical anchoring. The goal of Aim 2 is to determine how the LET-99/G? pathway is integrated with Rho-family GTPase signaling to properly position the cytokinesis furrow relative to the spindle. Quantitative analysis of localization patterns in mutants combined with biochemical interaction assays will be used to determine how these pathways interact. The hypothesis that LET-99 directly binds Rho GTPases via its partial RhoGAP domain will also be tested. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the human orthologs of LET-99, DEPDC1 and DEPDC1B, have a similar function to LET-99. Specifically we will test the hypothesis that these proteins associate with G? or Rho and are involved in spindle movements or cytokinesis. Because of the conservation of pathway components, the results of these studies will be relevant to asymmetric division in many systems and will define the function of a novel class of proteins, the DEPDC1 family."
"9315544","ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer with 134,490 new cases each year. Unfortunately, CRC results in a disproportionate number of deaths (49,190 projected in 2016) due to advanced stage at diagnosis, the aggressive phenotype of the disease and lack of effective therapeutics. Greater than 90% of CRC patients possess activating mutations in the WNT signaling pathway. WNT pathway activation is a critical step in the initiation of CRC tumorigenesis. Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs or drugs in late-stage clinical trials that target the WNT pathway. As a result, here is an urgent need for the development of inhibitors of the WNT pathway to treat not only CRC, but other WNT-driven cancers. StemSynergy Therapeutics Inc. (SSTI) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic approaches to target critical cancer stem cells, including WNT, Hedgehog and Notch. SSTI has identified a class of small molecules that regulate WNT signaling via activation of Casein Kinase 1?? In this application, we describe detailed characterization of mechanism of action, demonstrate SST-215 functions downstream of activating mutations found in CRC to produce excellent in vitro potency in a range of CRC cell lines and provide significant in vivo efficacy data using various genetic and xenograft models in mice. Significantly, SST-215 does NOT affect normal GI architecture, which is in contrast to two other major classes of WNT inhibitors currently being developed where GI toxicity is dose limiting. This Phase IIb application outlines the next logical steps in the development of SST-215: completion of rodent and non-rodent safety studies, IND preparation and initiation of a Phase I clinical trial for advanced or metastatic cancer. Successful completion of this Phase IIb project will provide all of the necessary studies for progression to proof-of-concept Phase II efficacy study in humans and accomplish the mission of the SBIR program of supporting small businesses in bringing forward innovative solutions to major public health concerns. The WNT pathway plays a role in many different cancer subtypes and because there are no drugs on the market that target the WNT pathway, by continuing to move SST-215 through the oncology development pipeline, SSTI has the potential to improve and prolong the lives of millions of cancer patients worldwide. The multi-disciplinary R&D team at SSTI has strong credentials and experience in all relevant areas, enabling us to complete the key science and business aspects of the development. As part of our commercialization plan, SSTI is collaborating with Geneyus, LLC (funded by Three Seasons Capital) to provide matching funds for this application, as well as significant follow-on commercialization funding contingent on SSTI meeting the milestones outlined herein. In summary, we provide strong preclinical data supporting the molecular targeting, therapeutic efficacy and preliminary safety studies for SST-215 justifying transition to the next stages of development, non-human primate safety studies and a phase I clinical trial. Support of this Phase IIb application will ensure that SST-215 does not succumb to delays in development due to funding and will support SSTI bringing to market a first generation of WNT inhibitors to capture a significant share of the global market for cancer drugs."
"9349391","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Making up almost half of the human genome, transposons are the most abundant residents in almost all animal genomes. These presumed selfish junk DNA sequences represent a potential mutagenic source able to wreak havoc on genome stability and integrity. While a significant amount of research work has shown that germ cells exploit a germline specific small RNA system, the piRNA pathway, to silence transposons in animal gonads, we know surprisingly little about transposon activity and the mechanisms that control transposons in somatic tissues. It has long been assumed that transposons barely move in somatic cells. This conclusion could largely be due to the insensitive tools that have been used to measure transposon mobilization. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that transposition occurs during normal neurogenesis and embryogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that there are comparable numbers of insertion events in somatic tissues and ovaries during fruit fly development. Interestingly, it has been documented that transposons become highly active in aged cells, following environmental stress or during tumorigenesis. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that transposons contribute to animal development, aging and disease progression. To test this hypothesis, I will first establish a robust platform to capture single transposition events with single cell resolution and determine their insertion sites with base-pair resolution (aim 1). Based on the encouraging preliminary data we have, in the second aim, I will apply our platform to study transposon activities in astrocytes and explore potential functions of transposons in these most abundant brain cells. To understand mechanisms that underlie transposon control in somatic tissue, I will also perform a genome wide mutagenesis screen to identify the components that are required to tame transposons. In the third aim, I will focus on the transposon activities during aging, which is a primary factor fo many devastating diseases, and examine the potential impacts of transposons on aging and aging-associated disease. Collectively, these studies develop new tools to study transposon activity and potential function, characterize new paradigms to understand animal development, aging and disease progression, and potentially provide new perspective to treat diseases by harnessing transposons."
"9392443","PROJECT SUMMARY A justifiable lack of access to human embryos for experimental purposes has presented a longstanding barrier to the in vitro investigation of human organogenesis. To circumvent this impasse, the overall goal of this R21 proposal is to establish a powerful new 3-D experimental model system that recapitulates key structural and biophysical elements of the embryonic niche environment to enable investigation of human cardiac morphogenesis and development. We propose a synergistic combination of innovative bioreactor design, state-of-the-art human pluripotent stem cell biology, and cutting-edge human cardiac tissue engineering technology, with a quantitative approach based on sound bioengineering principles. The strategy is to develop a microfluidics based bioreactor system to grow endocardial tubes, myocardium, and cardiac jelly using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endocardial cells in order to study the early developmental stages of heart tube formation in vitro. By providing fluid shear forces, mechanical constraints, and morphogen gradients similar to those experienced by the developing heart tube, and by seeding the bioreactor with spatially compartmentalized cell types in starting positions that mimic the primitive anatomy, we aim to provide a niche environment in which they can begin building a heart as they would in nature. The two specific aims of this proposal are consistent with the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Bioengineering Research Grant mechanism (PA-16-040): Aim 1 is to develop a microfluidic bioreactor with boundary constraints and flow control for the creation and evaluation of engineered morphogenetic human heart organoids. Aim 2 is to establish an in vitro model of human congenital heart tube malformation, exploring chemical and genetic interventions known to cause heterotaxy in vivo. This exploratory and developmental proposal offers a desperately needed and potentially disruptive leap forward in the sophistication of available in vitro human model systems. The multidisciplinary expertise of the research team, combined with the available state-of-the-art resources and facilities, provides a unique opportunity to overcome the anticipated technical challenges and successfully achieve the proposed aims. This is therefore considered a high-risk, high-impact proposal, likely to yield new tools and insights for understanding the process of cardiac tube formation, for creating more realistic multi-tissue heart organoids, and for eventually studying diseases related to cardiac structural defects using a unique anatomical in vitro 3-D human heart model system."

Using a combination of behavioral, neuroimaging (fMRI), and computational modeling techniques, Aim 1 examines how external shifts of attention affect perceptual and neural representations of visual information that is visible to the eyes, while Aim 2 examines how internal shifts of attention modulate information maintained in visual working memory. Together, these aims demonstrate how dynamic changes of attentional focus can impact?and distort?our perception of the world, and provide insight into how humans flexibly prioritize information that is more or less relevant for current behavioral goals. The current proposal adopts a novel approach of measuring specific visual information in the mind and in the brain by combining computational models of behavior with computational models of neural activity?which may be ultimately integrated into a cohesive theory for the perceptual and neural mechanisms of visual stability. This research will have an immediate impact on the understanding of typical visual functioning in healthy human populations. While the proposed work is rooted in basic science, these advances would have a longer-term translational impact on public health, by informing the knowledge, assessment, and treatment of clinical disorders that are characterized by deficits in visual processing (e.g., schizophrenia, autism, ADHD). This research thus complements several training goals that will help the applicant acquire new technical skills and theoretical knowledge to prepare for a future career as an independent investigator."
"9436072","Project Summary/Abstract Tumor research has entered an exciting phase with the advent of single cell sequencing techniques, which have the potential to revolutionize the profiling of genome variation at the highest cellular resolutions. However, the state-of-the-art single-cell sequencing technologies produce data with too many uncertainties and errors, which impedes tumor research and discourages the use of such advanced techniques. We will develop innovative evolution-aware methods that will significantly improve the accuracy of single-cell sequences, accelerating the advances on the understanding of tumor heterogeneity and evolution. Specifically, our first aim will be to develop a Bayesian Evolutionary-Aware Method (BEAM) to impute missing data and correct errors in single cell sequences. Our second aim will be to advance BEAM so that it can efficiently use variation profiles from bulk-sequencing cell population profiling data to further enhance the accuracy of single-cell sequences. To aid researchers, we will produce a freely-available software for high-throughput analysis of tumor genomic data. Ultimately, the proposed software and research developments will lead to advances in cancer evolution, bioinformatics, and biomedicine. New software and its source code will be made available free of charge for research, education, and training."
"9507559","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual loss in the elderly. Despite knowledge of the cell types involved, therapeutic intervention has been limited and there is currently no treatment for nonexudative AMD. While RPE cell transplantation into the subretinal space of patients offered a promising therapeutic approach, outcomes to date have been limited due to: 1) transplantation in late stage disease, 2) the invasive route of administration, and 3) incomplete differentiation status of the transplanted cells. To address these limitations, we have made a number of exciting discoveries: 1) forced expression of the RPE65 gene allows mouse hematopoietic stem cells (mHSC), when injected back into the circulation, to home to the retina and renew the RPE monolayer in both acute and chronic mouse models of RPE loss and re-establish visual function; 2) the circadian pattern to endogenous HSC release impacts reconstitution following bone marrow transplantation; 3) microglial activation in AMD will require modulation to ensure efficient RPE regeneration by HSCs; 4) a highly effective non-viral protein delivery machinery (T3SS) is able to deliver target proteins into host HSCs and promote their differentiation; 5) human hematopoietic progenitor cells (hHPCs), when programmed with RPE65, express RPE cell markers. Based on these observations we hypothesize that: Successful therapeutic utilization of human or murine HSC requires their programming prior to injection into the systemic circulation, their injection at the time of optimal engraftment potential and preconditioning of the retina by either suppression of resident microglia activation and/or restoring the balance of peripheral pro-inflammatory and homeostatic monocytes. The hypothesis is addressed in three Aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the dependence of recruitment and incorporation of programmed mHSC into the injured RPE in the SOD2 KD mouse model upon the time of day of injection and the age of the donor HSC as well as the age of the recipient. Aim 2 will investigate the importance of manipulating the retinal environment, by controlling either the activation state of the resident microglia or the influx of peripheral monocytes on the efficiency of systemically administered programmed mHSC to repair the RPE layer in the SOD2 KD model. Aim 3 will translate our mouse findings into hHPCs. We will express RPE65, in human CD133+, CD 34- , CD38- cells to differentiate these cells toward RPE cells and allow RPE regeneration in SCID mice undergoing the SOD2 KD model. Co-injection of mesenchymal stem cells will be utilized to reduce activation of resident microglia. Our approach overcomes many of the current limitations of human stem cell therapies for AMD."
"9311258","Project Summary  The inflammatory disorders of the pancreas have two forms, acute and chronic. Acute pancreatitis causes severe illness and reduces life expectancy. However, besides supportive care, there is no effective treatment for the disease due to a lack of understanding of the early cellular events important in the pathophysiology of this disease. Not only is chronic pancreatitis as bad in that it does not heal or improve and only gets worse over time leading to permanent damage of the pancreas, it is also the top risk factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Similar to the acute form, there is no effective treatment for this disease. This tissue damage causes a rapid sterile inflammatory response (SIR) characterized by edema, immune cell infiltration, and further acinar cell death. A lot of evidence points towards the SIR having a vital role in pancreatic damage, but the crucial link between acinar cell injury and initiation of the SIR has not been well understood. The Hippo signaling pathway is best known for its ability in controlling organ size, cell proliferation and regeneration. Noticeably, this pathway responds to various upstream stimuli such as mechanical signals, cellular stress, extracellular stimuli and adhesion cues, making it a good candidate as a microenvironment sensor for epithelial cells to orchestrate the inflammatory response during tissue injury and repair. Nevertheless, the role of the Hippo pathway in directly regulating inflammatory reactions has not been investigated. Our preliminary data showed that inactivation of the Hippo pathway by knocking out Lats1&2, specifically in acinar cells, rapidly induced the inflammatory response in the pancreas. Notably, our unpublished data indicated that this inflammatory response was not the secondary effect caused by the death of Lats1&2 deficient acinar cells, suggesting the novel function of the Hippo pathway to directly regulate epithelial-immune cell interactions. We hypothesize that YAP/TAZ mediated transcription in Hippo pathway- inactivated pancreatic acinar cells plays important roles in recruiting and educating immune cells to orchestrate the inflammatory response. Our hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims. First, we will test the hypothesis that expression of YAP1 or TAZ are necessary for induction of pro-inflammatory genes in Lats1&2 null pancreatic acinar cells using a genetic approach. Second, we will investigate how YAP and TAZ induce inflammation through transcriptional regulation. Third, we will test the hypothesis that Yap and/or Taz are necessary for the inflammation and fibrosis associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis. Our proposal will not only investigate the novel functions of Hippo pathways, but will also address the fundamental mechanisms by which epithelial cells specify the communication with immune cells during inflammation. Our research will have important implications to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases in the pancreas and for potential therapeutic development."
"9340114","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Pediatric Nephrology Training Program at the University of Washington (UW) is to educate a diverse group of young pediatricians to become physician-scientists and future academic leaders in Pediatric Nephrology. This will be accomplished by an intense year of clinical training, supported by institutional funds, followed by at least two years of comprehensive research training in one of three available research pathways: clinical, translational or basic science. Trainees who graduate from this program are board-eligible in Pediatric Nephrology and expected to assume faculty positions at academic institutions. Over the past 10 years all positions in this program have been filled and 100% of matriculated fellows have successfully completed the 3- year program; the majority of graduates are at academic institutions and have maintained an interest in research. The program (years 25-30) is seeking continued funding to support four MD, DO or MD/PhD pediatrician trainees annually. The need for this training is clear based on continued manpower shortage projections and the need for new scientific discoveries to prevent, recognize/diagnose and treat kidney disease in the pediatric age group. As a group, the pediatric nephrologists are the oldest board-certified pediatric specialty in this country - the average age is 57.8 years. Many of the primary disease processes that account for the growing chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemic, estimated to affect 14% of the adult population (and known to be an important risk amplifier for cardiovascular events and mortality), actually begin in childhood, mandating greater involvement of pediatric nephrologists in research and clinical care pertaining to childhood antecedents of adult CKD and its complications. Children with chronic (prevalence unknown) and end-stage kidney disease (over 7,000 in the USA) also impose several unique medical challenges pertaining to growth, development, social and emotional needs as examples. To accomplish our training goals, each trainee will receive extensive experience in one of three research focus areas that have been selected on the basis of several criteria that include importance to the clinical practice of pediatric nephrology, established and/or emerging research expertise of the division faculty, and the availability of outstanding research faculty mentors outside the division at UW who are committed to training the fellows in our program. These research areas are: acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease, immunology/infectious diseases and the kidney, and genetics, developmental biology and disease processes. Given the tremendous healthcare burden of CKD, this program continues its dedication to training a diverse group of young pediatricians as physician-scientists who can sustain and eventually lead the charge to prevent, treat and eliminate childhood-onset kidney diseases through novel research-driven discoveries."
"9340230","PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a debilitating disease, resulting in loss of peripheral vision and eventual total blindness if not treated adequately. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma in Western and African nations. While the exact etiology of POAG remains unknown, it is clearly a group of heterogeneous disorders frequently associated with elevated intraocular pressure. Pedigree studies utilizing large POAG families are a powerful method to identify rare genetic variants that predispose individuals to glaucoma. By focusing on one family, the complexity of this disease can be reduced to a simpler form that is more likely to have one causal event. In a large POAG family we recently identified a mutation in interleukin- 20 receptor B (IL-20RB), which is predicted to impact binding of the receptor to the IL-20 family of cytokines. All affected patients in this family have high intraocular pressures (>22mm Hg). Our hypothesis is that the IL-20 signaling pathway functions to regulate aqueous outflow and the T104M mutation in IL-20RB results in defective propagation of signals in POAG patients. The aim of this grant is to gain a better understanding of how a mutation in a critical site in IL- 20RB leads to elevated intraocular pressure and ultimately to glaucoma. The trabecular meshwork is the tissue in the anterior of the eye that functions to regulate intraocular pressure. IL-20 signaling in trabecular meshwork cells will be investigated using two model systems - perfused anterior segments and mechanical stretch of trabecular meshwork cells. Binding of the IL-20 cytokine subfamily to the IL-20 type I and type II heterodimeric receptors containing the mutant T104M IL-20RB protein will be analyzed using plasmon resonance. We will determine the downstream effect of defective signaling through the mutant IL-20RB receptor using mechanical stretch of patient mutant and wild-type fibroblasts. The proposed work has great potential for leading to new insights into the function of the IL-20 family of signaling molecules in regulating aqueous outflow and intraocular pressure. This is the first step to developing improved therapy for this blinding disease."
"9494963","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in defining protein functions in biological systems. Aberrant PPIs can have drastic impacts on basic cellular processes, and thus lead to various human diseases. PPI interfaces have recently become a new paradigm for therapeutics. Therefore, mapping PPIs and their interaction interfaces in living cells is not only fundamental to understanding protein function and regulation but also vital to identifying potential targets for better therapeutics. Previously we have developed an integrated approach termed QTAX to effectively capture and identify static and dynamic protein interactions in order to provide a more authentic snapshot of protein interaction networks as they exist in living cells. To advance the study of in vivo PPIs beyond interaction identities, we have successfully developed an in vivo cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) platform based on a novel membrane permeable, enrichable and MS-cleavable cross-linker, i.e. Azide-A-DSBSO, and multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MSn). This strategy has been successfully applied to map PPIs at the proteome scale and the protein complex level. This technological advancement signifies a leap forward in studying in vivo PPIs and offers an essential framework for us to further develop novel technologies towards the ultimate goal of defining in vivo dynamics of protein complexes at the systems level. The 26S proteasome is the protein complex responsible for ubiquitin/ATP dependent protein degradation. Dysregulation of proteasomal degradation has been implicated in many diseases. Up to now, the high-resolution structure of the 26S proteasome remains unresolved and its regulation is poorly defined. Therefore, detailed structural analysis of the human 26S proteasome complex will be critical to uncover molecular details underlying its function and regulation. To this end, we propose 1) to develop the next generation of multifunctional cross-linkers for defining PPIs of protein complexes in living cells, 2) to develop a quantitative XL-MS strategy for charting in vivo dynamics of the human 26S proteasome upon H2O2-induced oxidative stress, 3) to dissect the interaction dynamics of the human 26S proteasome and its associated deubiquitinases. The proposed experiments will not only result in an exciting technological advancement in proteomics research, but also help address important yet unresolved biological questions associated with proteasomal biology and its relevance to human diseases."
"9374995","ABSTRACT  Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) provide no mechanism of disease. Moving from GWAS to mechanism requires priori knowledge of cis-regulatory elements (CREs), as most risk variants reside in noncoding regions. Therefore, methods for defining noncoding networks consisting of CREs and their gene targets are essential. Current methods for CRE prediction are based on histone marks, transcription factor binding, and evolutionary sequence conservation. These methods have high sensitivity, but poor specificity. For example, over 6k enhancers were reported in human heart. Subsequent methods to predict CRE targets inherit poor specificity. Here, we propose new strategy to precisely predict risk CREs and target genes from noncoding and coding transcriptomes. Emerging evidence suggests that functional CREs are themselves transcribed.  We posit that tissue-specific expression in CRE transcripts can quantitatively define prioritize functional CREs from candidate loci. We posit that a CRE transcript and its gene targets coordinately expressed, providing a quantitative measure of CRE-target gene activity. We will utilize CRE transcription to prioritize CREs harboring candidate functional genetic variation. To this end, we need to systematically mine multi-scale high-throughput data, which requires efficient bioinformatics methods. In this proposal, we will develop a non-coding transcriptome model. First, we will integrate haplotype blocks of GWAS findings, disease-dependent noncoding expression, and distal chromatin interaction into a computational prioritization of CRE-promoter pairs. We will introduce our ?soft threshold?-algorithm to assess chromatin accessible CREs together with their transcribed ncRNAs. Second, building on our early success of PGnet algorithm, we will build a tripartite network (disease traits, CRE variants, and target genes) with a nonparametric model to infer risk CREs and gene targets. We will develop novel gene-based association and compared to PrediXscan. We will compare our prediction with TargetFinder. Collaborated with an expert in cardiac conduction system, I select atrial fibrillation (AF) as a research platform. AF is the most common human arrhythmias, affecting over 33 million people worldwide. The deliverables of this project will include critical cardiac rhythm CREs, CRE variants, and target genes. The ultimate goal of this work is an evaluated computational model to set the stage for future functional evaluations. This new analytic suit to define AF-associated noncoding regulatory pathway will have border implication on other diseases."
"9308688","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The decline in kidney function is unrelenting in many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite current therapies. Animal studies show that a systemic acid load induces kidney generation of pro-fibrotic mediators and kidney injury. Single-center clinical studies have further found that chronic alkali treatment, such as with oral sodium bicarbonate, is renoprotective in people with low, or even normal, serum bicarbonate concentrations. These promising results are underscored by the emphasis of this therapy as a potential clinical trial intervention in a 2011 NIDDK Conference and the specific suggestion by the present RFA. Before a large definitive trial can be undertaken, however, it is important to examine carefully the tolerability, compliance and safety features of various doses of oral bicarbonate. The present application for a pilot study is designed precisely for this purpose. In a two-center, single-blind pilot study, 140 patients with albuminuric stage 3-4 CKD and low-to-normal serum bicarbonate concentrations (20 - 26 meq/L) will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: (i) low- dose oral sodium bicarbonate (0.4 meq/kg lean body weight/day; n = 52), (ii) high-dose oral sodium bicarbonate (0.7 meq/kg lean body weight/day; n = 52), or (iii) placebo for one-year. The major objectives are to assess: (i) the tolerability and compliance of low-dose and high-dose sodium bicarbonate by performing pill counts and measuring changes in urinary net acid excretion (NAE), (ii) the safety profile of low-dose and high- dose sodium bicarbonate using clinical parameters, such as blood pressure, and coronary artery calcium score assessed by computed tomography scan, and (iii) the efficacy of low-dose and high-dose sodium bicarbonate on two kidney-injury biomarkers (albumin and N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidase) in the urine. Built into this parallel design is an initial one-month period to determine the relationship between various bicarbonate doses (0.2 - 0.7 meq/kg lean body weight/day) and urinary NAE in a pragmatic setting. The results from this pilot study will help to design the large, definitive trial by delineating the tolerability, compliance, and safety featuresof two rational doses of chronic oral sodium bicarbonate therapy. While the intermediate efficacy (urinary biomarker) results of this pilot study will also be informative, inconclusive efficacy results will not preclude the planning of a large trial, since positive results using glomerular filtration rate as an outcome have already been demonstrated in previous small trials. Chronic oral sodium bicarbonate is a promising adjunct therapy to slow CKD. If its renoprotective effects can be demonstrated in a large definitive trial, the broad applicability of this inexpensive therap will significantly transform clinical practice and have major public health implications."
"9559750","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the first renewal application for the UC Davis postdoctoral T32 program in Oncogenic Signals and Chromosome Biology. This training program takes advantage of the integrated strength of the Molecular Oncology Program at the UC Davis NCI-designated Cancer Center and the exceptional expertise and training records of the participating faculty members in oncogenic signals and chromosome biology. The program involves 30 trainers, including three National Academy members, who also form the backbone of the Molecular Oncology Program. Every trainer maintains an active, extramurally funded research program. The participating faculty members represent diverse disciplines but share a common topical focus. A strong clinical research component at the Cancer Center facilitates the translational aspect of this program, with further support from the UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center. Over the first funding period, the training program attracted an outstanding cohort of 12 highly talented postdoctoral fellows to UC Davis. Remarkably, five of these fellows have already moved on to very competitive, individual fellowships from NIH, DOD, and CBCRP to continue their training in cancer biology. The training program has developed an innovative and effective array of curricular activities that provide formal training in oncogenic signals and chromosome biology, education in the responsible conduct of research, and individual mentoring. A rich and diverse array of seminars, conferences, discussion groups, workshops, and retreats provide opportunities to present research progress and broaden the training experience beyond the trainer's laboratory. The training program added significant value above supporting trainees, as it serviced a cohort of 117, including 39 training grant eligible, postdoctoral fellows, who actively participate in some training grant activities. An effective administrative structure is in place that is further refined in this renewal. A director and a co-director administer the program, with guidance by an active executive committee. Each member of the executive committee actively maintains a specific portfolio to enhance the program activities. To further develop the training program, we have created a four-member Advisory Board. The two external advisors are directors of comparable cancer-oriented training programs, and one also serves on the External Advisory Board of the UC Davis Cancer Center with responsibility for the Molecular Oncology Program. The two internal members are highly experienced mentors and include the Executive Associate Dean of the School of Medicine, who is an authority in training and mentoring. The training program aims to prepare our trainees for independent research careers in academic or research institutions, biotechnology industries, or government laboratories."
"9355722","PROJECT SUMMARY Human ?-Synuclein (h?S) aggregation is considered as a primary mechanism of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease(PD). Accordingly, the theory of cell-to-cell propagation of h?S aggregates is well- accepted, as it can reasonably explain progressive propagation of h?S pathology and associated neuronal degeneration in PD. On the other hand, the theory does not account for trigger for h?S aggregation. Our recent study suggested that one possible explanation for initial h?S aggregation in PD and related disorders may be disruption of nuclear membrane integrity, as occurs during apoptosis. This exposes cytoplasmic h?S to proaggregant nuclear factors, which remain to be determined, but could include histones. Aggregates released in the immediate vicinity of the affected neurons may template h?S in nearby neurons that may then spread by cell-to-cell propagation, leading to more distant neurodegeneration. Conditions that limit clearance of apoptotic bodies (e.g., age-associated declines in immune competence) would be predicted to accelerate the process. Accordingly, pathological h?S might be at least, in part, a secondary phenomenon associated with loss of nuclear membrane integrity or neuronal apoptosis instead of primary event in the pathogenic cascade of PD. It remains to be seen if abnormal conformers of h?S may compromise nuclear membrane integrity.  In our previous study in support of our hypothesis, we have exogenously inoculated mice brains with h?S aggregates generated from apoptotic neuronal cultures to test neuronal uptake in vivo. In this proposal, we will introduce the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase(HSVtk)/ ganciclovir(GCV) system, a well- established strategy for drug induction of cell apoptosis in cancer therapy, to PD research for the first time and perform stereotaxic brain injection of lentivirus into bilateral substantial nigra (SN) of a mouse line to overexpress both HSVtk and Myc-h?S via lentivirus infection. The animals are from a human ?S transgenic mouse line without any observable pathology throughout the life cycle. Upon GCV administration, this mouse model is expected to self-generate transmissible filamentous Myc-h?S aggregates whose spreading can be tracked by histologically detecting Myc tag. We will investigate in vivo how the initial self-generated Myc-h?S aggregates seed subsequent aggregation of normal non-pathological h?S and whether such propagation of h?S pathology can cause further neuron loss beyond the SN regions. To our knowledge, this PD mouse model will be the first one able to conditionally generate transmissible filamentous h?S aggregates for spatio- temporally tracking propagation of h?S aggregates originated in SN regions. We expect that this study can provide more direct evidence to support our hypothesis, and Braak staging theory as well."
"9383150","Precision oncology requires delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right time, but ?time? is rarely studied preclinically before a new drug enters the clinic. As a result, drugs shown to prevent progression of advanced/metastatic solid tumors are sometimes found to be ineffective at preventing recurrence when administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings. The long-term clinical benefit realized from adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies lies in anti-cancer effects on residual/disseminated/micrometastatic, clinically dormant cancer cells that are undetectable by routine clinical methods; the biology underlying such anti-cancer effects is practically unknown, creating a gap for evaluating new drugs. Clinically dormant cancer cells that survive (neo)adjuvant therapy can ultimately give rise to recurrent/advanced tumors that frequently develop resistance to all approved therapies. Thus, understanding how clinically dormant cancer cells vs. established tumors respond to a novel therapy will guide clinical testing in the appropriate disease setting(s), and reveal targets for combination therapies to enhance efficacy. More thorough characterization of drug efficacy in relevant preclinical models will increase the drug success rate in clinical trials, thus decreasing the cost of drug development. Estrogen receptor ? (ER)-positive breast cancer is a disease for which improved drug development could ultimately impact treatment options for hundreds of thousands of patients. Patients with early-stage ER+ breast cancer are treated with adjuvant anti-estrogen therapies that neutralize ER and suppress, but do not eliminate, tumor-initiating cells. We and others have implicated activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in anti-estrogen resistance, and PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) are in clinical development in combination with anti-estrogens. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that short-term treatment with anti-estrogen/PI3Ki combination therapy kills clinically dormant ER+ breast cancer cells and prevents recurrence (Aim 2), while established tumors develop resistance to anti- estrogen/PI3Ki therapy via suppression of apoptosis (Aim 1) due in part to microenvironmental cytokine signaling (Aim 3). We will test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine why anti- estrogen/PI3Ki combination therapy is acutely but not sustainably cytotoxic in established ER+ breast tumors; 2) To determine how clinically dormant ER+ breast tumor cells respond to short-term anti-estrogen/PI3Ki combination therapy; 3) To identify cytokines in stroma-derived secretomes that drive resistance to anti- estrogen and anti-estrogen/PI3Ki therapies in ER+ breast cancer. These studies are aligned with the NCI Precision Medicine Initiative of Overcoming Drug Resistance, the Cancer Moonshot Panel recommendation to develop ways to overcome cancer's resistance to therapy, and the NCI Provocative Question `What cancer models or other approaches can be developed to study clinically stable disease and the subsequent transition to progressive disease?'"
"9340299","Epigenetic regulation via covalent histone modifications plays an important role in dictating developmental processes and cell fate determination. It complements to genetic information and provides additional regulatory mechanisms in response to fast changing cellular and organismal environment during development. Recent studies show that mutations in histone modifying enzymes often skew the normal development ?roadmap? and consequently lead to human diseases. PRDM16 plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of multiple adult stem cells including neural stem cells. Importantly, Prdm16 deletion in mice leads to multiple brain defects including microcephaly, disrupted cerebral cortex and agenesis of the corpus callosum. However, it remains unclear how PRDM16 regulate functions of neural progenitor cells and how its deletion leads to disruption of normal neurogenesis. We have recently found that PRDM16 is a histone methyltransferase that methylate histone H3. This finding links PRDM16 deletion to deregulation of epigenetic modifications in neural stem cells, which play essential roles in define transcription circuitries in stem cells that define cellular identity."
"9341335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the University of Pennsylvania's Post-baccalaureate Research and Education Program (PennPrep) is to guide recent college graduates from underrepresented (UR) groups into graduate school to pursue biomedical research.  Up to 10 UR scholars are identified each year who are interested in biomedical research but lack the experience or expertise necessary for graduate school training.  Each scholar is matched with a research mentor among the graduate training faculty and provided with a significant one year (or possibly longer) research project.  An Individual Student Development Plan (IDP) is developed for each scholar with help from an advising committee to ensure that the scholar undertakes training appropriate to his or her own scientific needs and interests, including graduate or advanced undergraduate coursework. In addition, scholars develop the skills necessary for success in graduate school by completing workshops in biostatistics, wet lab techniques, the responsible conduct of research, critical analysis of scientific literature, and oral and written presentation skills. Scholars also participate in a one on-one writing workshop with a professional writing instructor. Scholars meet weekly as a group to discuss scientific journal articles and their own research in order to further develop their skils in the critical evaluation of research and the delivery of scientific presentations, as well as to increase their exposure to research outside their own laboratory.  In addition, scholars receive advising for the graduate school application process, including selecting programs, writing application essays, and practicing interviews.  If necessary, scholars will take a GRE or MCAT preparation course.  Scholars also participate in various lunches and seminars with Penn faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, who share their training experiences, on-going research, and academic paths.  As of 2012, scholars meet annually with scholars, faculty, and advisors of PREP programs at other institutions in order to network and gain additional perspectives.  Finally, all PREP scholars are expected to attend a national conference each year, such as ABRCMS or a discipline-specific meeting as an additional means of broadening exposure to research and establishing networks.  Mechanisms are in place for measuring the effectiveness of the program's various components and improving the training experience over time. The ultimate measure of the program's success is the percentage of scholars who are admitted to PhD or MD-PhD training programs and pursue a research career. In PennPrep's 8 year history, more than 80% of scholars who have completed the program have been admitted to PhD or MD-PhD programs."
"9353316","Lenalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide, is a transformative therapy for a subset of patients with  myelodysplastic syndrome, and has demonstrated promise in early clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the mechanism of lenalidomide activity in myeloid malignancies is not known. We have identified and validated an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL4-CRBN, as a direct target of lenalidomide, consistent with previous reports that this complex is targeted by thalidomide. We hypothesize that the pleitropic effects of lenalidomide, including its therapeutic efficacy in myeloid malignancies, is due to altered ubiquitination of targets ofthe CRL4-CRBN ubiqutin ligase. In Aim 1, we will use a recentiy developed proteomic approach to define the proteins that are differentially ubiquitinated in AML cells in response to lenalidomide, and we will validate that these proteins are direct targets of the CRL4-CRBN ubiquifin ligase using genetic tools and biochemical assays. In Aim 2, we will use similar approaches to define the molecular basis of the immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide that lead to alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment.  These effects may be critical for the therapeutic efficacy of lenalidomide. In Aim 3, we will investigate how altered ubiquitination of specific proteins may sensitize cells to additional therapies. Significant responses to lenalidomide as a single agent have been reported in AML, but only a subset of pafients respond, and complete remissions are of short duration. We will therefore seek to improve the therapeutic potential of lenalidomide by examing combinations with addifional therapies in collaboration with each of the other projects in this POl. In addition, we will examine ubiquitinated proteins and genetic abnormalities in patients treated with lenalidomide plus induction chemotherapy in a clinical trial proposed in Project 5. These studies will elucidate a novel mechanism for a cancer therapy, the direct targeting of a specific ubiquitin ligase with both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous effects. In addition, we will identify novel combinations of lenalidomide with additional agents to develop more efficacious treatments for AML."
"9346674","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural circuit formation is a critical step of brain development, and disruption of neural circuit formation causes many birth conditions. The formation of a functional circuit requires the intricate orchestration of multiple steps, including fate determination, migration, axon/dendrite differentiation, axon growth, and synapse formation and elimination. However it is still unclear how individual neurons are assembled into the functional circuits during development. Here, we propose to use the development of a defined neuronal circuit in Caenorhabditis elegans-the RME circuit- to study molecular mechanisms of neural circuit formation. RME circuit development utilizes all the critical steps of mammalian cortex development and involves neuron- neuron, neuron-glia, and neuron-muscle interactions. This system has enabled us to analyze neural circuit formation from the birth of neurons to the maturation of functional circuits. In this proposal we focus on address two important questions: how do glial cells instruct neuronal polarity through gap junctions, and what is the local regulatory mechanism of the cell death pathway in synapse elimination. In our preliminary studies we uncovered a previous unknown function of glial cells during neuronal development in which glial cells form gap junctions with nearby neurons to regulate microtubule polarity and neuronal polarity. We propose studies of the molecular mechanism underlying this observation. The final step of the circuit formation is refinement of synaptic connections through synapse elimination. We found that local activation of the cell death pathway is required for synapse elimination, and this local activation needs the presence of mitochondria. In this application we outline a strategy to address the long time questions in the field: how the apoptotic pathway is locally activated without causing cell death, and what are the downstream targets of caspases in neuronal development. Completion of this proposal will lead to the discovery of novel mechanisms of neural circuit formation, establish the development of RME circuit as a powerful model to study neural circuit formation, and generate new tools for further studies. Given that many neural disorders are associated with defects in neural circuit formation, it is hopeful that this project will help to understand brain development under both physiological and pathological conditions."

"9468949","Project Summary  As the main detoxification organ that is routinely exposed to environmental insults, hepatocytes of the adult liver retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and restore the original mass upon injury and tissue loss. However, massive injury can lead to liver failure, and chronic injury can cause liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. For example, acetaminophen overdose can lead to hepatic oxidative injury by glutathione depletion. Currently, the genetic regulation of organ repair is only partially understood, and novel insights will aid the development of innovative treatments for liver disease. The mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI), an inborn error of tyrosine metabolism caused by the loss of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), provides an excellent system to study liver regeneration. FAH deficiency leads to toxic metabolite accumulation and hepatocyte death. The drug 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3- cyclohexanedione (NTBC) prevents hepatocyte death in both HTI patients and Fah-/- mice by inhibiting an upstream metabolic enzyme, which blocks toxin formation. I previously used the Fah-/- model combined with translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to obtain RNA from repopulating hepatocytes. High-throughput sequencing (TRAP-seq) identified multiple genes involved in GSH metabolism as the most highly induced. In particular, the top hit was Slc7a11, which encodes the cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT), imports cystine for glutathione synthesis to defend against oxidative stress. Therefore, I hypothesize that xCT upstream of GSH synthesis plays a central role in redox regulation in repopulating hepatocytes.  In Aim 1, I will test the function of Slc7a11 during liver regeneration. I will employ cDNA and shRNA constructs targeting Slc7a11 to perform overexpression and loss-of-function studies, respectively, to investigate the degree to which xCT controls liver regeneration following toxic injury. I will also administer erastin, an xCT inhibitor, to Fah-/- mice and determine its effects on liver repopulation. In Aim 2, I propose to establish an in vivo model that allows for quantitative detection and spatiotemporal mapping of redox dynamics during liver regeneration. I will utilize the Fah-/- model and integrate a ratiometric GFP biosensor specific to glutathione redox potential (Grx1-RoGFP) to detect cytoplasmic glutathione redox potential changes during liver repopulation. This study will address the question of whether replicating hepatocytes have higher or lower redox states relative to quiescent hepatocytes. In addition, I will perturb the level of expression of Slc7a11 and to assess the effect on the liver?s redox state.  This study will provide an in-depth understanding of temporal and regional specificity of redox regulation during liver repopulation and will identify novel potential targets that might be employed for the treatment of acute liver injury by inducing hepatocyte replication."

"9344706","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) is a promising therapy for restoring consciousness in patients in coma and vegetative state by changing the arousal state. Early experimental studies have established a causal link between central thalamus electrical brain stimulation and forebrain arousal. Clinical investigators in the 1960s and 1970s considered the potential relevance of the findings as a method for restoration of arousal and consciousness in chronically unconscious patients and carried out pilot case studies of electrical stimulation. However, despite eye opening and autonomic signs consistent with arousal effects, no reports described sustained recovery of interactive behavior. Following on these early case reports, a multicenter study involving a total of 49 patients was carried out. Deep brain stimulation resulted in increases in arousal and associated physiological responses in the majority of these patients but there were unfortunately no changes in behavioral responsiveness. More recently, a single subject study provided the first compelling evidence that some severely brain injured patients in minimally conscious state (MCS) may benefit from CT/DBS. The overall findings indicated significantly improved behavioral responsiveness with a combination of immediate as well as slowly accumulating, though long-lasting effects. However, this type of response has only been observed in a single subject and has been difficult to reproduce. While these earlier findings raise the possibility that using CT/DBS to improve consciousness in severe traumatic brain injury could be efficacious, many critical challenges lay ahead. These include defining the mechanisms of action and optimizing stimulation targets and parameters to make CT/DBS a reliable clinical treatment. In this proposal, we aim to overcome these challenges. We will develop and utilize a novel optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging approach that will enable us to systematically understand the underlying mechanism of action of the CT/DBS therapy with unparalleled clarity. Elucidating the mechanism of CT-DBS therapy will allow us to optimize the stimulation target, stimulation parameters, and even help stratify patients for inclusion into such therapeutic modalities. In Preliminary Studies we have established the effectiveness of the ofMRI approach at identifying key locations of stimulation and, importantly, function associated with CT-DBS. We will first conduct ofMRI, EEG, and behavioral studies in normal animals to define circuit mechanisms involved in both acute and long-term stimulation. Then, we will evaluate the optimized parameters of stimulation and their role in restoring consciousness in animal models of TBI. Knowledge of CT-DBS mechanism and optimization parameters will be invaluable for future clinical trials, understanding of mechanisms of arousal, consciousness, and neuromodulation therapy."

"9461855","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Moffitt PSOC Here we focus on two deeply interconnected physical science questions: How do we study, quantify, integrate, and model the complexity of cancer biology and treatment across multiple length and time scales that form the tumor ecology? and Can the evolutionary dynamics of therapeutic resistance be exploited through dynamic spatio-temporal models to optimize treatments and improve the lives of patients with cancer? We propose that cancer must be investigated and treated as a complex adaptive systems in which the underlying first principles are Darwinian. We view intratumoral evolution as a dynamical interaction between environmental selection forces and tumor adaptive strategies to maximize fitness. A critical property of cancer complex system is that it is open and thus can be perturbed by host response and iatrogenic interventions. Thus, the multi-scale (e.g. molecular, cellular and tissue scales) spatio-temporal variations within and between cancers (i.e. the ecology of cancer) is dependent in large part on the open components of the system such as alterations in blood flow that affect local environmental conditions and subsequent cellular adaptive strategies. Similarly, the Darwinian response to therapy will vary within each habitat within the tumor ecology and must be understood to design consistently effective therapies.  We approach these questions in two different ways: In project 1 we focus on fundamental principles - the cancer cell evolutionary dynamics and molecular mechanisms that permit adaptation to host-generated perturbations including blood flow and treatment strategies. Here the focus will be on sophisticated in-vitro and in-vivo experimental methods integrated with Darwinian-based mathematical models. A key deliverable from Project 1 is identification of novel therapeutic strategies that can exploit these evolutionary dynamics and molecular mechanism to improve clinical therapy. In Project 2 we will focus on developing computational models that use first principles and available clinical data to: 1. understand the patient-specific dynamics that govern response and resistance and 2. develop computational models that predict the outcomes of different therapies (e.g. multidrug chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy ) in individual patients. In the longer term our goal is to increase the scope of these models to permit design of patient-specific therapy to optimize overall survival. The deliverable from Project 2, therefore, include development of methods to extract maximum amounts of information from clinically available data and development of computational models to optimize clinical therapy using often sparse dynamic data. Both Projects will interact extensively with a core focused on developing computational models and applying sophisticated analytic methods to extract maximum knowledge from available molecular, pathological, and radiological clinical data."
"9411175","Proposal Summary/Abstract  The innate immune system utilizes restriction factors to prevent integration of foreign RNA species, such as viral RNA, into the genome of the host cell. In response, viruses adapt mechanisms to evade restriction in their natural hosts. An example of this type of molecular arms race is that between APOBEC3 restriction factors and HIV-1 infectivity factor, Vif. The proposed mechanism of restriction of HIV-1 by the APOBEC3 family involves several steps. First, APOBEC3 proteins associate with host and viral RNAs and are incorporated into budding virions. After the core contents of the new virus particle are released into a naïve host cell, the APOBEC3 enzymatic activity targets viral ssDNA for deamination of cytidine nucleotides. HIV-1 counteracts APOBEC3 proteins with Vif, which recognizes APOBEC3 proteins of its natural host and recruits the host ubiquitin ligase machinery to target these proteins for proteasomal degradation.  Typical APOBEC3 restriction factors (A3D, A3F, and A3G) are comprised of two homologous zinc- binding domains with distinct roles in cellular restriction activity. One domain carries the enzymatic deaminase function, while the other domain is poised to interact more readily with RNA for packaging of APOBEC3 molecules into new virions. Vif-interacting regions of APOBEC3 restriction factors can be localized to either domain. APOBEC3H (A3H) is particularly fascinating because, while other APOBEC3 restriction factors require two domains to facilitate all functions, A3H uses one, highly multifunctional domain, thus, making it an ideal, minimal system to study restriction by APOBEC3 restriction factors.  Interestingly, experiments to understand adaptations during infection in a pig-tailed macaque model revealed that the A3H was one of the most highly polymorphic restriction factors. Several polymorphic variants of A3H displaying a wide range of restriction activity were identified in the infected animals. These natural variants provide an innovative opportunity to characterize various functions of A3H on the molecular level and relate these biochemical findings to cellular phenotypes.  This research proposal aims to characterize A3H as a model to dissect restriction activities of APOBEC3 proteins. This research will focus on human A3H (haplotype II) in combination with polymorphic variants of pig- tailed macaque A3H. The following properties of A3H will be characterized experimentally through biochemical assays and crystallographic analyses of 1) A3H 3D structure, 2) cytidine deamination activity, 3) RNA binding and effect on catalysis, and 4) Vif binding and affinity. Biochemical activities will be correlated to restriction activity in cells. These experiments will lead to a more detailed understanding of HIV-1 restriction by A3H."
"9326925","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sex steroid hormones are critical in both the development and progression of breast cancer. The key role of estrogen signaling is well recognized, and drugs that target this pathway are a cornerstone of breast cancer treatment and chemoprevention. An important role for androgens in breast cancer biology also has long been hypothesized but remains to be elucidated. The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in a significant number of normal breast epithelial cells and in 60-70% of breast tumors. However, remarkably little is known about the role of androgens in normal or malignant breast tissue. Circulating androgens have been shown to be positively associated with breast cancer risk, and AR expression with breast cancer prognosis. The impact of androgen signaling on breast cancer survival may vary by estrogen receptor (ER) status of the tumor. We hypothesize that androgen receptor expression and signaling in normal breast tissue is associated higher risk of developing breast cancer and that androgen receptor expression leads to better survival in women with ER+ breast tumors and worse survival in women with ER- breast tumors. This project will test these hypotheses by 1) evaluating the role of AR expression in breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study Benign Breast Disease Nested Case-Control Study, 2) evaluating the role of AR signaling in breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study Benign Breast Disease Nested Case-Control Study, and 3) evaluating the role of AR expression in breast cancer prognosis in the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II. Elucidating the role of androgen receptor signaling in breast cancer carcinogenesis and prognosis is vital as this information will improve our understanding of etiologic mechanisms and could introduce new opportunities for chemoprevention and therapeutics."
"9376663","RISE Project Summary The advent of clinical genome sequencing to identify patients at risk for serious diseases and to tailor treatments promises to greatly improve health outcomes and provide a foundation for the delivery of Precision Medicine. However, even as laboratory methods to perform sequencing become highly efficient, uncertainty around the optimal breadth and economic value of sequencing as well as ambiguity around which individuals should be tested presents a critical barrier to wider use. As we rapidly approach an era of inexpensive sequencing, new approaches to quantify and optimize the economic and clinical value of genome-tailored care are needed. For the Rational Integration of Sequencing (RISE) project, we propose to develop a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to estimate the average clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prospectively acquiring sequence data across a diverse patient population. The simulation will leverage literature-based estimates of clinical outcome rates, costs, and utilities combined with clinical exome and pharmocogenomic implementation program data describing how results are returned and reacted to within clinical care. The first Aim will develop a conceptual framework and computational infrastructure to understand the drivers of economic value in genomic screening. The second Aim will externally validate the RISE model using real-world use data. The third Aim will assess the cost effectiveness of genomic screening scenarios, identify key drivers of value and inform research priorities in genomic screening."
"9334831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, clinical assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) depends upon estimates of glomerular filtration (eGFR) and glomerular injury (albuminuria). This two-dimensional assessment of glomerular health forms the backbone of recent Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines because each represents a different component of CKD and each provides prognostic information on adverse kidney and non-kidney outcomes independent of the other. As defined, CKD is an enormous public health problem, due to its high prevalence, its economic costs, and its adverse impact on morbidity and mortality.  Beyond glomerular filtration and glomerular injury, the kidney has many other critical biological functions that are primarily mediated by the tubulointerstitium; these include proximal tubule reabsorption, electrolyte transport, acid/base homeostasis, and endocrine actions. Neither eGFR nor albuminuria captures tubulo- interstitial abnormalities. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that a comprehensive assessment of kidney health in adults will require the addition of measures of tubulo-interstitial injury and tubular function.  The broa objective of this proposal will be to develop a Kidney Tubule Health Panel (KTHP) that will be comprised of established and novel measures of kidney tubule injury and dysfunction. For kidney tubule injury, we will evaluate and compare the prognostic value of urinary measures of proximal tubule injury, distal tubule injury, and interstitial fibrosis. For kidney tubule dysfuncton, we will evaluate the prognostic utility of endocrine resistance, metabolic acidosis, decreased proximal tubule reabsorption, and host defense. Outcomes of interest will include development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), progressive loss of kidney function and development of hospitalized acute kidney injury (AKI) (Aims 1 and 2). In Aim 3 we will develop the KTHP utilizing novel statistical approaches to select a parsimonious set of biomarkers that will maximize the prediction of ESRD, progressive loss of kidney function, and AKI. We will address our hypotheses in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study (REGARDS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), as they offer a broad age range of participants, a large representation of whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics,             detailed measures of kidney risk factors, available urine and serum specimens and the outcomes of ESRD, loss of kidney function and AKI over 10 years. By broadening the assessment of kidney health and disease beyond the glomerulus, we believe that our KTHP can ultimately lead to improved understanding, classification, prevention, and treatment of CKD. Our proposal includes a collaborative team of PIs, each with expertise in different components of the application, a long-standing history of collaboration, and extensive expertise in both cohorts."

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) Department of Analytical Chemistry (DAC) has a 142-year history of food safety research, including 12 years as a member of the FDA Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Chemistry Cooperative Agreement Program (cCAP) and 5 years of funding under the ?ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accreditation for Food Testing Laboratories? Cooperative Agreement Program (CAP). Under the latter program, the CAES DAC was awarded ISO 17025 Accreditation by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) in December 2016. In addition to being the sole laboratory in Connecticut providing chemical testing for the MFRPS program, the CAES DAC participates a broader surveillance and monitoring program to ensure the safety of food in the state of CT. The primary goal of this proposal is to acquire the necessary funding to maintain and enhance the laboratories ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation so as to support FDA effort to establish a nationally integrated food system. Specifically, this CAP will ensure that chemical food analyses on behalf of the State manufactured food regulatory programs are conducted within the scope of an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory, will strengthen the collaboration between lthe CAES DAC and the State manufactured regulatory program, and will increase the number of State of CT samples collected and analyzed for surveillance purposes annually.  The laboratories current scope of accreditation covers CAES DAC ?Market Basket? program. This program is conducted in coordination with the CT Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) and includes the FDA MFRPS Program. Currently, food samples are collected annually by DCP inspectors and brought to the CAES DAC for chemical analysis. The samples are subjected to validated in-house homogenization and extraction/digestion protocols, followed by analysis for pesticides by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS/MS) and by liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometric detection (LC/HRMS). Separately, select samples are analyzed for total arsenic by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS). The food matrices to be analyzed under the scope of accreditation are those typically encountered in our Market Basket survey, which includes juices, ciders, baby food, and other processed fruits/vegetables. The maintenance and enhancement portion of the proposed work is detailed in our Research Strategy but will involve expansion of the scope of accreditation to additional food matrices, as well as to additional pesticides and heavy metals, and also dedicated efforts to meet the soon to be released ISO 17025:2017 standard.  The CAES DAC has demonstrated the expertise, capability, and adaptability to fully meet the objectives of this RFA through our successful participation in the ?ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accreditation for Food Testing Laboratories? CAP and through our 12 years of work as a FERN cCAP laboratory. Receipt of this new award from FDA will significantly enhance the ability of the CAES DAC specifically, and CT in general, to meet the program goals laid out in the RFA, and as described by the Food Safety Task For Program, the Partnership for Food Protection and the Food Safety Modernization Act."
"9384257","Project Summary/Abstract  Caffeine is routinely used in the treatment of preterm (PT) infants with immature breathing patterns. We have documented persisting intermittent decreases in blood oxygen levels (intermittent hypoxia, IH) after stopping routine caffeine treatment about 6 weeks before the due date (34-35 weeks postmenstrual age, PMA). IH is pro-inflammatory and is associated with adverse effects on cognition and brain structure in patients with sleep apnea syndrome and in rodent models of apnea of prematurity. We address 2 significant questions in infants born at ? 30 wks gestation: 1) does IH occurring after stopping routine caffeine at 34-35 wks and persisting to 42 wks PMA cause injury, and 2) can this injury be attenuated by extending caffeine treatment to 42 wks PMA? Innovations include high resolution continuous pulse oximeter recordings to 43 wks PMA to quantify IH, measurement of inflammatory biomarkers, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess structural and functional brain injury. Our prior studies confirm that IH occurs frequently after cessation of routine caffeine, and that extended caffeine treatment at age-appropriate dosing attenuates the extent of IH. Our hypotheses are that, compared to placebo, 1) caffeine-treated infants will have lower overall IH exposure between 34-34 and 42 weeks PMA, 2) the caffeine group will have less biomarker evidence of continuing inflammation, and these effects will be mediated by reduced IH exposure, 3) the caffeine group will have less structural, microstructural and metabolic biomarkers of acute brain injury as determined by MRI and MRS, and these effects will be mediated by reduced IH exposure in the extended caffeine group. We will enroll 220 PT infants. Eligible subjects will be enrolled as early as 32 wks PMA, when no longer having overt symptoms related to immature breathing pattern. Enrolled, infants will begin continuous pulse oximeter recordings of oxygen (O2) saturation. We will randomize 110 infants to caffeine at 10 mg/kg body weight twice daily and 110 to equal volume placebo starting the day after last dose of routine caffeine treatment, typically by 34-35 weeks PMA. Study drug will be continued until 42 weeks PMA, and pulse oximeter recordings will continue to 43 wks PMA. Two caffeine levels will be obtained, the 1st before discharge home and the 2nd at home. At study enrollment and completion at 43-45 wks PMA, inflammatory biomarkers and brain MRI/MRS will be obtained. Data collection will also include demographics, postnatal medical history, and medical status at hospital discharge and study completion. Our results will provide the justification for subsequent studies to assess longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with persisting IH during a critical period of continuing brain maturation, and the attenuating effects of extended caffeine treatment. The knowledge gained will establish highly relevant and easily translatable new cost-effective strategies to significantly improve clinical practice and public health in infants born preterm at ? 30 wks gestation."
"9256873","Project Summary/Abstract Heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) beat over 100,000 times per day. Successful heart contraction requires that cardiomyocytes be physically coupled. This is accomplished through the intercalated disc (ICD): a specialized adhesive structure joining cardiomyocytes end-to-end to form a functional syncytium. The ICD contains protein complexes responsible for mechanical strength and protein complexes responsible for electrical conductance. The adherens junction (AJ) is a protein complex responsible for mechanical strength and integrates the actin cytoskeletons of neighboring cells. Myofibrils, organized actin-myosin structures, are the contractile machinery of the heart and produce the force necessary for individual cardiomyocytes to beat. Myofibrils terminate in the ICD, and linking myofibrils between cardiomyocytes allows for mechanical continuity across cells. However, how these myofibrils are coupled between cells is largely unknown. Vinculin is a key protein mediating cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts, serving to link both complexes to the actin cytoskeleton. Vinculin is recruited to AJs in a tension-dependent mechanism and is enriched at the AJ-myofibril interface in cardiomyocytes. Expression of vinculin at cell-cell contacts increases in aging heart muscle and is thought to be cardio-protective, and disorganization of vinculin is seen in failing heart muscle. Yet the role of vinculin at the ICD is poorly understood. In this proposal, it is hypothesized that vinculin anchors myofibrils to AJs and mediates crosstalk between cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts. In Aim 1, the linkage between myofibrils and AJs will be investigated by defining the myofibril-vinculin-AJ interface and determining the role of vinculin and its AJ binding partner, ?E-catenin in promoting AJ stability. In Aim 2, the crosstalk between AJs and cell-ECM contacts will be investigated by altering the ECM environment and determine its influence on vinculin localization, dynamics, and tension at cell-ECM contacts and AJs. The work proposed will further the understanding of a fundamental aspect of cardiac biology: how individual cardiomyocytes are coupled to create a functional syncytium. This research will elucidate vinculin function in the heart, shedding light on to its cardio-protective role."
"9346115","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to define the molecular mechanisms by which histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and stress granules (SGs) interactively drive the pathophysiology of tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal Dementia. In so doing, we will test the hypothesis that loss of HDAC6 activity augments site-specific tau acetylation, preventing the pathological recruitment of tau to stress granules, and slowing disease progression. We recently reported that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of tau enhances accumulation and aggregation, and we have now identified the acetylation sites on tau that are regulated by HDAC6. We also recently reported that tau pathology develops in concert with SG pathology in human and mouse models. Understanding the role of HDAC6 in regulating tau acquires added significance because HDAC6 regulates SGs, which are protein/RNA complexes that form in response to translational inhibition. Thus, HDAC6 functions as a nexus, linking acetylation of tau, SG formation and disease progression. The work in this proposal will elucidate the mechanisms by which HDAC6 regulates tau recruitment to SGs, with a particular focus on tau acetylation, and also assess whether decreasing HDAC6 expression with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) is sufficient to alleviate both tau and SG pathology. We have already identified ASOs targeting HDAC6 that effectively decrease expression in mouse primary neurons, and through an active collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, are working to identify ASOs that will progress to in vivo testing. Given HDAC6 inhibition or knockout produces no obvious toxicity in cells or in mice, HDAC6 as a therapeutic target possesses strong translational appeal.  Our proposal is structured to provide a greater understanding of the intricate and dynamic relationship between HDAC6 and tau, as well as elucidate the role of HDAC6 and tau acetylation in SG dynamics. We will generate acetyl tau antibodies on HDAC6-responsive sites to investigate how acetylation on these key sites affects tau biology and SG dynamics in our cell culture and rTg4510 mouse models as well as postmortem brain tissue from tauopathy cases (Aim 1). We will also determine whether modulation of HDAC6, through the use of ASOs, diminishes tauopathy and preserves cognition in vivo (Aim 2). Using mouse primary neurons, fibroblast-derived neurons from human tauopathy patients, which we show exhibit robust SG formation in response to stress, and rTg4510 mice treated with HDAC6 ASOs, we will further determine the roles of HDAC6, tau and acetylation in regulating stress granule dynamics (Aim 3). Completion of these studies in tandem will fundamentally expand our knowledge of the pathophysiology of tauopathies, and provide key insights into the pre-clinical efficacy of HDAC6 ASOs as a novel therapeutic strategy."

"9335769","Project Summary/Abstract Many persons with HIV have Hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection and consume alcohol. Now that highly effective and easily tolerated therapies for HCV are available, singular opportunities exist to prevent downstream morbidity and mortality from HCV including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, alcohol consumption may offset those benefits as it magnifies damage from HCV infection, potentially leading to liver inflammation, increased risk of liver failure, and HCC. Persons with HIV are at particularly high risk of the adverse effects of alcohol consumption because they already sustain multiple sources of hepatic injury, such as steatosis and hepatotoxic medications. Moreover, the high cost of HCV therapies and enormous burden on health expenditures magnifies the importance of employing these treatments successfully and with favorable value. In order to weigh these tradeoffs systematically and to inform future HCV treatment guidelines for individuals with HIV, we seek to employ a decision analytic model to compare alternative strategies for linking alcohol consumption criteria to HCV treatment eligibility."
"9437477","ABSTRACT A key limitation for using direct semiconductor detection for positron emission tomography (PET) is the relatively slow drift times of the charge carriers which leads to poor coincidence timing. We propose that Cerenkov light can be used as a fast timing signal in semiconductors such as TlBr. Cerenkov light is emitted quasi-instantaneously when a gamma-ray generates a photoelectron and has the potential to provide a signal with a time-of-flight precision even for semiconductor detectors. Cerenkov imaging has been proposed just a few years ago as a new modality and the first experimental results of Cerenkov light detection with BGO have been published recently, showing a coincidence time resolution of 270 ps. Cerenkov light in TlBr will be more intense than in BGO due to its higher index of refraction. The utilization of Cerenkov light as a fast timing signal in semiconductor detectors has not been reported yet. TlBr is an optimum detector for PET in terms of efficiency and energy resolution, however, its timing response compromises its overall performance. Using the Cerenkov light as a fast signal could provide TlBr with a time-of-flight timing performance and convert it into one of the most complete detectors for PET. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate and characterize the detection of Cerenkov light in TlBr. The specific aims address understanding of the generation and transmission of Cerenkov light in TlBr, and the detection of this light using TlBr slabs coupled to photodetectors. The three specific aims of this project are 1) the measurement of visible light transmittance in TlBr, 2) the simulation of Cerenkov light generation in TlBr, and 3) the detection of Cerenkov light generated in TlBr and measurement of timing resolution. The experimental measurements will be used to validate the simulation and to obtain a toolkit able to predict reliably the Cerenkov light emitted by a TlBr slab depending on its dimensions and to extrapolate it to other semiconductor materials. These specific aims will be sufficient to prove the feasibility of using Cerenkov light as a fast signal in TlBr and to provide the semiconductor detector community with a simulation toolkit that facilitates the production of TlBr detectors optimized to detect Cerenkov light."
"9431714","Joint Meta-Regression Methods Accounting for Postrandomization Variables Principal Investigator: Haitao Chu, M.D., Ph.D. Summary  The rapid growth of interest in comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based medicine has led to dramatically increased attention to systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which synthesize and contrast multi- ple randomized clinical trials. T o examine the impact of covariates on study-specific treatment effects, meta- regression methods are available for conventional meta-analysis comparing two treatments and for network meta-analysis simultaneously comparing multiple treatments . While there is broad consensus on methods for examining study-level covariates ? which are similar across a study's treatment arms because of randomization ? it is much more challenging to adjust for postrandomization variables, which are expected to differ between treatment arms within a study. Examples include differential noncompliance, measured as the proportion of premature treatment discontinuation or drop out, loss to follow-up, or change to an alternative therapy. To the best of our knowledge, existing meta-regression methods only focus on the impact of study-level covariates, which are assumed to be fixed, while postrandomization variables are generally considered random. Thus, ex- isting meta-regression methods cannot account for postrandomization variables.  Because postrandomization variables such as differential noncompliance can induce bias in estimating the effect of treatment plans, in responding to PA-16-161 this proposal's overall goal is to develop cutting-edge joint models to account for postrandomization variables in meta-analysis, and to integrate them into publicly available, easy-to-use software to enhance the reproducibility, validity, and generalizability of meta-analyses. Specifically, we will apply Bayesian hierarchical models in these three specific aims: 1) develop joint meta-regression meth- ods to adjust for postrandomization variables in conventional meta-analysis; 2) develop multivariate joint meta- regression methods to adjust for postrandomization variables in network meta-analysis; and 3) objectively eval- uate the proposed methods and develop an open-source R package.  We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these methods compared to existing meta-analysis meth- ods, through real data applications and extensive simulations. The proposed statistical methods will be broadly applicable to many meta-analyses. Completing these aims will substantially advance comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based medicine through innovative meta-analysis methods. It will improve public health by facilitating treatment selection for various cancers and for cardiovascular, infectious, and other diseases."

"9424098","1R01 DK115536-01 revised Inherited bone marrow failure disorders (BMFDs) represent a distinct category of hematopoietic disorders that are driven by genetic mutation. Within these disorders, a distinct set of genes has already been identified that contribute to a sub-set of BMFDs known as ribosomopathies. Ribosomopathies harbor mutation to genes playing a critical role in ribosomal processing and ribosome biogenesis. We previously established the DKC1 gene as a ribosomopathy gene through its ability to regulate proper translation as a result of its function to convert uridine residues on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) to pseudouridine. Exciting, preliminary data from our lab now demonstrates that another post-transcriptional modification of rRNAs, 2?-O-methylation (2?-O-Me), also contribute to proper regulation of ribosome function. Our data reveal that specific C/D-box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) controls proper IRES-dependent translation of major cell cycle and apoptosis genes. In vivo, disruption of 2?-O-Me in adult mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment results in features characteristic of ribosomopathies such as defects in stem cell maintenance due to exit from quiescence, apoptosis, and myelodysplastic bone marrow failure. Importantly, we identify novel germ line mutations dyskeratosis congenita (DC) patients related to function of C/D box snoRNAs. Thus, our preliminary findings provide direct genetic evidence for the critical role ribosome specialization through rRNA 2?-O-Me, as well as in the pathogenesis of multiple disease states through aberrant HSC and ribosome function. In order to better understand the role and function 2?-O-Me, we propose to (1) study the molecular and cellular pathways that are impacted by 2?-O-Me and which contribute to the process of bone marrow failure, (2) determine the in vivo significance of normal ribosome function for hematopoiesis, and of novel DC mutations identified through development of genetically engineered mouse models, and (3) evaluate the extent to which genes involved in the biochemical complexes that catalyzes 2?-O-Me may be altered in BMFDs, and to determine if additional novel pathogenic mutations targeting the process of rRNA methylation, including snoRNAs, exist in BMFDs. Together these data will further facilitate our understanding of ribosomopathies, and help uncover how essential regulation of the ribosome, through rRNA modification, contributes to normal and aberrant hematopoiesis."
"9460065","SUMMARY  Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC, ~5% of all breast cancers) is the most lethal form of breast cancer presenting a 5-year survival rate that is less than the half of the non-IBC patients. Furthermore, its mortality has continued to increase during the last 20 years. Despite these facts, IBC remains poorly understood and systemic disease management relies exclusively on chemotherapy. Remarkably, we have found that survival of IBC cells depend on histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) function while non-IBC cells are mainly independent. Importantly, we have demonstrated that the leading HDAC6 inhibitor (Rocilinostat/ACY1215, Acetylon Inc), which is currently being tested in clinical trials for other tumors presents anticancer activity in IBC cells in preclinical models. Our findings represent an opportunity to develop novel targeted therapies for IBC patients. Hypothesis and Objective: We hypothesize that key biological processes regulated by HDAC6 are essential to maintain the homeostasis of IBC cells. In this proposal our goal is to characterize the mechanisms involved in the addiction of IBC cells to HDAC6 function in order to be able to transition our finding to the clinic. Specific Aim1. Uncover the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC6 regulate the homeostasis of IBC cells. HDAC6 is a class-IIB histone deacetylase with a critical function on the cell's response to accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged mitochondria due to its role in formation of aggresome, mito-aggresome and autophagy. We will study if the lethality seen in IBC cells is due to loss of canonical functions or a different one. -Aim 1.a) Evaluate the function of HDAC6 in the metabolism of toxic bioproducts. -Aim 1.b) Evaluate the function of HDAC6 in basal autophagy. -Aim 1.b) Investigate novel putative HDAC6 substrates. Specific Aim2. Design and evaluation of combination therapy with HDAC6 inhibition for IBC treatment. Systemic therapy combining different anticancer agents is generally needed in epithelial cancer to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit. Here, we hypothesize that combinatorial therapy will circumvent resistance to monotherapy based on HDAC6 inhibition. We will perform both candidate based and unbiased studies to optimize the anticancer activity of regimens containing HDAC6 inhibitors. -Aim 2.a) Candidate based therapy using chemotherapy plus HDAC6 inhibition. -Aim 2.b) Unbiased system biology studies for the identification of Master Regulators (MR) associated with the  response to HDAC6 inhibition. Significance. This proposal represents the preclinical studies necessary to translate our findings into targeted therapy for IBC patients. The importance of our proposal is that it could lead to a decrease in mortality from the most lethal and one the less characterized group of breast cancers."
"9355174","Project Summary  Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects U.S. racial/ethnic minorities, as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the condition and its complications among Hispanics, blacks, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans compared to whites. In October 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released a new recommendation to screen asymptomatic adults who are 40-70 years old and overweight/obese for diabetes and prediabetes (collectively called dysglycemia). These screening criteria are likely to identify proportionately fewer cases of dysglycemia among racial/ethnic minorities, who experience higher risk at younger ages and lower body weights compared to whites. By contrast, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening in adults with at least two diabetes risk factors, including non-white race/ethnicity. Screening criteria are based on models that use risk factors to predict the development of dysglycemia. However, existing risk models have limited application in practice because they include data that are not routinely collected, and they do not accurately predict dysglycemia in racial/ethnic minorities. Using data from a national network of community health centers whose patients are predominantly racial/ethnic minorities, this timely research will investigate the assessment of diabetes risk and the effectiveness of alternate screening criteria. The Alliance of Chicago Community Health Services (Alliance) is a national data warehouse for over 200 community health centers, which links sociodemographic, laboratory, and healthcare utilization data from the electronic health records (EHR) of over 800,000 patients. Using longitudinal Alliance data from 2006 to 2015, we will compare the performance of three different approaches for predicting dysglycemia, based on: 1) USPSTF criteria; 2) ADA criteria; and 3) criteria from a novel risk prediction model we will develop using the same EHR data. In a second aim, we will estimate and compare the costs and short- term cost-effectiveness of screening based on the same sets of criteria. This economic analysis is essential to promote the uptake of optimal diabetes screening approaches in practice. Findings from this study can be used to improve diabetes screening recommendations to better identify high-risk individuals, especially racial/ethnic minorities. This study may therefore help reduce racial/ethnic disparities by detecting dysglycemia earlier in these groups, so that prevention and treatment strategies can be initiated. In addition, this study will lead to future research that tests novel interventions for screening, diagnosing, and treating dysglycemia, and examines the long-term cost effectiveness of screening approaches. Our multidisciplinary team has extensive expertise in the content areas and methods needed to successfully conduct the proposed secondary data analysis, and then investigate the application of study findings in practice. This study is timely in its examination of new diabetes screening criteria; novel in its inclusion of a large, minority-predominant patient sample; and significant in its potential to maximize both population health and health equity in diabetes."
"9349373","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans are colonized with diverse microbial communities, collectively called the commensal microbiota, that influence a wide array of biological processes. Recent studies demonstrate that in addition to their roles in nutrition, immunity and metabolism, the commensal microbiota also plays a fundamental role in the development and function of the nervous system, in addition to several complex host behaviors. The proposed research training program aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying the interaction between specific commensal microbes and the nervous system, and to elucidate the impact of these relationships on host physiology. Specifically, the proposed research will examine the role of commensal microbes on host serotonin (5-hydroxytrypatmine, 5-HT) metabolism, with aims to define the specific steps of the 5-HT pathway that are affected by commensal microbes, identify the particular microbial species and factors that affect host 5-HT, and apply these microbial 5-HT modulators toward ameliorating symptoms in models of 5-HT-related disease. Findings from these studies will advance our current understanding of how the commensal microbiota affects health and disease, and will further explore the innovative prospect of developing novel, microbe-based therapeutics, which can be readily modified for better function, regulatory control, targeting and delivery. The proposed studies on the interaction between the commensal microbiota and nervous system fills a novel area of multidisciplinary research that integrates not only neurobiology and microbiology, but also biochemistry (in the dissection of molecular alterations in the 5-HT pathway), chemical engineering (in the nanofabrication of microfluidic devices for high-throughput confinement, cultivation and functional screening of endogenous species of the microbiome) and molecular and behavioral neuroscience (in the investigation of pathologies seen in mouse models of serotonin-deficiency). My proposed training will span five years of independent research as a Senior Research Fellow at the California Institute of Technology. This title is typically reserved for individuals with previous post-doctoral experience and serves as a transitional stage toward advancing into a junior faculty position. Approximately one year after the award is conferred; I will recruit one full-time technician, with significant previous experience in laboratory research.I will also begin mentoring up to two biology or chemistry undergraduate students per year through Caltech's summer research program."
"9533755","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Investigations of hematopoietic growth factor bio-effects and action mechanisms continue to provide important insight into (dys) regulated blood cell formation. The EPO receptor (EPOR) system is an informative and clinically significant paradigm. Recent studies applying contemporary approaches indicate major gaps in the field's understanding of EPO/EPOR/JAK2 signal transducers and their regulation of erythroid progenitor cell (EPC) formation. To illustrate, the PI has recently identified a novel EPOR/JAK2/STAT5 pathway in which an EPO-induced Spi2A serpin cytoprotects EPCs against executioner cathepsins as leached from ROS-compromised lysosomes [JEM 210:225-32]. And Dr. T. Ganz's laboratory has characterized an EPOR/JAK2/STAT5-induced Erythroferrone TNF cytokine as a hepcidin suppressor [Nat Genet. 46:678-84]. Via major supporting studies for this R01 renewal, we've applied post-translational modification (PTM) based LC-MS/MS proteomics to discover intriguing new mediators of EPO/EPOR/JAK2 action. These include 50+ factors not previously linked to EPO-dependent erythropoiesis within diverse functional categories of molecular adaptors, erythroid cytoskeletal proteins, kinases & phosphatases, and cell cycle & survival factors. SA#1 will extend our PTM-directed proteomic investigations in human erythroid precursor cells to include broad-based targets as modified at pY, T*PP and ubiquitin motifs, together with analyses of more select signaling nodes for S/T kinases, survival/apoptosis factors and cell cycle targets. Networks for hundreds of specifically activated PTM events for novel (and known) EPO targets and transducers will be mined (with collaborating expert bioinformaticists). SA#2 focuses on defining the functional roles and action mechanisms of three interrelated new EPO targets as upstream effectors of EPOR/JAK2 complexes. Two, C1ORF186/RHEX and C1ORF150, are novel molecular adaptors that have evolved as EPO signal transducers in hEPC's (but are absent among mice, rats, lower vertebrates). Third, PTPN18 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase which we demonstrate to increase JAK2 activation, decrease EPOR turnover and limit pY-RHEX formation. Approaches will include GOF, shRNA LOF, and mutant rescue studies in UT7epo cells and primary hEPCs. SA#3 then focuses on a new downstream mediator of EPO action, Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP). EPO modulates TXNIP at C-terminal pT/pS sites, and heightens its expression. TXNIP knockdown attenuates EPC growth, and notably accelerates primary erythroid precursor development to KIT-low, GPA-high hemoglobinizing erythroblasts. Mechanistically how TXNIP acts as a novel EPO agent will be determined by analyzing EPC growth, survival, ROS, miRNA populations and metabolic properties. Overall, studies will reveal important new mediators of EPO-dependent human erythropoiesis. Certain may be druggable with potentials to lessen EPO dosing, and limit EPO's major adverse side effects. Other new EPO targets may functionally relate to MPNs and/or to EPO's potential to worsen cancer outcomes."
"9473495","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the increased risk of colorectal cancer among patients with ulcerative colitis is well documented, little attention has been given to the development of a chemopreventive regimen for this high- risk population. Based on this deficiency, a critical need exists to identify molecular targets for early intervention and develop efficacious regimens for the chemoprevention of colitis-associated neoplasia. Because results from several prior studies by this group provide strong evidence that the two morphological subtypes of colitis-associated colorectal neoplasias (flat and polypoid) arise via different geneti pathways, effective chemoprevention will only be realized once an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the formation of each lesion subtype has been achieved.  The hypothesis of the proposed experimentation is that morphological subtypes of colitis-associated colorectal dysplasias arise from either ß-catenin-mediated enhanced proliferation (polypoid lesions) or deficiencies in p53-dependent apoptotic signaling (flat lesions. Rationale for this hypothesis is provided by preliminary analyses in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of induced colitis that indicate that loss of p53 function and decreased expression of downstream target genes are prevalent in flat lesions, while ß-catenin mutations and nuclear localization of ß-catenin predominate in polypoid lesions bearing wild-type p53. A series of mechanistic studies are proposed to define the molecular switch that regulates the formation of flat vs. polypoid lesions and assess the feasibility of disrupting p53 and ß-catenin signaling s a strategy for the prevention of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. The ability of mutant ß-catenin or loss of function of p53 to drive the formation of polypoid and flat dysplasias, respectively, will be evaluated in Aim 1 in genetically defined mice with DSS-induced colitis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the propensity to develop each subtype of lesion will be investigated in parallel in cultured human colon carcinoma cells with defined mutations in ß-catenin or p53 by examining p53 expression and activation, subcellular localization of ß-catenin and the expression of mediators of p53 activity (Siah-1, Mdm2/X and miR-34). In Aim 2, the chemopreventive activity afforded against colitis-associated neoplasia by administering agents that reactivate p53 (CP31398) or inhibit ß-catenin-mediated TCF signaling (ICG-001) will be determined in wild-type Tcf4 luciferase reporter mice. Translation of these murine data to a clinical setting will be initiated with an analysis of the proliferative vs. apoptotic capacity of human flat and polypoid colitis-associated dysplasias and complemented by RNA expression profiling of each lesion subtype (Aim 3). The resulting data are anticipated to provide novel insight into the genetic basis of flat and polypoid colitis-associated dysplasias and inform the rational design of chemopreventive regimens for early intervention in the development of colitis-associated lesions, in particular flat dysplasias that often escape detection."
"9352831","Abstract Bariatric surgery is currently the most efficacious and durable intervention for severe obesity. Many comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) generally remit or resolve following bariatric surgery. Yet, some patients experience suboptimal weight outcomes following surgery, often resulting from substantial weight regain following successful weight loss. Unfortunately, weight recidivism is also often associated with reemergence of obesity-associated comorbidities. The most commonly performed procedures in the U.S. are the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and the laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). Both procedures involve significant anatomical and physiological changes that lead to changes in behavior and biology. The etiological contributors to weight loss following surgery are not well understood, and it is therefore difficult to predict which patients may experience suboptimal post-surgical weight outcomes. Changes in eating and physical activity behaviors, mood, and the microbiome have all been reported to occur following bariatric surgery and have an association with weight change. Weight change likely involves complex interactions between behavioral and biological variables. The longitudinal relationship between changes in the gut microbiome and post-surgery weight trajectory has not been explored thoroughly, and the associations between the microbiome and other variables that impact weight have been similarly understudied. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, 24-month longitudinal study of patients planning to undergo RYGB or SG and aim to identify correlates and predictors of observed weight loss trajectories over 24 months following bariatric surgery. In particular, this application is designed to examine the relationships between empirically supported behavioral and biological variables following surgery and their combined impact on weight outcome. These data will extend the current literature by collecting behavioral and biological data, by carrying out longer term follow-up of participants enrolled, and by studying a larger sample size. Novel data collection in this protocol will include intensive measurement of problematic eating behaviors and compliance with diet and exercise regimens post-surgically, which may be altered in parallel with, or in response to, changes observed in the gut microbiota. Identifying post-surgical predictors of weight loss and comorbidity resolution will allow for the development of interventions that can be tailored to individual patients based upon his/her risk profile which can then be implemented early to optimize surgery-related outcomes."

"9354527","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic stress affects numerous brain areas involved in memory, emotion, and motivation, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex; it abnormally alters a variety of cellular events, including dendritic morphology and gene expression patterns; and, it can precipitate several maladaptive states, such as depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. Yet, the neural circuitry sufficient to mitigate or even prevent such phenotypes is unclear. In both mice and humans, the hippocampus has been implicated in storing and retrieving positive memories and in modulating stress-related states. Promisingly, the recent work of the PI has demonstrated that artificially stimulating cells in the hippocampus that previously were active during positive memory formation are sufficient to increase reward-like behavior and motivation. To that end, in this DP5 proposal, a novel experimental bridge will be built between artificially activated positive memories and animal models of psychiatric disorders. The recently developed virus system by the PI will be utilized in which the promoter of the immediate early gene c-Fos drives the expression of the light-sensitive ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 in a manner that is under the control of the antibiotic Doxycycline. In the absence of Doxycycline, learning-induced neuronal activity selectively labels active c-Fos-expressing neurons with channelrhodopsin-2, thus conferring activity-dependent and inducible labeling of, in addition to optical control over, hippocampus cells and their corresponding axon terminals. The experimental goals of this project are threefold and combine in vivo optogenetics, in vitro immunohistochemistry, and a battery of behavioral assays. First, the hypothesis will be tested that optically modulating a defined set of positive or negative memory bearing hippocampus cells is sufficient to ameliorate or mimic the effects of chronic stress at the cellular and behavioral levels. Next, the goal is to test whether or not activating memory bearing hippocampus axon terminals?which route distinct mnemonic information to the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens?can differentially modulate independent features of psychiatric disease-like states, such as social impairments, anxiety-like, and anhedonic-related behavior. Finally, the goal is to test if chronically stimulating positive memory bearing hippocampus cells prior to stress can prevent such maladaptive behaviors from precipitating, while subsequently performing a brain-wide anatomical and histological analysis to identify key cellular loci mediating memory's putative prophylactic capacity."
"9432755","Project Summary/Abstract  The impact of the obesity epidemic in the US has been estimated to endanger the health of up to 30% of Americans by increasing the risk of diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and cancer as well as leading to 300,000 deaths annually. In order to lessen the negative impact of obesity, there is a need to better understand the neurobiology of feeding and metabolism in a manner that could contribute to the development of effective therapeutics. Attempts to understand the neural basis of feeding and metabolism often involve the study of individual neuropeptides that alter caloric intake and/or energy expenditure. Anatomical studies have implicated subregions of the hypothalamus as sites of action for several dozen peptide regulators of feeding behavior and body weight. Specifically, the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus (VMN) exert powerful control over feeding and metabolism through a broad array of both central and peripheral signaling molecules. For example, leptin, a well- studied peripheral signal produces hypophagia when administered into the VMN. Centrally, the actions of the VMN on energy homeostasis are also dependent on the activity of neural inputs synthesized and released by other brain regions such as the neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), which promotes energy expenditure and decreases feeding behavior. Thus, neurons in the VMN likely integrate both neural and peripheral signals in order to regulate energy homeostasis.  Preliminary data in this proposal support the hypothesis that leptin and PACAP interact in the VMN by regulating shared intracellular signaling pathways that lead to hypophagia. This is not surprising given the common and parallel features between PACAP and leptin in terms of anatomy, behavioral and metabolic outcomes, gene activation patterns, and functional dependency. This proposal examines several points of convergence among the intracellular signals produced by leptin and PACAP including the JAK-STAT signaling cascade and BDNF expression. Moreover, PACAP and leptin are ideal candidates to study the functional interactions between a tonically peripheral signal and a synaptically released neuropeptide that together could alter the activity of a broad neural network responsible for feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. In the hypothalamic VMN, we will examine the intracellular signaling links between PACAP and leptin (aim 1), and the functional relationship between PACAP and leptin under chronic conditions of leptin receptor dysregulation with obesity, hyperleptinemia without obesity, and diet induced obesity (aim 2).  "
"9534804","Project Summary/Abstract This is a collaborative multi-PI, multi-site application from the Illinois Precision Medicine Consortium (IPMC) to serve as a Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Cohort Program HPO Enrollment Center. IPMC comprises 3 major Chicago-area academic institutions (Northwestern University, University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Chicago) and their healthcare provider organization (HPO) partners across Illinois. Our overall scientific goal is to recruit and examine a large and diverse cohort of individuals across all age groups from both sexes, including both healthy people and those with pre-existing diseases (without regard to specific disease type), and to follow them through innovative mobile health technologies, electronic health records (EHR), and health insurance claims data to enable linkage of genetic and environmental exposures with a broad array of health outcomes. The consortium brings together extensive preexisting research resources across the 3 academic institutions, as well as the widespread, yet geographically distinct, service areas of their HPO partners representing numerous ethnically and socioeconomically diverse Chicago and Illinois communities. Specific Aims for the UG3 Phase (Year 01) are: Aim 1. Study goals: Recruit, consent, examine, collect biospecimens, and transmit curated data and processed biosamples to the PMI Coordinating and Biobanking Centers, on at least 10,000 people from diverse ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds who are patients in one of the 3 Illinois area HPOs (and their affiliates). Aim 2. Pilot projects: Conduct a series of recruitment pilot studies in the participating HPO settings, with detailed tracking of success rates, including percentage participation and diversity of participation, and from these studies discern the most effective recruitment strategies for each participating HPO. Aim 3. Milestones: Meet our stated milestones that demonstrate our success in reaching short-term goals for organization, participation in national planning, and successful recruitment and logistics. Aim 4. Collaboration: Collaborate with other PMI sites in protocol development, Steering Committee (SC) and other committee engagement to plan for success of the overall PMI. Specific Aims for the UH3 Phase (Years 02-05) are similar to the above with additional emphasis on accelerating and expanding recruitment and participant retention activities in order to enroll at least 35,000 participants per year. We also plan to capitalize on opportunities to advance precision medicine science by participating in research studies as agreed upon by the PMI SC. In addition, we will develop and propose ancillary studies that engage the scientific expertise across our 3 Chicago-area research institutions."
"9357895","This component describes our plans to develop, maintain, and extend the UCSC Genome Browser software, build and maintain genome browsers and annotations for species of biomedical interest, and integrate data from the scientific community that help interpret the functions of various genome regions. The UCSC Genome Browser has met the needs of the genomics and biomedical communities for over sixteen years while accommodating a dramatic increase in the volume of data and simultaneous users, supporting a wealth of new data types, and adapting to new computing platforms and displays. Our web-based tools garner over one million hits per day, and our Unix command-line tools are used in genomic analysis pipelines throughout the world. During the upcoming period we plan to expend more effort on maintaining and extending the Genome Browser software than on any other aim in this proposal. Highlights of our planned work include adding new displays to interpret personal genomes, developing displays that aggregate the increasing volumes of data, adding visualization support for chromatin conformation capture data and other data that cannot be easily shown in a linear, two-dimensional chromosome view, improving search capabilities of our databases and hubs, building a version targeted at mobile devices, and building browsers and displays that support single cell data. The Genome Browser database offers genomic data for nearly 100 organisms, many with multiple assemblies. The human and mouse genomes, which include the most recent assemblies from the Genome Reference Consortium, are the most richly annotated. We will continue to import new and updated assemblies, focusing on vertebrate genomes and with an emphasis on primates, animals used in scientific research, and animals that help extend coverage of the vertebrate phylogenetic tree. We intend to make it easier to build browsers and related tools on new genomes, automating the process when possible. We plan to map and compute annotations on patches issued between major releases of the human and mouse genomes to increase the usefulness of the patches to the scientific community. We will periodically evaluate multiple genome alignment software in search of a superior alternative to our existing pipeline. The genome framework is an ideal platform for integrating the research findings of a broad range of scientists. We plan to continue importing new data releases from projects that we currently support, in particular the GTEx and ENCODE projects, as well as incorporating new data from selected projects and papers recommended to us by our users, our scientific advisory board, and our funding agency. We will encourage the use of track hubs by external project groups and consortia for displaying their data sets in the browser. We also plan to integrate de-identified data into our public browser, and will coordinate with dbGAP to allow their authorized users to access specific, identifiable, private data sets in a secure manner on our site."
"9531743","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The small intestine bears similar morphology of crypts and villi throughout its length, yet marked regional differences in function are well known. The clinical relevance of these differences is highlighted by the region specific location of many human diseases throughout the bowel. Understanding the mechanisms that result in regional specific intestinal stem cells (ISC) is required to develop therapeutic approaches for restoring regional specific function. Our preliminary data supports the concept that patterning of the intestine occurs early in development and is maintained throughout life at the level of the ISC. Using our recently developed in vitro methods to culture human ISC-derived enteroids (hENO) and conditions that regionally pattern human ES/iPS-derived organoids (HIOs), combined with unique transplantation models, we will determine if intestinal regional identity (rID) is stably maintained by specific transcription factors together with a unique chromatin state within individual ISC. To test this hypothesis, we will define the molecular and cellular carriers of intestinal regional identity, determine whether human hENOs and HIOs maintain stable rID after transplantation and identify the network of molecular determinants of regional identity."
"9334292","PROJECT SUMMARY The primary function of the Administrative Core is to organize and implement an administrative infrastructure that facilitates the mission of CAPS. This infrastructure allows CAPS to remain positioned as a global resource for key HIV communities, including other scientists and public health and community partners. The Admin Core coordinates the programmatic work and scientific mission of the Center and its cores as well as facilitates interaction and collaboration between cores. By synergizing across cores, the core ensures that the ?whole is greater than the sum of its parts? and that the Center remains an organization that learns from experiences, is nimble, dynamic and continually enhances our capacity to create and respond to the epidemic and its changing scientific, institutional, political, and funding environments. The core not only coordinates the internal structures, but also interacts with the environment external to CAPS. The core serves as the primary liaison between the Center and other entities that inform our research and strategic planning process, including the faculty, External Scientific Advisory Board, Institutional Strategy Group, and our Community Advisory Board. Consequently, the aims of the Administrative Core are to (1) provide scientific and administrative leadership, (2) foster scientific innovation and enhance the productivity of investigators, and (3) ensure efficient and responsive administrative and fiscal operations. The structure and systems are designed to respond to the needs of CAPS scientists and support their ability to conduct significant and innovative HIV prevention science. CAPS has mechanisms and processes in place to reflect the evolving scientific requirements of the collective projects. Therefore, the Core facilitates the mission by providing scientific direction and administrative leadership, performing key decision-making functions, developing and implementing strategic plans, monitoring and evaluating progress towards the Center's goals and objectives, and ensuring efficient administrative operation."

"9379112","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intricate programs of mammalian cell differentiation ultimately target chromatin, formulating chromatin environments accessible to or deflective of the transcriptional machinery and thus conducive to distinct gene expression profiles. How these chromatin structures are first established to set the transcription program and how these established structures are then re-instated on newly replicated DNA during cell division is the crux of epigenetics. Based on preliminary findings obtained during the previous funding period, we will comprehensively explore two major modulators of epigenetic information that we have investigated extensively: PRC1 and PRC2, and a third potential epigenetic modulator, CTCF. We will continue our investigation of the molecular basis of their specificity in targeting discrete regions of the genome, the dynamics controlling their activity, and how their activities convey appropriate transcription outputs. Two mammalian complexes that comprise Polycomb Group proteins, PRC1 and PRC2 are recognized epigenetic conveyers of transcriptional repression. PRC1 transmits repression through catalysis of monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 and chromatin compaction. Through our extensive biochemical analyses, we demonstrated that PRC1 embodies discrete yet heterogenous complexes. In aim 1, we expand on our preliminary results showing that the distinguishing proteins for some of the PRC1 subgroups either convert PRC1 into a transcriptional activator, as in the case of the neuronal-specific protein, AUTS2, or exhibit cell-type specificity and a possible novel repressive mechanism as in the case of FBRSL1 in cardiomyocytes, or modulate PRC1 recruitment to chromatin as in the case of motor neuron enriched YAF1. The underlying mechanistic basis and the outcome to specific gene expression will be studied using biochemical and genomic approaches, respectively and with mouse models in the case of AUTS2 and FBRSL1. In aim 2, we continue our extensive analyses of PRC2 that catalyses methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27, a modification of repressive chromatin. We explore parameters regulating PRC2 activity including post-translational modifications of its catalytic subunit Ezh2, and the negative effects of naturally occurring, dominant negative histone mutants using biochemical analyses and CRISPR technology. With the foundation of our studies of interactions of long noncoding RNA with both Ezh2 and the PRC2 associated protein Jarid2, we expand into the role of these interactions in mediating specificity in PRC2 recruitment to chromatin. In aim 3, we pursue our preliminary results of RNA-mediated CTCF multimerization and its possible role in CTCF- mediated regulation of chromatin boundaries within the HOX gene cluster using ChIP-seq, sequence capture Hi-C and ChIA-PET technologies."
"9291508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital gut motility disorder caused by the failure of neural crest migration to the gastrointestinal tract. Neural cres is responsible for formation of the enteric nervous system, and their absence results in an aganglionic segment in the terminal bowel, which results in a failure to promote peristaltic contraction. New observations described in this proposal lead to a model in which placode cells also migrate and colonize the gut and selectively give rise to the intrinsic sensory neurons of the enteric ganglia, whereas neural crest cells contribute to non-sensory population (motor neurons, interneurons, and glia). In this application, I propose experiments to define the fate of enteric placode in the enteric nervous system, and to address how endothelin and Ret signaling control both neural crest and placode cell migration and colonization of the gut. Furthermore, I propose to address a model in which the intrinsic airway ganglia of the pulmonary plexus are also derived from both placode and neural crest, which will provide new insight into pathogenesis of the Hirschsprung's disease associated syndrome, Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)."
"9558894","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-shortening genetic diseases. It is characterized by pancreatic insufficiency, resulting in malnutrition and growth faltering even in infants diagnosed early through newborn screening. Obstructive lung disease with recurrent respiratory infections is inevitable. Median age of survival has improved to 38 years in 2008, but 20% of deaths still occur before age 20 years.  The overall objective of this grant is to assess the effects of exclusive breastfeeding and preschool diet on growth, nutritional status and pulmonary health in CF children through the first 6 years of life and determine if these effects are related to an insufficient essential fatty acid intake from breast milk and variations in gut microbiota. This will be done by expanding the follow-up of a highly productive, strong multi-center prospective observational study being conducted in a network of 5 CF Centers in 4 states (UT, WI, IN and MA) since 2012, referred to as FIRSTage0-2 study.  Specific Aims are: 1) to investigate the potential benefits and risks of exclusive breastfeeding (exBF) in children with CF from age 2 to 6 years (referred to as FIRSTage2-6 study) and test the hypotheses that a) the anti-pseudomonas infection benefit of exBF in the first 2 years of life results in better lung function at age 6 years and b) the early growth-faltering effect of exBF is reduced at 6 years by fortifying human milk and enriching the preschool diet through age 6 years; 2) to test the hypothesis that low essential fatty acid concentration of breast milk results from low maternal intake, predisposes exBF infants with CF to essential fatty acid deficiencies, and contributes to poor growth (Breast Milk study); 3) to characterize fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and testing the hypotheses that a) the gut microbiota differs between breastfed and formula-fed CF infants and is related to the frequency of antibiotic exposure and use of proton pump inhibitor, and b) differences in gut microbiota are related to poor growth/nutritional status and the severity of lung disease (Gut Microbiome study). Research proposed in this grant is timely and highly significant, because as of 2010, newborn screening for CF is universal in the US as well as in many European countries. However, optimal feeding is unknown in this very early diagnosed population of CF infants. Aim #1 will determine if exclusive breastfeeding is indeed the preferred method of feeding infants with CF as perceived by many CF clinicians. Aim 2 will elucidate the links between maternal diet, breast milk fatty acid content and infant essential fatty acid status in CF, generating the needed evidence to resolve the long-standing controversy of essential fatty acid supplementation for CF infants. Utilizing the wealth of clinical data generated from Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will not only advance our understanding of gut microbiome in CF but delineate its impact on clinical outcomes of CF. Accomplishing the aims of this grant will lead to innovative changes in the care of infants with CF."
