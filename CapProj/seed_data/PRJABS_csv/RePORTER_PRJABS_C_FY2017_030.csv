"9259939","Pilot and Feasibility Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center Pilot & Feasibility (PF) program provides support for basic and clinical research projects related to obesity, its etiology and complications. Since its inception 35 years ago, this program has been used successfully to 1. attract and underwrite young investigators who wish to undertake a career in obesity; 2. encourage established investigators proposing work related to obesity, outside of their usual areas of research; 3. promulgate high-risk projects that expand the NYONRC's reach into new areas of bioscience deemed likely to have relevance to aspects of our mission; 4. promote collaborative research projects among Center members and the Cores. Of the 90 prior recipients, 66 are still in obesity/nutrition academic research, four are in teaching, and seven are in industry. In the past 10 years, 21 of the recipients have been early investigators and 2 have been established investigators. To date, these 23 P/F grantees have acquired 25 grants, funded by NIH (n=16), and private foundations (n=9). The total annual direct costs for these 25 grants are nearly $3.4 M. We consider this program to be among the most important elements of the Center, and have take steps to increase the resources available to it. For this renewal we have, therefore, increased the requested budget for this program to $100k per annum of Center funds, and obtained commitments from the Deans of Columbia and Einstein for an additional $125k per annum. This $225k of annual funding will enable us to have 4-5 P&F grants (@ ~$45k per annum) active in any year. In addition, our closely integrated programs of the Berrie Center ? Berrie Frontiers Fellows and Scholars ? brings an additional $430k in per annum funding for programs focused on early stage fellows and faculty in the area of obesity, diabetes and allied metabolic disorders."
"9245140","Project Summary  Psoriasis is one of the most common immune-related chronic inflammatory skin disorders. Clinical observations suggest that streptococcal infection has an intimate relationship in triggering psoriasis onset and exacerbating chronic psoriasis. Humanized IL-12/IL-23 p40, IL-17A, and IL-17 receptor mAbs have shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, suggesting IL-23/IL-17 axis plays important roles in psoriasis pathogenesis. Our previous studies have demonstrated that dermal ?? T cells are the major IL-17 producers in the skin and are critical in psoriasis pathogenesis. Dermal ?? T cells are phenotypically and functionally unique. However, it is largely unknown how these cells are critically regulated in mice and humans, particularly in the context of microbial infection and skin microbial commensal alteration.  In the proposal, we provided preliminary data suggesting that dermal ?? T cells play critical roles in skin immune surveillance and inflammation. IL-1? signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating dermal ?? T cell proliferation, IL-17 production, and probably trafficking in mice. Pathogen products stimulated skin cells to produce IL-1?. In addition, we showed that skin microbiota from psoriatic skin has been substantially altered compared to that in healthy control skin. Human V?9V?2 T cells were capable of secreting IL-17 and significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of psoriatic patients but increased in psoriatic skin lesions and produced large amounts of IL-17. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that dysregulated dermal ?? T cells via IL-1 signaling by pathogen infection or skin microbiota alteration play an essential role in psoriasis pathogenesis. Three Aims are proposed to address this hypothesis. Aim 1 determines the role of IL-1 signaling in psoriasis immunopathogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that IL-1 signaling regulates psoriasis immunopathogenesis through 1) directly activating dermal ?? T cells; 2) stimulating KC to secrete chemokines which chemoattract more IL-17-producing ?? T cells from periphery into dermis thus amplifying skin inflammatory cascade; 3) generating memory-like dermal ?? T cells for disease relapse. Aim 2 examines how skin commensal microorganisms regulate dermal ?? T cell homeostasis in healthy skins and dermal ?? T cell activation in skin inflammation. Aim 3 determines how human V?9 T cells are regulated by pathogen components or skin microbiota alteration for expansion and IL-17 production. Human skin/SCID mouse xenograft model will be established to determine the pathogenic roles of human V?9 T cells and microbial infection/commensal alteration in psoriasis pathogenesis. It is believed that this study will provide new insights into understanding the biology of dermal ?? T cell population and immuno-pathogenesis of psoriasis."
"9276317","Abstract The hemoglobin switch -- repression of ?-globin and activation of ?-globin expression during the transition from fetal to adult stages of erythropoiesis -- is a major paradigm for cell and developmental stage specific regulation. Given family and genetic studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of increased HbF (?2?2) in the ?-hemoglobin disorders -- sickle cell disease (SCD) and ?-thalassemia -- efforts have been directed towards manipulating the switch as a therapeutic approach. A major obstacle, however, has been ignorance regarding how the switch is achieved and ?-globin silencing is maintained in the adult. Work in our group over the past several years has established the repressor protein BCL11A as a central, quantitative regulator of the switch. Moreover, critical sequences in an erythroid-specific enhancer within the BCL11A gene are required for its expression, providing a target site for gene editing as an improved form of gene therapy for patients with ?-hemoglobin disorders. The remaining challenge now is development of therapeutic strategies based on modulation of BCL11A function with small molecules, as a means to bring mechanism-based therapy to wider populations. In this project we will focus on the BCL11A protein and address three aspects. First, following our identification of components of the nuclear matrix in association with BCL11A protein complexes, we will dissect the functional relationship between chromatin and the nuclear matrix in erythroid cells. Second, with the goal of reducing the level of BCL11A protein and relieving HbF repression, we will employ genetic and small molecule screens to test the possibility that inhibition of deubiquitylases might constitute a new therapeutic approach to HbF reactivation. Third, we will perform saturating CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the human A??? intergenic region to localize sequences required for full HbF repression, and correlate these with chromatin sites proposed to bind BCL11A. In this manner, we will identify critical cis-acting sequences bound by BCL11A, ascertain whether these are sites of chromatin-nuclear matrix interaction, and define additional DNA sequences for therapeutic genome editing. The goal of this project is to capitalize on our discovery of BCL11A as a major regulator of the hemoglobin switch and develop innovative, and non-traditional, therapeutic approaches to the hemoglobin disorders."
"9278572","Core 2. Project Summary. The Neuroimaging Core will continue to provide the resources for all MRI studies, and will also provide the initial neuroimaging data collected under our current Conte Center, as well as processed data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for comparisons. We will be using imaging sequences similar to those of the HCP in all studies, and this will include multiband acceleration for all functional imaging, as well as high-resolution T1 and T2 imaging for more precise surface reconstruction. For functional data, the Neuroimaging Core will provide both resting-state fMRI, and data from specific functional localizers that we have have established during our current Conte Center. This Core will also provide expertise on preprocessing, including implementation of latest developments in multimodal surface matching. As in our current Conte Center, we will emphasize in-depth characterization of each individual subject and plan to recruit individuals who can return for multiple visits of testing. The neuroimaging core has three specific aims: 1. To provide all MRI resources for the Projects. 2. To provide core and comparative neuroimaging data to the Projects. 3. To provide protocol and analysis solutions, informatics, and data archiving and sharing support."
"9243908","This application is to renew the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a comprehensive quality-assured  prospective cohort study of over 7000 men, which has contributed almost 1300 research papers on the  natural history of HIV infection and the impact of effective combination antiretroviral therapies (cART). The  follow-up of the existing cohort with continuing dynamic enrollment will enable elucidation of long-term  effects of cART, including newer and evolving cART regimens, in men who have sex with men (MSM), the  largest population impacted by HIV in the U.S. The overarching goals of the MACS are to continue to  elucidate the biology of infection and the clinical outcomes of treated and untreated infection, combining  immunologic, virologic, genetic and psychosocial approaches. The scientific agenda of the MACS focuses on  four primary areas: 1) clinical epidemiology of HIV-related and non-AIDS-defining outcomes with particular  emphasis on the effects of cART and age; 2) pathogenic mechanisms underlying HIV susceptibility, disease  progression and treatment response including genetic and other molecular factors; 3) psychosocial factors,  including substance use which influence risk of HIV infection, co-morbidities and treatment utilization; and 4)  development of novel applied methodology. Following HIV-uninfected MSM with the same standardized  protocols will facilitate distinguishing the contributions of HIV, age, genetics,co-infections and behaviors on  the development of non-AIDS-defining outcomes including malignancies, and aging. The role of unresolved  inflammation and immune activation, and more rapid senescence of the immune system, on disease course  in treated HIV will be investigated. Data with linked specimens, particularly from over 700 HIV seroconverters,  provides an unparalleled resource for studying the entire natural history of HIV, ranging from pre-infection  (e.g. susceptibility) to infection, through treatment to old age and death. The MACS is and will  continue to be ideally positioned to address these issues because of its long-term standardized follow-up, an  extensive repository of over 1 million specimens that have been collected semiannually since 1984, an  appropriate control group of HIV- MSM, and a seasoned and expanding cadre of experienced investigators."
"9274708","Ultra-high resolution imaging mass spectrometry (MS), using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) MS coupled to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass analyzer, provides a powerful technology for visualization of diverse endogenous molecules and assessment of their tissue distribution in a native anatomical context. This capability of MALDI-FT-ICR imaging is unprecedented in its ultra-high resolution (>10,000,000), sensitivity, molecular specificity, and breadth of coverage, using a single analytical platform. The ability to visualize the distribution of large numbers of molecules of diverse molecular classes (metabolites, lipids, nucleotides, peptides) in tissues on microscopic slides, overlayed with relevant histological/pathology information, now paves the way for massively synergistic knowledge of human health and disease states. NIH-supported researchers at Weill Cornell Medical (WCM) and the greater New York City biomedical research community (including Cornell Ithaca, NYU School of Medicine, Albert Einstein School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Hospital for Special Surgery) have an urgent unmet need for high-resolution MALDI imaging to elucidate the tissue distributions of diverse molecules of biomedical importance. This instrumentation is needed by a group of 10 NIH-supported Major Users who request funds to purchase an ultra-high resolution Bruker 7 Tesla SolariX XR MALDI-FT-ICR imaging system with integrated dual MALDI/ESI source, computer and operating/analytical software. The requested MALDI imaging system will be housed in a newly-expanded Mass Spectrometry Core Facility on the 16th floor of the Belfer Building at Weill Cornell Medicine, and address the needs of WCM biomedical investigators, along with the broader New York City and State research community. Our MS Facility Core Staff and user's group seek to not only apply existing MALDI imaging technology for advancement of ongoing NIH- supported research, but also intend to expand and significantly advance MS imaging capabilities for isotope flux measurements, redoxome analysis, and assessment of newly-discovered RNA modifications that impact the efficiency of protein translational. We are currently unaware of any ultra-high-resolution MALDI-MS imaging instrumentation in the whole of NYS that duplicates the capabilities of the requested instrumentation. Consequently, availability of MALDI-FT-ICR is anticipated to have great value to a diverse research neighborhood and high demand. We have established a solid plan for making the requested instrumentation available to users and WCM is fully-committed to long-term financial support for the useful lifetime of the instrumentation."
"9254551","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for The OSU College of Optometry Clinic Site to conduct the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, a randomized clinical trial designed to address whether and by what mechanism commercially available soft bifocal contact lenses may slow eye growth in myopic children. Experimental animal data and numerous but scientifically limited human clinical evaluations suggest that contact lenses that alter peripheral defocus may slow the progression of myopia. The first aim is to conduct a rigorous prospective randomized clinical trial 'to determine if bifocal contact lenses that supply peripheral retinal myopic defocus slow myopia progression in children in a dose-dependent manner as a function of add power. The second aim is to evaluate whether peripheral myopia is a visual signal for eye growth by determining whether the rate of progression follows a dose-dependent response to peripheral myopic retinal defocus. The final aim is to determine the structural correlates of any slowing of myopia progression: is any slowing of eye growth local and peripheral, foveal, global, or confined to one more ocular quadrants. Analyses related to the second and third aims will determine how soft bifocal contact lenses affect growth of the eye and, ultimately, to optimization of the visual signals that slow myopia progression in children. In this trial, 294 children aged 7 to 11 years with myopia will be randomly assigned to wear soft bifocal contact lenses (Biofinity Multifocal with +1.50 add or +2.50 add; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY) or single vision contact lenses (Biofinity; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY). The primary outcome measure is change in cycloplegic spherical equivalent auto refraction over three years. Secondary outcomes are central and peripheral eye length. Covariates include the amount of peripheral defocus at distance and near while wearing a contact lens, distance peripheral refractive error without a contact lens, high and low contrast visual acuity at distance, high contrast near visual acuity, accommodative lag, pupil size, family refractive error history, a myopia risk factor survey, vision-specific quality of life, and contact lens wear compliance."
"9273515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In patients with very-late-stage non-dialysis dependent (NDD) CKD (eGFR <25 ml/min/1.73 m2) the optimal transition of care to renal replacement therapy (RRT, i.e., dialysis or transplantation) is not known. Major uncertainty and significant knowledge gaps have persisted pertaining to differential or individualized transitions of care across different age and demographics and different pre-RRT comorbid conditions and events in several key areas including:  (1) the best timing for RRT initiation; (2) the optimal RRT type (dialysis vs. transplant); and in the case of dialysis, the best modality (hemo- vs. peritoneal), format (in-center vs. home), frequency (daily vs. infrequent) and vascular access preparation; (3) the post-RRT impact of pre-RRT comorbid conditions and events including blood pressure and glycemic control, acute kidney injury episodes, and management of CKD specific conditions such as anemia and mineral disorders; and (4) the impact of the above pre-RRT conditions on end-of-life care and decision-making. Given the enormous changes occurring in our health care system and given the high costs of dialysis therapy with persistently poor outcomes, there is an urgent need to answer these important questions related to CKD transitions to RRT.  Given the inherent limitations of the USRDS that lacks most core data prior to the RRT transition intercept, we propose a highly innovative linkage approach between the USRDS and two exceptionally rich and large longitudinal databases of very-late-stage NDD-CKD patients, i.e., the national (entire US) Veterans Affairs (VA) database and the regional (Southern California) Kaiser Permanente (KPSC) database, each consisting of millions of people including over 20,000 NDD-CKD patients with eGFR<25 ml/min who transitioned to RRT over the 5-year period 1/1/2008-1/1/2013. These cohorts will also provide annual linkage to projected (2013- 2016) data from over 4,000 incident ESRD patients including several hundred kidney transplant recipients each year for 4 years, hence adding over 16,000 linked patients who will transition to RRT. We hypothesize that (1) a pre-RRT data-driven individualized approach to the transition of care into RRT in very-late-stage CKD is associated with more favorable outcomes including greater survival, fewer hospitalizations and reduced costs, if the decision is based on pre-RRT factors such as clinical and lab variables including the CKD progression rate and comorbid conditions combined with demographics, and (2) that a scoring system derived from these pre-RRT data can determine the timing, preparation and modality of RRT to achieve better outcomes. Upon linking the national VA and regional KPSC data with the USRDS to identify those who have transitioned to dialysis or transplantation, we will examine the predictors of short- (first 6 months) and long-term mortality, hospitalizations and costs by generating pertinent de novo variables including pre-RRT eGFR slope, laboratory data trends and comorbidity indices; and these pre-RRT variables on >36,000 transitioned patients will be linked and reported annually and eventually become available to the USRDS to share with researchers."
"9297801","Project Summary The present application is in response to Strategies 1.3 and 2.2 of the NIMH strategic plan, which respectively call for the identification of brain circuits that contribute to various aspects of mental function and dysfunction and the identification of clinically useful biomarkers and behavioral indicators that predict change across illness trajectories. We propose to contribute to these goals by applying the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach to the symptom of paranoia and attempting to identify a neurobehavioral mechanism for paranoid ideation. Paranoia is a distressing and debilitating psychotic symptom that is both transdiagnositic and dimensional in that it is experienced by individuals across a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses and is commonly experienced by individuals in the general population. The current proposal conceptualizes paranoia as lying at the intersection of two Domains: Social Processes (specifically, Perception and Understanding of Others and Reception of Facial Communication) and Negative Valence Systems (specifically, Sustained Threat). Existing knowledge links each of these constructs to function of the amygdala, and our pilot work demonstrates that paranoia is associated with increased baseline activity of amygdala and related neural circuits. We therefore hypothesize that increased tonic, or baseline, activity of social process and negative valence neural circuits will constitute a neurobehavioral mechanism for paranoia across the continuum from healthy to pathological. To test this hypothesis, data will be collected across three RDoC Units of analysis ? circuits (baseline and stimulus-related neural activity), behavior (judgments of trustworthiness and emotion from facial stimuli), and self-report (paranoia and social functioning rating scales). These data will be used to test longitudinal associations between our proposed mechanism and paranoid ideation (Aim 1), determine if experimentally induced paranoia yields predicted changes in the proposed mechanism (Aim 2), and establish how our proposed neurobehavioral mechanism varies dimensionally across the paranoia continuum (Aim 3). The findings of this project will not only contribute to new classification strategies that utilize neurobiological measures but also to the identification of novel treatment targets and biologically-based predictors of illness trajectory."
"9389817","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Abstract This Geroscience training program in the Biology of Aging is an unique cooperative venture of the University of Southern California's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology (USC) and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging (Buck). In 2012, in a truly joint venture, we created the very first dedicated Biology of Aging Ph.D. program in the USA. Students take courses at both institutions (some in a fully interactive, on-line format) and undertake first-year lab rotations at both campuses before selecting a mentor and lab at USC or the Buck. Faculty at the USC Davis School have been training Ph.D. students in the Biology of Aging since 1964, but such students were previously admitted via faculty joint appointments in other schools/departments at USC: over 50 doctoral students have been trained in this way. Similarly, most Buck faculty had prior university appointments where they established extensive Ph.D. training records, and many have continued to train Ph.D.'s from other universities after joining the Buck. This application requests support for four (4) pre-doctoral geroscience students in the USC-Buck Biology of Aging Ph.D. program. We also request support for two (2) post-doctoral geroscience scholars in the biology of aging, specifically at the USC Davis School of Gerontology. This request complements, but does not duplicate, existing funding at either institution. The bi- institutional nature of our USC-Buck Ph.. Program in the Biology of Aging is unique, and allows us to broadly foster a pipeline of investigators engaged in basic and translational research in aging biology throughout California. This collaborative effort has been in existence in various ways for several years (before formal approval in 2012) and has proven to be an important force in advancing the aging research agenda both at USC and at the Buck. Students have access to more than 100 scientists performing aging research, more than 40 focused on the cellular and molecular biology of aging. Students regularly rotate from USC to the Northern California Buck campus and are key to creating a unified research culture and collaborations. Joint classes and seminars are held at both campuses and broadcast using Adobe-Connect, allowing for active participation of all members at each campus, including active Q&A sessions during and after such lectures. Thus, this T32 Geroscience application, while involving two institutions, is in fact a wholly integrated unified program in which the Buck Institute scientists already hold USC faculty appointments and share scientific, educational, and cultural goals. A special feature of our program, that is no provided to students in traditional biochemistry/molecular biology programs, is exposure to the full range of Gerontological specialties: including social, psychological, demographic, economic, and public policy. This occurs through interactions with students and mentors in our highly successful Gerontology Ph.D. program which has long been supported by an NIA training grant, joint seminars, colloquia, and interdisciplinary research projects. Thus, our Biology of Aging Ph.D. students are provided with a truly comprehensive background in aging sciences, and learn to value the relationships between each of these sub-disciplines."
"9263999","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to PAR-12-138, this proposal focuses on the integrative and high throughput functional phenotyping of human blood, matched by Systems Biology and Bioengineering approaches for patient-specific training of computer models to identify and quantify responses to clotting triggers or pharmacological agents. A multi-investigator team of bioengineers, computational scientists, radiologists, and hematologists at the University of Pennsylvania and UC-Berkeley will investigate human platelet genetics and signaling, blood coagulation proteases, and blood biochemistry in the hierarchical context of clotting under complex hemodynamic conditions. Four specific aims are: Aim 1 explores the transition from regulated hemostasis to thrombosis to embolism with emphasis on platelet contractile forces, fibrin formation, and von Willebrand Factor unfolding. Experiments and model building will include contact pathway activation and its triggers, relevant to in vitro diagnostics and potentially anti-thrombotic therapies. Computer simulations are focused at the molecular, cellular, and local coronary artery scale, including data-driven models derived using blood parameters derived from healthy individuals. Aim 2 will focus on simulation of acute myocardial infarction (aMI) using patient-specific platelet/coagulation models and the patient's own complete coronary anatomy obtained by CT-angiography. Then, a large in silico patient cohort will be created to score aMI severity metrics to identify multidimensional risk factors and drug efficacy. Aim 3 will utilize an arterial mouse laser injury model of arterial thrombosis to create n vivo data sets of intraclot transport and reaction, thus providing an in vivo setting for testing Systems Biology predictions. The in vivo work will emphasize the use of novel fluorescent sensors developed specifically for this research. Overall, these approaches represent the full integration of platelet signaling models with realistic and hierarchical hemodynamic/mass transport simulations that regulate adhesive bond function and plasma protease networks. Better elucidation and quantitative measurement of blood reactions and platelet signaling pathways under hemodynamic conditions are directed at clinical needs in thrombotic risk assessment, safer and more focused anti-coagulant or anti-platelet therapies, and stroke research."
"9292314","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an accessibility checker to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss."
"9420767","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 98% of the human genome contains non-coding DNA, some of which encodes cis-regulatory sequences that control gene expression. These cis-regulatory sequences function by binding to transcription factors (TFs). Mutations to these regulatory elements-and the TFs that bind these elements-give rise to the adaptive phenotypic variation as well as disease. Despite their importance, many questions remain about how these regulatory sequences function and evolve. To date, studies investigating the evolution of cis-regulatory sequences have focused primarily on how orthologous non-coding sequences either diverge in function or retain their function despite DNA sequence divergence. Much less has been learned about how new cis- regulatory sequences evolve. Here, I propose to investigate two enhancers that independently evolved similar activity to identify the similaritis and differences between the sets of TFs regulating these elements. This work provides insight into not only the flexibility of cis-regulatory sequences, but also the flexibility of the trans- regulatory networks with which they interact. To explore how enhancer activity arises from non-coding sequences, I will compare the sets of TFs regulating a pair of enhancers with convergent activities. The same set of TFs may recognize distinct sequences, creating convergent phenotypes. Alternatively, different sets of TFs may recognize the distinct sequences in a manner that produces convergent phenotypes. A dual reporter gene system will be used to identify the sets of TFs regulating two enhancers driving convergent expression. Specifically, I will examine the well-characterized enhancers of the gene yellow in Drosophila melanogaster and D. willistoni to study how independently evolved enhancers drive similar expression patterns. Finally, I will test whether these transcription factors directly bind either of these regulatory regions as a test of the molecular mechanisms underlying these expression patterns. Through these efforts, I will gain insights into the diversity of pathways that produce identical phenotypes, the origin of new cis-regulatory sequences, and the syntax of cis-regulatory DNA. These insights will inform our understanding of phenotypes, such as disease and cancers, arising from mutations affecting cis-regulatory sequences."
"9292806","Project Summary. Compulsive behaviors, or unwanted, repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing distress, are a core feature of obsessive- compulsive (OC) spectrum disorders, but appear across a very broad spectrum of psychological conditions. Compulsions suggest a failure of goal-directed behavior to override habitual behaviors ?stamped in? through repeated practice and short-term distress reduction. In OC patients, this ?habit hypothesis? is supported by behavioral data suggesting OC patients struggle to override habits even after their functional value has been negated and show deficits in markers of flexible goal-directed cognition. Convergent neuroimaging evidence suggests abnormalities in a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit. However, human studies linking CSTC function and neurocognitive disruptions to compulsive behaviors have been limited by a correlational design (e.g., cross-sectional group comparisons), leaving critical unresolved questions regarding the causal mechanisms of compulsive behaviors in humans. By contrast, recent advances in animal models of OC behavior have allowed unprecedented experimental manipulation of targeted brain circuits and provide compelling evidence for a causal role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in compulsive behavior. Optogenetic studies have established that activating an orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pathway induces compulsive grooming behavior in mice, while disrupting activity in a similar region blocked habit formation and expression in rats. However, the OFC plays an equally critical role in promoting goal-directed behavior, and OFC inhibition can likewise disrupt goal-directed behavior, while optogenetic activation of OFC can reduce conditioned grooming. This leaves open the question of how best to translate animal work to humans, and specifically, which direction of modulation in humans would help tip the balance towards a capacity for `habit override' in the service of goals. For the first time, we propose to translate animal models back to human studies and use experimental manipulation to test parallel causality in humans. In this experiment, 70 individuals with chronic compulsive behaviors will be randomized to receive a single session of one of two forms of non-invasive brain stimulation targeting the OFC?intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) expected to potentiate the OFC, or continuous TBS, expected to de-potentiate the OFC. Brain modulation will be coupled with practice in overriding a clinically relevant habit (an overlearned shock avoidance behavior). We aim to: 1) Verify differential acute effects of iTBS vs. cTBS on OFC function by examining acute markers of OFC activity and CSTC connectivity during the acute window of brain modulation; 2) Delineate a causal translational model linking experimental modulation of OFC to markers of compulsive behavior vulnerability in humans by examining enduring effects of TBS on markers of habit and compulsion vulnerability and flexible goal-directed cognition?measured at both 90min and 1-week post-TBS?and relationships between behavioral, cognitive, and neural markers across individuals. As a precursor to mechanistic intervention development, we will clarify the OFC's causal role in compulsion vulnerability in humans, informing future translational research hypotheses and development of novel treatments."
"9298723","There is no question that the vulnerabilities of the developing brain and the potential for recovery are unique, or that pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (pmTBI) represents a major public health concern with ?400,000 new cases annually. Although the neurobehavioral symptoms of pmTBI are well-documented in the first days to weeks post-injury, few well-designed studies have examined the long-term consequences of injury. Even less is known about the neuropathology underlying the expression of post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and the impact on clinical outcomes. Thus, clinicians currently do not understand how children typically recover in the first year of injury from either a clinical or neurophysiologic perspective. The current application addresses this critical knowledge gap by collecting longitudinal (1 week, 4 months and 1 year post-injury) neuroimaging and clinical data on a large cohort of pmTBI patients (N = 150) and healthy controls (N = 125). Our preliminary data suggests diffuse white matter injuries, hemodynamic abnormalities in deep gray matter, and signs of cortical atrophy at 4 months post-injury in a relatively small sample. Consistent with animal models, these data indicate that multiple imaging measures at multiple time-points are needed to understand the dynamic effects of pmTBI on neurophysiology and underlying contributory factors (e.g., cerebral blood flow, cerebral vascular reactivity). The current study will extend these findings to the early chronic and chronic injury stages, determine how these diffuse injuries relate to clinical outcomes, and determine the individual ?recovery time-courses? of selected biomarkers. Ratings of PCS are collected from both child and parent in conjunction with computerized cognitive testing, quality of life measures, and assessments of pre-morbid functioning. A multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging sequence provides unique information on potential underlying mechanisms of action (water fractions). Functional activity is measured during a spatial attention task and through connectivity analyses. Additional quantitative measurements of resting cerebral blood flow and cerebral vascular reactivity will disambiguate hemodynamic from neuronal dysfunction. These independent measures will also provide critical information on how the vasculature in deep gray matter structures is affected by trauma, providing mechanisms of target engagement for future therapeutic trials. Growth curve modeling provides preliminary analyses of different recovery trajectories (fully versus partially recovered) for both clinical and imaging data. The public health significance of the current application is multifold. First, late childhood and adolescence constitutes a critical time for brain development, and persistent neurobehavioral symptoms following pmTBI can interfere with subsequent academic achievements and interpersonal relationships for years post-injury. Second, developing objective biomarkers that track injury progression will aid in diagnosis of injury severity and provide an empirical foundation for determining when it is truly safe for children to return to learn/physical activity. Finally, understanding the mechanisms of injury represents a critical first step for developing novel therapies that target neuropathology (i.e. target engagement) rather than symptom mitigation, the current approach for all pmTBI therapies."
"9249648","Abstract    Core D: Non-invasive Imaging Core: The purpose of this core is to provide state-of-the-art in vivo noninvasive imaging approaches for: (a) understanding the cardiovascular physiologic adaptations related to changes in maternal-fetal environment; and (b) to provide quantitative end-points that do not rely on animal sacrifice and, hence, can be used to temporally characterize changes in the maternal-fetal interface and fetal cardiovascular development and function. This core takes advantage of OHSU's strength in using noninvasive cardiovascular imaging for understanding vascular and ventricular physiology in the developing fetus. The core personnel will be composed of investigators who have pioneered the development of contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging and have applied these techniques to evaluate microvascular remodeling in health and disease and to understand flow-function relations. The imaging core lab for this project has been developed for the purpose of not only gaining unique information on cardiovascular function and microvascular flow that is not available by histology or ex vivo methods, but also to create a cost-efficient method for evaluating the impact of fetal environment in a large animal model without recourse to euthanasia. Utilization of the imaging core has been incorporated into each ofthe major projects, allowing for predictable allocation of core services. However, a strength of the non-invasive cardiovascular imaging research laboratory at OHSU has been the ability to adapt to the needs of collaborating users imaging technology in order to gain unique understanding of molecular phenotype and cell biology. It is anticipated that additional applications of imaging or new technologies will be developed according to the dynamic needs ofthe individual research programs. In addition, evaluation of cardiac function will be a service provided by the core so that each project will have an entire perfusion and functional evaluation. Each project will take advantage of the core. The core will apply the ever new technologies in the field as they become available to bring increasingly more power to the evaluation ofthe fetal heart and placenta in the stress models in the 3 projects."
"9311559","Abstract  Regeneration of periodontal tissues including formation of new alveolar bone, and generation of new connective tissue attachment have been the ultimate goals of periodontal research and therapy since the 1980ies. Here we have identified the highly selective SETD7 methyltransferase activity inhibitor (R)-PFI-2 (PFI-2) as a powerful small molecule modulator that ameliorated the severity of periodontal inflammation and significantly promoted new alveolar bone formation, new cementum formation, and periodontal ligament re-attachment. When PFI-2 was applied to periodontal defects in our rodent model, there was a substantial 1.7-fold increase in alveolar bone height equivalent to a 3 mm gain in vertical bone of attachment levels in humans when compared to controls. These preliminary data indicate that PFI-2 might represent a new answer to the quest for periodontal regeneration and a molecule capable of tipping the periodontal homeostasis balance in favor of the anabolic side. Explaining the mechanisms by which PFI-2 affects periodontal stem cell function, our preliminary data have demonstrated that PFI-2 treatment increased YAP1 nuclear translocation and downstream gene expression, suggesting that PFI-2 affects periodontal gene expression under inflammatory conditions through a novel pathway that includes the methyltransferase SETD7 and the Hippo pathway member YAP1. Based on these exciting preliminary data we have now hypothesized that PFI-2 upregulates YAP1 target gene expression through nuclear translocation, resulting in improved periodontal progenitor proliferation and differentiation, and reduced periodontal bone loss under inflammatory conditions. We anticipate that these studies will result in the development of novel small molecule-based therapeutics for the treatment of periodontal disease and to combat the associated loss of periodontal tissue that will aid the practicing periodontist."
"9259937","Animal Phenotyping Core PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rodent models of obesity have provide invaluable to the study of obesity and to the work carried out by NYONRC investigators. To meet the growing needs of Center researchers, the proposed NYONRC Animal Phenotyping Core (APC) reflects a significant expansion of the Animal Energy Balance Core (Einstein) and integration with the animal component of the Adipose Tissue Core (Columbia). During the past 4 years of the current cycle, these components of the NYONRC have processed more than 14,000 service requests for 38 NYONRC members supported by 45 grants, and provided additional services to 9 NIH-funded non-NYONRC members. The services offered by the APC have been instrumental in obtaining 19 new or renewed grants, and in the generation of 213 publications. The proposed APC concentrates and coordinates significantly expanded technical and research capabilities of this amalgamated Core. The incorporation of additional animal resources at both the Einstein and Columbia campuses, will significantly increase the user and research base of the NYONRC overall, and of the APC Core in particular. By coordinated application of NYONRC dedicated facilities, and resources and expertise at both Columbia and Einstein, the proposed APC Core will combine sophisticated qualitative and quantitative measurements of ingestive behavior with concurrent assessments of energy expenditure, physical activity, body temperature, and repeatable noninvasive body composition analysis by MRI and MicroCT. Also available are a range of metabolic surgeries, including gastrointestinal bypass, autonomic denervation procedures, and adipose tissue services including: 1) quantifying adipocyte subpopulations (brown, white, beige), in terms of size, variation, and cellular ultrastructure; 2) primary cell isolation and analysis; 3) differentiation of adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages; and 4) adipose tissue transplantation. This expanded array of services stems from the growing realization that our understanding of the biology of obesity requires simultaneous assessment of energy intake and energy expenditure, and of the means to determine their net effects on energy balance repeatedly in individual animals. The Specific Aims of the APC are to provide state-of-the-art assessments of: 1) Adipose Tissue Morphology & Function, in terms of cellular, histologic and functional analyses; 2) Body Composition, in terms of the total relative fat and lean mass, and whole body anatomical distribution of adipose tissue; 3) Energy intake and Expenditure, including oxygen and CO2 consumption, respiratory quotient, and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue; and 4) consequences of Metabolic Procedures and Surgeries, designed to illuminate the physiology of weight regulation and obesity pathophysiology, including gastrointestinal bypass, autonomic denervations and central nervous system targeting using viral, optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches.."
"9263341","PROJECT 1 SUMMARY Wide deployment of malaria control tools in the past decade, has significantly contribute to substantial reduction of the incidence and deaths related to the disease in Sub-sahara Africa (ref). Yet, the region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden of malaria deaths. Moreover incidence remains high but stable in some settings while rebounding in others after a long period of decrease associated with intensive deployment of malaria control tools. The gap in our knowledge that this project will fill is information on the relationships interaction among current combination of malaria control interventions, entomologic aspects of transmission and the incidence of human infection and disease in different eco-zones across West Africa that span the savanna and sub-Saharan Sahel region. The goal of this project is to understand why different patterns of malaria epidemiology and endemicity are resilient to current control strategies at four sites in Mali. The four field sites exhibit different endemicities, length of seasonality, and different combinations of control interventions and duration of implementation of those interventions. The specific aims are 1] Determine a cohort-based long-term effect of concurrent malaria control interventions on the incidence of uncomplicated and severe malaria in relation with asexual an sexual malaria infections at 4 ecological settings with different combination of malaria control interventions in West Africa; 2] Determine seasonal changes in malaria vector population composition, biting behavior and sporozoite rates in relation with ongoing vector control tools deployed on each ecological setting; 3] Assess the relationships between temporal and spatial variations in vector epidemiological parameters, and P. falciparum infection and disease in human populations. This project links the different aspects of malaria transmission and disease into a unified whole, adding the ability to distinguish the contributions of different malaria control interventions on parasite population and range of immune responses (Project 2, Immunopahtogenesis) and seasonal and geographical distribution of Anopheline mosquitoes vectors (Project 3). Understanding the factors relating entomologic and epidemiological patterns of transmission will provide more definitive guidelines for malaria control efforts in Mali and in West Africa."
"9262978","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among all cardiovascular-related diseases, coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death in western countries. The incidence and progression of heart disease is different in males and females, indicating that some protective factors are enhanced in one sex. The long term objectives of this project are to identify cellular and genetic mechanisms, regulated by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones that affect cardiovascular disease, to improve the understanding of endogenous mechanisms of disease, and to identify sex-biased protective factors that may become targets for therapies. Previous research from our labs indicated that the number of X chromosomes causes striking differences in the response of XX and XY mice to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, independent of the gonadal sex of the mice. XX mice show dramatically greater susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, relative to XY mice, and lower post-ischemic heart contractile function. The XX vs. XY difference is attributable to the number of X chromosomes, not the presence/absence of the Y chromosome. Kdm6a is an X chromosome gene that escapes inactivation and is expressed higher in XX than XY cells, and two copies of this gene (as occurs in XX cells) cause greater I/R injury than one copy (as occurs in XY cells). The central hypothesis is that Kdm6a contributes to X chromosome dependent me /R injury via epigenetic regulation. Moreover, because estradiol is a female-enhanced factor that protects from I/R injury, one hypothesis is that estradiol regulates gene targets of KDM6A. Aim 1 will test whether KDM6A is responsible for the XX vs. XY difference in I/R injury by measuring infarct size and heart functional recovery in mice with different copy numbers of Kdm6a (deleting one copy of Kdm6a from XX mice, and adding Kdm6a to XO mice). Aim 2 will discover direct targets of histone demethylase KDM6A, and measure the changes in expression of genes regulated by KDM6A dosage. These studies will define a short list of genes downstream of KDM6A that can be tested to determine if they mediate KDM6A's effects on me /R injury. Aim 3 will compare the effects of two female-specific factors, estradiol secreted from the ovary, and the presence of a second X chromosome, to establish how each factor influences the effect of the other. Genes regulated by KDM6A will be tested to determine if they are also regulated by estradiol. These studies are intended to provide a more sophisticated mechanistic understanding of the differences in I/R injury in females and males, with an eye towards discovering novel protective mechanisms that could become targets for therapy in both sexes."
"9347562","This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one?s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team?s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments."
"9267545","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SEPA application from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research seeks to create and implement 20 novel hands-on, inquiry-centered activities, specifically aligned with the curricular indicators, in a General Biology course in higly disadvantaged high schools, beginning with Northwestern High School, in Prince George's County, Maryland. The biology modules will be taught by near-peer mentors, well-trained college students, to comprehensive general biology students, those deemed unprepared in terms of college preparation in math and science, from mostly under-represented groups in scientific professions. The proposed program outlined in this application seeks to perform efficacy evaluations through attitude surveys and specific task- based assessments, of this in-classroom intervention. The hands-on activities and near-peer mentor training materials will be available on a Wiki further developed through this project. Moreover, many of these inquiry-based activities will utilize available apps on smart phones for their classroom implementation.         The hypothesis is that near-peer mentors - well-trained, often minority college students in biology and biomedical programs at area colleges and universities or recently graduated from them - can improve the attitudes and concept learning of students in a 10th grade general biology course in Maryland. This study will also evaluate high school assessments from this cohort of students from this high school with a paired, demographically matched high school in Prince George's County. Dissemination of the materials and program will be accomplished in the paired school where intervention did not occur, but in a subsequent year of 10th grade General Biology students. Additional schools will be involved in dissemination in Prince George's County Public Schools.         The Specific Aims are as follows:     * To provide in-school, in-classroom internships for general biology students through weekly investigations/mentoring provided by college interns (termed near-peer mentors).      o Approximately 20 original inquiry investigations will be developed to reflect authentic research and provide students with practical applications.      ? The investigations will reinforce the six expectations or concepts of biology required by Maryland's High School Assessments.      o Proposed Curriculum for this Proposal: Serial Dilutions, Molarity and Normality;  Bacteriophages; Eubacteria; Fungi; Tetrahymena - Eukaryotes; Robotics in Biomedicine     * To provide underserved students in selected Prince George's County high schools with opportunities to practice science through learning fundamental laboratory skills and doing investigations with scientific methodology that encourage thoughtful analysis of their data and critical reflection on its meaning.      o The laboratory skills become increasingly complex to parallel students growing conceptual understanding from the investigations with growing technical abilities.      o Smart phones and tablets with scientific apps will be used during experimentation.     * To support undergraduates and recent post-baccalaureates (near-peer mentors) in a joint research and education internship.      o Near-peer mentors mature in technical skills, laboratory management abilities, and research design proficiencies while simultaneously mentoring secondary students and improving their own oral and written communication skills.      o A Wiki resource will be created/augmented as a resource for these activities.     * To give classroom teachers the opportunity to learn innovative strategies for uniting scientific concepts with laboratory investigations and their accompanying process and skills.      o The Wiki resource site with all available activities created under this project will be available to teachers."
"9336080","The skeleton, populated by large numbers of osteoblasts and osteocytes, requires a constant supply of energy-rich molecules to fuel the: synthesis, deposition, and mineralization of bone matrix during bone modeling and remodeling. As a result, studies performed over the last decade have expanded our understanding of the physiologic functions of bone beyond locomotion, mineral ion storage, and protection of vital organs to now include the secretion of hormones that contribute to the regulation of whole-body metabolism. Sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted factor that inhibits Wnt signaling by interacting with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) and Lrp6 co-receptors, has generally been viewed as a local inhibitor of bone formation. However, human data raises the possibility that sclerostin also antagonizes Wnt signaling in distant tissues as circulating levels are increased in conditions of metabolic dysfunction. Moreover, preliminary studies described in this proposal demonstrate that sclerostin deficiency (Sost-/- mice) alters body composition and glucose homeostasis, and that sclerostin treatment augments adipocyte differentiation. These data lead us to hypothesize that sclerostin fulfills an endocrine function that allows bone to communicate with other metabolically active tissues, and to contribute to the coordination of whole body metabolism. In this application, we will utilize a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to explore the impact of sclerostin on adipose tissue development and function. Our hypothesis predicts that circulating sclerostin enhances fat accumulation by suppressing signaling downstream of the Wnt co- receptor Lrp5 and that this function is facilitated by Lrp4, a putative sclerostin receptor. Our approach will enable the identification of previously unanticipated functions of sclerostin. We firmly believe that the information gained from our studies will improve understanding of how the metabolic activity of the skeleton impacts global metabolic activity. Such information is expected to significantly improve the diagnosis, management, treatment, and prevention of the related metabolic disturbances of diabetes and bone disease in aging Veterans."
"9286870","ABSTRACT Diabetics suffer defective angiogenesis as a long-term complication and consequently a high propensity to develop critical limb ischemia (CLI), the leading cause of limb amputation worldwide. This is due, in significant part, to the deteriorated capacity of diabetic endothelial cells (ECs) and bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells, also called endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to properly elaborate needed blood vessels in ischemic areas. Lack of knowledge as to how this occurs has hampered therapeutic opportunities for CLI, including adoptive therapies with autologous EPCs. PPAR?-coactivator (PGC)-1? is a versatile regulator of gene transcription that coordinates broad metabolic programs in numerous tissues. The new and critical role for endothelial PGC-1? is now emerging. Diabetes induces PGC-1? in mouse ECs and human EPCs, which in turn activates Notch pathway that powerfully renders ECs resistant to VEGF. Ablation of EC PGC-1? in diabetic mice dramatically rescues the full angiogenic capacity, which highlights considerable promise of targeting PGC-1?-Notch axis to treat diabetic CLI. However, the significance of EC PGC-1? in diabetes is just beginning to be understood. Deeper knowledge of how exactly this pathway blunts EC and EPC functions is imperative to fully explore its therapeutic potential, since PGC-1? and Notch are expressed widely and mediate distinct, sometimes opposing effects among cell types. Burgeoning evidence indicates that ECs are highly glycolytic comparable to tumor cells, and that EC energy metabolism is the key mediator of sprouting angiogenesis in response to VEGF. In this proposal, we hypothesize that persistent angiogenic impairment of diabetes is, at least in part, mediated by PGC-1?/Notch-dependent alteration of cellular machineries that coordinate cytoskeleton with bioenergetics in ECs and EPCs, and that this mechanism is independent of previously recognized mediators of diabetic vascular dysfunction such as reactive oxygen species. Indeed, our preliminary findings identify novel downstream effectors of PGC-1?/Notch axis that strongly support our hypothesis, and that this regulator is surprisingly dispensable for health but required for diseases progression. This provides answers to many questions regarding the PGC-1? angiostatic mechanism, and opens avenues to develop safe and efficacious therapeutics for diabetic angiopathy that circumvent possible unwanted effects of targeting PGC-1?/Notch. Our hypothesis would thus be of translational relevance to innovate therapies, including gene delivery and adoptive EPCs transplantation, to salvage intractable dysfunction of ECs and EPCs in diabetes that causes angiogenic failure and CLI. Our concept would also provide clues to strategizing how to intervene in cell metabolism and cytoskeleton to develop therapeutics. The major goal of this proposal is to address this possibility."
"9348132","TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is the major aggregating disease protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over 90% of ALS cases exhibit pathological lesions containing detergent insoluble deposits of phosphorylated, truncated, and ubiquitinated TDP-43 protein. TDP-43 phosphorylated at S409/410 (pS409/410) is the most consistent, robust, and specific neuropathological feature of ALS suggesting a phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP) mediated cascade of neurotoxicity. Furthermore pTDP has been shown to influence the aggregation of TDP-43 in cultured cells and in human ALS cases. Our previous work demonstrated pS409/410 TDP-43 mediates motor neuron toxicity of familial ALS-causing TDP-43 mutations. Kinases regulating TDP-43 phosphorylation present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in ALS. We have identified a well-conserved TDP-43- active kinase with translational potential known as tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1). Identification of brain penetrant TTBK1 inhibitors may ultimately provide a viable drug development strategy. We hypothesize that increased TDP-43 phosphorylation drives motor neuron degeneration in ALS and that blocking pTDP accumulation by inhibiting TTBK1 will protect against TDP-43 mediated neurodegeneration in ALS. Three integrated specific aims are proposed: 1) Identification of TTBK1 selective kinase inhibitors. 2) Optimization of TTBK1 selective inhibitors and validation of selective compounds in a cellular model of pTDP accumulation. 3) Validation of the role of TTBK1 in the formation of pTDP using TTBK1 knockout mice and an existing transgenic model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. The studies proposed here will set the stage for development of TTBK1 selective inhibitors as a candidate therapeutic approach for ALS."
"9256412","PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT. A key problem in understanding and eventually treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is our incomplete understanding of the role of genetic risk factors in late-onset, sporadic AD (SAD). While there is no clear single genetic lesion that causes SAD, the observed high heritability suggests that individual genetic background plays a significant role. Here we propose unique applications of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC) technology to dissect how individual genetic background and identified risk factors predispose to SAD biochemical phenotypes in human neurons and to link that information to clinical data on individual patients and to post-mortem pathology. We are basing our work on our recent finding using hIPSC technology that tested the hypothesis that R haplotypes cause general reduction of SORL1 expression leading to increased amyloid beta (A?) peptides and consequent risk of developing SAD [3, 7- 10]. Using hIPSC technology we found that R haplotypes impair a signaling input to the SORL1 gene. Specifically, P haplotypes respond to BDNF by inducing SORL1 expression, while R haplotypes do not. Basal expression levels show no correlation with R or P haplotypes. Thus, the SORL1 genetic contribution to SAD may be caused by complex regulatory variation in living human neurons. We now propose to test our working model for how SORL1 haplotypes contribute to SAD neuronal phenotypes and thus SAD risk in humans in vitro, and in vivo in human patients. We propose to test: 1) the hypothesis that BDNF-induced SORL1 expression modulates amyloidogenic processing of APP and downstream SAD-associated biochemical changes; and 2) the hypothesis that effects of SORL1 haplotype on neuronal phenotypes in vitro are mirrored in clinical data on SAD patients, specifically the relative amounts of BDNF and SORL1 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem neuropathological phenotypes. In a related goal, we will investigate whether purified neurons made from our collection of patient hIPSC lines correlates with clinical behavior of individual patients. At present, we have too few hIPSC lines to definitively establish the degree of correlation rigorously, but given the existence of the lines, we will begin to collect comparative data as a way of contributing to future studies. Together, these experiments will provide new data about the details of SORL1 variant contributions to SAD phenotypes in human neurons with differing genetic backgrounds and potentially lead to new pathways for drug discovery and stratification of clinical trials based on genetic background. Our specific aims are to: 1. Test the hypothesis that the reduced BDNF induction response of purified human neurons with SORL1 risk variant haplotypes enhances SORL1- dependent downstream biochemical SAD phenotypes. 2. To test the hypothesis that the genetic status of patients at the SORL1 locus has a significant influence on clinical phenotypic markers measured in CSF or by post-mortem pathology."

"9316078","PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 6000 children in the USA die from in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs) each year, and 21-33% are sepsis-associated. Although >40% of children with IHCAs survive to hospital discharge, children with sepsis-associated cardiac arrests are 35% less likely to survive to discharge. Children with sepsis-associated IHCAs often have pulmonary hypertension. Yet nearly all animal investigations of cardiac arrest and CPR have focused on ventricular fibrillation or asphyxia cardiac arrests rather than cardiac arrests associated with shock, pulmonary hypertension, and systemic inflammation, common key components of sepsis-associated cardiac arrests. New biologically plausible therapeutic approaches addressing the special CPR circumstance of pediatric sepsis-associated cardiac arrests are needed to improve outcomes from this under-studied and highly lethal problem. The goal of this grant proposal is to establish that the novel addition of a pulmonary vasodilator, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can improve coronary perfusion pressures and improve survival rates from intractable cardiac arrests associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock and pulmonary hypertension in the context of systemic inflammation. Our preliminary CPR data in 30 kg (3 month old) swine and 10 kg (1 month old) piglets demonstrate that outcomes are uniformly fatal from LPS-induced shock-associated cardiac arrests despite aggressive state-of- the-art resuscitation techniques because of LPS-induced acute pulmonary hypertension. As expected, the pulmonary hypertension was much worse in the more immature 1 month old piglets. In this proposal, we will evaluate the novel addition of pulmonary vasodilator therapy with iNO during CPR for LPS-induced shock- associated cardiac arrests in 30 kg (3 mo) swine and more immature 10 kg (1 mo) piglets. Our overall hypothesis is that the addition of a potent pulmonary vasodilator during CPR will improve short-term survival. Aim 1: Determine whether the blinded addition of iNO during CPR can improve short-term survival compared to resuscitation with no iNO during CPR in a 30 kg (3 mo) swine model of LPS-induced shock-associated pediatric cardiac arrest. Aim 2: Determine whether the blinded addition of iNO during CPR can improve short-term survival compared to resuscitation with no iNO during CPR in a 10 kg (1 mo) piglet model of LPS-induced shock-associated pediatric cardiac arrest. This novel highly translatable, biologically plausible and readily available intervention may provide an effective alternative for a developmentally broad group of children who have poor outcomes with our current therapeutic approaches, and has the potential to save thousands of lives worldwide each year."
"9257187","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in seven people living with HIV (PLH) in the U.S. cycle throughout the criminal justice system each year. While studies show that up to 70% of inmates living with HIV who are prescribed ART can achieve viral suppression during their incarceration, this benefit is not sustained after release into the community. In order to help decrease HIV-related morbidity and mortality among former inmates with HIV and to reduce HIV transmission to their community contacts, more information is needed regarding longitudinal HIV outcomes as inmates cycle between the criminal justice system and the community. Connecticut (CT) is unusual in that it has an integrated correctional system which, combined with CT's statewide HIV/AIDS surveillance monitoring system (eHARS), provides a novel opportunity to study the longitudinal interactions between HIV continuity of care and criminal justice involvement. By linking multiple CT Department of Correction databases with CT's HIV/AIDS surveillance system, this F30 application is poised to determine the relationship between incarceration, release into the community, and the continuity of HIV care. By using a retrospective cohort of PLH released from CT prisons and jails between 2007-2013, the Specific Aims for this application are to: (1) use survival analysis to assess HIV treatment outcomes and engagement in care after release from correctional facilities in CT; (2) use time-varying effect modeling to evaluate longitudinal trends in HIV viral suppression during incarceration compared to time in the community, based on type and extent of interaction with the justice system; and (3) use group-based trajectory mixture modeling to identify groups of individuals demonstrating distinct viral load trends indicative of poor HIV management. Exploratory aims are to identify and describe HIV outcomes for particularly high-risk (i.e., female and ethnic/racial minority) sub-populations through both hypothesis-drive analysis and data mining. The innovative linkage and analysis of community-based clinical data and integrated correctional data at a statewide level will allow for the first study to follow both recidivists and non-recidivists in the community and o use advanced longitudinal methods to evaluate HIV outcomes during time in the community as compared to imprisonment. The proposed study will identify key time points at which former inmates are at highest risk for developing poor HIV outcomes. Findings will help community and correctional system-based healthcare interventions target the highest risk groups of individuals at the time points that would be most beneficial. Through this three-year fellowship, the applicant will gain training in advanced biostatistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal an big data with mentorship from a multidisciplinary research team at Yale University. The training plan outlined in this application aims to prepare her to apply for an NIH K/R award, furthering her career as an independent clinician-investigator generating data to directly inform health policy and clinical interventions to effectively treat HIV/AIDS in vulnerable populations."
"9256406","CORE B: CLINICAL - ABSTRACT The Clinical Core clinically and neuropsychologically characterizes, and longitudinally follows, a cohort of cognitively-normal elderly control (NC) subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or other dementing disorders. It also banks biological specimens (e.g., plasma, DNA, fibroblasts, CSF) from these subjects and facilitates autopsy. Over the past 30 years, the Core has provided well-characterized subjects, clinical and cognitive data, and biological specimens to local, national and international research that has contributed to great progress in the areas of detection of AD in its earliest (even pre-clinical) stages, differential diagnosis of AD from other dementias, tracking the course of AD over time, and testing new treatment approaches for AD. The Specific Aims of the Clinical Core are to: (1) Maintain and follow a panel of about 500 well characterized English- or Spanish-speaking subjects with AD, MCI, DLB/PDD, or FTD, and age- and education-matched NC subjects. (2) Maintain a high autopsy rate (i.e., greater than 75%). (3) Perform annual detailed and standardized nursing, neurological, and neuropsychological evaluations of all subjects using Uniform Data Set (UDS) and supplemental procedures. (4) Maintain and augment banks of plasma, DNA, and CSF from subjects with AD, MCI, DLB/PDD and healthy controls. (6) Share clinical data with the NACC UDS and with investigators performing other multi-center analyses of clinical data. (7) Participate in projects with other ADCs, in ADNI, and in multi-center therapeutic drug trials for AD. (8) Refine and evaluate clinical and neuropsychological assessment procedures for accurate identification of the transition from normal cognition and pre-clinical AD to MCI to very mild AD dementia. (9) Refine and evaluate clinical, neuropsychological, and laboratory assessment procedures to differentiate AD from DLB/PDD, FTD, and other dementing disorders. The Core will also engage in innovative developmental research that will examine novel neuropsychological approaches to early detection of AD, assess subjective memory and other cognitive complaints, and assess attitudes and potential barriers to participation in primary prevention clinical trials. This will be enhanced by new recruitment of cognitively normal elderly with increased risk of AD (due to age and APOE genotype) and willingness to undergo typical AD trial procedures (including neuroimaging and plasma and CSF biomarkers). This cohort will provide important ecological validity in relation to enrollment for future primary prevention clinical trials."
"9265307","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity- associated inflammation is widely recognized as a critical factor in the development of insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes  (T2D) and other metabolic disorders. However, surprisingly, treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs have not proven successful in treating these metabolic syndromes and the critical question of whether inhibiting inflammation is a good approach in the attempt to treat insulin resistance remains unanswered. G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) has recently emerged as an important, novel regulator of homeostasis and inflammatory responses in various metabolic organs, most importantly adipose tissue. Previous work from our lab and others describes GPS2 as a multifunctional protein. GPS2 is found to function in the cytosol, where it inhibits the stress kinase, JNK, activation by modulating ubiquitin signaling events downstream of the TNF? receptor, and in the nucleus, where it acts as a cofactor regulating gene expression by inhibiting transcription of pro-inflammatory targets and activating key mediators of the lipolysis pathway. Here, we present the characterization of the adipo-specific GPS2 knockout (AKO) mouse model confirming the critical role of GPS2 in regulating obesity-induced inflammation and lipid metabolism in vivo. We observe that the GPS2 AKO mice become more obese and inflamed than WT mice during high fat diet feeding yet are protected from developing insulin resistance. We hypothesize that GPS2 AKO mice are metabolically healthier than their wild type littermates because of increased adipose tissue lipid storage capacity resulting from increased lipogenesis and decreased lipolysis in the adipocytes. We also hypothesize that the increased stimulation of inflammatory responses in the adipose tissue has a positive and protective role against the development of insulin resistance. Thus, we propose to understand how GPS2 regulates lipid flux in adipose tissue by modulating key regulators of lipid metabolism and to elucidate the role of GPS2 in controlling macrophage infiltration with potential consequences for tissue remodeling and expansion. The GPS2 AKO mice represents a unique model to improve our comprehension of the interplays between inflammation and adipose tissue functionality in the development of insulin resistance and contribute to understand whether inhibiting inflammation in the context of obesity is a viable strategy to ameliorate metabolic functionality."

"9254548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the University of Houston College of Optometry (UHCO) to serve as one of two clinical centers for the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, a randomized clinical trial designed to answer 3 important issues related to slowing eye growth in myopic children. The answer to the first question will determine whether commercially available soft bifocal contact lenses slow myopia progression in children. Answers to the second and third questions will determine how soft bifocal contact lenses affect growth of the eye, in order to ultimately optimize signals that slow myopia progression in children. A total of 294 myopic children (7 to 11 years old) meeting the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The University of Houston Clinical Center will enroll 147 children. The children will be randomly assigned to wear either single-vision soft contact lenses or center-distance soft bifocal contact lenses and will be followed for at least three years using protocols standardized between the clinical centers. The primary outcome is the change in myopia as measured by cycloplegic auto refraction. Secondary outcomes include peripheral defocus while wearing contact lenses at distance and near, peripheral refractive error without a contact lens (eye shape), and central and peripheral eye length. This application details the UHCO Clinical Center's ability to recruit 147 myopic children in 15 months and to retain the children for at least three years of follow-up. We also document that UHCO has the personnel, experience, equipment, and facilities needed to successfully conduct this study in accordance with the study Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details regarding the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the MOP, which is submitted with the Study Chair application. The other Clinical Center, Study Chair, and Data Coordinating Center are located at The Ohio State University."
"9253091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe preeclampsia (sPE) is a placenta-based hypertensive disorder affecting 2 to 7% of all pregnancies. It is the leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The Preeclampsia Foundation (2007) estimates the annual economic cost of sPE in the USA to be $7 billion. Presently, the only available cure for this disease is placental and fetal delivery. In severe cases, this disease leads to preterm birth which, in itself, has numerous serious long- term complications. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve pregnancy outcome by ameliorating placental and maternal endovascular function in severe preeclampsia. sPE placentas are characterized by abnormal trophoblast differentiation, which, together with reduced uteroplacental perfusion, results in a hypoxic state leading to abnormal placental secretion of proteins, which in turn contribute to maternal vascular dysfunction, proteinuria and hypertension. The transcription factor and nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR?), has recently been found to regulate the transcription factor GCM1, which regulates trophoblast differentiation and is reduced in sPE. PPAR? can be manipulated by drugs of the thiazolidinedione class, which are normally used for the treatment of type II diabetes. Using Rosiglitazone in a rat model of sPE, we have shown great improvements in pregnancy outcome and maternal vascular function. We hypothesize that human trophoblast differentiation is regulated by the PPAR?-GCM1 axis and that it can be induced pharmacologically to improve placental and, in turn, maternal endothelial function. Furthermore, we challenge the current tenet that pathological protein secretion in preeclampsia is primarily caused by hypoxia, and suggest instead that it is driven by abnormal differentiation. This hypothesis will be critically tested by completing the following three specifc aims; 1. We will assess whether PPAR? regulates human trophoblast differentiation by direct regulation of the transcription factor GCM1 as part of a cascade that in turn regulates many other proteins. 2. We will test whether modulation of PPAR? activity will improve placental function in a hypoxic placental explant model of sPE. 3. We will determine whether placental protein secretion can be altered through modulation of PPAR? activity to drive trophoblast differentiation, and whether this, in turn, will improve maternal endothelial function. The efficac of this strategy will be assessed by determining in an angiogenesis assay whether media from pathological tissues treated with PPAR? activating drugs will improve endothelial function. Successful completion of this study will explain new pathways in human placental development and the pathophysiology of preeclampsia."
"9259935","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center (NYONRC) provides the scientific resources and cultivates the rich institutional and NYC intellectual communities that are critical in sustaining and developing obesity research programs at Columbia University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein). Through its efforts, the Center maximizes the productivity of scientists and clinicians studying obesity by creating a vibrant environment that encourages innovation and productivity. The Administrative Core (AC) is the organizing center of the NYONRC providing leadership, infrastructure and oversight in support of all the Center's activities. This Core proactively monitors the needs of its communities and adjusts programmatic activities/services to maximize the impact of the Center. The scientific resources provided by the three Research Cores - Human Phenotyping, Animal Phenotyping and Molecular Biology/Molecular Genetics? rely on the oversight and administrative support of the AC. In its oversight role the AC ensures relevance of and access to the scientific Cores, continually assessing them to ensure that they meet the evolving needs of the NYONRC community. The AC interfaces with administrative entities at Columbia and Einstein to provide each core with purchasing and accounting support. The AC also interfaces with other Cores and Centers at its respective institutions to prevent duplications of services. It negotiates and mediates access for members of the NYONRC, and maintains the NYONRC website giving members direct access to the Cores and to their staffs, in addition to information on seminars, grant applications, and other resources. A key component of scientific studies supported by the AC is appropriate statistical consultation and analysis. To support the statistical needs of its constituency, the AC has established a collaboration with the Department of Biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health to provide NYONRC members consultative services on obesity and nutrition-related research projects. Beyond access to scientific resources, sustaining a vibrant obesity research community depends on a broad intellectual infrastructure cultivated by the AC. The NYONRC provides a vehicle to convene ? formally and informally - obesity researchers for productive collaborations, discussions and support. The AC is responsible for shaping and sustaining this community. The most important ingredient in the Center's past and future success is its membership. The AC maintains and enhances the NYONRC community by recruiting members and providing administrative support and oversight for Pilot & Feasibility Programs. The P&F program, in particular, identifies and encourages new areas of research and support, primarily for the efforts of young investigators. The exchange of ideas is critical to spur innovative projects and facilitate current programs. The Enrichment Program cultivates these vital interactions among Columbia and Einstein obesity researchers and provides access through seminar series, symposia, and courses to emerging concepts and leaders in obesity research beyond Einstein and Columbia."
"9278567","Project 1. Project Summary. This Project 1, directed by John O'Doherty, is a renewal of Project 2 in our current Conte Center. It aims to continue our investigation of how we can learn to make decisions by observing the choices of another person. This ability, observational learning, is present behaviorally in several species and likely constitutes the main mechanism for the acquisition of social decision-making skills in humans. However, compared to the systems we now know to mediate direct learning through personal experience, surprisingly little is known about the systems that mediate observational learning. What systems are there? How are they differentially employed depending on the context? How might this vary across individuals? We will address these questions across four Aims that test the engagement of three postulated neural systems for observational learning.  Of specific interest is a system that relies on social inference, the focus theme of this Conte Center. This system, which is thought to recruit sectors of medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction, mediates a computationally more powerful and flexible form of observational learning that requires imputing hidden states to people to explain their actions: their values, goals, and beliefs. We hypothesize, and will test, that this is the same social inference system that is engaged in standard social neuroscience tasks, such as the ?why/how? task administered to all participants under Core 2 and investigated explicitly in Project 2. This Project 1 also links to an Aim that is described under Project 4, where we will investigate the single-unit correlates of observational learning. The strong links between this Project and several others are reflected in its personnel, which include PIs from other Projects (Mobbs, Andersen, Rutishauser, Hutcherson) and post- docs shared with other Projects.  The primary approach of Project 1 uses computational fMRI, which designs fMRI tasks such that regional brain activation can be fit to the parameters in a model of the observational learning process. It will test 50 healthy participants in each of 6 experiments, recruited through Cores 2 and 3, and shared in part with the participants of Projects 2 and 3. Its Aims will test how attention to specific features of social stimuli engages different systems, how social context matters (e.g., if we are observing a human or a computer), how the reliability of the different systems may influence arbitration amongst them, and to what extent there are individual differences that correlate with psychological assessment scores from Core 3, or results from experiments that shared overlapping subjects in other Projects."
"9256411","CORE F: HISPANIC SATELLITE - ABSTRACT There were about 46 million Hispanics in the USA in 2010. Elderly Hispanics are at risk for dementia, due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and vascular risk factors. The UCSD ADRC's studies of aging and dementia among Hispanics aim to improve our understanding of AD and related disorders and to overcome barriers to effective assessment, diagnosis and treatment of early (and even preclinical) disease. The Satellite will support general research in aging and dementia, because subjects will undergo the same procedures, including biomarker studies and request for autopsy consent, as non-Hispanic subjects in the ADRC, and will contribute to research projects and clinical trials. In addition, the Satellite will support research into aspects unique to Hispanics, including 1) the influence of bilingualism and low education on diagnostic assessment and in cognitive reserve and dementia risk; 2) genetic, vascular, and socio-economic risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Overall aims for the Hispanic Satellite in this ADRC renewal application are to: 1) Support research efforts by recruiting and following well-characterized Hispanic subjects with normal cognition, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD. The Satellite will follow about 100 subjects (the balance between continued recruitment and death and dropout). Subjects will undergo standard clinical characterization (including the Uniform Data Set procedures). Biological samples (DNA, plasma and CSF), MRI and other brain images will be obtained. A comprehensive database will be maintained. Subjects will continue to contribute to autopsy studies after death. Data, biosamples and brain imaging studies from Hispanic Satellite subjects will be integrated with those from non-Hispanics followed by the Clinical Core. 2) Interact widely with researchers at UCSD, the VA Medical Center, and nearby research institutions. In particular, support ongoing funded research studies on bilingualism and on brain imaging and cognitive changes in aging in relation to APOE genotype and vascular risk factors. 4) Provide data to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, and DNA to NCRAD, and collaborate with other AD Centers, and with multi-Center research efforts related to AD and dementia. Subjects will be offered participation in clinical trials organized by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), and by pharmaceutical companies. 5) Continue to support innovative research and train new investigators, 6) Foster professional education and training, and to improve public knowledge and awareness about aging, vascular and other risk factors that influence cognitive health in aging and dementia risk among Hispanics. To provide innovative support efforts for patients and families affected by AD."
"9389072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to critically evaluate and expand upon leading neurocircuitry models of trauma and PTSD among assaulted adolescent girls. Existing neurocircuitry models of trauma and PTSD focus almost exclusively on identifying the neural mechanisms that explain observed hypervigilance for threat and deficits in fear extinction learning. While these models have ample empirical support, they do not explain known deficits in risk perceptions of social situations and increased rates of revictimization among assault-exposed and PTSD populations. By contrast, our pilot study demonstrated that assaulted adolescent girls display both worse behavioral performance and decreased activation of anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insular cortex during a social learning task, which suggests a novel mechanism to explain known social functioning deficits in these populations. Based on these pilot data, we hypothesize that expanding existing neurorcircuitry models to include weakened brain and behavioral correlates of social prediction error encoding increases explanatory power for PTSD symptoms and functional deficits among assaulted adolescent girls. We propose to recruit control, assaulted without PTSD, and assaulted with PTSD adolescent girls and administer both a threat processing task and our previously used social learning task during fMRI. Participants would also complete a standardized risk perception task, in which they are presented with written vignettes depicting increasingly dangerous social situations. Aim 1 seeks to demonstrate that weakened encoding of social prediction errors among assaulted adolescent girls mediates decreased risk perceptions to the standardized risk social situation vignettes when controlling for variance explained by neural mechanisms on the threat processing task. Aim 2 seeks to demonstrate that weakened encoding of social prediction errors among assaulted adolescent girls predicts 3-month trajectories of PTSD symptoms when controlling for variance explained by neural mechanisms on the threat detection task. The overarching purpose of the proposed project is to demonstrate increased explanatory power of a neurocircuitry model that includes social processing deficits. Successful completion of the proposed project would stimulate new conceptualizations of the toxic effects of early life trauma and PTSD, and hopefully lead to improved prevention and treatment programs."
"9249031","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in 30-40% of people with type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2) are at particularly high risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as cardiovascular disease and death. Despite intensive glycemic control and renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition, the rates of progression to ESRD and death remain high. Development of new therapies targeting this DKD stage requires greater understanding of the mechanisms causing DKD progression, particularly at this stage of disease. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the biologic pathways that are associated with progression from reduced eGFR to ESRD in type 2 diabetes. We propose to utilize a state-of-the-art, targeted, quantitative proteomics platform to quantify expression of 179 proteins from 12 biologically promising candidate pathways prior to progression from reduced eGFR to incident ESRD or 50% drop in eGFR. These pathways are selected because they have extensive support from DKD animal models as well as evidence of involvement in advanced human DKD, but have not been previously evaluated at this stage of human DKD. Using immunoassays and quantitative targeted assays from our recently completed Human Selected Reaction Monitoring Atlas (a library of peptides enabling quantitative proteomics for 20,300 human proteins), we examined urine concentration of 28 proteins from four of the above 12 candidate pathways. Our preliminary data suggests that the concentrations of 25 of these proteins are markedly abnormal, consistent with expected dysregulation of their corresponding pathways at the time of overt DKD. We hypothesize that a subset of the 12 targeted pathways are dysregulated at the time of reduced eGFR and are associated with progression to ESRD. To test this hypothesis, we propose a case-control study nested within a type 2 diabetes sub cohort of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, with subsequent validation in the Seattle Kidney Study (SKS). We will compare urine concentration of 179 proteins from 12 key DKD pathways in CRIC participants with diabetes and reduced eGFR who do or do not progress to incident ESRD or 50% loss of eGFR during follow-up. We will use these novel measurements and the corresponding clinical data to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1. To identify the proteins and corresponding pathways which are altered in people with  diabetes and reduced eGFR and are associated with DKD progression. Aim 2. To validate the proteins and pathways associated with DKD progression in the CRIC study (Aim 1) in a second cohort, the Seattle Kidney Study (SKS)."
"9272735","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Special Study Center on Palliative and End-of-Life Care will be to provide the nephrology community with novel, rigorous and nationally representative information about a domain of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care for which little information is currently available to guide policy and practice. The median survival of US adults with ESRD is approximately 36 months and far less than this for the growing number of very elderly patients initiating dialysis. Both younger and older patients with ESRD shoulder a significant burden of comorbidity, disability and frailty, while healthcare utilization and costs are exceedingly high. These realitie signal a growing need for a more comprehensive approach to ESRD care that integrates existing disease-based models with a more palliative patient-centered approach intended to relieve suffering and optimize quality of life. National rates of hospice use are extremely low among patients receiving chronic dialysis and rates of invasive interventions during the final month of life are much higher than for patients with other chronic life-limiting conditions, suggesting that there may be a systematic failure to recognize and respond to end-of-life care needs for patients with ESRD. Evidence from single center studies suggest that patients with ESRD have overly optimistic expectations about their prognosis and very low rates of advance care planning; these findings highlight a critically important opportunity to reshape patterns of end-of-life care to better align with patient values, goals and preferences and to reduce unwanted high intensity care at the end of life. There have been no national studies of palliative and end-of-life care in patients with ESRD. Single center studies have been largely cross-sectional, and thus have not examined factors that shape downstream patterns of end-of-life care. To address these knowledge gaps we propose an integrated research agenda to address the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the palliative care needs, quality of communication about end-of-life care, prognostic expectations, and readiness to engage in advance care planning among a nationally representative sample of ESRD patients; 2) to evaluate the end-of-life experience of a representative national sample of US adults with ESRD and their families; and 3) to assess the relationship between advance directives and palliative care consultations with downstream healthcare utilization and costs in patients with ESRD. We will conduct prospective observational studies among national cohorts of ESRD patients and their family members and complementary secondary analyses of existing USRDS data sources to accomplish these aims. Collectively, we anticipate that the work proposed here will help to identify novel opportunities for improvement and future intervention to enhance the quality of palliative and end-of-life care in patients with ESRD and will serve as an enduring resource for the renal community to support ongoing work in this area."

"9345038","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This SBIR grant will drive a promising form of T cell therapy, called ATTACK, toward mainstream society. ATTACK's promise as a cancer therapy is supported by clinical data that suggest it has the capacity to effectively treat solid and liquid tumors, expose cancer cells not recognized by ATTACK to the patient's own immune system for destruction, circumvent the need for patient immunosuppression, avoid deadly toxicities associated with genetically engineering approaches such as CAR T, prime the patient's immune system to facilitate ongoing surveillance for cancer cells, and eliminate complex genetic engineering with live virus.  Unfortunately, despite its unique advantages and impressive clinical results, ATTACK is currently saddled with a very complex manufacturing process that prevents commercialization. This SBIR program is intended to render the ATTACK manufacturing process commercially viable.  The investigation is a two-step process. First we will create novel methods of activating cancer killing T cells to recognize multiple tumor associated antigens. Second, we will use these methods to create a commercially viable ATTACK manufacturing process. If successful, the stage will be set for Phase III commercialization of a highly advantageous cancer therapy. Aim 1 Objective: Create novel test devices for use in Aim 2 by constructing centrifuge compatible cell culture devices integrating G-Rex design principals as well as the required geometry to facilitate the activation, stimulation, and medium exchange investigation of Aim 2. ? Aim 1 Deliverable: WW will deliver fully functional, sterile, centrifuge compatible cell culture devices to  BCM personnel for the activation, stimulation, and medium exchange optimization studies outlined in  Aim 2. Aim 2 Objective: Identify a simple and robust manufacturing process for the generation of ATTACK T cells by undertaking a three step investigation: (i) determine if multiple antigen stimulation can be avoided by increasing the strength of the antigen stimulation signal at the onset of the culture, (ii) identify an alternative source of APCs that can replace the use of DCs, (iii) combine the knowledge obtained in (i) and (ii) to define the optimal final manufacturing protocol. ?

"9471887","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sporadic breast cancer is a hormone dependent malignancy with a steadily increasing incidence. Although the reasons for this increase are uncertain, epidemiologic findings support an important role for environmental pollutants containing endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their metabolites. The last six decades have witnessed a massive introduction of hormonally active synthetic chemicals into the environment. Therefore, exposure to EDCs at critical windows of opportunity during the life course may play a role in changing the susceptibility to breast carcinogenesis. Herein, we propose to explore whether exposure to three environmental compounds with different endocrine-disrupting pathways, butyl perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), benzyl phthalate (BBP), and Zeranol during the pubertal period will alter breast composition and/or the susceptibility to breast cancer. We will build on an existing puberty cohort of in 400 Latino girls in Chile for whom breast composition measurements at Tanner stage 4 are already available. We propose to extend this cohort to add a breast composition assessment two years after menarche as breast density tracks from this point into adulthood. We propose to study the influence of the three chemicals, PFOA, BBP, and Zeranol, individually and in combination, on breast composition in these Latino girls. To explore whether pubertal exposure to PFOA, BBP, and Zeranol has deleterious effects on mammary gland biology and susceptibility to carcinogenesis, we will study the morphology, transcriptome, and tumorigenesis of the rat mammary gland exposed to these compounds. Results from our work will be disseminated via community outreach to family members of study participants and community members in Chile. Furthermore, we will connect this project and BCERP with breast cancer advocacy in the United States, creating opportunities for translation into personal and policy change to promote health."
"9055742","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spoken word recognition lies at the root of language comprehension and acquisition. Recognition of known words (numbering in the tens of thousands for adults) is prerequisite for retrieval and storage of semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic information associated with those words. Typically, such recognition is fast, accurate, robust, and effortless. Yet the perceptual computations required are highly complex, as anyone listening to speakers conversing in an unfamiliar language begins to discern: what one hears is a babble lacking readily identifiable words. Nevertheless, within the first year of life, infants must develop the skills needed for spoken word recognition. Such skills are prerequisite to further acquisition of language, for if a language learner cannot break input utterances into their constituent words, it will be impossible to learn how these words fit together or what individual words mean. Research proposed in this application focuses on elucidating precursors to, and predictions from, development of spoken word recognition. This project seeks to explore causal pathways from early cognitive development, basic speech perception skills, and language experience to development of spoken word recognition and early language knowledge, and hence to pre-school language outcomes. A pair of integrative longitudinal studies will measure infants from birth to 24 months on batteries of tests assessing cognitive and linguistic development; language environments will also be measured. A further battery of tests at 36 months will assess pre-school language outcomes. One longitudinal study will enroll full-term infants to establish normative baselines. The second, concurrent study will enroll preterm infants (<28 weeks gestation): language delays and deficits are associated with low birth weight, and preterm infants receive markedly different early input, but it is not known whether the causal structure of language development differs across the two populations. Specific questions to be addressed include: What is the relation between early (segmental and prosodic) discriminative and representational abilities and development of spoken word recognition skills? Are effects of cognitive development on language outcomes in pre-school years mediated by early spoken word recognition skills? How does absolute performance on cognitive and linguistic measures at specific ages in infancy compare to changes in such performance across ages (growth curves) with regard to predicting pre-school language outcomes? How do variations in informational quality and quantity affect early speech processing, development of spoken word recognition, and pre-school language outcomes?"
"9349163","This research will develop an innovative therapy to promote tissue regeneration and reverse the consequences of recalcitrant wound healing. It is particularly relevant to our Veteran population that suffers the consequences of injury and aging. The $5 billion global market for ?advanced wound care? is anticipated to triple in the next ten years. We have a rapidly growing cohort of older veterans with diabetes, a new cohort of wounded warriors with injuries that include non-healing ulcers from spinal cord injury, multiple traumatic injuries and burns. Hence Veteran populations are at risk for a staggering number of chronic wounds. We propose to use a secreted nanovesicle from adipose derived stem cells (human ADSC). Adipose tissue is an abundant and renewable source of stem cells. Human ADSC release trophic factors that stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms in wounds, and they have immunomodulatory effects, responding to the microenvironment. They have been shown to heal wounds. However, hADSC research is flawed by the lack of standardization and delivery methods. Our goal is to harness the promise of stem cell regenerative secreted factors to heal wounds. We have identified a wound healing treatment using conditioned media (CM) collected from hADSC in culture. We recognize that CM contains exosomes secreted by hADSC, and the factors within the exosomes act in a paracrine manner. In addition to lipids and proteins, exosomes contain various species of RNA. One type, long non- coding RNA, is of particular interest in that it is only secreted by stem cells. Once cells start to differentiate to lineages such as bone and adipocytes, it is retained for a nuclear function. The secreted long non-coding RNA that we find in exosomes is MALAT1. It functions in wound healing, and we predict that exosomes rich in MALAT1 will be able to heal a variety of wounds. We hypothesize that MALAT probably derepresses genes for migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis via its interaction with microRNAs. We will examine how exosomes function in vitro in a human dermal fibroblast wound healing assay. We will use a rat ischemic wound model for examining how exosomes function in vivo. Both of these models will let us optimize the number and concentrations of exosomes that allow for wound closure and modulation of angiogenesis. We propose improvements to hADSC that will allow for collection of more exosomes. Exosomes are more stable than stem cells for wound applications. They can be stored in low temperatures, applied topically and be made available to wounds in emergency rooms and for home use. This project is the first step in making hADSC exosomes a clinical reality for wound repair and tissue regeneration."
"9237204","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary proposal aims to provide mechanistic insight into how dietary polyphenols confer resilience to chronic disease, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Bacterial cell biology combined with meta-omics approaches will first be used to assess acute effects of polyphenols on microbial viability and metabolic activity while in parallel monitoring acute changes in intestinal epitheliu (IE). Murine gut organoids will then be used to differentiate effects of polyphenols and biotransformed/microbial metabolites on IE followed by gut inoculation studies in germ-free mice to further define cause-effect relationships influencing energy metabolism. Consumption of polyphenol-rich foods is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease, but mechanism(s) of systemic protection offered by polyphenols have remained elusive due to generally poor polyphenol absorption and uncertainty about their molecular targets. Polyphenols accumulate in the intestine where they can be biotransformed by gut microbiota into simpler phenolic compounds with higher bioavailability; however, the levels and bioactivities of circulating metabolites may not be sufficient to explain their pharmacological effects. We observed that grape polyphenols (GP) can alter gut microbiota ecology and reduce intestinal and systemic inflammation in a high fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse model of MetS/T2D in association with improved glucose metabolism. Compared to HFD-fed controls, C57BL/6J mice fed isocaloric HFD supplemented with GP had less systemic inflammation, weight gain, adiposity, and glucose intolerance while consuming an equivalent amount of food. Intestinal tissues of mice fed GP- supplemented HFD had: 1) lower levels of inflammatory mediators, 2) higher occludin expression indicating improved barrier integrity; 3) increased Fiaf expression indicating less fat deposition in peripheral tissues; and 4) higher proglucagon expression, a precursor of GLP-1 and GLP-2 proteins that promote insulin production/secretion and maintain gut barrier integrity, respectively. These observations correlated with a dramatic increase in Akkermansia muciniphila, a microbe inhabiting the mucus layer covering the IE. Increased abundance of A. muciniphila was observed after gastric bypass surgery and metformin treatment, underlining its importance in positive metabolic outcomes. These data suggest why dietary polyphenols provide resilience against MetS/T2D; however, because GP are metabolized by gut microbiota it remains to be determined whether intact polyphenols or biotransformed metabolites mediate the bloom in A. muciniphila and intestinal gene expression changes. We propose to: 1) Determine the acute response of the microbiota and IE to GP and assess whether GP or their biotransformed metabolites increase A. muciniphila growth and 2) Uncouple the effects of GP and biotransformed /microbial metabolites on the IE using ex vivo cultured murine gut organoids followed by gut inoculation studies in germ-free (GF) mice to test their inflammatory and metabolic response to polyphenol- exposed microbiota of conventional (CONV) obese mice."
"9451079","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is very common in obesity and type 2 diabetes and it may significantly contribute to the risks associated with these metabolic disorders. Moreover, NAFLD by itself is one of the leading causes of liver transplantation in the United States, as progressive forms of the disease lead to liver failure. Although there are a growing number of epidemiological studies implicating environmental factors in the etiology of NAFLD, mechanistic studies of how these factors are integrated into liver lipid regulation have been lacking. The proposed research will focus on two important regulatory pathways in the liver controlled by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Together, these proteins control numerous facets of liver lipid metabolism including de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid uptake, and lipid storage. As a Class I histone deacetylase, HDAC3 functions as a transcriptional repressor of liver lipid synthesis and an epigenomic mediator of circadian signaling. SCAP on the other hand controls the activity of SREBPs, which act as potent transcription factors downstream of insulin signaling in the liver. Aside from their opposing roles in transcription, recent studies have mapped the activities of HDAC3 and SCAP to different parts of the day. Whereas HDAC3 functions to silence lipogenic gene expression during periods of sleep, SCAP/SREBP signaling is activated by feeding and nutrient-dependent cues. I hypothesize that HDAC3 and SCAP mediated pathways to fatty liver formation are distinct. To study this, I have generated double floxed HDAC3/SCAP mice to allow for conditional and liver specific knockout of both factors in adult mice. My preliminary data indicate that SREBP is not required for increased lipid accumulation in HDAC3 null livers, but unexpectedly protects the mouse from metabolic collapse. My first specific aim is to fully characterize the metabolic phenotype of mice lacking hepatic HDAC3 and SCAP. My second specific aim will focus on the downstream molecular pathways that are disrupted in HDAC3/SCAP double knockout mice and how environmental cues are integrated through HDAC3 and SCAP to regulate liver lipid metabolism. These studies will uncover basic mechanisms of hepatic lipid regulation and will inform future therapeutics to impede the epidemic of NAFLD."
"9459788","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to continue a highly successful Training Program in the Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration - a program devoted to the training of pre- and postdoctoral students for careers as independent research scientists in universities and health-related research laboratories. The trainers are all Harvard faculty members with active research programs related to neurodegeneration, with an emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders related to aging. They are drawn from the Harvard Medical School and six affiliated research hospitals: Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and McLean Hospital. Bringing a wide range of experience and experimental approaches to the problems of age-related neurodegeneration, the Program faculty includes molecular biologists, geneticists, cell biologists, neuropathologists, and biochemists.  The predoctoral students are recruited into and drawn from the graduate students in the degree-granting Neuroscience Program of the Harvard Medical School. The postdoctoral students are chosen from among applicants nominated by individual faculty members of the Program. Selection of trainees occurs through a competitive process mediated by a Training Grant Advisory Committee. A total of six predoctoral trainees and eight postdoctoral trainees are proposed for a primary training faculty of 28 individuals experienced in basic and applied studies of age-related neurodegeneration. In all cases, the main criteria for successful candidates is dedication and interest in aging and neurodegeneration research and the highest level of academic achievement in their previous training. Students are required to participate in special neurodegeneration courses, seminars, journal clubs and symposia. Close monitoring of student progress and career advising provide an effective structure for the entire training process. The purpose of the Program is to create a framework within which the best training of future researchers devoted to problems in aging and neurodegeneration can take place, and the already extensive collaborative interactions among the Program faculty can be propagated at all levels, from student to Professor."
"9331185","Project Summary The Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) was founded in 1937 as a nonprofit professional organization. Its mission, `To advance and promote the sciences relevant to skin health and disease through education, advocacy, and scholarly exchange of scientific information.' An important component of this mission is to ensure there is an adequate pipeline of educators and researchers to foster the next generation. Over the past few decades, there is a notable shortage of Academic Dermatologists in the United States. There are currently 127 ACGME accredited Dermatology residency programs in the United States, varying in size and research facilities. A relatively small percentage of graduating residents indicate an interest in academic medicine, teaching the next generation, and the protected time that comes with it. There is growing concern about the declining number of graduating dermatology residents entering academic medicine, posing a threat to the training of dermatologists who are required to treat the nearly one third of the US population which will suffer from skin disease at some point in time. Members of the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) represent a significant percentage of U.S. dermatology faculty. The organization is uniquely suited to address the problem given the access to both faculty and resident physicians. The SID mission and that of the National Institute for Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) are largely overlapping. Both are committed to supporting skin disease research and training basic and clinical investigators. The two organizations have a vested interest in reversing the trend as major stakeholders in maintaining a pipeline of dermatological educators and researchers. In order to leverage potential synergy in the missions of the SID and NIAMS, the concept of the Resident Retreat was developed. The SID Retreat for Future Academicians is an annual conference presented by the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) for a select group of first-year dermatology residents who have expressed an interest in pursuing a career in academics. The program tests the hypothesis that early and sustained exposure to like-minded residents, graduate students, post-docs and seasoned faculty will have a positive effect on a decision to follow the career path into academia. To achieve our goals, we plan to expand upon the format utilized over the past 16 years, which included discussions of grant writing, finding mentors, negotiating a job (and protected time), economics, work-life balance, developing an interest area, integrating academics into dermatologic specialties and finding funding. These themes have been very well received, but do not address how physician scientists create collaborative liaisons with PhD scientists to bring new knowledge into the field of Dermatology. We believe that this multidisciplinary approach is an important aspect of building scientific opportunity to improve our field, and is a core value of the SID. This modified format also positions the Resident Retreat as a venue to help attract the PhD community to the field of skin biology."
"9307547","With the remarkable improvement in cure rates of childhood cancer over the last several decades, over 80% of children in the U.S. with cancer today become long-term (5+ years) survivors. This growing population of survivors, currently over 400,000 nationwide, reflects a highly vulnerable group of individuals with a high probability of experiencing adverse health-related and quality-of-life outcomes. To provide proper care for this population and inform the design of future treatment regimens, it is imperative to gain sound understanding of their long-term morbidity/mortality associated with specific therapeutic exposures, genetic profiles, sex and other demographic characteristics, and co-morbid medical conditions. Growing body of published literature exists addressing specific adverse outcomes and their associations with specific therapeutic exposures. While these association studies have provided key evidence utilized to develop follow-up care guidelines such as those of Children's Oncology Group, recognizing ?associations? (differences) is not sufficient for provision of individually-tailored follow-up care. Ability to ?predict? (prognose) is required to expand the impact of survivorship-based research and allow translation of observational research toward individualized-precision survivorship care. Capitalizing on existing strengths of the well-established and highly productive survivorship- based research program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, with currently available late effects outcomes data from direct clinical assessments and whole genome sequencing of germline DNA, the proposed project will apply state-of-the-art methods to construct and independently validate outcome-specific prediction models, based on a phenotype pathway/modeling framework for each outcome, incorporating genetic predictors with laboratory-based functional validation. We will undertake an aggressive program of survivorship focused research to address NCI's Provocative Question PPQ-7: How can prediction models be developed and used to identify patients at highest risk of treatment-related complications? By not restricting the proposed research to a small number of late effects outcomes or a specific diagnosis of childhood cancer, our aims are ambitiously set to extensively contribute to and meaningfully impact clinical practice. Our specific aims are to: (1) build individual-risk prediction models that have clinically-appropriate degrees of precision, for the following 11 late effects outcomes: meningioma; basal cell carcinoma; multiple subsequent neoplasms; cardiomyopathy; obstructive lung disease; restrictive lung disease; diabetes mellitus; oligo/azoospermia; primary hypogonadism; memory deficit; and executive function deficit; (2) validate them with independent validation cohorts; and (3) functionally/biologically validate the genetic elements in the risk prediction models. Upon completion of (1)-(3), we extend the model building, validation, and functional/biological validation work to 9 additional late effects: stroke; arrhythmia; growth hormone deficiency; hypothyroidism; central hypogonadism; processing speed deficits; attention deficits; hearing loss; and bone mineral density deficits."
"9311265","This application will bring unprecedented forms of analysis to TOPMed?s already-rich data resources. The application uses recently-developed tools from numerical analysis, that quickly extract key features of the large data summaries used in high-throughput genetic studies. By using them, analyses can be performed on many more variants than is currently possible, so the methods remove a major ?bottleneck? in the process of turning TOPMed?s data into knowledge. The differences are dramatic; for example, instead of being able to analyze single genes at a time, the new methods scale up to (for example) use of whole chromosomes. By working together with TOPMed Working Groups, the funded work will employ these new and powerful tools where they can have greatest scientific impact. The application has several specific aims. All of these will be implemented by our experienced and insightful team of investigators and staff, in collaboration with TOPMed Working Groups. Our group already have considerable collective experience in TOPMed and so recognize the need for its constituent partners to produce high-quality, open, novel and collaborative science, rapidly. First among the specific aims, we will provide the fast, large-scale methods described above, used to find associations with rare variants and TOPMed?s disease outcomes. As an example, our new approach enables use of ?topologically associated domains? (TADs) to aggregate variants for testing; TADs are much larger regions than those currently used for aggregation, but offer a highly compelling way to focus (and hence strengthen) the genetic association signals of interest in TOPMed. We will also collaborate with Working Groups to formulate other new and promising modes of association, and will work with TOPMed?s computing infrastructure groups to ensure that these tools are broadly-available. Second, we will further develop the available analysis tools to cover not just single disease outcomes, but high- dimensional ?omics? outcomes. By using the same fast numerical methods, we will implement ?canonical correlation?- based analyses that can scale up to the size of TOPMed?s data. A first task here will be to summarize major patterns of association between genetic variants and the metabolomic and proteomic measures in TOPMed, but we will again be heavily involved with Working Groups, drawing on their expertise to prioritize the most promising analyses. Third, we will also further develop the available analysis tools to assess problems of ?stratification?, that can confound and invalidate genetic association findings ? particularly in TOPMed?s cross-study work. By scaling up the extent of ancestry that can be identified and adjusted for in analyses, we will be able to make these forms of analysis more robust, and hence increase the proportion of replicable, well-understood scientific findings that TOPMed will produce."
"9327715","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal aims to address the clinical and scientific problem of targeted drug resistance in basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is the most common human cancer in the U.S., and its tumorigenesis is dependent on increased Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, where activation of Smoothened (SMO) leads to increased Gli transcription factor activity. Targeted inhibitors of SMO have been used to treat advanced or inoperable BCCs. However, over 50% of advanced BCCs develop resistance to these SMO inhibitors, rendering the targeted therapy useless. This suggests the existence of other non-canonical pathways of Gli activation. The Oro lab has recently identified one such novel, non-canonical pathway of Gli1 activation, where RhoA signaling activates myocardin related transcription factor (MRTF) and serum response factor (SRF) to bind Gli1 and induce transcription. However, a large gap in the understanding of this pathway is the mechanism of increased RhoA signaling in resistant BCCs. An initial inhibitor screen against selected overexpressed targets in resistant BCC cells has identified transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) and bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP-1) as necessary for maintenance of Gli1 signaling. Therefore this current proposal aims to investigate the hypothesis that TGFB (Aim 1) and BMP-1 (Aim 2) function to promote SMO inhibitor resistance in BCC by activating the non-canonical Rho-MRTF- SRF-Gli signaling pathway. To assess the necessity and sufficiency of these proteins, inhibition and overexpression experiments will be conducted in vitro in BCC cell lines. Changes will be measured at the transcriptional, protein, and cell functional levels. Because bioavailable inhibitors against TGFB and BMP-1 are already available, they represent very promising candidates for new therapeutics. A preclinical BCC mouse model will be treated with these inhibitors to test their efficacy in vivo. The results of this proposal can be used to develop more effective combination therapies in the treatment of drug-resistant BCC."
"9346984","Project Summary Neuropeptide somatostatin analogs are important therapeutics for the treatment of hormone secreting tumors with annual sales of ~$2.4B. However, currently available peptide depots are effective in only half the patients with growth hormone secreting tumors, and patients with carcinoid tumors can rapidly become resistant to these drugs. Somatostatin analogs act by stimulating the GPCR sst2A, but the currently available agents cause desensitization via internalization of the same receptor, resulting in reduced or complete loss of efficacy. We hypothesized that biased agonists of sst2A that maintain strong Gi activation, but do not cause desensitization, would normalize hormone levels in a greater percentage of patients and improve efficacy in patients not adequately controlled by currently available agents. In Phase I, we began developing compounds to test this hypothesis using assays for both receptor activation and internalization to identify several small molecule, non-peptide agonists that are indeed potent activators of Gi, but with far less propensity for inducing receptor internalization and desensitization. These early results paved the way for Phase II, in which we optimized the leads identified in Phase I to identify compounds with sub-nanomolar potency, selectivity versus a number of off-target activities, and drug-like properties ultimately leading to a Development Candidate. This compound is effective in both acute and chronic studies of GH and IGF-I suppression in rats, exhibits good drug-like characteristics including oral bioavailability and half-life consistent with anticipated once a day dosing in human, and a good safety margin based on preliminary rat studies. The goal of this Phase IIB project is to optimize process chemistry and prepare material which will then be used to conduct IND enabling toxicology studies. This will enable a Phase I clinical trial of the first orally bioavailable, biased somatostatin agonist for the treatment of hormone secreting tumors. Our innovative approach towards the identification of such an agent has proactively incorporated a set of receptor regulatory assays, and if successful, promises to deliver a new cost effective therapeutic agent with a novel pharmacological profile that leads to both improved efficacy and durability of effect. Importantly, the GPCR family is a rich source of proven targets for drug discovery, which share common regulatory and signaling mechanisms. Therefore, if successful, this work will not only provide improved agents for patients with hormone secreting tumors, but will also support a general novel strategy for optimizing agonist drugs that can be exploited to target many other GPCRs."
"9249675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) represents the terminal stage of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease and is characterized by rest pain and gangrene; both heralding signs of limb loss. The incidence of CLI in Western societies is approximately 220 new cases per million per year, and with a progressively aging population, persistent rates of tobacco abuse, and an increase in diabetes, a steady growth of the population at risk is expected. Despite recent advances in surgical bypass and endovascular reperfusion techniques, approximately 25% of patients presenting with CLI will not be candidates for either procedure and amputation of the limb is the only option. Most surgeons strive to preserve the knee joint as above knee amputation (AKA) is associated with significantly greater rates of disability, institutionalization, and morbidity than below knee amputation (BKA). Unfortunately up to 24% of patients with BKA require conversion to AKA due to ischemic wound complications. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) improve blood flow and promote wound healing in animal models. MSCs do not express MHC-II antigens and allogeneic MSCs have been used in multiple clinical trials in cardiovascular disease without adverse host immune response. With this compelling medical need and background of supportive data we propose a Phase I clinical trial with the primary Aim of determining safety and assessing the efficacy of allogeneic MSCs in preventing wound complications after BKA. Three hundred million MSCs will be injected into the muscle of the amputation wound and proximal leg at the time of BKA. A composite measure of death, conversion to AKA, and incidence of gangrene during the six month study period will be compared to cohorts undergoing BKA not enrolled in the trial. Perfusion of the BKA flap will be quantified with indocyanine angiography (ICA) and transcutaneous oxygen pressures (TcPO2) at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24 and assessed for correlation with incidence of gangrene and AKA. Completion of this Aim will demonstrate that allogeneic MSCs are safe, if there is evidence of efficacy in preventing wound complications, and if further assessment in a larger randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial is warranted. Using high throughput genomic, molecular, and cellular analyses, Aim 2 will test our hypothesis that intra-muscular injection of MSCs act in a paracrine fashion to recruit bone marrow derived CD34+CD133+ proangiogenic hematopoietic cells to ischemic muscle and that this phenomenon correlates with capillary formation and tissue perfusion. Completion of this Aim will provide a first in man comprehensive description of the mechanisms by which these MSCs promote tissue repair in diseased human tissue."
"9262123","Alzheimer disease (AD) brains feature amply documented biochemical alterations: diminished overall glucose consumption concomitant with an increased non-oxidative (?aerobic?) glycolysis which is paralleled by diminished oxygen consumption, oxidative stress, and changes in the activity of mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy metabolism. The causal-temporal relationship between mitochondria changes and AD? related readouts (any and all of those) is yet to be established. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that a decrease in glycolytic flux, an increase in aerobic glycolysis, and oxidative stress are the consequence of abnormal interaction of mitochondrial oxidation with glycolysis that is triggered by disease-causing idiopathic or inherited factors (e.g., mutated presenilins or other AD-associated proteins). The damage occurs at the level of mitochondria?glycolysis interface-related functions such as pyruvate oxidation or transport into mitochondria, or the functioning of mitochondrial metabolite shuttles that are involved in glycolytic NAD+ regeneration. This results in the adaptive changes in mitochondrial proteome, such as the changes in tricarboxylic acid cycle or respiratory chain enzyme activities. In turn, these changes may lead to an increased ROS production and Ca2+ dysregulation. Furthermore, as the cellular and mitochondrial ROS scavenging systems are fueled by NAD(P)H, a decrease in glycolytic flux would decrease the capacity of ROS scavenging systems and augment the oxidative stress.  This proposal will verify a subset of hypotheses that stem from this overarching scenario. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate (hypothesis 1) that the changes in mitochondria occur in AD neurons when they are still immature (at the neural precursor stage) and get augmented upon their maturation. Further (hypothesis 2), we will elucidate whether changing pyruvate utilization and/or the shuttles that are involved in regenerating glycolytic NAD+ (malate aspartate shuttle and alpha-glycerophosphate shuttle) is sufficient to trigger the remodeling of mitoproteome toward AD energy phenotype described above. Further, (hypothesis 3) we will check whether augmenting the cellular pool of NAD(P)H by pharmacological means would prevent the changes in mitoproteome, diminish the oxidative stress and improve the bioenergetics of AD neurons. Finally, we will test the effects of various pharmacological compounds studied in non-human cells and mouse AD models in other Projects of this PPG on the bioenergetics of human AD neurons.  These hypotheses will be tested in human neuronal precursors and neurons derived from hiPSC. The isogenic non-diseased PSEN1 mutant cells will be used in these studies, as well as PSEN1 knockout cells, and isogenic hiPSCs bearing Tau-A152T mutation."
"9284488","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For nearly two decades this grant has developed statistical and computational tools vital to gene mapping. During that period, technology and genomic data changed dramatically. Expression and genotyping chips became standard scientific tools; the full genomes from a host of organisms, including the human species, were sequenced; and low-cost sequencing transitioned from fantasy to reality. The last decade has also witnessed a shift from common to rare SNVs (single nucleotide variants) and from moderate-sized studies to large consortium studies. Simultaneously, computers have grown exponentially in speed and memory. These parallel advances have powered thousands of successful human gene mapping studies for both Mendelian and complex traits. Because these successes have shed light on only a fraction of the heritability of common traits, we have not yet reached the endgame of statistical genetics. There is still need for new ideas and better software.  We plan to build on our previous successes, with particular stress on adapting modern methods of data mining to genetic applications. We and others have made great strides in applying penalized estimation and model selection in genomics. Genetic analysis via penalized regression easily handles non-genetic predictors, uncertainty in genotype and sequence calls, corrections for ethnic admixture, quantitative traits and disease dichotomies, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and both rare and common variants. Unfortunately, it is now apparent that penalized estimation is hampered by severe shrinkage and inflated false positive rates. Our recent development of the proximal distance algorithms and AIC (Akaike information criterion) guided regression show that severe shrinkage can be eliminated and false positive rates tamed. We are also convinced that haplotypes have been underexploited in genetic analysis. These flag local gene sharing, serve as surrogates for rare variants, capture intragenic interactions, and enable both fixed and random effects QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping.  Our extensive list of aims should not be interpreted as a lack of focus. Our track record shows that we can make progress on a number of fronts simultaneously. All of our efforts are directed toward sharpening the tools of genetic analysis. As our programs SIMWALK, MENDEL, and ADMIXTURE illustrate, we are committed to translating theoretical advances into user-friendly software. These programs are notable for their comprehensiveness, speed, reliability, small memory usage, and detailed documentation. The goal of this grant is to empower the very large genetic studies on the horizon. Collectively, our Specific Aims go a long way towards that goal."
"9209974","?     Description: Provide a brief description of the center and its focus.          This is a CoE renewal application for the third grant period of the Advanced Platform Technology Center of Excellence from the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. The PI is Ron Triolo, a very experienced and well-funded investigator with awards from NIH (2), VA RR&D (2) and DOD (2) in addition to the current version of the Center. The proposed CoE is an infrastructure for translation and translational research in four main areas: Prosthetics/Orthotics Health Monitoring/Maintenance, Neural Interfacing and emerging Enabling Technologies. The CoE will predominantly fund the staff and some investigators, with support for research mainly occurring through leveraging grant and a modest pilot program. In each of these areas the CoE will work to move individual projects through the translational spectrum from basic science to proof of concept in animals to in vivo testing to in humans to clinical trials. As a result progres is made toward problems of great importance to the RR&D mission. There is great synergy in the local environment with the FES CoE, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. The CoE investigators are leaders in the different research areas with more than $7 million in active funding for the current year. There is particular strength in prosthetics and neural interfacing. If funded, it is expected that a number of projects and technologies would be translated (or moved one step further along the translational continuum). The projects presented (the majority already funded by current active funding) are clearly feasible and well thought out. The previous funding cycle was exceptionally successful with CoE investigators receiving more the $58 million in external funding and the center becoming home to two PECASE awardees, six CDA recipients and two Senior Research Career Scientists as well as other senior investigators responsible for almost 250 publications, more than 330 presentations, 105 outreach and media events, and over 100 disclosures, 75 patent applications and licenses.           Evaluation:           Significance and Impact of Prior Work:     The CoE has been incredibly productive (metrics given above) and has established a great working model, which has led to a number of promising translational research advances such as:     * Determining the biocompatibility of novel nanocomposite material in rat cortex and developing new microfabrication techniques to process it into functional cortical recording probes, thus moving the project from proof-of-concept to initial pre-clinical testing.      * Refining prototypes of wireless implanted bladder pressure monitor and modular surface electrotherapy system to test in vertebrate animals to prepare them for transition to first-in-man clinical feasibility trials     * Filed a Device Master File for the FINE (flat interface nerve electrode), which was accepted by the FDA and referenced in two successful IDEs, enabling chronic human implantation for natural sensation to upper limb amputees and facilitate standing and stepping after paralysis. The devices have now been functioning without adverse event in amputees for more than two years.          There are numerous additional examples of high impact research at various levels along the translational research continuum.           Strength of Proposed Research Focus:      The proposed work is highly relevant to the veteran population and it is certain that it will produce much new and useful information. The research focus areas have been defined very clearly and the high priority projects in each are detailed in such a manner that it seems very clear that the CoE will be able to execute the research projects successfully. There is much that will be contributed to the VA RR&D portfolio. One potential weakness is that several of the projects will contribute more to veteran health care than to rehabilitation practice as they are more general medical solutions. That being said, they are high impact projects that are able to use the developed infrastructure so this is at most a minor concern.           Effectiveness of Operating Plan:      This is a great strength of the proposal. The infrastructure that they are using has been proven to work. CoE funds support an outstanding professional support staff. They fund all or part of the following: regulatory affairs specialist, quality assurance specialist, engineering manager, director of external affairs and industrial relations, director of internal operations, information  technology specialist, and various engineering staff (several supported entirely by research grants at the current time). Thus, most of the budget goes to professional staff to facilitate the success of the individual investigators to obtain extramural funding, which funds the research of the CoE. They will have a substantial impact with the overall VA research program as they are designed to be a national resource and collaborate with a number of different VA's beyond their local medical center and nearby CoE. They make their platform available to investigators nationwide. They also have developed a number of relationships with commercial businesses which will greatly facilitate the translation of their research to the VA and the rest of the healthcare community.          Adequacy of Resources:      The current VA RR&D program is exceptional. There are a large number of funded investigators with active VA and non-VA research funding (leveraged the CoE funding to $56 million to investigators over the last grant cycle). In addition there is strong support from the VA clinical investigators, VA administration and the academic affiliates. The scientific, engineering, or medical leadership of key personnel at the VA are outstanding. As noted previously, Dr. Triolo has an exceptional track record and record of current funding. Other investigators leading the various focus areas are also outstanding. The combination of VA resources and academic affiliate resources made available are also outstanding.          Budget and Cost Effectiveness:      The budget is able to support the program activities due to investigators being funded through VA Research Career Scientist awards or external research grant funding. The requested costs are reasonable.           Additional Items:     a. Protection of Human Subjects     b. Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children     c. Vertebrate Animals     d. Biohazards          All are acceptable.          Summary Bullets:      * Outstanding track record in previous grant periods and environment     * Stellar PI and investigative team     * Importance of proposed research areas to VA research program"
"9323833","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The granulocyte is absolutely essential for host defense and survival. Its pathophysiological importance is apparent in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Life-threatening infections in children with SCN can be avoided through the use of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), which increases the number of granulocytes. However, SCN often transforms into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A great unresolved clinical question is: do chronic, pharmacologic doses of GCSF contribute to this transformation. Two major sets of human clinical and experimental data strongly suggest such a linkage. First, a number of epidemiological clinical trials have demonstrated a strong association between exposure to GCSF and MDS/AML. Second, mutations in the distal domain of the GCSF Receptor (GCSFR) have been isolated from 70% of patients with SCN who developed MDS/AML. Most recently, clonal evolution over ~20 years was documented in a patient with SCN who developed MDS/AML. What is very striking is that five different mutations arose in the GCSFR gene, one persisted into the AML clone but others became extinct during the course. We hypothesize that clonal evolution of an SCN sick stem cell involves perturbations in proximal and distal signaling networks triggered by a mutant GCSFR. Transition from SCN?MDS?AML most likely also depends on chance, hence the need for a stochastic model. To address these hypotheses through computational modeling and experimental validation, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1) Develop and evaluate a network model to account for the dynamics of normal and aberrant GCSFR signaling effects and their interactions with mutant ELANE; and Aim 2) Estimate the number, timing, and selective advantage of mutations in granulocyte progenitors at the MDS/AML stages and develop and validate population genetics models to predict risk of transition from SCN?MDS?AML. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled an expert multidisciplinary team in state-of-the-art experimental hematology (high-dimensional mass cytometry, cellular barcoding, and patient-derived iPSC), computational biology, network analysis, and applied probability to develop an innovative multiscale systems analysis of how defective granulopoiesis undergoes malignant transformation. Our goal is to produce a first-generation, multi-scale model for clonal evolution of a sick blood stem cell into an unstable one. Our long-term objectives are to establish patterns of network perturbations in myeloid clonal evolution, predict patient risk fo transformation, and design measures to prevent that life-threatening event. One insight from our modeling is that we can predict when transformation to MDS can occur in patients with SCN, which could be used to optimize surveillance and clinical intervention."
"9265128","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal summarized herewith is responsive to PAR-12-138 by (1) Developing and accessing platelet functional responses as a unique human model to be studied within the framework of systems biology, (2) development of novel principles for evaluating the functional interpretation of genetic sequence variation in a robustly phenotyped population, and (3) development of integrated mathematical models incorporating genetic variation/gene expression studies for systematic analysis of a relevant phenotype (platelet function) linked to a complex human phenotype (platelet-associated thrombotic disorders such as cerebo/cardiovascular disease, and. The impact is enhanced by directly comparing and developing these model systems using both normal and diseased platelet populations. Platelets mediate the initial first-step in hemostasis through adhesive and aggregatory events, additionally providing the negatively charged phospholipid surface required for the contact phase and propagation of the coagulation cascade. Platelets are fundamentally important in normal hemostasis and pathological thrombosis (i.e. cerebro- and cardiovascular disease), and continue to be intensely studied in drug development, predicated on the well-documented efficacy of antiplatelet agents in acute and preventative (both primary and secondary prophylaxis) settings. Data using various platelet activation models clearly demonstrate that platelet responses to the majority (if not all) agonists is highly variable within the population, supporting the concept of studying platelet functional responses within a systems biology framework that integrates quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene networks linked to overall platelet responsiveness. In this application, we propose to close the knowledge gap currently existing between advances in platelet genetics and the genetic basis of platelet function, hypothesizing that platelet functional responses can be developed as powerful models for the development of integrated genetic systems in normal and diseased populations. In specific aim 1, we will develop and phenotypically quantify the impact of genetic sequence variants on platelet functional responses in well-defined normal and thrombocythemic cohorts; and in specific aim 2, we propose to develop integrated mathematical algorithms linking genotypic variants and pathways into predictive models of functional platelet responsiveness in healthy and diseased platelets. This proposal builds on long-standing infrastructure, genetic data bases, and interdisciplinary collaborations focusing on platelet biology, and will lead to novel paradigms linking genetic variability to platelet and clinical phenotypes.

"9263988","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive genomic instability disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) susceptibility, and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. The study of this rare disease is significant because it has led to a broader understanding of BMF, MDS, and AML in the general (non-FA) population. FA patients often present with MDS or AML, with the highest frequency during their teens or young adulthood. It is estimated that 19% of FA patients present with MDS, usually exhibiting refractory cytopenia and multilineage dysplasia. There are sixteen known FA genetic subtypes, and the encoded FA proteins cooperate in a common DNA repair pathway, the so-called Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway (D'Andrea AD. Susceptibility pathways in Fanconi's anemia and breast cancer: 2010 N Engl J Med 362: 1909-1919). Inherited or acquired disruption of this pathway leads to the characteristic chromosome instability phenotype of FA. In the FA/BRCA pathway, DNA damage activates the assembly of at least eight of the FA proteins into a Fanconi Anemia (FA) core complex which translocates to the site of the damage. The FA core complex, in turn, monoubiquitinates the FANCD2/FANCI heterodimer at this site. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 subsequently binds FANCP/SLX4 (an endonuclease complex), via the monoubiquitin binding pocket (UBZ4 domain) of FANCP/SLX4. FANCP/SLX4 in turn mediates the excision of the DNA crosslink. The resulting double strand break is repaired by the downstream FA proteins (D1/BRCA2, O, N). After completion of DNA repair, the FANCD2-Ub protein is deubiquitinated by USP1. The purpose of this new application is to examine novel regulatory features of the FA/BRCA pathway. During the five-year study period we plan 1) to determine the functional role of sumoylation of the Fanconi Anemia core complex in the FA/BRCA pathway, 2) to determine the functional role of new subunits of the Fanconi Anemia core complex in the FA/BRCA pathway, and 3) to determine the different roles of FANCD2 and FANCI in the FA/BRCA pathway."
"9229101","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder characterized by acute episodes of systemic microvascular thrombosis. TTP is more common in women, occurs during the child-bearing years, and rarely occurs in children <18 years of age. With early recognition and plasma exchange treatment, 78-90% of patients will survive their acute episode. Long-term adverse health outcomes in adults following recovery from TTP are under recognized. We have documented in the Oklahoma TTP Registry that survivors have an increased prevalence of major depression, decreased health-related quality of life, minor cognitive impairment, and a decreased life expectancy compared to the general population. However, current guidelines on the management of TTP focus on the long-term risk for relapse with no mention of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We propose to utilize rigorous qualitative methods to determine from survivors the most important long-term outcomes that impact their daily routines during remission (Aim 1), which fills an existing gap by identifying specific PROMIS PROs that should be evaluated following recovery. Currently, there are no published studies on PROMIS instruments or the preferred mode of administration in TTP patients; therefore, we will determine the feasibility of administering PROMIS instruments online in a TTP population, including recruitment of TTP patients from the United States Thrombotic Microangiopathy Consortium (Aim 2). Understanding the TTP patient preference will assist in integrating these PROMIS instruments into routine clinical care. Finally, although it is becoming more common to integrate PRO assessments in routine clinical care, a barrier to successful integration is that clinicians are often unsure how to interpret PRO results in a clinically-meaningful way. Clinical severity cut-points such as `mild', `moderate' or `severe' may be more easily understood in a clinical setting than a comparison to a normative population. We propose to create clinical threshold levels for PROMIS scores (Aim 3) which fills an existing gap by reducing an implementation barrier for hematologists using PROMIS assessments to manage long-term outcomes. The rationale for the proposed study is that it is expected to yield important new insights into impairments during clinical remission of TTP and extend clinical interpretability of PROMIS measures to include a new disease area (TTP). Dr. Terrell is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Her additional training proposed under the current career development plan will enhance her ability to become an independent NIH-funded clinical epidemiologist with training and experience in qualitative methodology and the theory and application of the measurement science of PROs."
"9310835","Abstract Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) homeostasis is regulated by intricate cytokine receptor and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) is the key tyrosine kinase in the signaling pathway of an array of hematopoietic receptors, including thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (MPL) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR) in myeloid progenitors. While JAK2 plays an essential role in hematopoietic development, uncontrolled JAK2 signaling results in hematopoietic malignancies. Gain-of-function JAK2 mutations such as V617F are found in large populations of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a clonal HSC disease. Genetically targeting JAK2 abrogates MPN in mice; the JAK2V617F mutation is the driving mutation found in the HSCs of human MPN patients. However, current FDA-approved JAK kinase inhibitors have low curative potential, indicating the need for a better understanding of the regulation of JAK2 for efficient targeting. A number of E3 ubiquitin ligases for JAK2 have been proposed, but none of them, when lost in vivo, increases JAK2 protein level in HSPCs, expands HSC pool, or enhances multiple lineage hematopoiesis. Thus, the E3 ligase(s) regulating JAK2 turnover remain elusive. Through a series of biochemical and functional studies, we found that JAK2 stability is regulated by the CBL family E3 ubiquitin ligases, c-CBL and CBL-b, via the adaptor protein LNK (also called SH2B3). C-Cbl-/- mice phenocopy Lnk-/- mice, exhibiting an augmented HSPC pool with superior transplantability and hypersensitivity to cytokines. Importantly, CBL loss-of-function mutations have been found in a wide range of myeloid malignancies with the most frequent occurrence in chronic and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML and JMML), both of which bear poor prognosis. Here, we propose to define the molecular basis underlying the regulation of JAK2 stability and signaling through this novel signaling axis, CBL/LNK/JAK2, and exploit it for therapeutic strategies in treating myeloid neoplasms. The following specific aims will be addressed: 1. Investigate mechanisms by which CBL regulates JAK2 ubiquitination, stability and signaling in hematopoietic cell lines and HSPCs from Cbl deficient and Cbl E3 ligase inactive mouse models. 2. Determine the influence of CBL on the stability of constitutively active JAK2 mutants and mutant JAK2- mediated MPN development. 3. Determine the role of CBL in regulating JAK2 level and signaling in primary human progenitors and explore therapeutic potential of JAK inhibition in treating murine and human myeloid malignancies with CBL mutations. Collectively, our data point to a novel direct role of CBL-mediated JAK2 ubiquitination and degradation in cytokine signaling and hematopoiesis. The proposed studies will likely provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of wild type JAK2 in normal HSPCs as well as JAK2 mutants in MPNs. In addition, our studies may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CBLmut myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis."
"9245715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate's application provides the requisite training to establish a clinical research career committed to improving the health of families and children with critical illness, which is in line with the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness brach of NICHD. The candidate is a critical care and palliative medicine physician who is proposing to receive direct mentorship from a panel of experts and obtain training in quantitative and qualitative analyses, interventional study design and teaching communication skills. With this training plan she will develop and pilot an intervention that could very well improve communication between parents of children with critical illness and providers (physicians and nurse practitioners) who care for them.  Health communication was added to the Healthy People 2010 objectives, recognizing that communication affects every aspect of health and disease. Effective communication between parents and providers is crucial during critical illness of children because inadequate communication can lead to delayed decisions and increased suffering for the child, conflict between the clinical team and parents, and parental distrust, dissatisfaction and psychosocial distress. Some of the major barriers to optimal communication in critical care are lack of provider communication skills training, time constraints, and provider discomfort with eliciting family values and preferences. In this 4-year study, we propose to develop and pilot an intervention which includes two components: (1) communication skills training for providers; and (2) use of a clinical measure, the Good Parent Tool (GPT) to elicit parental values and preferences around critical decision- making; then provide these individualized values to providers prior to a parent-provider conference and measure their use in the conference. In Aim 1, we will develop the intervention by adapting a validated communication skills training program for critical care providers. In Aim 2 we will assess the impact of the parental engagement intervention on provider's outcomes, while in Aim 3 we will assess the impact of the intervention on parent's outcomes. Parental engagement will be measured by audio-taped analysis using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. All other outcomes will be measured by surveys. We will use the data obtained from this study to generate effect sizes for future mixed methods communication multi-center intervention studies. This study constitutes a first step towards our long term research goal of understanding the impact of provider-directed communication interventions on parent outcomes."

"9268010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application from a highly productive, multidisciplinary, multicenter project  evaluating the diagnosis of women at risk for ectopic pregnancy (EP) and early pregnancy failure.  Early  pregnancy failure is the most common complication in pregnancy with an estimated 25% of clinically  recognized pregnancies ending in miscarriage, and 1-2% are diagnosed as ectopic pregnancy (EP).  EP is the  leading pregnancy-related cause of death and a major contributor to maternal morbidity. When the gestation is  not visible with ultrasound, distinguishing a healthy ongoing intrauterine gestation (IUP) from a miscarriage or  an EP poses a critical clinical challenge as there is no other definitive, noninvasive diagnostic test. Current  diagnostic protocols can result in the interruption of a desired IUP and/or morbidity associated with rupture of  an EP. We have demonstrated that a number of putative biomarkers of EP can distinguish IUP from EP when  used in combination.  Using an unbiased proteomic analysis approach we have also established new  biomarkers, one which we have already validated: ADAM-12.  The goal of this project is to expand the use of  biomarkers to develop a biosignature distinguishing EP, ongoing IUP and miscarriage.  Specific Aims and Methods: We plan to develop a multiple marker bio-signature profile to aid in the  diagnosis of EP.  We hypothesize that a small number of markers, used in combination, will be able to  distinguish an EP from IUP (combination of ongoing IUP and miscarriage) and/or can be used to distinguish a  nonviable gestation (combination of EP and miscarriage) from an ongoing IUP. In Specific aim 1 we will  develop, refine and validate a serum (multiple marker) test to identify EP based on putative markers of early  implantation and viability.  In Specific Aim 2 we will validate the potential of newly discovered biomarkers of  EP to add to (or replace) those in our current multiple marker panel. In Specific aim 3 we will conduct an  unbiased three-way proteomic discovery study that will identify new, lower abundance biomarker candidates  that distinguish between EP, IUP and miscarriage.  Summary:  This proposal represents a unique opportunity to combine epidemiologic and basic science  methodologies to understand and improve upon important limitations in our ability to diagnose and treat a  reproductive disorder with important public health consequences. Utilizing access to a large number of  geographically, racially and ethnically diverse women at risk for EP, we plan to conduct a series of multicenter  case control studies using well phenotyped bio-specimens, and ultimately conduct a prospective cohort study  to assess actual use in the intended patient population.  The development of non invasive methods of  diagnosis, such as a serum test to diagnose an EP and/or miscarriage with high accuracy, would have  tremendous clinical impact."
"9328866","Project Summary  In the past decade, advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of genomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Dysbiosis, or perturbation of the microbiome, has been linked to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity; genetically modifying the gut microbiome thus holds promise as a method for treating these diseases. To achieve this goal, however, we must first develop a mechanistic understanding of the complex ecological dynamics of the microbiome. This requires the ability to make specific perturbations to the microbiome and observe the effects to determine causality, which we currently lack. There are no tools available to genetically manipulate most gut microbes, including at least 30% of species that are not cultivable in vitro. Engineering therapeutic functions into the microbiome also requires the ability to make targeted genomic edits, which presents a further challenge. In this project, I propose an in situ genome engineering system and a novel CRISPR-Transposon platform to address these key challenges.  For in situ delivery of transposons into the gut microbiome, an E. coli donor strain will be orally gavaged into a live mouse host. The donor strain will conjugate a replicative or integrative plasmid vector into native gut microbes in situ to tag them with selectable markers such as GFP and antibiotic resistance genes. Using high- throughput screening methods and metagenomic sequencing of 16S rRNA, I will identify genetically engineerable microbes from fecal samples and determine the composition of reservoir populations for each plasmid vector. I will also track these populations over time to make metagenomic measurements of the dynamics of horizontal gene transfer (e.g. specific routes, time scales, and rates of transfer) in an animal-associated microbiome for the first time, which will elucidate this important aspect of gut microbial ecology.  In this in situ system, integrative plasmids utilize a randomly inserting transposon to add new genetic functions into native microbes. Conversely, to enable targeted gene deletions and genetic knockout studies of diverse microbes, I will develop the CRISPR-Transposon (CRISPR-Tn) platform for targeted transposon mutagenesis. A fusion protein between a broad-host range transposase and a catalytically dead Cas9 endonuclease will be programmed to bind a specific genomic locus with by a synthetic guide RNA molecule. Once tethered, the transposase will be forced to insert transposons site-specifically. This programmable, host- independent system will enable targeted genome knockouts and operon insertions in a wide range of bacteria, and combined with in situ conjugative delivery, will significantly expand our genetic engineering capabilities for mechanistic studies of natural microbiomes."
"9264932","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment of HER2+ breast cancer with the targeted therapeutic lapatinib has shown promising results, but faces the major obstacles of de novo and acquired resistance in clinical use. Much of this resistance can be attributed to intratumoral heterogeneity giving rise to drug resistant cell populations. An important factor of intratumoral heterogeneity is the spatial heterogeneity of cancer cells within the tumor mass, which results in differential contact with extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins, stromal cells, growth factors, and other signaling molecules within the tumor microenvironment. This can variably alter the intracellular signaling network of cancer cells, modulating cellular plasticity and drug response. The goal of this project is to assess what effect cellular interactions with the microenvironment have on lapatinib resistance in HER2+ breast cancer. To accomplish this I am utilizing MicroEnvironment MicroArrays (MEMAs), which consist of combinations of functional ECMs, growth factors, and cytokines printed onto a solid surface, allowing for the simultaneous interrogation of thousands of unique microenvironments in a single assay. I have grown HER2+ breast cancer cells on MEMA spots, treated with lapatinib, and measured functional response to each protein combination by immunofluorescent assay and high throughput image acquisition and analysis. By focusing on markers of proliferation, apoptosis, and cellular subtype differentiation, I have identified several protein combinations that confer resistance to lapatinib In five luminal-like HER2+ cell lines I have identified HGF and NRG-1 as growth factors capable of providing resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib. Additionally, I have identiied several juxtacrine signaling molecules that can modulate this growth factor mediated resistance, and have discovered that their effects correlate with the mammary tissue compartment these proteins normally localize to. Proteins such as desmoglein 2 or E-cadherin that are normally found in the luminal compartment of mammary ducts are observed to enhance NRG-1 mediated resistance to lapatinib, while ECM proteins of the basement membrane and stroma tend to diminish this resistance. HGF and NRG-1, as well as desmoglein 2 and E-cadherin, were all previously found to be important in the progression of breast cancer, but their effect in combination is a novel finding made possible by the use of MEMAs. The overall hypothesis of this project is that juxtacrine signaling molecules of the mammary duct lumen promote a luminal cellular phenotype that drives expression of key growth factor receptors, sensitizing cancer cells to growth factor mediated drug resistance. Additionally, proteins of the basement membrane and stroma can antagonize this rescue. To follow up on these findings I intend to utilize RNAseq analysis to inform a probabilistic computational model of network signaling to determine what pathways are enhanced by the proteins both alone and in combination. siRNA knockdown of identified pathway nodes can then determine which interactions can be targeted to restore drug sensitivity."

"9246535","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have reported progressively higher prevalence estimates, ranging from 0.07 to our recent report of 2.64%. While the evidence suggests that most of the rise is attributable to greater public awareness, a broadening of the ASD diagnostic criteria and better case ascertainment, it still remains possible that the rising ASD prevalence is associated with increases in ASD incidence. In turn, since purely genetic factors are unlikely to have an impact in such a short period of time increases in ASD incidence suggest that environmental factors and their interactions with genetic vulnerability are mechanisms for increasing risk for ASD.  Detecting the etiological substrates of ASD has proven to be challenging. These difficulties likely arise from the complexity of ASD genetics, including gene-environmental interaction (GEX), insufficient sample sizes and the use of mainly clinical samples that may reflect biased selection.  This proposal is designed to overcome these obstacles, and aims to discover etiologic substrates of ASD and determine their relationship to ASD incidence. This goal will be achieved by first prospectively examining cumulative incidence up to age 7 using 5 successive birth cohorts from Goyang City, South Korea, using a total population strategy and systematic, standardized case identification procedures. In this process, we will establish a systematically-ascertained population-based cohort of children with ASD, their families and sex and IQ matched controls from which we will collect data from medical histories, neuropsychological testing and physical examinations, along with blood for measurement of hormones and putative environmental toxins. With these data, we will examine the role of environmental risks in ASD incidence and phenotype. Finally, we will establish a biorepository of serum for further analyses, including toxins and ASD-related immunological markers, while also creating cell lines and purified DNA that can be used for future genetic and GEX studies. While these materials will be available for a subsequent large scale GEX study in which we will complete whole genome genotyping to provide sufficient coverage for environmentally responsive genes, in years 4 and 5 of the proposed study, we will also examine GEX using rapidly evolving data and replicated genetic markers from ongoing ASD genetic studies.  When the proposed sample collection is completed, it will be analyzed independently and then combined with the data from our large-scale, Simons Foundation-funded epidemiological sample (N=10,000) whose saliva/blood were collected and phenotype was measured for ASD symptoms. This combination will dramatically increase the power and provide substantial opportunities to address ASD genetic architecture, the role of environmental factors and GEX in a large-scale, statistically well-powered, systematically-ascertained, population-based, genetically homogenous group of distinct individuals with ASD, along with matched controls."
"9259940","ENRICHMENT PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The goal of the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center (NYONRC) is to advance translational research in obesity and nutrition. This requires the development of a dynamic, cohesive and interactive community of researchers. The Enrichment Program plays a central role in fostering this community, in which ideas, techniques and expertise are freely exchanged. The Enrichment Program accomplishes this through weekly meetings, special lectures, annual symposia/classes and by supporting educational efforts for students and fellows. All of these efforts are coordinated with other programs at Columbia and Einstein, so that there is complementarity and non-overlapping. With the movement of the St. Luke's faculty to the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), the weekly seminar series has been revamped and received significant financial support from the Division of Preventive Medicine & Nutrition at Columbia. The NYONRC now holds two weekly seminars: The DeWitt Goodman Seminar Series which brings researchers from beyond Columbia and Einstein to the NYONRC and provides a forum for local NYONRC researchers to present well developed research projects, and the Berrie Center Work-in-Progress Seminar Series at which students and post-doctoral fellows present their on-going research. The NYONRC also organizes and promotes several annual programs including the DeWitt Goodman Lectureship, Obesity Prevention Month and the Obesity Course. Along with other annual programs held at Columbia and Einstein, these longstanding programs promote the exchange of data, ideas and are aimed: 1) To promote scientific exchange among NYONRC investigators. The NYONRC is more than a collection of individually operating laboratories. It is a vital community of scientists who exchange ideas, approaches and data leading to collaborations and mutual support. These scientific exchanges are most effective when investigators present their work on an ongoing basis. 2) To facilitate the interactions between Center investigators and non NYONRC scientists. Fresh approaches, ideas and models provide stimuli for innovative science. To cultivate innovation the NYONRC hosts researchers from outside of Einstein and Columbia and local scientists who have expertise beyond obesity and nutrition. The weekly DeWitt Goodman Seminar Series provide the opportunity for NYONRC investigator to hear and discuss scientific work beyond the NYONRC community. 3) To support the education, training and development of scientists studying obesity. The education of young scientists is critical in maintaining any scientific community. This has been borne out by the long history of the NYONRC training its own future leaders. The NYONRC leadership actively supports the training programs that add substantially to the intellectual environment of the Center and are critical for its future."

We will also humanize RTO, maintain its PF4-monomer binding ability, but minimize the human immune response in preparation for potential future clinical studies."
"9328590","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For most of the last century, it was thought that all epigenetic information in germ cells was erased at the start of each new generation. However, it is now known that this is not always the case. Many examples of epigenetic information escaping reprogramming and crossing generational boundaries have now been documented (collectively termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance or TEI). Examples of TEI include paramutation in plants, RNAi inheritance in C. elegans, and the inheritance of acquired traits in mice. Given the large number of cases of TEI that have now been observed, it is possible that TEI may be an important adaptive process with significant implications for our understanding of heredity. We do not yet understand how epigenetic information is inherited, how TEI is regulated, or why animals possess TEI systems. One dramatic example of TEI occurs in the model organism C. elegans: in C. elegans, the effects of double stranded (ds)RNA exposure (termed RNA interference, RNAi) can be passed from parent to progeny for more than five generations (termed RNAi inheritance). I hypothesized that C. elegans possess systems that limit TEI inheritance and by removing these limiting systems, TEI might last for more generations than usual. With this idea in mind, I performed a forward genetic screen to identify mutations that make RNAi inheritance last for more generations than normal. My screen identified the gene heritable enhancer of RNAi 1 (heri-1). heri-1 encodes a gene whose protein product contains two conserved domains: a putative chromodomain and a domain with homology to kinases. I have found that HERI-1 is recruited to genomic sites targeted by RNAi and the recruitment of HERI-1 to these sites limits the inheritance of epigenetic information at these sites. As far as I am aware, HERI-1 represents the first known factor dedicated to the regulation of TEI in animals. The research strategy proposed here is designed to provide further insights into how epigenetic inheritance is regulated. There is currently intense scientific debate about whether or not epigenetic information can be inherited in humans and whether or not inherited epigenetic information might contribute to human disease. If the answer to this question turns out to be yes, my work exploring how TEI is regulated could help us understand the basic molecular mechanisms that limit and regulate epigenetic inheritance and, thus, make it possible to influence heritable epigenetic processes in such a way as to mitigate human disease."
"9258029","PROJECT SUMMARY  Ischemic heart disease accounts for approximately 42.5% of all cardiovascular-related deaths and afflicts 720,000 individuals/year. While current medical treatments have significantly decreased heart attack- associated mortality, post-ischemic myocardial tissue undergoes pathologic remodeling and scarring, subjecting patients to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. As endogenous cardiac regeneration is limited, stem cell and regenerative medicine-based approaches to cardiac repair represent promising solutions towards regaining normal heart function. Bolstering interest in cardiovascular tissue engineering has given rise to the development of novel biomaterials capable of maintaining cardiac cell function within a 3D tissue-like environment, while detailed protocols have been developed to derive mature cardiomyocytes from a myriad of stem cell sources; however, the essential ability to generate a construct that recapitulates the cellular density and composition, thickness, and helicoid structure of the native heart has limited the therapeutic applicability of tissue engineered constructs thus far. Utilizing photodegradable polymer-based hydrogels that enable a spatially-defined co-culture of hES-derived cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, we propose to generate a densely-vascularized 3D cardiac construct exhibiting biomimetic helical tissue architecture. To support the culture of a thick myocardial tissue and enhance mass transport of oxygen and nutrients, vessels will be photopatterned into cell-laden hydrogels containing mature cardiomyocytes to generate perfusable vasculature with similar size, shape, and structure to that of the native heart. Channels will be endothelialized and perfused with fresh media using biomimetic pulsatile flow to encourage endothelial-cardiomyocyte cell interaction. We aim to demonstrate that by controlling micron-scale channel architecture in a biomimetic helical arrangement with near-native heart capillary density, paracrine signaling, ECM deposition, and direct contact of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, we can direct cardiomyocyte orientation, enhance construct contractility, and recapitulate the native torsional tissue contraction. As the proposed research will represent the first successful strategy to generate perfusable vasculature networks with 3D features on the single-micron scale, we expect that the developed methodologies will find wide applicability in the engineering of vascularized constructs beyond cardiac tissue."

"9249099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects roughly 2 million people in the US and remains responsible for twice as many years of life lost as all of childhood cancer combined. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become the gold standard technique that clinicians use to monitor cardiovascular function in patients over time. Advanced CMR techniques offer incredible potential for improving our ability to diagnose and treat patients with CHD, but currently require long acquisition times that limit their feasibility n the clinic. Our overall goal is to make these advanced CMR techniques clinically feasible through dramatically reducing the time required to acquire the image data. We propose a new CMR system, which we call videogame interface for diaphragm location (VIDLoc), that can reduce acquisition times by 50%. VIDLoc works by advising children how to alter their breathing patterns in real-time, during CMR, in order to dramatically reduce the total time required to acquire CMR data. Because the heart moves up and down on the diaphragm as children breathe, imaging can only be performed when the diaphragm is within a narrow region called the acceptance window. Since children breathe very erratically, the amount of time they spend in the acceptance window is often as low as 20% (thus imaging can only be performed 1/5th of the time). VIDLoc overcomes this by imaging the child's diaphragm location in real-time and using this to generate a videogame showing a car on a road. The car's location relative to the road represents the diaphragm location relative to the acceptance window. VIDLoc will provide instructions to children to guide their diaphragm (or car) to be within the acceptance window (or road), where the heart can be imaged. We hypothesize that using VIDLoc will increase the amount of time spent in the acceptance window and therefore dramatically reduce CMR acquisition times. This will make advanced CMR techniques clinically feasible in patients with CHD. We will first optimize VIDLoc by adding extra features, such as text and voice feedback of breathing instructions, which will be tested by children with CHD to determine each feature's effectiveness. Then, we will test VIDLoc against conventional free breathing for acquisition time and quality of data derived. Twenty children with CHD will undergo an advanced CMR technique to image three-dimensional cardiac motion. Lastly, we will quantify the acquisition time and quality of data derived from VIDLoc with and without pre-CMR training in a simulator. A simulated version of the VIDLoc system outside of the scanner will use a sensor to quantify chest wall excursion as a proxy for diaphragm location. Twenty children with CHD will be randomized to undergo advanced CMR using VIDLoc with or without pre-CMR training in the simulator. Acquisition times and image quality will be used to determine the efficacy of pre-CMR training. The overall goal of this proposal is to use VIDLoc to reduce CMR acquisition time so that we can start using advanced CMR techniques in the clinic to ultimately improve the lives of patients with congenital heart disease."
"9225215","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether the height of the incision made during trichiasis surgery affects surgical outcomes as measured within 12 months after surgery. The trial will be conducted in southern Ethiopia, where trachomatous trichiasis is endemic. Approximately 2,400 adult subjects will be enrolled. They will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to surgery with an incision height of 3 mm or 5 mm. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks after surgery and participants will be examined again at 6 weeks and 12 months after surgery. The primary outcome is presence of post-operative trichiasis, defined as one or more lashes touching the eye or confirmed evidence of epilation. The secondary outcome is presence of a moderate or severe eyelid contour abnormality. Nearly 8 million individuals are in need of trichiasis surgery. If this trial is successful in reducing th rate of post-operative trichiasis by 25%, an estimated 300,000 individuals will be spared from post-operative trichiasis, which will allow reallocation of resources from repeat surgery to provide services to hundreds of thousands of individuals needing initial trichiasis surgery."
"9330432","ABSTRACT It is estimated that >300 million patients worldwide undergo major surgery each year, a feat that would have been impossible without the discovery of general anesthesia in the mid-19th century. The specialty of anesthesiology now spans operating rooms, intensive care units, and pain clinics; in addition to insensate surgery, anesthesiology has contributed widely to the field of medicine as a whole with innovations such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and critical care medicine. Anesthesiology has been a recognized leader in patient safety and quality improvement, with dramatic reductions in intraoperative mortality over the past five decades. Despite these important clinical contributions that make modern medicine possible, the academic development of anesthesiology has not kept pace with other fields of medicine. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding is generally lower in anesthesiology compared with other disciplines. There is, in our opinion, an urgent need to direct energy and resources to securing the future of academic anesthesiology. We believe that junior academic anesthesiologists and associated trainees represent key targets for high-impact interventions. In the current status quo, junior anesthesiologist-scientists often work in silos within individual departments or within isolated fields. Based on preliminary data, they perceive limited access to the mentorship of a broad array of senior leaders in the field and?perhaps more importantly?they feel disconnected from one another. Furthermore, there is a significant potential to engage junior academic anesthesiologists and trainees in the creation of positive impact through translational research. We propose a series of career development conferences for anesthesiology T32 fellows nationwide as well as research-oriented trainees that will help them navigate the translational research continuum and turn their discoveries into benefits for patients and their communities. These conferences will promote NIH scientific goals by providing mentorship to rising scholars, educating and engaging them in translational principles, enabling scientific collaborations, and stimulating new lines of research. Our strategic goal is to help empower the current and upcoming generations of junior academic anesthesiologists in order to secure the future of academic anesthesiology so that we may continue to make innovative contributions to medicine and society."
"9060761","?     DESCRIPTION:      Homelessness in Veterans is a widespread, vexing problem, and an urgent priority at the national level. The VA set a goal to prevent and eliminate homelessness in Veterans within 5 years (that is, by 2015). This is an important goal because Veterans are greatly overrepresented among the homeless (16% versus 8% non- Veterans). Using models such as supportive housing, the VA has made substantial progress in housing Veterans. For example, between 2010 and 2013, the number of homeless Veterans decreased by 24%. Despite this substantial progress in providing housing for Veterans, a fundamental problem remains. Permanent housing is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for successful community integration. Community integration is defined in terms of: 1) social integration (i.e., contact with family and friends) and 2) work integration (maintaining productive activities in work or school). Providing housing is only the first step in facilitating recovery among homeless Veterans; once housed, they will need different types of assistance to integrate into communities. Community integration does not arise automatically once housing is provided. Hence, we propose a Research Enhancement Award Program (REAP) application linked to the homeless programs at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLA) to serve as an interdisciplinary center to generate intervention and translational research to improve community integration for homeless Veterans. The REAP will fill a critical gap: Rather than focusing on factors that confer risk for homelessness in Veterans (a complex question already being widely studied), we will instead apply our group's skills to the neglected problem of community integration for Veterans once housing has been provided. It will attract and develop clinical researchers and trainees who will focus their energies on this critical problem. The REAP will be based at GLA, which has served 34,000 homeless Veterans since FY 2006, including 4,000 new homeless Veterans each year, and has the largest homeless program of any VA in the nation. The mission of this REAP is to understand and to improve community integration in homeless Veterans. This mission consists of several components:  Research: This REAP will support: 1) translational studies using cognitive neuroscience methods and concepts to understand the determinants of work and social integration in homeless Veterans after housing is provided, and 2) intervention studies to rigorously evaluate with randomized controlled trials innovative treatments to enhance community integration for these individuals.  Training: This REAP will encourage postdoctoral fellows and junior investigators to focus their professional talents on the topic of homelessness and community integration in Veterans. This goal will be accomplished by the Pilot Grant Program and through multi-disciplinary mentorship.  Facilitation for new projects: The proposed REAP will provide support for independent grant submissions. Future applications will benefit from the REAP infrastructure, such as recruitment pathways, and a rare collection of expertise in clinical trial methodology, outcomes research, and cognitive and social neuroscience. To facilitate the development of new projects, the REAP will provide services to projects, including: 1) recruitment and assessment of participants for all REAP research projects; and 2) data management and statistical support for future applications."
"9306648","The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of ?big data? for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm ? specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships ? can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation."
"9299834","Project Title: Tumor-targeted nanoparticle-based delivery system for imaging and treatment of cancer Project Summary Early detection of cancer substantially increases the probability of its successful and effective treatment. Theranostics is an emerging field in medical research that can potentially improve overall patient therapy and outcome by combining diagnostic and specific therapeutic properties. Although nanoparticles allow for distinct advantages in the field of therapy of different diseases, a combination of both diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in a single nanoparticle may be associated with certain difficulties. Therefore, it may be ideal to develop a separated, but integrated multi-particle system for theranostics. The efficacy of the cancer detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chemotherapy of primary tumors and metastases can be significantly improved by targeting of nanoparticles containing a contrast agent or anticancer drug specifically to cancer cells. Consequently, the overall goal of the planned investigations consists of the development, characterization, and preclinical in vivo testing of multi-particle cancer-targeted system for diagnostics by MRI and chemotherapy of primary tumors and metastases. In the present theranostic study, manganese oxide nanoparticles (Mn3O4) will be used as MRI contrast agents; poor water-soluble anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) ? as an anticancer drug; neutral liposomes ? as carriers for PTX; a modified luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) peptide ? as targeting moiety. The developed multi-particle theranostic system will be tested in vitro and in vivo using murine models of human ovarian and lung cancers. However, the proposed approach may be extended for other types of carriers/particles, contrast agents, and anticancer drugs as well as other types of cancer. The specific aims of the proposal are: (1) To synthesize and characterize cancer- targeted nanoparticles for imaging and treatment of cancers; (2) To evaluate the efficacy of the synthesized nanoparticles as MRI contrast agents for the detection of primary tumors and metastases in vivo using murine models of lung and ovarian cancers; (3) To evaluate the effect of formulation and drug delivery route on whole body tissue disposition and pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and (4) To examine in vivo antitumor efficacy and adverse side effects of combined imaging and chemotherapy with PEGylated cancer-targeted liposomes containing PTX using orthotopic murine model of lung cancer after intravenous and inhalation delivery. It is expected that proposed approach and the use of the developed cancer-targeted nanoparticle-based MRI contrast agents and chemotherapeutic drug will substantially enhance the efficacy of the detection of primary tumors and metastases and therapy for cancers, while limiting adverse side effects of the treatments. The planned studies have the potential to significantly impact the field of imaging and drug delivery and to improve the efficiency of therapy of lung and other types of cancer."
"9258922","Project Summary/Abstract The adaptive immune system is a powerful means by which higher organisms protect themselves from a variety of pathogens. T-helper 17 (TH17) cells are an important component of the adaptive immune system involved in the production of inflammatory cytokines responsible for this protection. Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines causes tissue destruction and chronic inflammation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The TH17-specific nuclear receptor ROR?t is a key transcriptional regulator of these cytokines. Although the upstream regulation of ROR?t had remained elusive, recent studies have revealed a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and a protein as regulators of ROR?t. The objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular interactions between these key regulatory players, as well as the mechanism of cytokine transcription activation. The hypothesis is that formation of the ternary complex induces a conformational rearrangement in ROR?t which facilitates transcription. To test this hypothesis, it is proposed to identify the interactions and characterize biochemically and biophysically the conformational re-arrangements in the ternary complex between the protein co-regulator, ncRNA, and ROR?t. Specific Aim 1 is devoted to understanding the molecular features of the RNA and both proteins involved in forming interactions. These interactions will be identified through RNA and protein probing and footprinting and other techniques in solution. Furthermore, mutations in the ncRNA found to negatively affect ROR?t regulation will be probed through footprinting to gain insights into transcriptional regulation. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate the intermolecular interactions required for ROR?t binding to promoter DNA and the structural features of the ternary or quaternary complex formation through structural determination by X-ray crystallography, cryo- electron microscopy, and other methods. Finally, Aim 3 focuses on understanding the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation elicited by the complex by testing mutations at the molecular interfaces in a reporter system using TH17 tissue culture cells. The proposed study will reveal the molecular interactions involved in ROR?t regulation and cytokine gene production. This proposal is relevant to public health since it addresses the molecular basis of cytokine production in inflammatory autoimmune disorders and other diseases. Understanding the molecular interactions involved between ROR?t and co-activators will aid the development of novel therapeutic drugs. Thus, the proposed research aligns closely with the NIH mission to expand fundamental scientific knowledge in order to prevent and cure diseases."
"9328428","Project Summary/Abstract  Antibacterial resistance is widespread for all major classes of antibiotics with many bacteria being resistant to multiple, and in some cases all, available antibiotics. To combat this resistance, novel antibiotics are needed. Natural products (NPs) from actinomycetes have traditionally been rich sources for antibiotics, but discovery of novel NPs from these strains via traditional means (i.e. screening crude culture supernatants for antibiotic activity) is rarely effective due to high rates of rediscovery. Whole genome sequencing of actinomycetes has revealed the presence of many unknown biosynthetic gene clusters suggesting the existence of many novel NPs. The Metcalf and Kelleher laboratories recently developed a method for untargeted NP discovery based upon genomic and mass spectrometric analyses (referred to as Natural Product Identification via Mass Spectrometry Based Analyses, NIMBLE). I propose to improve NIMBLE by incorporating computational structure predictions and molecular networking. I will use the improved NIMBLE to discover two novel antibiotic NPs and to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway for the more biologically active of the two.  In Aim 1, twenty novel NPs identified via NIMBLE will be analyzed using computational structure prediction and molecular networking. This analysis will allow for identification of NPs with novel chemical scaffolds (not derivatives of known NPs!). Ten of the NPs with unique structures will be partially purified from their producing organisms and screened for activity against a panel of clinically relevant bacteria. Due to the high percentage of antibiotic NPs (~50% for actinomycete NPs), we expect that at least two antibiotic NPs will be identified. For the two most active NPs, the NIMBLE-predicted associations of the NPs with their biosynthetic gene clusters will be validated using in vivo genetic analysis. The compounds will then be isolated, and their structures will be elucidated. Finally, the purified NPs will be further analyzed for their antibacterial activity. In Aim 2, the biosynthetic pathway for the most potent NP identified in Aim 1 will be deciphered. An advantage of the NIMBLE method is that it allows simultaneous identification of novel NPs and their gene clusters. Having knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway will allow for future engineering of the strain for enhanced production of the NP and production of derivatives that could have improved activity or pharmacokinetic properties. The boundaries of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the functions of the genes within the cluster will be determined via bioinformatics analyses, genetic validation, and if needed, in vitro analysis of the enzymes encoded in the cluster. The order of the pathway will be determined via cross-feeding studies. Overall, this proposal will allow for identification of 2 novel antibiotic natural products and elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway for one of them. More importantly, it will provide a general platform for discovering many more bioactive natural products."
"9269085","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Abstract:  Our overall goal is to develop new clinical approaches to restore upper-limb function after incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Corticospinal tract (CST) axons are involved in  controlling upper-limb function. Paired-pulse induced spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) enhances synaptic strength between residual CST axons and spinal motoneurons (SMNs) resulting in temporary improvements in upper-limb function in humans with incomplete cervical SCI. Our specific goals are to: 1) develop methodologies to maximize STDP-induced aftereffects in an adult rat model of incomplete SCI and 2) translate this knowledge to humans to maximize STDP-mediated motor function recovery after incomplete cervical SCI. STDP aftereffects depend on the parameters of stimulation and the activation of postsynaptic glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors causing increased synaptic transmission. In Aim 1, we will use an adult rat model of incomplete cervical SCI to examine the effects of increasing paired-pulse frequencies and duration, and extended use of clinically-relevant NMDA and AMPA receptor agonists on the strength of electrophysiological and forelimb functional STDP aftereffects. Motor training will be combined with paired-pulse STDP stimulation to further enhance plasticity and behavioral recovery. Comprehensive assessment of cellular and molecular plasticity in the brain and spinal cord will be used to study neuronal mechanisms underlying the effects of our approaches. In Aim 2, we will translate the knowledge from Aim 1 to humans with incomplete cervical SCI. The most effective stimulation parameters and pharmacological agent will be used in humans during functionally relevant reach to grasp motor tasks. Motor training of reach and grasp movements will be combined with STDP-paradigms to further enhance behaviorally relevant plasticity and recovery of function. Our experiments will provide new knowledge on STDP-mediated aftereffect mechanisms in an adult rat model of incomplete cervical SCI (Aim 1) which will be used to maximize STDP aftereffects in humans with incomplete cervical SCI (Aim 2). The results may support the development of more effective clinically-relevant STDP protocols to improve daily use of upper-limb function in humans with SCI. The relevance of this proposal is highlighted by the restricted efficacy of current strategies to improve hand function after SCI."
"9328227","Project Description (Summary/Abstract) The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) series on the ?The Cell Biology of Metals? provides a truly outstanding forum for scientific exchanges, presentations and discussions in the emerging field of metals in biology, focusing on the acquisition, distribution, sensing and utilization of metals in proteins, cells and systems from bacteria to humans. This GRC series was initiated in 2005 and in the next cycle was immediately oversubscribed, illustrating that the meeting filled an important niche exploring the molecular mechanisms of metal utilization in proteins, organelles, and whole organisms. This conference has now become a cornerstone of the field and is unique in attacking broad research questions such as how metal cofactors are assembled to how metal ions play roles in metabolic and infectious diseases. The Cell Biology of Metals GRC is held every two years and has consistently attracted more than 140 attendees. The Gordon Research Conference series is internationally renowned for the high-quality, cutting edge nature of its meetings, showcasing unpublished work; the program of the proposed 2017 conference strives to maintain this high standard. The 2017 Cell Biology of Metals GRC will be held on July 23 ? 28 at Mount Snow in West Dover, VT. This application describes the preliminary program, which is organized around the theme of ?Mechanisms from Microbes to Humans?. Session topics include metals in enzyme function, metalloenzyme strucutres, metal homeostasis, metal sensing and dynamics, metalloprotein biogenesis and signaling, metals in host-pathogen interactions and metals in physiology and disease.

"9309903","SUMMARY  Cell-restricted transcriptional modulators play critical roles in the process of selective gene regulation during hematopoiesis. We have been investigating the molecular and biological function of Erythroid Krppel-like Factor (EKLF; KLF1). EKLF is a cell-restricted transcription factor that is a global regulator of genes essential for the erythroid program.  Analysis of EKLF's ability to positively regulate transcription and chromatin has led to identification of its association with the HIRA chaperone, and of its direct activation of histone H3.3 expression. The experiments of Aim 1 will link a coherent feed-forward model of the EKLF/HIRA/H3.3 axis with changes in paused/active status at selected EKLF target genes.  Analysis of expression patterns resulting from the neonatal anemia (Nan) mutation in murine EKLF (E339D) shows extensive genetic disruption and exacerbated anemia that follows extensive ectopic gene expression following Nan-EKLF expression. The experiments of Aim 2 will have identified alterations in protein/protein interactions, mapped the changes in binding at normal and novel target sites, and analyzed the resultant epigenetic rearrangements that follow from Nan-EKLF expression.  Analysis of DNA from a congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) patient supports the idea that a subset (type IV) follows from mutation in one allele of human KLF1 at E325K. The experiments of Aim 3 will have characterized derived iPSCs and de novo mutated erythroid cells for their hematopoietic/erythroid cellular and expression capabilities as well as to enable molecular/ biochemical studies of the KLF1/E325K protein itself.  These studies will be aided by the use of phenotypic and biochemical analyses, genetic approaches, and use of primary or minimally manipulated cells. Elucidating EKLF's role in regulatory phenomena will continue to illuminate novel aspects of erythroid biology and the essential mechanisms by which a cell-restricted transcription factor can exert varied yet highly controlled influences on genetic expression and epigenetics."

"9352535","Use of heart transplantation is limited by severe shortage in donor organ supply, resulting in death of many heart transplantation candidates before a suitable donor heart becomes available.1, 2 In addition to the scarcity of total donor hearts, national transplant data collected by the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations indicates that nationwide approximately 70% of cardiac allografts were rejected for transplantation during 2009?2011. The majority of these hearts were discarded due to stringent acceptance criteria, one of which is the limited acceptable time between procurement and transplantation. This time correlates with progression of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and constrains the acceptable geographic distance between the sites of donor heart explantation and transplantation. Overall, there is an urgent need to develop effective approaches to increase transplantable grafts by improving the numbers of organs which will fulfill acceptance criteria. Amelioration of I/R injury despite prolonged transport times and in organs felt to be potentially marginal will improve preservation of graft function, thus expanding the donor pool and increasing access.  Human adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (hASC) represent a uniquely practical subtype of MSC, due to their abundance, the simplicity of isolation from adipose tissue and their rapid in vitro expansion capacity. We3 and others4 have shown that hASC produce paracrine factors that provide therapeutically beneficial effects in multiple pathological conditions. In the context of myocardial infarction, we have shown that hASC preserve myocardial function, inhibit apoptosis, and stimulate angiogenesis primarily through ASC-secreted factors.5 Moreover, we previously reported that pre-treatment of explanted hearts with hASC improved myocardial functional recovery following acute I/R injury in an ex-vivo heart perfusion system.6 Our preliminary data indicates that pre-ischemic infusion of ASC-derived paracrine factors also improves myocardial function during recovery from cold ischemia, with significant preservation of a normal molecular pattern ?fingerprint? of the myocardial transcriptome, as defined by deep RNA sequencing. These RNASeq experiments specifically indicate that cold ischemia leads to prominent disruption of a set of genes (Arnt/Bmal, Esrra, Per2, Per3, Cry2) governing the circadian clock within the myocardium, which in turn prompts a coordinated increase in transcription directing mitochondrial biogenesis; and that these disruptions are specifically counteracted by hASC factors.  Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that infusion of hASC-derived factors into the cardiac circulation will ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion-induced functional deterioration of model donor hearts ex vivo as well as of human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro, by mechanisms mediated by soluble growth factors as well as exosomes, which limit damage to cardiomyocytes by preserving a normal pattern of circadian gene expression and mitigating the induction of deleterious mitochondrial biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will employ three specific aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the protective effect of extracorporeal infusion of human adipose stem cell conditioned medium (ASC-CM), fractions, on normal mouse donor heart preservation during cold static storage.  Aim 2. Identify the specific cellular targets protected by ASC-CM as well as its exosomal and extra- exosomal fractions, using human iPS-derived human cardiomyocytes (iCM), iPS-derived endothelial cells (iEC) cultured individually as well as together using a three-dimensional human ?myocardium-on- a-chip? (MOC) model organ.  Aim 3. Determine the relative roles of selected molecular components of the exosomal and extra- exosomal fractions of ASC-CM in protecting the human iEC and iCM in the MOC organ construct."
"9225217","Chronic pain and disability after physical trauma, including surgery, is a major public health problem. Surprisingly, recovery from pain after cesarean delivery is more rapid than after similar injuries outside the postpartum period. In animals, recovery from hypersensitivity after surgery is more rapid if surgery occurs in the early postpartum period, and this is blocked by spinal injection of an oxytocin receptor antagonist. This grant was funded to probe in animals and humans the mechanisms and clinical translation of this effect. We are on track to complete the originally proposed studies and have published or submitted 15 manuscripts in the past 3 years. We have also generated novel ideas and methods to increase the impact of this research, including growth curve modeling to more powerfully describe the time course of recovery, novel methods to repeatedly assess motivated, high-intensity movement and pain-related fear of movement in animals, and novel viral vectors to knockdown receptors of interest and to control spinally projecting oxytocinergic neurons and high threshold mechanosensitive nociceptor peripheral neurons. We will apply these novel methods to 2aims in the proposed extension period to determine in animals and in humans: 1. Efficacy and mechanisms of oxytocin against injury-induced pain on movement: We will use novel outcome measures of high-intensity motivated behavior and kinesiophobia in animals to examine the role of oxytocin systems in recovery after surgery, the receptors involved, and methods to augment this recovery-hastening effect. In humans we will test the role of spinal and systemic oxytocin on pain with movement and kinesiophobia with painful physical therapy following surgery. 2. Actions and mechanisms of spinal oxytocin on mechanosensitive input: We will examine the detailed effects of oxytocin on tuning of mechanosensitive inputs, the receptors involved, and the subtype selectivity of these actions in normal animals and those recovering from injury. In healthy humans and those recovering from surgery, we will test the action of spinal and peripheral oxytocin on modality selective input from afferent fiber classes."

Little is known about why lymphatic vessels become dysfunctional, but clinical studies reveal an elevated lymphatic diastolic pressure, enlarged diameter, impaired or absent contractions, and what appear to be incompetent valves. Collectively these findings point to underlying problems with the lymphatic pacemaker, pump and valves. In this proposal we will test the mechanisms leading to contraction and valve dysfunction at pressures experienced by the lymph pump during the development of lymphedema.  Recently we developed methods to measure the membrane potential of lymphatic smooth muscle (LSM) in isolated, pressurized mouse lymphatics and patch clamp methods to study selected ion currents in LSM cells. We will apply those methods to transgenic mouse models to study the ionic basis of the electrical pacemaker that drives spontaneous and pressure-regulated contractions. Our preliminary results challenge the existing dogma about the pacemaking mechanism in LSM and suggest it is controlled by interactions between voltage- gated Ca2+ channels and KCNQ K+ channels. Our new data show the same channels operate in human LSM.  We have developed methods to test valve and pump function in isolated single lymphangions from the mouse when the vessel is subjected to increasing output pressure, simulating the load on a vessel in a dependent extremity. Our results provide new insights into how the lymph pump fails when pressure is elevated. The pump either gradually weakens until it cannot eject, or the output valve locks open catastrophically. Importantly, we find that both types of pump failure can be corrected by the administration of norepinephrine (NE) to activate the pacemaker while preserving contractile strength and tone for normal valve gating. Although pump failure occurs in some normal vessels subjected to elevated pressure, susceptibility to failure is increased of mice deficient in the transcription factor FOXC2, which controls the development and maintenance of lymphatic valves. Foxc2+/- mice recapitulate the human disease lymphedema distichiasis.  Our central hypothesis is that lymphatic pacemaking, pump strength, and valve function are closely interrelated such that failure of any one disables the lymph pump and leads to lymphedema. We propose that pump dysfunction can be rescued by pharmacological intervention in normal, Foxc2+/- and inducible Foxc2-/- mice. This hypothesis will be tested by 3 aims: 1) Determine the ionic basis of the lymphatic action potential and pacemaking. 2) Determine the ionic mechanisms by which pressure modulates the lymphatic pacemaker. 3) Determine the mechanisms by which NE modulates the lymphatic pacemaker and can rescue a lymphatic vessel that is made dysfunctional by an elevated pressure load or valve defect. This approach to treating a failed lymph pump represents a potential new strategy for treating a key underlying cause of lymphedema."
"9246505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psoriasis and the risk of diabetes Psoriasis affects over 7 million people in the US (125 million people worldwide) and is the most common helper T-cell (Th)-1 and Th-17 mediated inflammatory disease in humans. Epidemiological studies indicate that psoriasis is associated with an increased risk for major cardiovascular (CV) events and premature death due to CV disease independent of traditional risk factors. Emerging data suggest that patients with psoriasis may also be at increased risk for developing diabetes as well. The chronic inflammatory pathways involved in the maintenance of psoriasis have been shown to promote insulin resistance in animal and human models of diabetes. Furthermore, psoriasis and diabetes share susceptibility genes (such as CDKAL1). These shared genetic and inflammatory pathways suggest biologic plausibility for an increased risk of diabetes in patients with psoriasis. However, it is not known how clinical aspects of psoriasis (such as body surface area of involvement, anatomic sites of involvement, etc) impact diabetes risk nor is it known if successful treatment of psoriasis will lower the risk of diabetes. We will address these key knowledge gaps by conducting new aims to ongoing NIH funded projects. First, we will determine the risk of diabetes in a large population-based cohort of 9000 patients with psoriasis called the incident health outcomes and psoriasis events (iHOPE) study, established by R01 HL089744. Second we will determine how clinical aspects of psoriasis are associated with prevalent diabetes in a United States multi-centered clinic-based cohort of 1800 extensively phenotyped patients with psoriasis, 200 of whom have prevalent diabetes. This cohort was derived from the Dermatology Clinical Effectiveness Research Network (DCERN) established by RC1 AR058204. Third, we will determine if treatment of psoriasis with a systemic TNF-inhibitor (adalimumab) improves novel biomarkers which predict future development of diabetes compared to skin targeted treatment (ultraviolet B phototherapy) or placebo. This new aim will be investigated in the ongoing Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis (VIP) trial funded by R01 HL111293, which is designed to evaluate vascular inflammation and lipid metabolism outcomes. These projects leverage existing studies conducted by the applicant to develop highly significant and innovative aims which will: 1) provide added value to ongoing studies while aiding the applicant to develop new skills in epidemiological and translational research focusing on diabetes; 2) address an important problem by determining which patients with psoriasis are at highest risk for developing diabetes thus warranting preventive interventions already proven to reduce the risk of diabetes; 3) determine if a class of medicines (i.e., TNF inhibitors) which are commonly used across multiple inflammatory disease indications hold promise for diabetes prevention through the study of innovative biomarkers in a rigorous randomized controlled trial which may yield new clinical practice paradigms; and, 4) provide a diverse clinical research platform in which to mentor young physician scientists in patient oriented research and promote their successful transition to independence."
"9450834","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 exposure is associated with methamphetamine (Meth) abuse. These two factors synergize in aggravating neuroAIDS symptoms and disease progression. One of the important consequences of Meth on innate immune cells is to change the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce inflammatory markers, such as CCR5 and RANTES. These changes are believed to be dopamine-dependent, but we have observed that both ROS and CCR5 can be induced in dopamine-free systems. Interestingly, ROS in the CNS can signal the increase of NFkB levels and phosphorylation, and directly induce activation of promoters of inflammatory molecules. On the other hand, HIV Tat, which also induces ROS, has been shown to potentiate glial activation and neuronal damage induced by Meth and other drugs of abuse. HIV Tat, but not Meth, increases several TATA-box binding components in macrophages in vitro, suggesting that it can have a modulatory effect on promoters of inflammatory molecules that bear a TATA-box promoter domain in the promoter. We hypothesize that transcriptional signaling triggered by Meth-induced ROS interact with a TATA-box-dependent modulatory mechanism in the presence of HIV Tat. We propose to explore the role of ROS-induced pathways in the upregulation of CCR5 and RANTES on astrocytes and microglia by Meth and Tat, aiming to identify the players in a dopamine-independent mechanism. We will also investigate whether the induction of TATA-box binding elements is at the basis of the ability of HIV Tat to modulate ROS and inflammatory markers in the CNS, affect immune cell infiltration and interfere with drug-related stereotypic behaviors. Using an original approach we expect to unveil a basic mechanism of interaction between HIV and Meth in the aggravation of CNS pathology, which will open a new line of investigation with a translational reach."
"9255540","Adjunctive antithrombotic treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 antagonist)  plus anticoagulant (heparin or bivalirudin) is a guideline mandated for percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI) patients. Despite aggressive antithrombotic therapy, however, myocardial  perfusion after PCI remains inadequate in many patients. Reocclusion from recurrent thrombosis  continues to occur, and dose-limiting bleeding occurs in a significant minority of patients.  Attempts to further improve clinical outcomes have led to the development of more potent platelet  P2Y12 inhibitors including prasugrel and ticagrelor, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban  and apixaban (not approved for PCI), but also increase bleeding complications. Moreover, none of  the current antithrombotics provide effective protection against reperfusion injury, defined as  myocardial damage caused by the restoration of coronary blood flow after occlusion. Reperfusion  injury accounts for up to 50% of the final size of a myocardial infarct, a major determinant for  subsequent mortality and morbidity. In patients undergoing PCI, the composite endpoint of adverse  cardiovascular events at 30 days after reperfusion remains as high as 7-12%. Meanwhile, 11-12%  patients suffer major bleeding. The vast majority of these adverse events occur within the first 6  hours post-intervention. Clearly, beyond optimizing reperfusion therapy, the next milestone is to  break the link between antithrombotic potency and bleeding risk and protect the myocardium against  microvascular obstruction and necrosis that causes adverse left ventricle remodeling and heart  failure in 25% of treated patients.  APT402 is a novel therapeutic fusion protein comprised of both antiplatelet and anticoagulant  activities. We hypothesize that fusion will target the antithrombotic effect to the site of  coronary thrombosis and additively/synergistically attenuate thrombosis and reperfusion injury with  minimal bleeding risk. In the carotid electrical vascular injury model in rabbits, we observed  APT402 preferably bound to injured site  and thrombus. Treatment with clopidogrel, low molecular  weight heparin (LMWH, enoxaparin), or bivalirudin (Angiomax, direct and reversible thrombin  inhibitor, considered the safest FDA approved anticoagulant) alone failed to fully prevent  occlusion with significantly increased bleeding. In contrast, APT402 maintained 100% patency  without increasing bleeding time, PT, aPTT, or insertion site hemorrhage. In this fast-track SBIR  application, we will determine whether hyperacute treatment with APT402 is more effective to  attenuate thrombosis and protect hearts in a highly clinically relevant porcine model of PCI  without increasing bleeding compared to the standard-of-care treatment with a P2Y12  antagonist  plus anticoagulant.  Specific Aim 1. Produce APT402 to support the proposed animal studies (Phase I) and establish a GLP  CHO cell line for future cGMP manufacturing (Phase II). Specific Aim 2 (Phase I). To determine minimal effective dose and maximal tolerable dose in the  electrical injury model of arterial thrombosis in rabbits. Specific Aim 3 (Phase II). To determine in a porcine model of coronary thrombosis and PCI whether  APT402 is more effective and safe to prevent recurrent arterial thrombosis and decrease reperfusion  injury within 7 days than P2Y12 antagonist plus anticoagulant infusion."

"9209983","Project I Improved algorithms for structure refinement at multiple resolution ranges Our ability to visualize macromolecules at atomic resolution has had a lasting and profound impact on the study of biology. Obtaining the most accurate model is paramount for maximizing biological insight and for enabling activities such as the development of new therapeutics for human health. For the most challenging, and often very biologically important systems the availability of only low resolution diffraction data (3-4.5 ) has limited the accuracy of models. Therefore we will develop computational methods that significantly improve models, by creating better methods for their refinement even when data are limiting. This will have a broad impact on structural biologists, drug developers and molecular modelers. The field of X-ray crystallography has matured significantly over the last 10 years. However, there still remain many challenges in solving and refining structures at low resolution. These same challenges are now being encountered by researchers in the field of single particle cryo-EM. Many of the tools we have developed for crystallography can be applied to this problem. Therefore we propose to further develop our methods to address structure refinement when only sparse experimental data is available. Real space algorithms will be implemented to improve the refinement of models against maps, in particular for the cryo-EM case. The resulting procedure will be able to robustly refine the fit of models to maps while preserving excellent stereochemistry. Obtaining accurate stereochemistry has profound implications for the understanding of enzymatic reactions, macromolecular interactions, and the development of novel therapeutics. We will develop methods to generate the highest quality molecular models, which provide the greatest chemical and biological insight, at any resolution range. To do this we will continue our collaborations that have made use of methods from the field of structure modeling, and extend them to make use of other physically reasonable molecular potentials developed in the fields of molecular mechanics and dynamics. Finally, we will continue to develop and maintain the Phenix infrastructure to support both novice and expert researchers. Diffraction image analysis will be incorporated into the Phenix system to enable automated analysis of user data to detect possible problems. We will also implement a structure deposition system that incorporates model and data validation, and brings together information from multiple stages of structure solution."
"9327570","The recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have emphasized the importance of the T cell immune response. In particular, immune checkpoint blockade therapy with anti-PD-L1/PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 has proven successful in treating a subset of patients and cancers by non-specifically activating T cell responses. To understand how cancer immunotherapy fails in the remaining patient population, we must observe how the T cell immune response develops with treatment. Now with novel technologies that allow for high-throughput single-T cell phenotyping and receptor sequencing and a yeast-display method for ligand identification, we can understand how the natural T cell response behaves in cancer and how it is manipulated by immune checkpoint blockade. The previously undiscovered linkage between T cell phenotype and receptor specificity in cancer will distinguish what makes a productive T cell immune response. Questions to be addressed include 1) what T cell immune responses form against cancer, 2) how are T cell phenotypes altered by immune checkpoint blockade therapy, 3) how do T cell receptor specificities change with therapy, and 4) how can manipulation of antigen-specific responses synergize with cancer immunotherapy. The aggressive B16F10 melanoma tumor model implanted into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice will serve as the system to understand the linkage between phenotypic T cell responses and receptor specificities in the context of immune checkpoint blockade. To address these questions, the experimental plan is to 1) characterize T cell immune responses in B16F10 melanoma by T cell phenotype and receptor repertoire, 2) identify T cell receptor peptide specificities by using yeast-display of C57BL/6 peptide-major histocompatibility complex alleles and predictive statistical models, and 3) provide antigen-specific stimulation of T cell responses in synergistic combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This will be the first study to link individual T cell phenotypic responses and receptor specificities to inform fundamental changes in immune responses by immune checkpoint blockade. The discoveries will guide future design of cancer immunotherapeutic strategies and provide new cancer targets when applied to clinical settings."
"9310617","Expansion of functional pancreatic beta cell mass is a major therapeutic goal for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Glucose is a key physiological driver of adaptive beta cell mass expansion, promoting beta cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. We have been studying mechanisms of glucose-regulated gene expression for nearly two decades. In 2012 we found that carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP; Mlxipl) is required for glucose-stimulated beta cell proliferation in both rodent and human beta cells. That same year, our co-investigator (Dr. Mark Herman) discovered that ChREBP exists as 2 major isoforms. ChREBP? is the full-length form that is mostly cytoplasmic and repressed in low glucose. ChREBP? is a product of alternative splicing, with the nuclear export signals and the low glucose inhibitory domain removed. Consequently, ChREBP? is mostly nuclear, and is constitutively and potently active. ChREBP? transcription is induced by a powerful carbohydrate response element after activation of the glucose-responsive ChREBP?, creating a vigorous feed-forward loop (Fig. 1). Remarkably, in every system studied in detail, the induction of ChREBP? is the molecular engine that drives the major physiological effects of ChREBP. In adipose tissue or liver, induction of ChREBP? increases de novo lipogenesis and either increases or decreases insulin sensitivity, respectively.. In beta cells, we recently showed that the exponential induction of ChREBP? - from a nearly undetectable level to amounts comparable to ChREBP? - is required for glucose-stimulated proliferation. Strikingly, however, overexpression of ChREBP? in beta cells, as may happen with prolonged hyperglycemia or by ectopic viral expression, results in beta cell apoptosis. In stark contrast, overexpression of ChREBP? amplifies glucose-stimulated beta cell proliferation without cell death. Our overarching hypothesis is that the ratio of ChREBP? to ChREBP? abundance is critically important for beta cell function, both for beta cell mass expansion and, when dysregulated, as a mediator of glucose toxicity. We will test our hypothesis by performing the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the effects of increasing or decreasing the abundance of ChREBP? specifically in beta cells on beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis; (2) Determine if exogenous expression of ChREBP? or ChREBP? in human islets improves or worsens islet transplantation outcomes; and (3) Determine how the ratio of ChREBP? to ChREBP? controls the fate of beta cells. This application uses novel tools that will provide an essential mechanistic understanding of transcriptional glucose sensing that will inform therapies to expand and protect beta cell mass."
"9350898","ABSTRACT  HIV infection has been reported in various cells in the CNS, especially microglia. The CNS is also likely to contribute to the reservoir of HIV infection that persists despite ART, although the contribution of the CNS to viral rebound when ART is discontinued has not been clearly established. While a precise understanding of all the body's reservoir(s) is lacking, contributing factors are expected to include gross anatomic features that impact drug penetration and immune surveillance, as well as the transcriptional environment of specific cell types that can lead to post-integration latency. In the case of the brain microglial population, they are not only highly susceptible to HIV infection, but they reside in a compartment that is immune privileged and poorly accessible to many drugs. There is also increasing evidence that between 30 and 50% of well-suppressed HIV patients have neurocognitive dysfunction (HAND), suggesting that even a low level of persistent HIV in the brain can cause neurological damage. Thus, it is crucial to develop strategies that can remove, disable or suppress HIV in the CNS, ideally using methods that do not require viral reactivation because of the risk of exacerbating neuronal damage. One such approach being considered is based on disabling or suppressing HIV replication using sequence-specific genetic tools. By targeting HIV at the genetic level, a powerful suite of emerging technologies could be leveraged for this goal, including RNAi to prevent HIV translation, and engineered nucleases to disrupt, suppress, or epigenetically silence integrated HIV genomes. However, two major problems exist for the development and evaluation of such tools for HIV-CNS reservoir applications. First, efficient methods to specifically deliver the reagents to the CNS need to be developed. Targeting HIV reservoir cells is challenging because of the relative rarity of such cells and because a truly latent cell will not express any phenotypic indicators of its viral passenger. The second major issue is that successful delivery requires properties beyond simple target molecule recognition, including in vivo stability, de-targeting away from vascular sinks, and the ability to enter the CNS. Unfortunately, such complex parameters can only be evaluated in an animal model. To contribute to the broad effort towards an HIV cure, and its many significant technical challenges, we have developed a semi-quantitative model of latent HIV infection in the CNS, based on human microglial cell engraftment in immune-deficient mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells. The animals contain up to 10% human CD11b+ microglia and perivascular macrophages and can be infected with HIV-1. After suppression of viral replication by ART, infected cells can be recovered from their brains. The current iteration of the model, and anticipated refinements to increase microglial cell populations in these animals, will be used to systematically evaluate the CNS delivery of gene-editing tools designed to disrupt the HIV genome without reactivation."
"9243255","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma affects 70 million people worldwide [1, 2] and is characterized by optic nerve (ON) atrophy and the progressive death of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) [3]. Glaucoma is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and current management aims at lowering IOP [4]. Yet although IOP-lowering treatments slow the development and progression of glaucoma, approximately 10% of people who receive proper treatment continue to experience loss of vision [2]. Therefore, investigation of the underlying mechanisms involved in RGC death is likely to improve our understanding of the disease pathophysiology and lead to novel therapeutic approaches.  Effective neuroprotection thus is urgently needed, but unfortunately there are no effective treatments available. Although apoptosis has been shown to be a major form of cell death, interventions based solely on inhibition of this important modality have failed to achieve the desired goal. We recently demonstrated that RIP kinase-mediated necrosis (also known as necroptosis) in addition to caspase-dependent apoptosis is involved in photoreceptor death in a retinal detachment model of retinal degeneration and that effective neuroprotection necessitates combination therapy.  We propose to study whether the RIP kinase pathway in combination with caspases can be a novel therapeutic target in animal models of glaucoma. We would like to expand our findings on the redundancy of cell death pathways from our work in photoreceptor degenerations to animal models of glaucoma. We propose to evaluate the neuroprotective and axonal regenerative effects of RIPK and Caspase Inhibition (alone and in combination) after optic nerve injury and examine the effects of RIPK inhibition and RIP3 deletion on autophagy and inflammasomes in RGC degeneration after optic nerve crush."

"9316346","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid impulse propagation is a vital feature of atrial and ventricular conduction system cells to maintain normal rhythmicity and coordinated contraction of the four-chambered heart. Dysregulation of these rapidly conducting cells, particularly distal His-Purkinje system (HPS) cells, have been implicated as the site of initiation  of many inherited and acquired forms of cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Our lab has shown that Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), an endocardially-derived paracrine hormone, is necessary and sufficient to convert embryonic cardiomyocytes towards a fast conduction phenotype. Furthermore, a number of studies probing the human genome have shown NRG1 is an important susceptibility gene for SCA. Despite numerous reports demonstrating that NRG1 signaling is pivotal for cardiac development and maintaining physiological heart function, the signaling mechanisms through which NRG1 functions remains unclear. In this proposal, we seek to identify transcriptional effectors downstream of NRG1 signaling that are required to confer a HPS cell fate decision. Our initial experiments using cardiac conduction system (CCS)-lacZ transgenic reporter mice and signal transduction pathway inhibitors revealed that NRG1 mediates CCS specification in the heart through the Ras-MAPK-RSK/MSK signaling cascade. In parallel, transcriptional profiling of developing and mature CCS cells compared to ventricular myocytes identified numerous enriched transcription factors of which a single MSK/RSK dependent candidate, ETV1, a member of the E-twenty-six TF family, was identified. ETV1 expression was highly restricted to rapidly conducting regions of the heart and was markedly induced in response to NRG1. The specific aims discussed in this proposal will explore the NRG1-ETV1 signaling axis and elucidate their role in regulating normal sinus rhythm. In particular, Aim 1 will address whether NRG1 though ETV1 gene regulatory networks dictate the unique expression of transcription factors, ion channels, and gap junction proteins selectively expressed in rapidly conducting atria and HPS cells. It will also determine whether there are direct ETV1 regulated genes that are important for rapid conduction. Aim 2 will test whether loss of ETV1 using global and cardiac-specific Etv1 knockout mice impact cardiac conduction parameter and specification of the HPS. These experiments will be the first to examine the link between a paracrine signaling pathway and direct downstream targets required to maintain the hierarchy of myocardial conduction velocities in the heart. We hypothesize that these studies will uncover new mechanistic insight on what governs lineage specification of specialized HPS cells versus working myocytes. In addition, the identification and characterization of these transcriptional targets could give rise to novel pathways to pursue for the development of anti-arrhythmic agents. This may bring us closer to mechanism-based therapies for arrhythmia management, improving the quality and duration of life for patients at risk of these cardiovascular disorders."
"9259923","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches to cancer have been successful at identifying novel susceptibility loci, but there remains a fundamental gap in understanding the biological and clinical relevance of these discoveries. This problem is especially acute as there is an urgent need to translate basic scientific advancements into clinically relevant deliverables that will impact cancer patient care. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to discover the heritable component of neuroblastoma, an important childhood cancer that continues to result in significant morbidity and mortality, and to use this knowledge to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The primary objective of this competitive renewal application, based on the published and unpublished results from the first 4 years of funding, is to discover how host genetic architecture explains neuroblastoma susceptibility and patient survival, while also extending our initial findings that genes uncovered by our GWAS play a central role in tumor progression and maintenance. The central hypothesis to be explored here is that heritable DNA variation influences the initiation of neuroblastoma, the clinical course of the disease, and patient outcomes. This hypothesis builds on our identification of multiple common and rare DNA variations associated with neuroblastoma, the observation that many of the genes identified through these efforts impart oncogenic dependencies in established tumors, and the fact that recurrent somatic mutations are exceeding rare, even in the most aggressive subsets of this disease. The motivation for the proposed research is the urgent need to improve high-risk neuroblastoma survival rates and decrease treatment-related morbidities. We will test our central hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) Discover common and rare DNA variants that are associated with neuroblastoma; 2) Identify the DNA polymorphisms that predict neuroblastoma patient survival; and 3) Determine how genes identified by the neuroblastoma GWAS act as oncogenic drivers of the malignant phenotype. The first Aim will continue our discovery efforts by increasing the resolution of the scan and doubling the number of cases and controls, with the goal of delivering the identifiable heritable component of neuroblastoma. Aim 2 is devoted to a GWAS within the neuroblastoma cases to define genetic determinants of patient survival, and this will build on our preliminary data identifying potential tumor cell intrinsic mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance via this approach. The final Aim will determine the mechanism by which genes identified by the most robust association signals act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in neuroblastoma cells, again building on our extensive preliminary data. We consider this project significant because it will define DNA variation, genes and pathways critical to neuroblastoma initiation and progression, and thus provide insights that will be actionable in the clinic and ultimately result in improved cure rates."
"9246329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many people suffering from vestibular disorders often complain of balance problems and loss of spatial orientation. Yet, our knowledge regarding sensory (perceptual) recovery after vestibular damage remains limited and all we currently know about vestibular compensation has been based primarily on VOR deficits. Furthermore, neurophysiology experiments characterizing vestibular compensation have made no attempt to measure interneuronal correlations or correlations between neural activity and behavior (e.g., choice probabilities CP); both of which affect population decoding for sensory perception. There are three goals in the present experiments. First, we will compare neuronal thresholds in the vestibular (VN) and cerebellar (CN) nuclei, as well as parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) simultaneously as trained animals perform rotation discrimination tasks to test contemporary theories of sensory encoding and decoding. Second, we will characterize deficits and compensation in vestibular rotation perception after unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL). Results will not only be informative for vestibular rehabilitation and recovery of function, but will also provie vital tests of computational theories of sensory perception. Third, we will investigate whether noise in semicircular canal afferents contributes to perception. While macaques perform a direction discrimination task, we will search for trial-to-trial correlations between canal afferen activity and perception. Such correlations, often found in cortical neurons, are thought to reflect top-down influences. The present experiments seek to provide evidence for or against an opposite, bottom-up, hypothesis, i.e., that sensory noise propagates through to the decision. The proposed experiments represent a paradigm-shift for studying neural processing in the vestibular system. The outcomes of the proposed studies will not only be very useful for understanding perceptual deficits and recovery of spatial orientation, but will also contribute valuable and important knowledge about sensory processing and neuronal variability more generally."
"9333858","PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria remains a major global infectious disease, largely affecting people living in resource poor environments, and is one of the most important causes of childhood mortality. Drug-resistance is constantly undermining the usefulness of antimalarial regimens. There is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Plasmodium falciparum parasites utilize multiple ligand-receptor interactions for the invasion of human red blood cells, many of which are redundant. Different parasite strains rely on alternative ligand-interactions known as invasion pathways, for invasion, presumably for immune evasion and to invade polymorphic red blood cells. We have recently developed methods for the in vitro genetic analysis of red blood cell genes using hematopoietic stem cells. We have functionally characterized two red blood cell proteins, BSG and CD55, and have shown that they are essential for invasion by all P. falciparum strains, suggesting that they are strain- transcendent, prioritizing their interactions as targets for therapeutic development over strain-specific interactions. In forward genetic knockdown screens that assess all of membrane proteins found in the RBC proteome, we have identified a short list of high priority red blood cell determinants that we hypothesize are involved in strain-transcendent essential interactions between the host red blood cell and malaria parasite. In this proposal we will validate these genes as red blood cell determinants of strain- transcendent or strain- specific invasion. For this we will also leverage our development of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in an erythroid cell-line that supports P. falciparum invasion, and facilitates the knockout of RBC proteins. The precise step of P. falciparum invasion that is mediated by each red blood cell determinant will be identified. We will use the RBC mutants that we generate to identify specific parasite ligands using both candidate and unbiased screening approaches. Together, these studies will serve to shift the paradigm from a focus on alternative redundant invasion pathways to the functional analysis of essential strain-transcendent host- parasite interactions. In the long-term we hope that our studies will provide a functional understanding of critical ligand-receptor interactions for P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes to inform vaccine development and the design of host-targeted therapeutics."
"9262159","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with increasing age is becoming one of the most important medical issues in the USA and Europe. Increasingly, key morbidities of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with loss of muscle and loss of exercise activity. The cellular and molecular basis of age-related progressive loss of muscle is disputed. One hypothesis is that the myogenic reserves of stem-like satellite cells become exhausted and unable to maintain muscle in the face of the need to replace muscle damaged by day- to-day activity. A second is that age-related malfunction reflects the progressive accumulation of damage to the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes within the stressful environment of the muscle fibre. These two main hypotheses are not exclusive of one another. We propose to test these ideas in human muscle by grafting fragments of muscle from cadavers of various ages into immunodeficient host mice where we have shown that the satellite stem cells become activated to form small newly regenerated muscles that closely resemble human muscle in man and are the most authentic model available of a regenerated human muscle in vivo. If the satellite cells become functionally exhausted, it will register as a drop in efficiency and/or effectiveness of regeneration with age of the donor cadaver. Because the regenerated muscle is formed anew, the nuclei and mitochondria within it will not have been previously exposed to the oxidative and free-radical damage within muscle fibres and their genomes will act as a pre- damage standard against which to compare the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes present within the cadaver muscle from which the graft was made. If such genomic damage is a significant part of the aging process, we should detect increasing discrepancies between the graft and cadaver genomes with increasing age of the cadaver. Thus, we will have tested the two main candidate hypotheses of age-related loss of function in human muscle. This project represents a synthesis of expertise between two experienced researchers in the same laboratory with backgrounds in different biological disciplines and with a long history of successful collaborative research."
"9434284","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Directional cell migration is required in a vast array of biological mechanisms, including organogenesis, proper immune system function, and tumor metastasis. To accomplish migration, individual cells respond to highly regulated signaling cues which mediate downstream cytoskeletal remodeling events in order to form polarized protrusions and shape changes, all while establishing and maintaining interactions with the extracellular environment. However, the mechanisms that underlie collective cell migration are less well understood, and involve not only the morphogenetic changes involved in single cell migration, but also require the maintenance of cell-cell junctions during movement. Additionally, cell shape changes and establishment of polarity must be coordinated in a multicellular manner in order to preserve directional movement in the migrating cohort. In embryos of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM) cells are muscle founders specified in the embryo at its posterior-most end. These cells undergo the longest migration of any cell type in Drosophila and undergo synchronous bilateral migration, thus serving as a simple model for collective cell migration. The Stathopoulos laboratory has previously reported a role for FGF signaling in ensuring proper bilateral movement of the two groups of CVM cells, and recent gene expression profiling and RNAi experiments have uncovered genes that exhibited CVM migration defects. Furthermore, we have evidence that primordial germ cell (PGC) and CVM cell migration may be interdependent, and preliminary analysis suggests that Wnt/Fz signaling plays a role in supporting this process. I hypothesize that spatiotemporal expression and localization of signaling factors by the CVM cells in conjunction with graded signaling cues from surrounding tissues (including the germ cells) mediate their migration - specifically, that a subset of cells within the migrating collective responds to cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous Wnt cues in order to mediate forward migration and repulsive exclusion from the midline. I will use a combination of genetic and immunohistochemistry approaches in conjunction with in vivo live imaging and a novel conditional knockout system to investigate the contribution of Wnt/Fz signaling to CVM cells, the interdependence of CVM and PGC migration, and leader and follower cell dynamics within a migrating collective. This study will address the gap in the literature regarding how distinct tissues can cooperatively influence migration, as well as contribute to a general understanding of how subsets of cells within a group respond to signaling cues. The insights gained from this study will also prove useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying tumor metastasis, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential therapeutic targets."
"9249628","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite compelling experimental evidence linking inflammation to the pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), anti-inflammatory clinical trials have systematically failed to demonstrate beneficial effects in patients. This failure is often ascribed to the interrelated prospects that pan-suppression of inflammation is deleterious or that anti-inflammatories also inhibit protective stress responses. Thus, identifying novel targets to treat ARDS requires an understanding of the basic biology underlying key molecules that drive both pro-inflammatory responses in immune cells and protective stress adaptation programs in non-immune cells. Preliminary Data show that, in addition to inducing pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, Caspase-1 protease activation protects Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (PMVEC) and Pulmonary Arterial Endothelial Cell (PAEC) barrier function in response to infection. Additional data presented herein support a model in which Caspase-1 degrades glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins in PMVECs and PAECs as a protective strategy that limits accumulation of advanced N-glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RS) induced by infection. Intriguingly, the model opportunistic pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and vasculotropic pathogen (Rickettsia prowazekii) used in these studies both deploy homologous secreted phospholipase A2 toxins (ExoU) that inhibit Caspase-1 activation. The proposed experiments will test the Hypothesis that Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs elicits degradation of glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins as an adaptive stress response to protect barrier function. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs by: 1.1) Defining the mechanisms by which PMVECs and PAECs sense infection at the level of Inflammasome signaling using a Split Venus fluorescence complementation reporter. 1.2) Determining mechanisms by which the ExoU secreted toxin inhibits Caspase-1 activation using phospholipase A2 signaling inhibitors. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1-induced stress responses in PMVECs and PAECs by: 2.1) Elucidating glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins degraded by Caspase-1 and validating targets by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme function assays. 2.2) Determining whether Caspase-1 protects PMVEC and PAEC barrier function during infection. Molecular and pharmacologic approaches will be used to either down-regulate or up-regulate Caspase-1 followed by assessment of barrier function, AGEs, and RS. Inhibitors of glycolytic intermediates, AGEs, and/or RS will unveil their roles in barrier demise. Specific Aim 3 will correlate Caspase- 1 activation and mitochondrial function with ARDS patient outcomes by: 3.1) Measuring active Caspase-1 and mitochondrial respiration in immune cells and non-immune cells. 3.2) Correlating outcomes with patient mortality and ventilator-free days. Long-term impact on human health and translational potential lie in identifying targets for therapies to treat ARDS, which are currently lacking."

The goal of our proposed activities is to establish novel partnerships, strengthen existing alliances, and create systematic and impactful changes that will move breakthrough innovations more rapidly to products benefitting healthcare and the larger society. Unique to the University of Minnesota's is our advantage, which builds upon pre-existing REACH-like structures which rely upon business and industry expert individualized and team coaching, which aids faculty in designing commercially realistic developmental pathways and appropriately timed commercial partnerships and hand-offs to provide critical mid-stage skills transfer. Providing faculty with a system of educational tools, industry experts, attractive technology transfer agreements tailored to Try-it; Buy-it and Partner-It commercial agreements offers well-designed one-stop shop for commercialization with partnering. University of Minnesota will be first a regional and later a National center for technology commercialization and adoption. The track record of the University of Minnesota Technology Transfer Office and newly designed MN-IP (incentivized and inducement-like financial terms) are meant to attract industry sponsors much earlier than historically realized. University of Minnesota MN-IP has attracted more than 100 commercial partnerships in the last two years, at a point in technology development when previously few would entertain industrial sponsorship. Early transfer can bridge the so-called, `valley-of-death' of early stage technologies. These business changes offer a best path forward to commercial partnering and reduced the burden of licensing and demonstrates institutional commitment MIN-REACH builds upon a foundation of existing pre-commercial programs at the UMN for both medical devices and drugs. The UMN funds and staffs multi-disciplinary programs aiding faculty to commercialize medical device and drug inventions. Our secret to success will be in our systems and people educated and already working in commercialization of University projects.

"9253420","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common genetic disorder in humans, with more than 160 point mutations in this gene, and over 400 million people affected. Although most research relates to G6PD deficiency and increased hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) and accumulation of bilirubin in adults, epidemiological studies indicate that G6PD deficiency is also a major cause of pathologic neonatal bilirubin accumulation (jaundice) and a contributor to morbidity, including neurological injury (kernicterus). The hypothesis to be tested here is that correcting the activity and stability of G6PD mutants as well as increasing the activity of the wild-type enzyme will decrease bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in infants. In this proposal, the plan to begin developing a treatment for kernicterus using a totally novel approach, by developing activators of wild-type (Wt) and mutant G6PDs is described. The project includes four aims: AIM 1: Identify small molecule chaperones that increase the catalytic activity of Wt and common G6PD mutants using an in vitro screen of a library of small molecules. AIM 2: Determine the X-ray crystal structure of the Wt and mutant G6PD enzymes in complex with the G6PD chaperone(s). Aim 3: Evaluate the ability of the chaperone(s) to protect cultured cells expressing Wt or the mutant G6PDs from bilirubin-induced cytotoxicity and elucidate the molecular basis of their effects. AIM 4: Evaluate the ability of the small molecule chaperone(s) to reduce bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in rodent models of newborn hyperbilirubinemia, in vivo. Two established rat models of kernicterus (Gunn rats and bilirubin-injected Wt rats) and three new mouse models [transgenic mice, mimicking three common G6PD mutations with kernicterus] will be used. Small molecules, identified in Aim 3 to protect neurons from bilirubin-induced toxicity, will be tested for their ability to prevent or reduce neurological injury (measured as loss of motor and auditory skills) due to hyperbilirubinemia in one or more of these rodent models, in vivo. The experience of Dr. Stevenson (co-PI) in basic research related to hyperbilirubinemia and in clinical care of such newborns, the expertise of Dr. Wakatsuki in crystallography, together with our expertise in drug discovery and development and in neuroscience research, and the expertise of other advisors in drug screening, medicinal chemistry, in gene editing and in assessing auditory and motor dysfunctions, place the team in a unique position to address the above goals."
"9263338","SUMMARY Wide deployment of malaria control tools in the past decade has significantly contributed to substantial reduction of the incidence and deaths related to the disease in Sub-Sahara Africa.. Yet, the region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden of malaria deaths. Moreover, incidence remains high but stable in some settings while rebounding in others after a long period of decrease associated with intensive deployment of malaria control tools. The Overall goal of this ICEMR is to understand the variable effectiveness of current malaria control interventions in different ecological settings of West Africa through research to understand interactions between the parasite (response to drug treatment, genotypes, gametocyte survival), human (immune response and host genetics) and the vector (ecology, behaviors, and response to insecticides) and regulating influences of the local environment and human behavior. This ICEMR encompasses 3 Projects with the goals summarized as follow: 1] Epidemiology Project (Project 1): The goal is to understand why different patterns of malaria epidemiology and endemicity are resilient to current control strategies at four sites in Mali, representing different eco-zones across West Africa, 2] Malaria immuno- genomics Project (Project 2): The goal of this project is to identify genetic variation in the malaria parasite and human host, and assess the impact of these differences on malaria transmission and effectiveness of malaria control measures in four sites of Mali , 3] Malaria vector and transmission field ecology project (Project 3): The project goal is to investigate important neglected aspects of malaria vector and transmission field ecology at four sites in Mali, representing three eco-zones across West Africa. These projects links the different aspects of malaria transmission and disease into a unified whole, adding the ability to distinguish the contributions of different malaria control interventions on parasite population and range of immune responses (Project 2, Immunopahtogenesis) and seasonal and geographical distribution of anopheline mosquitoes vectors (Project 3). Understanding the factors relating entomological and epidemiological patterns of transmission will provide more definitive guidelines for malaria control efforts in Mali and in West Africa. "
"9456235","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large inhalable particles exist in the workplace and can constitute a substantial amount of inhaled exposure (50% or more). Particles >30 mm primarily deposit in the oral and nasal cavities. Symptomatic health effects (acute or chronic rhinitis, chronic pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis, nasal cancer, and chronic laryngitis and gastro- intestinal diseases) occur in many industries, indicating the presence of these large inhalable particles. However, no instrument currently exists that is capable of measuring particle sizes between 30 and 100 mm. Large particles settle out quickly (terminal settling velocity of 100 mm particle = 0.3 m/s), requiring a real-time instrument to capture the timing and magnitude of the exposure. This project has three specific. The first aim is to design a portable inhalable particle spectrometer to measure inhalable aerosols as a function of particle size in real time. The second aim is to evaluate the sampling efficiency and other performance measures for this instrument in both calm air and low-wind speed environments. The third aim is to evaluate the size distribution of aerosols as a function of job task in two workplaces: a dairy parlor and in a machining shop. The outcome of this project will be an instrument capable of measuring inhalable aerosol size distributions. The ability to measure large inhalable particles will allow u to evaluate a hazard that up until now has remained un-quantified. Such measures will allow improved assessment of worker exposure, better selection of appropriate control methods, and thus, improvements to worker health. Successful development of the proposed instrument will enable researchers to make fast, accurate aerosol size distribution measurements with a small, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive device."
"9301856","Project Summary  We have developed the sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SETER/PR) index of gene expression to predict the degree of sensitivity to endocrine therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, to guide the selection of treatment after disease progression. The assay measures the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) gene (ESR1), the frequency of ESR1 transcripts with activating mutation in a hotspot region of the ligand-binding domain, and a signature representing the expression of genes most strongly correlated with expression of both estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) genes. Therefore, the SETER/PR index summarizes 18 selected transcripts relative to 10 reference transcripts that represent the range of gene expression. Using RNA from high-quality fresh samples of breast cancer, the SETER/PR index was highly reproducible under diverse analytical and pre-analytical conditions, and was prognostic for PFS and overall survival (OS) when tested in biopsies of metastatic breast cancer from patients who then receive endocrine therapy. We have recently translated the assay for use with sections from routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue biopsies.  We know that it will be important to define the pre-analytical conditions under which an RNA-based assay can be accurately applied to usual clinical samples of metastatic breast cancer. Although it is usual to immediately preserve small biopsies of metastatic cancer in clinical practice, there are major pre-analytical conditions to consider: the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (several sample preservation protocols are possible), dilutive and contaminating effects from host tissue RNA within a cytologic or tissue biopsy of metastasis, and the ability to perform the assay using malignant effusion samples (larger volumes are not immediately fixed). We have designed our studies to provide insights into whole transcriptome assays and, separately, our customized, targeted RNA sequencing assay for the SETER/PR index.  Our first objective is to identify the transcripts with measurement that is robust to the effects of routine fixation and processing on small biospecimens, compared to the high-quality RNA from matched samples in RNA preservative. We will use whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to measure every transcript under every clinical procedure for preserving a tumor tissue or cytologic biopsy, compared to high-quality RNA as the reference. We will similarly, compare these pre-analytical conditions using our customized RNAseq assay for the SETER/PR index (droplet-based reverse transcription of targets, followed by sequencing). This will define the best conditions for RNA-based testing of cytology and tissue samples, and will provide data for all transcripts in addition to the specifically targeted transcripts in the SETER/PR index.  Our second objective is to define a panel of host organ transcripts that will be used to estimate the extent of the host organ RNA within a clinical biopsy sample obtained from any metastatic site. This involves the identification of organ-specific transcripts from RNAseq data and existing microarray data sets, so that a measurement of the SETER/PR index from a metastatic biopsy is accompanied by a measurement to estimate the extent of host organ RNA that was included within the sample, and hence the purity of cancer. This will serve as a useful quality control measure, and potentially enable corrected reporting for the tumor population.  Our third objective is to analytically validate and test the feasibility and clinical validity of the SETER/PR index using the diagnostic assay with biopsy samples of metastatic breast cancer collected from a clinical trial. We will finalize the SETER/PR index assay, including analytes to estimate the extent of host organ contamination, an complete the analytical validation studies to establish this as a CLIA-compliant clinical test. Then, we will test the clinical performance of the SETER/PR index test using samples of metastatic breast cancer from the Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) trial, specifically in the treatment arms that compared endocrine- based treatments for progression-free and overall survival. The MBC trial is a basket trial of randomized treatment comparisons that is being developed by the Food and Drug Administration, academic oncology community, and the National Cancer Institute. It aims to coordinate predictive diagnostic development with a network of clinical trials of new treatments.  We will complete the development of an assay that accurately measures the expression, functional sequence integrity, and transcriptional product of ER within a biopsy of metastatic breast cancer ? to predict the sensitivity to endocrine therapy at any point in the treatment course of metastatic breast cancer."

"9244812","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The translation elongation cycle is the central process required for the correct decoding of mRNA into protein. Despite the extremely high level of fidelity that has been observed in this reaction, there are special circumstances that redefine the coding potential of a given mRNA. The incorporation of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), is one example. The transformation of a UGA stop codon into a Sec codon requires the utilization of a novel translation elongation factor (eEFSec), a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the 3' untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs, and a novel SECIS binding protein termed SBP2. These factors act in concert to alter the coding potential of specific UGA codons by specifying the insertion of the Sec-specific tRNA, Sec-tRNASec. This process is required for the production of 25 human selenoproteins, many of which form an essential line of defense against oxidative stress. The proteins are also responsible for a myriad of other functions including thyroid hormone metabolism and maintaining proper sperm motility. We have recently demonstrated that the factors known to be essential for Sec incorporation are, in fact, sufficient. These factors include a specialized elongation factor (eEFSec), a SECIS binding protein (SBP2), a specialized transfer RNA (Sec-tRNASec) and mammalian ribosomes. Although some information about which protein domains are important for Sec incorporation activity, the mechanism by which these factors allow Sec incorporation is not known. A complete understanding of this process is required for three key reasons: 1) many selenoproteins are essential; 2) mutations in the SBP2 gene cause human disease; 3) modulation of selenoprotein production has tremendous potential to maximize the beneficial antioxidant effects of selenoproteins. We propose to address three central questions in this project: What is the molecular basis for the exquisite specificity of Sec incorporation at defined UGA codons? How are cellular dynamics involved in the specificity and efficiency of Sec incorporation? How does the 3' UTR regulate the efficient and processive incorporation of 10 selenocysteine residues into the plasma selenium carrier protein selenoprotein P (SEPP1)? Successful completion of these Aims will shed significant light on the molecular mechanism of Sec incorporation, setting the stage for identifying the means by which the process can be regulated in a clinical setting."
"9276315","Abstract/Summary In this competitive renewal application of the Program Program grant >30 yrs in existence, diverse approaches are used to address the singular theme of gene regulation in developing red blood cells. The Project Leaders are united in their commitment to the developing red cell as an experimental system in which to make fundamental biological discoveries that will inform our understanding of cell differentiation and directly impact our capacity to treat disorders of the red cell, including congenital and acquired anemias. The Program encompasses the most relevant vertebrate systems (human, mouse, and zebrafish) and employs contemporary genetic approaches, including gene modification using CRISPR/cas9 and innovative genetic screens. Deep, longstanding, and intensive interactions and collaborations among the Project Leaders ensures synergy in the accomplishment of the proposed goals of the research. Project 1 (S.H. Orkin, Project Leader) builds on prior groundbreaking work on the role of BCL11A in HbF repression and centers on the interaction of BCL11A and other transcription factors with the nuclear matrix, the turnover of BCL11A protein and the search for small molecules that destabilize the protein in erythroid cells, and cis-regulatory sites of BCL11A-binding in the human ?-globin cluster. In Project 2, H. Lodish (Project Leader) and his colleagues focus on the pathways by which self-renewal of red cell progenitors is controlled. Project 3 (L. Zon, Project Leader) addresses the role of transcription elongation in red cell gene expression and its intersections with signaling pathways. In Project 4 (D.E. Bauer, Project Leader), erythroid cell super-enhancer elements will be analyzed functionally with innovative CRISPR/cas9 saturating mutagenesis, an approach recently pioneered in the Program. In Project 5 (B. Paw, Project Leader), new genes/proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism will be characterized for their physiological roles in mouse/human/zebrafish systems. Each of the projects in this Program grant addresses critical aspects of the expression program and function of erythroid cells. These studies are founded on the premise that discoveries emerging from the proposed projects will provide new opportunities for the design of novel approaches to the understanding and management of red blood cell disorders, including the hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease and ?-thalassemia), other congenital anemias, and acquired conditions."
"9232227","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in bone marrow differentiate into both myeloid, and lymphoid cell lineages that disperse into different tissues throughout the body. Several studies indicate that HPCs can be infected by HIV-1 in vitro. Our preliminary data shows that mac-tropic R5 variants (adapted to use low CD4 on macrophages) infect umbilical cord blood HPCs more efficiently than non-mac-tropic R5 viruses and that infection via cell contact is particularly efficient. We also show that HPCs infected in vitro survive to differentiate and multiply into mature myeloid cells. Mature cells were then able to transfer virus to susceptible target cells. Our data indicates that infection of a single HPC would have the potential to produce large numbers of HIV+ mature cells. Such mature cells would be able to seed HIV into different tissues throughout the body.  HIV sequences in bone marrow were reported to be closely related to those in brain. This result is consistent with HIV+ monocytes (derived from infected HPCs) seeding HIV into the brain, as reported to occur in late disease. Other limited studies have not confirmed this. However, bone marrow contains many cell types including mature macrophages and lymphoid cells, so that sampling of HIV may not detect virus from HPCs. Here, we will evaluate HIV sequences in purified HPCs and compare them with those in brain.  In this proposal, our main goals are to investigate (1) whether HPCs from bone marrow of HIV+ subjects carry HIV and whether they can differentiate into myeloid or T-cell lineage cells that then transfer virus to new cells. And (2) whether HIV sequences present in HPCs are related to those in brain tissue, to support the presence of a bone marrow to brain dispersal route for HIV. We present three aims. Aim 1: Determine whether HIV-negative adult bone marrow HPCs can be infected in vitro and whether they retain the capacity to differentiate into myeloid and T-cell lineage cells. We will test if our data showing HIV infection and differentiation of umbilical cord blood HPCs applies to adult bone marrow HPCs Aim 2: Determine whether HPCs derived from HIV+ bone marrow are infected and can differentiate into infected myeloid and T-cell lineage cells. We will test differentiation of HIV+ bone marrow HPCs into both T- cell and myeloid lineage cells and establish whether mature cells carry infectious and transferable virus. Aim 3: Establish whether HIV sequences in HPCs are closely related to those in brain tissue. We will examine whether HIV sequences present in HIV+ bone marrow HPCs are closely related to viral quasispecies present in the brain of the same HIV+ patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).  Our hypothesis is that HIV+ HPCs differentiate into mature myeloid and T-cells that disperse HIV through the body. If supported, our results will point to a major role for HPCs in HIV pathogenesis and formation viral reservoirs that has previously not been appreciated. This new information may lead to new strategies to identify HIV+ HPCs and derivatives that need to be eradicated if HIV is to be eliminated in vivo."
"9264581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social deficits are characteristic of most major mental health disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. In many cases, social interactions that were once rewarding become aversive and individuals become withdrawn. Despite the negative impact that social withdrawal has on the individual and family, the mechanisms are unknown and treatments are lacking. The proposed research will fill this important gap by identifying neural mechanisms that naturally promote social interactions, which can be used to develop treatment options. The research turns to novel insights from the postpartum brain and applies them to non- parental adults. Nave prepartum female mice find social interactions with mouse pups to have low valence; however, postpartum females find social interactions with pups to be intensely rewarding. It is possible that the reward mechanisms altered in mothers may represent fundamental mechanisms that promote sociability across social contexts. Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1) (also known as Rev erb alpha) is of great interest because striking and reliable decreases in Nr1d1 expression occur in postpartum (i.e., prosocial) compared to prepartum mice in multiple brain regions regulating reward, including nucleus accumbens (NAC). Nr1d1 is a transcription factor involved in circadian rhythm regulation, but recent work suggests a key role for Nr1d1 in reward-related processes as well as disorders with social deficits, such as depression. Depression is associated with dysregulation of reward pathways and Nr1d1 may be the link between reward, social behavior, and depression. Recent work indicates that Nr1d1 in NAC interacts with and possibly regulates numerous reward-related genes. Still, the role of Nr1d1 in NAC in social reward is not known. The long- term goal is to understand the basis of changes in sociability with the possibility of opening avenues for devel- oping treatments to improve social deficits in humans. The objective here is to determine how decreases in Nr1d1 in NAC regulate social reward. Our central hypothesis is that decreases in Nr1d1 in NAC will improve social reward in a non-reproductive context. The rationale is that the findings will contribute key, missing information on the role of Nr1d1 in NAC on modulating social reward. In order to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of the application, the following two specific aims are proposed. 1. Identify effects of decreasing Nr1d1 in NAC on social reward-related behaviors. 2. Identify effects of decreasing Nr1d1 in NAC on CNS processes using microarrays and bioinformatics approaches. Bioinformatics analysis will highlight pathways related to addiction/reward, mental health, neuronal activity, transcriptional regulation, and circadian rhythms. The approach is innovative as is the concept that Nr1d1 is a critical trigger for social reward. This work is significant because it will provide novel insights into new approaches on how to improve sociability. These studies will provide specific information about how Nr1d1 functions in adults to regulate social reward and could provide insights for understanding dysregulation in adults."
"9200460","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is continuing need for improved strategies to prevent the spread of HIV, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Over half of those living with HIV in the US are MSM and MSM continue to account for two-thirds of new HIV infections. Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC) is a brief, effective HIV risk reduction intervention for MSM. PCC has been designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a ?Best-Evidence Intervention,? and the CDC actively disseminates PCC using training materials developed by the applicant company (Allen/Loeb Associates) and the developer of PCC (Dr. James Dilley). Empirical data show that training is not sufficient for implementation of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in real-world settings. Post-training support is essential, yet no affordable support strategies are available. To meet this need, the developers of the PCC intervention and training developed and tested two strategies for scalable, low-cost, web-based post-training support with Phase I SBIR funding from NIMH (?Web-Based Support For Implementation of Evidence-Based HIV Prevention (PCC),? R43MH099917). Phase I usability tests showed that both strategies--person-to-person consultation (P2P) and video support--are highly acceptable to counselors and are associated with increases in counselor self-efficacy related to PCC delivery. This Phase II project builds on Phase I findings to rigorously test web-based post-training support for PCC. Seventy-five counselors who have recently completed PCC training will be randomized to one of three levels of increasingly intensive post-training support: (1) Information, (2) Video Support & Information, and (3) P2P & Video Support and Information. The impact of post-training support on PCC self-efficacy, knowledge, and implementation will be assessed at study entry, 6 weeks after study entry and 3 months later. We hypothesize that (1) the impact of Video Support & Information will be greater than the impact of Information alone and (2) the impact of P2P & Video Support & Information will be greater than both other conditions. Results of these hypothesis tests will inform the optimal configuration of post-training support for commercialization. The Phase II study will yield a fully functional, market-ready support platform. The primary target market for the platform is Capacity Building Assistance (CBA) providers that are funded by the CDC to provide technical assistance to the CBOs, health departments, and hospitals that deliver evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. Throughout the study period, existing relationships with the CDC and CBA providers will be further developed to insure that the post-training support platform meets customer needs. The web-based support strategies developed for PCC can be generalized to other evidence-based prevention interventions."
"9474010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a competitive renewal of the Autoimmunity Center of Excellence (ACE) at Duke. Its research focus will continue to be modulation of B cell responses in autoimmune disease. The ACE will be under the leadership of Dr. E. William St. Clair, Professor of Medicine and Immunology. For the past 5 years, Duke has been a productive member of the ACE network, contributing new insights into the developmental pathways of B cells and the mechanisms of B cell directed therapy. The proposed ACE builds on these discoveries and will support 2 new basic science projects, 5 ongoing and 2 new clinical trials, and an Administrative Core, and continue to emphasize a strong and fluid integration between the bench and the bedside. Tedder and colleagues have recently found that a phenotypically unqiue subset of B cells secreting IL-10 (called B10 cells) serve as critical negative regulators during adaptive CD4+ T cells responses, and dramatically suppress Th1 immune responses and autoimmune disease in mice. For Basic Research Project 1, they will examine the hypothesis that antigen-specific regulatory B10 cells modulate autoimmune responses in mice and man and that they can be manipulated for therapeutic gain. A picture is gradually emerging about the precursors of self-reactive B cells in autoimmune disease. Kelsoe and coworkers in Basic Research Project 2 will investigate developmentally regulated expression of activated cytidine deaminase (AID) in human fetal and neonatal pre-, pro, and immature/transitional B cells and its relationship to the generation of self-reactive B cells in human autoimmune disease, potentially eludidating another pathway of B cell self-reactivity outside the confines of normal tolerance mechanisms. We propose two new clinical trials to investigate lymphotoxin-beta receptor fusion protein as a treatment for primary Sjgren's syndrome, and rituximab therapy for bullous pemphigoid. A Pilot Research Project is also proposed to engineer tetramers of self-antigen enabling the identification and characterization of self-reactive B cells, which will have implications for the goals of the clinical and other basic research projects. Overall, the Duke ACE will bridge these basic and clinical studies to advance our understanding of autoimmune disease.    The B cell is a type of immune cell essential to autoimmunity. The goal of the proposed Autoimmunity Center of Excellence at Duke is to improve our understanding of the roles played by B cells in human autoimmune disease. The projects are designed to be highly integrative between the bench and the bedside, with collaborations between basic and clinical scientists. These studies may lead to better treatments."
"9306949","The cellular requirement for mRNA diversity is apparent, as the evolutionarily conserved process of mRNA splicing generates mRNA and protein diversity through alternative mRNA splicing. Indeed it has been established that >90% of mammalian genes are alternatively spliced. The abundance of the alternatively spliced forms varies extensively, but a large fraction (~85%) of these alternatively spliced RNAs exist in the range of 5-15% of that particular gene's mRNA transcript population. The biological roles of alternatively spliced mRNAs are varied for example different spliced forms of channels and receptors give rise to differentially responsive proteins, spliced cadherin RNAs facilitate specific cell-cell interactions and distinct splice forms of individual transcription factors modulate distinct gene sets. With such examples of molecular diversity, there has been increased effort to characterize additional splicing events resulting in the recent discovery of three different types of alternatively spliced RNAs including 1) circular RNAs, 2) exitrons and 3) a complex population of alternatively spliced RNAs containing retained introns (ciRNAs) that was identified in the cytoplasm of cells through the use of highly sensitive NextGen sequencing on isolated neuronal dendrite RNA populations. This last class of RNAs is the topic of this proposal. The discovery of a large population of ciRNAs was unexpected, yet led to the hypothesis that they may exert a here to for unknown biological function. An example of a ciRNA that provides insight into functionality of this class of RNAs is one that comprises part of BKCa mRNA population. Preliminary evidence suggests a physiological role for the ciRNA in BK channel functioning but little is known about the intrinsic mechanisms involved and whether multiple ciRNAs that possess different retained introns for a particular RNA exert similar or distinct functions. The robust biological impact of this ciRNA isolated from dispersed cultured neurons highlights the need to identify and characterize the ciRNAs from cells in their native tissue microenvironment to explore how they may regulate the cells' natural physiological responsiveness. We propose to investigate these events in situ using our newly developed Transcriptome In Vivo Analysis (TIVA) to isolate RNA from individual dendrites resident in the live mouse brain slice. The identity of dendritically localized ciRNAs (including depolarization induced ciRNAs) will be determined by single cell RNAseq. A second goal is to start to dissect the mechanism(s) of action of ciRNAs by manipulating their expression and measuring function. While we expect to discover new ciRNAs in the course of this project, the ciRNAs encoding channels are among the most easily examined for a functional role and provide a starting point for functional assessments of this novel class of RNAs.

"9313522","PROJECT SUMMARY How Father & Grandparent Household Transitions Impact Child Growth and Cognition  Adult family members influence child development through a variety of mechanisms such as providing resources for children, interacting with them, and influencing family decision-making. Though much research has found negative effects of father absence on child development, the relative importance of the mechanisms has not been determined. Furthermore, grandparents can play a large role in their grandchildren?s lives and changes in family structure involving grandparents could similarly impact child development. I will be trained and mentored so I am able to engage in independent research that seeks to understand the impacts of fathers and grandparents on child development, even when these family members are non-coresident with the children, and to identify mechanisms that drive the results.  Latin America is an ideal location for studying these associations because longitudinal data indicate young children experience a significant degree of transitions in household structure, including grandparent transitions: three-generational households are a cultural norm. Using longitudinal survey data from five Latin American countries, I will document household transitions experienced during childhood and test how these are associated with child development outcomes. I will also identify mediating factors between household transitions and child development outcomes. Since the surveys will not have variables for all hypothesized mediators (such as the details of non-coresident family members? interactions with the child) I will adapt and validate survey questions from other sources for mothers, fathers, and maternal grandmothers about those potential pathways. In 2019, Chile?s nationally representative Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood will include these instruments. Questions for the mothers will be asked of all mothers, while a smaller phone survey will question fathers and grandmothers (both inside and outside the household). Using this new data, I will assess additional mediation pathways as to how household transitions influence child development. By extending the literature on household structure to transitions involving grandparents and by providing novel data on non-coresident family members, my research will measure the associations between household transitions and child development and provide evidence supporting which pathways are pertinent.  To strengthen my research, I will be mentored and trained in the science and theory of child development. Additional mentorship and training in measurement and instrument design will provide me with essential tools for project evaluation. These new skills, combined with the research results highlighting potential mechanisms linking household transitions and child development, will prepare me to write an R01 grant that adapts and evaluates a program to help children through household transitions of fathers and grandparents in the Chilean context."
"9281541","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing body of research is showing that chronic circadian rhythm disruption, as experienced by rotational shift workers and patients suffering from sleep phase disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders, can lead to behavioral and physiological problems such as insulin insensitivity, depressed or agitated mood, impulse control issues, and cognitive deficits. To regulate circadian rhythms, light information reaches the brain via efferent projections of intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In order to develop effective treatments for circadian rhythm disruption, it is imperative to understand and separate out the specific pathways through which light information reaches the SCN from other mRGC mediated effects, such as the pupillary light reflex which is mediated by mRGC projections to the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN). This proposal aims to identify distinct retinal cell- mRGC-brain region circuits for different non-image forming (NIF) visual responses and molecular players that underlie those circuits. In order to identify mRGCs that specifically project to SCN o to OPN, TVA, an avian receptor not found in mammalian cells, will be expressed in the mRGCs of Opn4Cre (cre-recombinase driven by melanopsin promoter) mice via intravitreal injections of cre-dependent AAV. Stereotaxic injections of TVA dependent red glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus (EnvA-SAD?G-mCherry) into the SCN and blue glycoprotein- deleted rabies virus (EnvA-SAD?G-BFP) into the OPN will allow SAD?G to be taken up in mRGC axon terminals ending at the injection site. Glycoprotein deleted rabies virus is unable to spread transsynaptically but continues to replicate within the infected cells- effectively filling all processes with fluorescen protein and allowing for identification of mRGCs that specifically project to SCN (will express mCherry), those that specifically project to OPN (will express BFP), and subtypes of mRGCs. In a separate experiment, rabies virus glycoprotein (RV-G) will be targeted to mRGCs. Infection of RV-G-expressing mRGCs with SAD?G will allow the fluorescent rabies virus to spread one synapse in the retrograde direction. This will allow SCN or OPN specific mRGCs to label upstream retinal cells with the same colored SAD?G and may reveal exclusive retinal cell-mRGC-brain region di-synaptic circuits. Lastly, next generation sequencing will be applied to mRGC populations that are fluorescently labeled based on their central target projections to generate gene transcription profiles of target- specific mRGC populations. Comparisons between gene expression profiles of different target-defined mRGC populations will reveal genes that are preferentially expressed in mRGC populations that specifically project to SCN or OPN. All together, these experiments will identify brain region-specific mRGC projections and retinal cell inputs, uncover molecular players that underlie target-specific mRGC projections, and inform about potential targets for treating circadian rhythm disruption."
"9278569","Project 3. Project Summary. This Project 3 derives from Project 3 in our current Conte Center. It has the only new PI in our Conte Center, new faculty at Caltech Dean Mobbs (moving from Columbia University in summer, 2016), together with senior Co-PI Colin Camerer. Its overarching goal is to understand how social inference and context guide social decisions under threat, a counterpart to Project 2, which investigates how these processes instead guide prosocial altruistic decisions. There are four Aims, which trace this theme from the buffering safety value of other people, through investigations of social versus nonsocial threat, to investigations of how we behave when other people block our goals (closely related to the RDoC construct of ?frustrative non-reward?). The last Aim, as in Projects 1 and 2, investigates individual differences.  As with the other Projects, there are close links to Aims investigated with different approaches. For instance, Aim 1 under Project 4 will use single-unit recordings from the amygdala to investigate neuronal responses to specific types of threat, from basic to social. These links are also reflected in the personnel of Project 3, which includes PIs Adolphs and Hutcherson (from Project 2), O'Doherty (Project 1), and Rutishauser (Project 4, for the single-unit recording link), as well as several shared post-docs and students.  The Aims leverage the expertise of PI Mobbs in constructing more ecologically valid protocols that can be used in the fMRI environment, have quantifiable parameters, but capture ecological contexts related to social threat in the real world. It will test 60 healthy participants recruited through Cores 2 and 3 in six fMRI experiments. Aim 1 investigates how the competence and reputation of other people can serve as a buffer against physical threats (electric shock). Aim 2 investigates dynamic decision-making in a virtual foraging task, to understand how people's choices trade reward probabilies against social or nonsocial threats. Aim 3 investigates frustrative nonreward in a social setting: what responses are elicited when other people block our goals-- and how this may vary depending on whether or not the other person has an excuse or is blocking us intentionally. Taken together, Projects 1, 2 and 3 build from a very computational framework with very quantitative tasks, to a more standard social neuroscience framework, to a framework maximizing ecological validity. They all involve fMRI studies in healthy people, and they all have links to Aims under Projects 4 and/or 5 that extend the investigation to single-unit studies or lesion studies."
"9441576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prion diseases (PrD) are rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of insoluble prion protein (PrP) in the brain. Despite compelling evidence for the role of the templated conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in the spread of prions, our current understanding of the primary causes of PrP neurotoxicity is limited. Our long-term goal is to uncover the molecular factors mediating the pathogenesis of PrD. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic triggers of human PrP neurotoxicity in Drosophila. Flies expressing PrP from rodents and sheep display late-onset brain degeneration but lack an easy-to-score phenotype, which has hindered the discovery of the mechanisms mediating PrP toxicity. Since natural variants of PrP seem to affect its disease potential, we postulated that the heightened toxicity of human PrP (HuPrP) underlies the exceptional complexity of human PrD. Our HYPOTHESIS is that HuPrP efficiently folds into highly pathogenic conformations that hijack endogenous cellular components to activate deleterious intracellular signals that kill neurons. We based this hypothesis on extensive literature review and compelling preliminary results demonstrating the robust toxicity of HuPrP in flies. HuPrP-WT kills brain neurons and induces small/glassy eyes in flies. Also, reducing the activity of PERK and its effector ATF4 suppresses the glassy eyes, demonstrating (a) the physiological relevance of HuPrP toxicity in Drosophila and (b) its sensitivity to known mediators of PrP toxicity. The rationale for this proposal is that (1) the toxicity of HuPrP in Drosophila stems from aberrant molecular interactions that can be defined genetically, (2) Drosophila is an ideal model for large modifier screens, and (3) understanding HuPrP toxicity is directly relevant for uncovering the pathogenic cascades in human prion diseases. We will test our central hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: -Working hypothesis I: HuPrP accumulates specific isoforms responsible for its heightened toxicity Aim 1: Identify intrinsic determinants of human PrP toxicity. We will introduce the M129 polymorphism and reverse HuPrP toxicity with the N159D substitution from dog PrP. Then, we will identify the HuPrP-specific neurotoxic isoforms that trigger toxicity and the cellular mechanisms that produce them by biochemical studies. -Working hypothesis II: Unbiased genetic screens will reveal the genetic factors mediating HuPrP toxicity Aim 2: Identify extrinsic factors mediating human PrP toxicity. We will perform a genome-wide genetic screen for modifiers of the robust eye phenotype of HuPrP. Testing 6,600 RNAi and 5,000 overexpression alleles will identify most pathways mediating HuPrP toxicity. The main INNOVATION of this proposal consists on exploiting the robust phenotypes of a new Drosophila model expressing HuPrP to identify both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors mediating HuPrP toxicity. This is SIGNIFICANT because we will tease apart the complex molecular mechanisms triggering HuPrP toxicity, guiding future therapeutic approaches most likely to work in the clinic."
"9260922","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bacterial populations associated with the human body play important roles in both health and disease. The objective of this research is to understand how altered patterns of bacterial colonization impact outcomes after major traumatic injury. This proposal is designed as an ancillary study to the ADAPT trial, a NIH-funded observational study of best practices in the care of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). The work is an extension of a pilot study of critically ill children that documented widespread derangements of the microbiome, which in some cases were linked to nosocomial infections. We will use next-generation DNA sequencing to resolve population level bacterial colonization patterns in 50 patients with severe TBI. We will profile colonization patterns using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples, skin swabs, tongue swabs, tracheal aspirates, and samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected twice weekly after admission to the PICU. A panel of 4 microbiome analyses will be performed to profile the microbiota for each individual patient, and for the entire study population. We will use group-based trajectory analysis to track changes in diversity, presence of dominant nosocomial pathogens, and loss of microbial site-specificity across body sites. Alterations in the microbiota of TBI patients will be compared to colonization patterns in control populations of adults and children (Aim 1). We will use multiple statistical approaches including a hierarchical mixed effect linear model to characterize how the ICU microbiome is impacted by clinical variables, including antibiotic exposure, enteral nutrition, and contamination from the ICU room environment (Aim 2). Finally, we will utilize regression models to test the hypothesis that specific derangements in the microbiome increase the odds of adverse clinical outcomes including nosocomial infection, prolonged hospital stay, death, and poor neurologic function at 6 months (Aim 3). Improved understanding of post-injury colonization patterns could translate to improved outcomes for trauma victims by suggesting more effective patient care strategies, e.g. modification of the microbiome to prevent infection. More broadly, this research will uncover aspects of colonization dynamics with implications for a diverse range of critically ill patients, including both children nd adults."
"9276321","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in erythroid iron/heme metabolism. Erythropoiesis is a massive exercise in cellular proliferation and synthesis of a single protein, hemoglobin. As a consequence, there is a tremendous demand for iron and heme to be efficiently trafficked within the developing erythron. Despite advances in our understanding of extra-cellular iron trafficking and proto-porphyrin biosynthesis, significant gaps remain, especially with respect to components involving the egress of iron from the endosomes to the mitochondria, the trafficking of iron/heme within the mitochondria, the transporters required for proto-porphyrin genesis, the cofactors that facilitate the intracellular trafficking of iron/heme, and the eventual export of heme from the mitochondria for its incorporation in hemoglobin. Using complementary approaches of genetics and bioinformatics from transcriptional profiling, we previously identified several proteins, such as Mitoferrin1 (Mfrn1), Sorting Nexin3 (Snx3), Tmem14c, Lat3, and Clpx1, as new components in the intracellular trafficking of iron, heme and nutrients crucial to red cell development. Although transcriptional profiling as provided insights, we showed that post-translational mechanisms play equally critical roles in the expression and function of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we examined changes in the mitochondrial proteome as erythroid cells undergo maturation. We identified several solute carriers and transmembrane proteins, whose function in erythropoiesis have not been previously ascribed, that were induced with hemoglobinization. We propose to study the expression and loss-of-function phenotype of these 7 candidate genes (Aim 1). In particular, we plan to focus previously identified gene, Fam210b (c20orf108), and its interacting partners in red cell development (Aim 2). Functional elucidation of these structural genes will expand our knowledge into the unknown additional steps in intracellular solute, iron and heme trafficking crucial for erythropoiesis. The results of our proposal will provide us with new genetic tools to explore human disorders of anemias."
"9310591","SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as ?omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals."
"9231498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through part-of-speech tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (which, what, that). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention."
"9036280","?    DESCRIPTION:     The Center for Social and Community Reintegration Research (SoCRR) addresses a critical goal for the VA: the full reintegration of Veterans in domains identified as central to community participation by the World Health Organization. Specific domains include employment and school, community/social engagement, and interpersonal relationships. SoCRR investigators will conduct research and train post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty investigators to address these reintegration needs for Veterans with psychiatric disabilities. The research will be organized by two important areas of focus: 1) Interventions to Enhance Education/Employment and 2) Interventions to Enhance Family and Social Functioning.  For Focus 1, we propose to develop two interventions that support Veterans who are having difficulties maintaining their ongoing employment or education. Both interventions emphasize collaboration between treatment and rehabilitation professionals, and are designed for Veterans in the community rather than in a hospital. Pilot Project 1 focuses on the educational and unmet mental health care needs of returning Veterans on college campuses. The goal is to facilitate awareness and access to treatment for relevant mental and physical health concerns or other rehabilitation needs by providing supported education services that improve educational outcomes. Pilot Project 2 will develop and test the feasibility of a rapid-response vocational service that adapts supported employment principles to help Veterans who are at risk of job loss, with the goal of lengthening employment tenure, and improving vocational functioning and quality of life.  For Focus 2, we propose to develop pilot interventions that improve or enhance social and family functioning. Pilot Project 3 will develop and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminry efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Improving Social Support for Veterans with PTSD (ACT-SS). This treatment will help Veterans with PTSD to increase social support in family relationships, partners, and peers by targeting maladaptive patterns of interpersonal difficulties, feelings of detachment from others, irritability, and avoidance of social situations. Pilot Project 4 will develop and test an innovative comprehensive and recovery-oriented intervention for Veterans who use violence in their partner relationships. This intervention provides Veterans with skills to increase healthy coping and communication strategies, education, and provision of wraparound services for mental health conditions such as PTSD and substance abuse. The goal is to eliminate or reduce the use of intimate partner violence and increase relationship satisfaction and quality of life.  Underlying both core areas of functioning we also propose a developmental measurement project to address the challenges of measuring the multifaceted concept of community reintegration. This study will develop a comprehensive item database including all relevant measures of community reintegration, as well as measures that reflect the underlying factors associated with this concept (social, emotional, and vocational functioning). Once assembled, the goal will be to revise, choose, and then organize the items into testlets that can be piloted to create a menu of measures to address multiple subareas of community reintegration."
"9252365","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  PanThera's goal for the proposed research is to identify a clinical candidate that demonstrates in vivo efficacy in animal models of post-exposure inhalation anthrax and has a safety profile suitable for use in humans as an antidote to anthrax lethal factor intoxication.  The 2001 anthrax spore attack via the U.S. mail caused 11 confirmed cases of inhalation anthrax. Despite the administration of frontline antibiotics and modern day intensive care support, only six of these patients survived. This high mortality rate, along with the widespread panic and considerable cleanup cost, starkly defined the seriousness of this bioterrorist event and the extreme threat anthrax poses to national security.  Therapeutics currently available to treat anthrax, such as antibiotics and immunotherapeutic agents (vaccines and monoclonal antibodies), show complete protection in animal models when administered pre-exposure. However, their protective capability diminishes dramatically as post-exposure treatment delay times increase, suggesting that toxemia remains a threat to host survival. The complex pathogenesis of anthrax disease includes both bacterial and toxin components, although antibiotics can clear the system of bacteria and shut off the source of the toxins, and biological agents can block the transport of toxins into the cells, no therapeutic is currently available to disarm the toxins already present in the cells.  PanThera has identified novel anthrax lethal factor inhibitors (LFIs) with picomolar potency and demonstrated in vivo efficacy in rat, mouse, and rabbit models of anthrax. These LFIs are designed to mitigate both early and late-stage toxemia by acting intracellularly and extracellularly, in contrast to biologics which ac only extracellularly. Small molecule LFIs should also provide a countermeasure against antibiotic resistant strains of B. anthracis (Enhanced Agents) and against novel viral vectors engineered to deliver intracellular anthrax LF toxin (Advanced Agents).  The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) complete lead optimization studies and select a preclinical candidate; 2) conduct early IND-enabling studies sufficient for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA; and 3) complete the remaining IND studies needed for submission of an IND to the FDA. To achieve these aims we have assembled a team of scientists who are leaders in the field of bacterial toxins and anthrax disease. This team of expert collaborators provides us with unique animal models: rat toxin and mouse spore challenge models of anthrax (Leppla lab; NIH), as well as a rabbit inhalation spore challenge model of anthrax infection (Peterson lab; UTMB)."
"9309921","Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chie?y, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speci?c hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve."
"9459532","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory input to the visual system arises from two separate channels (left and right eyes), yet we  experience a single, unitary visual world that belies little hint of the dual monocular origins of that experience.  This transformation from two monocular views to stable binocular single vision is the manifestation of important  neural processes that give rise to significant improvements in visual perception, including stereoscopic depth  perception and binocular contrast summation. In cases of sensory eye dominance (SED), a condition where one  of the two eyes contributes more strongly to the binocular percept than the other, these gains can be muted or,  in extreme instances, completely thwarted. Under these conditions, vision with two eyes is no better than with  one, and in some instances is worse owing to monocular competition.  In addition to arising from differences in monocular processing, asymmetric contributions from the left  and right eyes may stem from processes involved in combining neural signals from the two eyes. The local  nature of binocular combination suggests, moreover, that SED may vary idiosyncratically throughout the visual  field. Aim 1 will investigate how patterns of SED vary across visual field locations, and will test for influences of  regional SED patterns on binocular function. Then, extended monocular patching, known to strengthen one eye's contribution to the binocular percept, will be utilized to learn whether altering these SED maps can lead to  improved binocular function by counteracting the neural processes putatively responsible for SED.  Following psychophysical measurements in Aim 1, Aim 2 will apply functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) to test predictions stemming from a simple neural model of binocular integration. This model predicts increased neural activity (and thus larger BOLD signal responses) to dominant eye stimulation and  epochs of perceptual dominance (during binocular rivalry) at locations of strong SED imbalance. An fMRI study  will investigate whether this is due to stronger drive of monocular input neurons and/or greater engagement of inhibitory interneurons mediating binocular contrast gain control. By studying this network under monocular,  binocular fusible, and binocular rivalry conditions, the stage of processing giving rise to SED can be isolated,  while also revealing how underlying mechanisms vary functionally throughout the visual field.  This research project will provide important training opportunities focused on psychophysics, neural  modeling and neuroimaging. Working closely with proposed research mentor Randolph Blake and interacting  with others in the Vanderbilt Vision Research community offers a unique opportunity to expand the applicant's expertise in visual neuroscience. Results from the proposed research can potentially lead to translational  applications in the diagnosis and treatment of binocular visual disorders, offering additional and important training in linking vision research to clinical practie. This will act as a launch pad for the applicant's career as an  independent scientist working on clinically relevant problems of human vision."
"9251314","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) is devastating to non-Hispanic black men, who have a higher HTN prevalence than other groups but less physician contact and less participation in intervention trials. We previously conducted the first cluster-randomized tril of a HTN intervention in black-owned barbershops. Shops were randomized to a control arm (HTN pamphlets) or an intervention arm in which barbers (trusted peers) offered blood pressure (BP) checks to adult black male patrons and motivated those with high BP to make doctor appointments. After 10 months, we found a small intervention effect. Under-treatment of HTN by primary care providers limited the ability of the barber-based intervention to lower BP. Thus, we now have linked the barber-based intervention to pharmacist-based team care to optimize HTN management. In collaboration with Kaiser Permanente (KP) and Walgreens, we propose a new trial with the following specific aims: 1. To evaluate the efficacy of the enhanced intervention on systolic BP by conducting a cluster-randomized trial. The clientele of 20 Los Angeles (LA) barbershops will be screened to collect a cohort of 25 patrons per shop with uncontrolled HTN. Ten shops (250 patrons) will be randomized to a comparator group (HTN pamphlets) and 10 shops (250 patrons) to an intervention group in which barbers frequently check and transmit BP readings of enrolled patrons and motivate them to follow-up with pharmacists. With physicians' permission and oversight, pharmacists will promote patient activation, intensify drug therapy under a collaborative practice agreement, send progress notes to physicians, and follow up after each medication change. The primary endpoint is the change in systolic BP assessed after 6 months. We hypothesize that barbershop patrons who receive the barber- pharmacist intervention will have a greater reduction in systolic BP than patrons in the comparison group who receive standard HTN pamphlets and usual medical care. 2. To evaluate sustainability and safety with a 6- month extension study. The intervention will continue with more phone than in-person encounters with pharmacists. We hypothesize that the intervention effect on systolic BP can be sustained safely for at least 6 more months. 3. To evaluate real-world effectiveness and adoptability in an implementation pilot study. If the trial's 6-month primary outcome is met, we will: A) analyze qualitative data to inform implementation; B) evaluate effectiveness under real-world conditions with a pilot implementation study (n=300 men) in three states that involves referral to KP for their members, and to Walgreens stores for non-KP patients; C) model cost-effectiveness from a generic health care payer perspective to translate observed BP reductions into cost- offset projections; and D) modify these projections using internal corporate-specific cost data to determine if viable business models can be developed. Implementation would support Affordable Care Act initiatives promoting systems in which providers are fiscally responsible for cost, quality and outcomes. Sustained reductions in systolic BP of even 5 mmHg would reduce the disparity in HTN control affecting black men."
"9254549","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this project is to determine whether a commercially available soft bifocal contact lens with a distance-center design can slow myopia progression in children. Using soft bifocal contact lenses to manipulate the peripheral optics of the eye is a novel use for a standard contact lens that may keep children from becoming as nearsighted as they would otherwise. Secondary goals are to determine whether the amount of myopic defocus imposed on the peripheral retina by soft bifocal contact lenses is associated in a dose-dependent manner with slowed myopic progression and to determine whether peripheral myopic blur acts to slow eye growth locally or globally. These important pieces of information will enable investigators to learn about the role of peripheral optics for regulating eye growth, which could ultimately lead to optimization of optical signals to slow myopia progression. Ultimately, the information could be used to design optical devices to prevent the onset of myopia in young children. Slowing myopia progression or eventually preventing myopia onset could potentially affect approximately 60 million children in the United States alone. While the consequences of myopia are rarely sight-threatening, the quality of life for myopic patients is negatively affected, and the health care costs to treat myopia are astronomical (approximately $4.6 billion in 1990). The National Eye Institute recognizes the need to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatments for delaying the onset or for slowing the progression of myopia, such as lenses that alter peripheral defocus. Using a common treatment of myopia (contact lenses) to potentially slow myopia progression and to learn about optical signals that regulate eye growth is a very novel approach to solving a problem that affects a large proportion of people in the United States."
"9343399","Abstract: HIV causes a spectrum of neurologic deficits known as HIV-Associated Neurologic Disorders (HAND). HAND is a prominent co-morbid condition of HIV even in the era of Combined Anti-Retroviral Therapy and is expected to increase as the HIV+ population ages. Fundamental understanding of how HIV invades the brain and mechanisms that drive HAND are poorly understood. In this application we will focus on the role of CD4+ T cells and CD4dimCD8bright T cells in HIV neuroinvasion, persistence, and HAND. CD4dimCD8bright T cells are a unique subset of CD8+ T cells that co-express CD4 on their surface. They exhibit potent anti-viral responses in the periphery. Recently, we showed that migration of CD8+ T cells into the CNS in context of HIV gives rise to CD4dimCD8bright T cells, in a Wnt/?-catenin signaling - dependent manner. Within the brain, CD4dimCD8bright T cells exhibit highly potent anti-HIV responses. The consequence of this response is controlling HIV on one hand but perhaps at the cost of inducing inflammation and injury in the brain. Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that because peripheral CD4dimCD8bright T cells are susceptible to HIV infection, they will contribute to HIV neuroinvasion (Aim 1), yet because they robustly express ?-catenin and its pro-survival target gene, Bcl-XL, infected CD4dimCD8bright T cells will persist in the CNS as a reservoir for HIV (Aim 2). Further, because CD4dimCD8bright mount potent anti-HIV responses and are hyper-activated, their frequency will correlate with lower HIV content in CNS but higher level of neuroinflamamtion and worse neurocognitive performance (Aim 3). We will use a combination of in vitro, small animal studies, and patient samples from the Southeast Asia Research Collaboration with the University of Hawaii (SEARCH) and the US Military HIV Research Program (USMHRP) to address this central hypothesis. Collectively our studies will establish a new understanding of HIV neuroinvasion, HIV neuro-persistence, and role of T cells in the neuro-immune axis mediating neuropathogenesis/HAND. This understanding can provide new approaches for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate and/or reduce HAND and will provide valuable insights into HIV persistence in the CNS."
"9212422","The CDC estimates a $124 billion aggregate lifetime economic burden incurred by victims of child maltreatment. A large literature supports positive associations between child maltreatment and adverse physical health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic pain, headaches, sexually-transmitted infections, and autoimmune diseases. However, the majority of these findings derive from cross-sectional, short-term, or adult retrospective study designs, severely limiting scientific credibility and causal inferences. Moreover, putative etiological processes leading to such outcomes remain largely unknown and not every child who has been maltreated will experience any long-term health effects, suggesting the presence of unique risk and resilience pathways. This lack of understanding in the basic mechanisms conferring risk or resilience for victims of child maltreatment has stymied translational research where preventative interventions targeting identified pathways can be developed or modified in an effort to reduce these health disparities and their corresponding healthcare costs. Project 1 will raise the rigor of this science and address critical gaps by implementing a large, prospective cohort study to examine the effects of child maltreatment on multiple etiological processes believed to play a role in the onset and maintenance of adverse health outcomes for victims. Through a large-scale partnership with the State of Pennsylvania's Department of Human Services, Project 1 will recruit a large cohort of 1200 children aged 8?13 (50% males), including 900 who experienced substantiated maltreatment within the past year (300 sexual abuse, 300 physical abuse, and 300 neglect), along with demographically matched control children (300). The processes of biological embedding (BE) at the neuroendocrine, autonomic, immunologic, epigenetic, and cellular (i.e., mitochondria and telomere biology) levels will be examined as mechanisms of child health, including brain health (i.e., optimal neurodevelopmental trajectories), behavioral & emotional health, and physical health. Psychosocial and behavioral processes such as resilience (i.e., school engagement, self-esteem, family and peer support, adaptive coping, flexibility, cognitive ability, emotion regulation, and executive functioning); healthy lifestyle behaviors (i.e., exercise, sleep, diet, sexual attitudes, and substance use); and treatment utilization will be examined as plausible malleable factors that mitigate the relationship between BE and health. Aims include: (Aim 1) a comprehensive understanding of the interplay among child maltreatment, biological embedding (BE), and health status; (Aim 2) testing how BE operates independently and in conjunction with psychosocial and behavioral factors to explain the relationship between maltreatment and health status; and (Aim 3) testing the moderating effects of genotype, gender, ethnicity, pubertal stage, and maltreatment type on models tested in Aims 1 & 2."
"9316220","Project Summary: The primary aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate whether risk of perpetrating intimate partner aggression (IPA) when intoxicated is greater among young adults (aged 21 to 35 years) with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than young adults without ADHD, and (2) Investigate whether certain biological, neurological, and dispositional risk factors that may strengthen the risk of adults with ADHD perpetrating IPA when intoxicated. The long-term goal of this research is to evaluate whether alcohol consumption is a more potent risk factor for IPV in young adults with than without ADHD and, if so, to reduce their risk of IPA perpetration by including interventions to reduce their risk in existing treatments for ADHD. Young adults with ADHD are at-risk for IPV perpetration, and preliminary evidence indicates that problematic alcohol use is more likely to predict IPA among young adults with ADHD than those without ADHD. However, it remains unclear whether young adults with ADHD are more likely to perpetrate IPA when under the influence of alcohol and when provoked. Furthermore, investigations are needed to test whether specific biological (e.g., testosterone:cortisol ratio), neurological (e.g., behavioral inhibitory control), and dispositional risk factors (e.g., alcohol-aggression expectancies) identify adults with ADHD at increased risk of perpetrating IPA when intoxicated and provoked. To address these gaps in our knowledge, 66 heterosexual couples including young adults with ADHD and 34 heterosexual couples including young adults without ADHD will be recruited to participate in an alcohol administration study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive an alcoholic beverage or to receive a non-alcoholic beverage, and afterwards their level of partner-directed aggression in response to provocation will be unobtrusively measured via laboratory-based aggression task. We hypothesize that intoxicated adults with ADHD will perpetrate more severe IPA when provoked than sober adults with ADHD or adults without ADHD, regardless of being intoxicated or sober. Among adults with ADHD, we also hypothesize that individuals who are intoxicated and have specific biological, neurological, and/or dispositional traits will perpetrate more severe alcohol-facilitated IPA when provoked than intoxicated adults with ADHD but without the same traits, or adults with ADHD who are sober, regardless of their biological, neurological or dispositional traits. Finally, we hypothesize that adults with ADHD who have multiple risk factors will be at greatest risk of IPA perpetration when intoxicated."

"9261068","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia meeting entitled Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases: Discovery and Models of Precision Therapy, organized by Drs. William A. Gahl and Christoph Klein. The meeting will be held in Boston, Massachusetts from March 5-8, 2017. Of the 7,000 known rare diseases, only a fraction have their molecular and mechanistic bases delineated, and many other diseases have yet to be discovered. Characterization of these disorders will reveal new biochemical pathways and cell biological processes, point to potential drug targets, and provide hope for millions of affected individuals. This meeting will address approaches and best practices in pursuing rare and undiagnosed disorders, limitations in data sharing as a barrier to new disease discovery, and examples of successful descriptions of new diseases, mechanisms, and treatments. Specific aims include: 1) fostering the development of expertise in rare diseases and the definition of their natural histories, including training the next generation of rare disease investigators; 2) developing an international network of scientists and physicians collaborating on new disease discovery by sharing phenotypic and sequence data; and 3) promoting the creation of new therapeutic approaches based upon rare and new disease mechanisms. Through this meeting, participants will become familiar with rare and undiagnosed disease programs, acquire insights into new disease mechanisms, learn about potential therapeutic targets, and establish collaborations that enhance rare disorder expertise and new disease discovery. The meeting will bring together physicians who are expert in rare disorders with scientists who know metabolic pathways and mechanisms, advancing understanding and therapy. A desired outcome of the meeting includes developing lists of clinical and basic research experts for synergistic collaborations, and creating an international organization to perpetuate the joint investigation of rare and new diseases. Relevance to NCATS: the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences houses the Office of Rare Diseases Research, which initiated the Undiagnosed Diseases Program and which gets a lot of calls from patients without a diagnosis. The NCATS mission is translational, and rare and undiagnosed disease patients are the Institute?s most needy constituents with respect to new drug development."
"9249923","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microtubule cytoskeleton is required for multiple essential functions of the cell, including vesicle transport, organelle positioning, cell migration and assembly of the mitotic spindle. The centrosome acts as the primary organizer of the cytoskeleton, regulating microtubule nucleation, growth, and positioning. Human diseases such as autosomal recessive primary microcephaly are primarily caused by defects in proteins that are localized to, and function at, the centrosome1. As such, developing an understanding of how these proteins act at the centrosome to promote cytoskeletal organization is also of medical relevance. Hundreds of proteins have been identified as components of the centrosome2,3, yet how specific proteins act to promote new microtubule nucleation from the cell's dominant microtubule organizing center is still unknown. Despite identification of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (?-TuRC) as a major microtubule nucleator in the cell4-7, it remains unclear how it gets localized and activated specifically at the centrosome to generate microtubules. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine how the centrosome nucleates microtubules for building the microtubule cytoskeleton of the cell. In order to achieve this goal, I will develop an assay to visualize, in real time, new microtubule formation at the centrosome in a cell-free system using single molecule microscopy. I will investigate which proteins are responsible for localizing ?-TuRC to the centrosome and for specifically activating it there. Finally, I will determine how the key molecular players induce centrosomal microtubule nucleation. Completion of these aims will provide a molecular understanding of how microtubules are nucleated at the centrosome and how this contributes to building the microtubule cytoskeleton in health and disease."
"9254554","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the Data Coordinating Center for the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, a mulfl-center, randomized clinical trial designed to answer 3 important issues related to slowing eye growth in myopic children. We will determine whether soft bifocal contact lenses slow myopia progression in children. The soft bifocal contact lenses will create a wide distribution of peripheral defocus in myopic subjects, which will allow us to determine whether the amount of peripheral myopic defocus is related to slower myopia progression. Measuring the peripheral refractive error without contact lenses will allow us to monitor changes in eye shape to determine whether peripheral defocus primarily changes local eye growth or affects the growth of the entire eye.  In this trial, 294 children aged 7 to 11 years with myopia will be randomly assigned to wear soft bifocal (either Biofinity Multifocal with +2.50 D add or with +1.50 add; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY) or single vision (Biofinity; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY) contact lenses. A comparison of the myopia progression experienced by the treatment groups will determine if the soft bifocal lenses slow myopia, while peripheral findings will provide additional information about the regulation of peripheral eye growth.  As the Data Coordinating Center for the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, we will complete the following Specific Aims: 1.) implement the protocol as designed by the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study Executive Committee; 2) implement data collection procedures via electronic data capture systems that ensure high-quality data in a secured fashion; and 3) analyze the data using appropriate statistical methodology and ensure that the results are accurately reported."
"9204869","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe malaria kills about 900,000 children a year and impairs brain function in some survivors. Human CM (HCM) is a severe form of malaria characterized by sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) in cerebral micro-circulation and induction of inflammatory mediators which cause impaired consciousness with unarousable coma. We reported [PLoS One, 2012;7(3):e34280)] that excess production of heme, a by-product of Plasmodium berghei-damaged erythrocytes during infection, is a major cause of inflammation, loss of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and tissue damage associated with fatal experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) . Excess free heme induces up-regulation of STAT3 and CXCL10 whereas up-regulation of HO-1, an essential enzyme in heme catabolism, limits sequestration of pRBC, induction of inflammatory mediators and brain tissue damage caused by ECM. Following a screen for agents that attenuate ECM, we identified Neuregulin- 1(NRG-1), a 8 kDa peptide currently undergoing clinical trials for use against traumatic brain injury, that attenuates mortality, limits sequestration of pRBC, induces anti-inflammatory mediators and reduces brain tissue damage in ECM when delivered intravenously or intra-peritoneally at 5g/kg (J Neuro,2014:11:9). NRG- 1 mediated attenuation of mortality was via perturbation of expression of a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors during ECM pathogenesis. We observed that ECM resistant mice (BALB/c) constitutively expressed higher levels of NRG-1 in brain tissue than ECM susceptible (C57BL/6) mice. In human malaria, serum NRG-1 was higher in mild malaria cases but lowest in fatal HCM indicating a possible inhibitory role of infection on endogenous serum NRG-1 production. Expression of NRG-1 in brain tissue, on the other hand, was dependent on expression of ErbB4, a NRG-1 receptor, in damaged brain regions. Since NRG-1 negatively regulates STAT3 and CXCL10 (a key biological determinant of fatal ECM) and positively regulates HO-1, our goal is to functionally assess the key pathways perturbed by NRG-1 to attenuate ECM and HCM pathogenesis. Our main hypothesis is that NRG-1 attenuates CM mortality by down regulating CXCL10 and STAT3 activation and up regulating HO-1. The proposed study focuses on the mechanism by which NRG- 1 regulates the heme-STAT3-CXCL10-HO-1 system to protect against fatal ECM. Three specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: will test the hypothesis that NRG-1 is essential for protection of brain microvascular endothelium and blood-brain barrier (BBB) against heme-induced damage in human CM pathogenesis. Specific Aim 2: will test the hypothesis that NRG-1 is essential for protection against ECM-induced CNS damage and neurobehavioral outcomes via heme-STAT3-CXCL10-HO-1 signaling pathway. Specific Aim 3: will test the hypothesis that NRG-1 attenuates severe HCM by restoring integrity of human blood-brain barrier. Understanding the protective effect of NRG-1 against CM pathogenesis and mortality will provide opportunities for discovery of a new class of small molecule adjunctive therapeutics and interventions against fatal CM."
"9450282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal muscle is a unique organ that is composed of multinucleate muscle fibers, each of which is the product of fusion of hundreds or even thousands of myoblasts. Myoblast fusion is not only important for skeletal muscle development, but also critical for satellite cell-based muscle regeneration. Despite a large body of studies ove several decades, the mechanisms underlying myoblast fusion in humans remain poorly understood. Recent studies in the fruit fly Drosophila have begun to reveal unprecedented details about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of myoblast fusion. The striking evolutionary conservation between fly and mammalian myogenesis makes Drosophila a particularly relevant system to study myoblast fusion in vivo. Recent studies from our lab have uncovered a novel cellular mechanism underlying myoblast fusion. We show that myoblast fusion is mediated by a cell type-specific, F-actin-enriched podosome-like structure (PLS), which invades the opposing fusion partner with multiple protrusive fingers leading to fusion pore formation. To further characterize the regulation of the invasive PLS, the key cellular structure mediating myoblast fusion, we propose to investigate the molecular and cellular functions of two new genes, DPak3 and dynamin, both have previously been implicated in human diseases. We will use a multifaceted approach, including genetics, cell biology and biochemistry, to study the mechanisms by which DPak3 and dynamin regulate actin polymerization dynamics within the PLS in Drosophila myoblast fusion. We will also investigate the function of their mammalian orthologs in the fusion of mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Given the molecular and cellular conservation of myoblast fusion between fly and mammals, the proposed mechanistic studies using the simpler and genetically tractable Drosophila system will lead to significant insights int human muscle biology in health and disease, and ultimately provide a basis for developing more efficient therapeutics against the life debilitating muscle degeneration diseases."

"9316069","Project abstract Patterns of modified cytosines (5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) are required for the normal function of the genome, and perturbations of patterns of modified cytosine can be lethal and lead to gross changes in patterns of gene expression. Methylation patterns are grossly abnormal in many forms of human cancer. Existing methods of genome-wide methylation profiling require large amounts of DNA, overestimate methylation levels, and cannot cover the entire genome. We are developing a method wherein enzymes are used to modify sites of methylation and hydroxymethylation with chemical tags that render these sites easily detectible by nanopore sequencing by synthesis and other platforms for single molecule DNA sequencing. The result will be a comprehensive method for the detection of modified bases in human genomes with much greater sensitivity, accuracy, economy, and throughput than existing methods."
"9318011","PROJECT SUMMARY Histone modifications are key constituents of the epigenome regulating growth and development, and they control nuclear processes including transcription. Misregulation of histone modifications is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Numerous genome-wide studies have clearly shown that multiple histone modifications co-occupy genomic regions and define chromatin sub-domains. Chromatin modifying or remodeling complexes contain subunits with specialized interaction domains that bind different histone modifications. Therefore, combinatorial histone modifications on a nucleosome might play a key role in regulating transcription, but this aspect is very poorly understood. Apart from nucleosomes asymmetrically modified with H3K4me3-H3K27me3 marks implicated in transcriptional regulation at poised or developmentally regulated genes, other combinatorial modifications or asymmetrically modified nucleosomes remain unknown. We have identified a novel H3K4me3-H3K4acetyl (ac) dually modified mononucleosomes in yeast as well as human cells. Using ReChIP-seq, we have determined that nucleosomes with the H3K4me3-H3K4ac bivalent mark are present at actively transcribed genes and enriched around transcription start sites both in yeast and human genomes. H3K4me3 is often used as a surrogate for gene expression, but this mark is also found at inactive or poised genes. Therefore, we hypothesize that nucleosomes dually modified with H3K4me3-H3K4ac marks are the best indicators of active transcription and transcription start sites in genomics studies. In Aim 1, we will further test our hypothesis by mapping the genomic location of H3K4me3-H3K4ac bivalent mark in other model eukaryotes (Drosophila and C. elegans). Using ReChIP-seq, we will map the genome-wide occupancy of H3K4me3-H3K4ac dual mark in undifferentiated and lineage-committed human embryonic stem cells and confirm its active establishment at transcribed genes. The orientation of H3K4me3 and H3K4ac marks within a nucleosome might constitute a further epigenetic regulatory signal during transcription. Using the high resolution ChIP-nexus approach, we have determined a distinct orientation for H3K4ac and H3K4me3 marks within yeast nucleosomes. In Aim 2, we will determine whether H3K4me3 and H3K4ac marks also acquire specific orientation in human cells. Using biochemical and genomic approaches, we will aim to gain mechanistic insights into the functions of H3K4ac-H3K4me3 bivalent mark as a recruiter and/or regulator of chromatin modifiers and remodelers during transcription. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide a paradigm-shifting concept and establish the novel H3K4me3-H3K4ac bivalent modification as a genuine mark of active transcription. Our study will be the first to provide a comprehensive epigenomic map for a novel histone bivalent mark functionally connected to transcriptional activity in multiple eukaryotes and during growth and differentiation in human cells. Importantly, our study will usher in the next wave of epigenomics studies aimed towards identifying and investigating the functions of novel combinatorial histone marks."
"9249644","Project III is designed to discover mechanisms that underlie the ability of the immature cardiomyocyte to  integrate conflicting hormonal signals that determine the final and optimal cardiomyocyte endowment at birth.  Fetal cardiomyocyte endowment is important because it determines the relative force that must be generated  by each working cell for the life of offspring and it guides the generation of the coronary architecture within the  myocardium. In rats, underendowed hearts are more vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion injury and heart  failure. Based on PPG support we have demonstrated that three hormone/growth factors stimulate  cardiomyocyte growth in living near term fetuses: insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), angiotensin II (Ang II) and  Cortisol. Two factors inhibit stimulated cardiomyocyte growth: atrial natriuretic peptide and tri-iodo-L-thyronine  (T3). For this project we will study the signaling and actions of IGF-1, T3 and Cortisol. We propose 3 aims that  will further our understanding of how these hormones work together and how they might be used to augment  cardiomyocte numbers in under-endowed growth restricted hearts. Aim 1 (in vitro) will test the hypothesis that  the hierarchy of signaling action from IGF-1, Cortisol and T3 is based on signal interactions within the mitogen  activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK) and the phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)  pathways in the near term fetal ovine cardiomyocyte. Aim 2 will test three hypotheses to determine the roles of  IGF-1, Taand Cortisol in regulating cardiomyocyte growth and maturation. The aim speculates that  phosphorylation of ERK and PI3-K pathway proteins will be down-regulated in cardiomyocytes in response to  subnormal T3 levels which will lead to decreased IGF-1 receptors and increased IGF-1 concentrations. Aim 3  (in vivo) will test the hypothesis that exogenous IGF-1 and T3 can be used to augment cardiomyocyte numbers  permanently in the fetal myocardium. The outcome of the project will be possible therapies for repairing  disadvantaged hearts in the womb."
"9414183","?    DESCRIPTION: The existence of latent reservoirs of HIV-infected cells constitutes the major impediment towards viral eradication. HIV-1 latent reservoirs are small, but extremely long-lived. Latent infection is associated with undetectable levels of viral gene expression and appears to be non-cytopathic. However, upon reactivation, latent viruses enter an active mode of replication in which they are fully competent for spread and induction of disease. The current thinking in the field is that a combination of hypothetical drugs that will reactivate latent viruss (``anti-latency'' drugs), with present-day antiretroviral drugs, will be an effective approach towad viral eradication. We have found that benzotriazole derivatives can reactivate latent HIV-1 in an in vitro primary cell model of latency and in cells isolated from aviremic patients by potentiating ?c cytokine signaling. This reactivation is achieved in an unusual way in that it is independent on cellular activation or proliferation. We therefore propose to explore this novel mechanism of viral reactivation as a novel therapeutic target in the context of reactivation of latent HIV.  In he R21 phase, we will study how benzotriazole derivatives mediate reactivation of latent HIV and what are the effects of these compounds on global transcription, both viral and cellular. In Aim 1, we plan to characterize in detail the mechanism of action of benzotriazole derivatives as well as identify the target for these compounds. Preliminary data suggest that these compounds suppress a negative feed-back loop that normally resets STAT5 to an inactive, baseline state after cytokine signaling. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects on global transcription as well a HIV-1 transcription using both RNAseq and ChIPseq in primary CD4 T cells. We will evaluate RNApol-II binding to the HIV-1 LTR as well as cellular promoters in the presence of benzotriazole derivatives. We will complement this study with an analysis of STAT5 occupancy across host and HIV genomes. These studies will be complemented with the optimization of benzotriazole derivatives via medicinal chemistry. This will be done in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. Finally, we plan to test the ability of benzotriazole derivatives to reactivate latent HIV-1 in cells isolated from aviremic patients in the presence of different  ?c-cytokines. These studies will set the stage for testing of these compounds in humanized mice during the R33 phase of the grant.  The R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved. The goal of Aim 3 is to mirror a shock and kill strategy in humanized mice, with the following primary goals of (a) establishing a latent HIV reservoir and then to measure changes in HIV transcription upon administration of benzotriazole derivatives found in Aim 1; (b) measuring changes in reservoir size that may result from viral reactivation; and (c) evaluating an effector arm consisting of engineered cytotoxic T lymphocytes."

We promote the continued development of a diverse, multidisciplinary research workforce representing all career stages, by supporting a broad portfolio of NRSA training, mentored career development, content specific educational programs and experiential learning opportunities (Aim 2). These initiatives deepen scientific understanding of clinical and translational science, establish core competencies and advance the knowledge base in good clinical practice, study design, bioethics, conduct of clinical trials and team science. The CCTS supports ethical, scientifically rigorous clinical trials and pilot research across the CCTS Partner Network (Aim 3) through focused efforts to provide resources, specialized services and consultation in genomics, informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, clinical research, advanced imaging and drug discovery. The CCTS fosters the application of best practices, including those established by the CTSA Consortium, and will promote tools that enable the rapid and efficient execution of multi-site clinical trials, taking advantage of the electronic health record to inform feasibility and access to study populations. Importantly, in keeping with our goal of reducing regional health disparities, we recognize the importance of engaging our communities in the planning and conduct of research (Aim 4). Through our community engagement arm ? One Great Community ? we are expanding programmatic outreach by taking successful community-based participatory research approaches to a regional scale. Finally, we understand the importance of evaluating the activities of the CCTS Partner Network to ensure that we are accomplishing our goals (Aim 5).

"9198178","This multi-center VA study of visual function and structure in veterans after mild Traumatic Brain Injury (Palo Alto, Minneapolis and Iowa City VA Medical Centers), will address two main topic areas identified as priorities for the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC): 1) Studies which focus on understanding neurosensory deficits associated with chronic mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and 2) Studies which assess diagnostics and prognostic measures for neural degeneration. The main aims of the grant are to prospectively study visual structural and functional consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the eye and their connections in the brain to determine if progressive worsening occurs and to compare ocular and brain biomarkers of structure and function for diagnosis and prognosis. With this proposal, a more complete picture of the spectrum of visual sensory disturbances after mTBI will be obtained by utilizing more detailed tests of visual function and ocular motility, as well as newer structural analyses of OCT combined with functional MRI imaging of visual pathways in the brain (fMRI) and volume analysis of corresponding grey and white matter locations. We hypothesize that after mild TBI, structural and functional biomarkers of damage are more prevalent than previously appreciated in the eye and corresponding visual centers of the brain, providing the first evidence linking TBI-induced neural degeneration to eye and brain locations. Our second main hypothesis is that mild TBI and repeated episodes can cause a chronic progressive decline in eye and CNS biomarkers of vision in a subset of susceptible veterans. This is based on strong preliminary data from our own studies and that of our collaborators in humans and in established animal models of mild TBI, which show that acute injury initiates visual pathway damage, leading to a chronic, progressive process of neural degeneration. This proposal will have two Specific Aims - 1: Determine whether ocular functional and structural biomarkers after mild TBI significantly correlate with corresponding visual pathway biomarkers in the brain. 2: Determine whether ocular and corresponding location CNS biomarkers progress over time after mild TBI. Currently, it is not known if neuronal loss in the retina and brain after mTBI continues to progress over time. Closing this knowledge gap will be important for understanding and treating TBI-related visual symptoms and for establishing whether ocular biomarkers can be used to predict risk of CNS dysfunction and its progression over time."
"9265306","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nuclear receptor transcription factor PPAR? is an established target for FDA approved drugs for patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These drugs and numerous other known ligands that bind PPAR? increase insulin sensitivity T2DM patients. Most of the PPAR?-binding drugs also display adverse side effects, including increased risk of bone fractures, weight gain, and heart disease. Despite these negative indications, PPAR? remains an important T2DM therapeutic target. Detailed understanding of how ligands affect PPAR? activity may facilitate the development of new drugs with fewer adverse effects. The transcription of PPAR? target genes is affected, in part, by small molecule ligands that bind to its ligand-binding domain (LBD) and change the interaction between PPAR? and coregulator proteins (corepressors and coactivators). In the inactive transcriptionally repressive form, PPAR? is bound to corepressor proteins. Binding of an agonist ligand, including FDA approved drugs that target PPAR?, causes a conformational change that releases corepressors and allows binding of coactivators; this generally results in an increase the expression of PPAR? target genes. While many crystal structures have been reported for PPAR? bound to coactivator peptides and agonist ligands, no structural data has been reported for PPAR? bound to a corepressor. Agonist ligands stabilize the activation function-2 (AF-2) surface, decreasing binding affinity for corepressors while increasing affinity for coactivators. The stabilized AF-2 surface with coactivators likely explains the numerous PPAR? crystal structures bound to coactivator peptides. However, our preliminary data show that a dynamic AF-2 surface, which samples multiple conformations, facilitates corepressor binding. The dynamics of the AF-2 surface when bound to a corepressor may explain why no crystal structure of PPAR? bound to a corepressor has been reported, since the dynamic surface could inhibit crystal formation. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining NMR, biochemical, biophysical and cell- based functional methods we seek to report the first structural understanding of how corepressor proteins bind PPAR?. The connection of PPAR? corepressor binding to functional effects could aid in the design of novel compounds targeting PPAR? with lower unwanted side effects profiles."
"9326554","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Signal transduction by protein kinases controls many aspects of cell development and proliferation. Deregulation of kinases has been linked to many cancers, and kinase inhibitors are an important class of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, most currently available inhibitors are poorly selective (because they target the conserved ATP binding site), and clinical resistance within one year is nearly universal. There is thus an increasing demand for new and more specific kinase inhibitors. The focus of regulation for most Ser/Thr kinases is on the conformational transition between active and autoinhibited states. Each kinase has a unique set of allosteric mediators of this transition, including small molecule ligands, post- translational modifications of the kinase, and protein-protein interactions. Active and autoinhibited states are distinguished by the conformations of a few conserved structural features, including the kinase activation loop. In allosteric activation, according to x-ray crystallography, activation loop residues move several nanometers, unblocking the substrate peptide binding site and positioning a conserved Asp residue for catalysis. Yet, very little is known about how these conformational changes occur in solution and their role in kinase activity because there are currently no real-time assays for the structural state and dynamics of the kinase.  In this proposal, we describe the use of a novel assay determining the conformation of the activation loop of human Aurora A kinase (AurA), a key regulator of mitosis which has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. I use site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate two fluorescent probes into a single AurA molecule, and I then measure the distance between them using the nanometer-scale measurement technique of Frster resonance energy transfer (FRET). I will use this assay, in conjunction with activity assays, point mutation of critical residues, and state-of-the-art time-resolved FRET and kinetics techniques, to define the conformational ensembles and structural elements governing AurA activation (Aim 1). I will also use this assay to characterize and screen AurA allosteric inhibitor drugs using FRET (Aim 2). I will elucidate the binding modes of existing inhibitors and will improve upon currently available high-throughput drug screening methods for allosteric inhibitors which bind specifically outside the kinase active site. We anticipate that our FRET assay will lead to major advances in drug discovery and the understanding of allosteric regulation.  Under this award, I will train for three years as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Minnesota with Dr. Nicholas Levinson, an expert in kinase structural biology, and Dr. David Thomas, an expert in fluorescence spectroscopy and drug discovery methods. Under their dual mentorship, I will develop skills in writing, presenting, and collaboration, as well as laboratory techniques in biophysics, structural biology, and drug development. This training will prepare me to be an independent researcher studying mechanisms of protein allostery and its applications for drug design."
"9244825","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Counter to the model minority stereotype, Asian American (AA) youth show a uniquely mixed pattern of behaviors. They report better academic performance, fewer externalizing problems (e.g., substance use, violence), but more internalizing problems (e.g., depression, suicide) than youth of other racial-ethnic groups. During emerging adulthood, the positive outcomes in AA youth do not seem to hold up, and poor mental health is exacerbated. In fact, the suicide rate among young AA women is alarming, posing a serious public concern. In addition, AA youth subgroups dramatically differ in youth outcomes: some subgroups fare well while others struggle. However, our current knowledge is seriously limited in understanding how parenting and parent-child relations help or hinder youth development among AA youth. The existing family-process model, which is derived mainly from Western conceptualization, does not seem to be adequate to predict health and behavioral outcomes in AA youth. For example, the associations between parenting and youth behaviors among AA youth do not often show a conventional pattern but in fact reveal a paradoxical pattern. Cultures vary in parenting beliefs and behaviors and how they establish parent-child relations. In addition, like all other minority youth, AA youth face acculturation, having to negotiate between parental and mainstream cultures. However, culturally unique aspects of family process and the issue of acculturation are often neglected in the existing parenting research. This study responds to the urgent need for reliable longitudinal data of AA youth, the fastest growing but one of the most understudied and misunderstood populations in the United States. This proposed study aims to formulate a culturally adequate family-process model that incorporates acculturation in family process to accurately explain the complex outcome patterns of AA youth. The study will collect annual longitudinal survey data from Filipino American and Korean American families in the state of Illinois (N=1,960; 350 youth, 350 mothers, and 280 fathers from 350 families with n=980 per group) with the following specific aims: (1) to examine the concurrent and longitudinal associations of family process (parental beliefs, parental behaviors, and parent-child relations) with academic achievement, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems among AA youth, (2) to delineate developmental trajectories and their determinants in family process for the three outcome domains during adolescence and through the transition to young adulthood among AA youth, and (3) to investigate the influences of acculturation on the ways family process is connected to youth outcomes and developmental trajectories among AA youth. The results of this study will guide AA parents to preserve the aspects of their parenting that produce and maintain positive youth behaviors but to modify their parenting or adopt new strategies to prevent serious internalizing problems or worsening of those problems. The results also can guide parents of other race/ethnic groups to adopt AA parenting methods to help maximize their child's potential growth without increasing mental-health problems."
"9385582","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this application is to understand the working mechanism of a supramolecular machinery, termed divisome, in carrying out bacterial cell division. The divisome is composed of more than thirty proteins that are orchestrated to assemble and function at the correct time and space to ensure successful cytokinesis. Understanding key rate-limiting steps in this process and how different proteins coordinate with each other is important to provide potential new antimicrobial targets for treating bacterial infections. In the past a major focus of the field is on the role of the essential component of the divisome, a ring-like structure (Z-ring) formed by the tubulin homolog protein FtsZ, in generating a mechanic force to constrict the membrane actively. The roles of the other two components of the divisome, septal cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machinery and chromosome segregation machinery, are thought to follow the active contraction of Z-ring. Recently accumulating evidence suggests that the Z-ring may not be the main force generator but a key regulator/mediator, and that cell wall synthesis and chromosome segregation machineries have larger roles in driving septum closure than Z-ring contraction.  The project described here will examine this hypothesis using a combination of single-molecule imaging, genetic, biochemical and structural methods. The first Aim is to determine the role of the Z-ring in the spatiotemporal organization of septal PG proteins. The dynamics and organizations in wild-type FtsZ cells will then be compared to those in mutant cells harboring Z-rings with altered structures, dynamics, GTPase activity, and protein-proteins interactions. The second Aim is to determine the role of septal PG synthesis in driving septum closure. Septal PG synthesis will be systematically perturbed using targeted mutations and drug treatments, and the corresponding time-dependent septum closure rate, septal PG incorporation rate, septa morphology and composition will be measured using a variety of single-molecule imaging and biochemical methods. The third Aim is to determine the structural basis responsible for the coordination between chromosome segregation and septum closing. Molecular interfaces between a suite of proteins that interact with each other and anchor the Z-ring to the chromosome will be determined using genetic, biochemical, computational and structural methods.  The expected outcomes of the project are: (1) a high-resolution structural and dynamic model of the full E. coli divisome, (2) a redefined roles and relative contributions of the three major divisome components in cytokinesis, (3) molecular insight into the working mechanism of the divisome as a whole, and (4) a set of innovative imaging- based tools and assays enabling bacterial cell biologists."
"9249647","Abstract  Core C the histopathology core has been an invaluable cost effective asset to the work of the PPG since its  inception. It has provided a wide variety of histological services to PPG investigators including improvements  that maintain the state of the art status of the core. The histology services provided by the Core include tissue  processing, paraffin embedding, sectioning, staining and immunohistochemistry. Core personnel have also  assisted investigators in the collection of animal tissues for histologic studies. New services have come on-line  as they have become commercially available. The Core has a laser capture microscope for tissue  microdissection that was recently upgraded to support immunofluorescence detection. This has been used on  Project III. The Core has also purchased a tissue microarrayer. In addition, the Core provides digital  photomicrographs of selected histologic findings to program investigators. In past years, the Core's histology  services have been used to a varying extent by all of the investigators - except for the old Project I in nonhuman  primates which took advantage of the core in only a minor way because primate center has its own  histology/pathology lab. For the upcoming PPG all three of the projects will use the core services. Dr. Thomas  oversees the program and offers personal advice and assistance as needed. Ms. Gendron is an outstanding  histologist who works day to day with members of the PPG team. She is highly effective. She is especially  adept at getting immunohistology techniques to work. Members of the PPG are allowed to have their tissues  processed at no additional charge to their individual projects. This is financially possible because of our  partnership with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."
"9212421","Child maltreatment is a public health crisis that assaults the most vulnerable in our society. Unfortunately, its victims have not fully benefitted from evidence-driven legislative action to the same extent as other serious public health issues (e.g., smoking, obesity). To increase reliance on child maltreatment research for policy and practice, the field requires a national hub to actively: (1) translate scientific findings, (2) engage end-users, and (3) package key messages into high-impact communication products. The Translational Center for Child Maltreatment Studies' Dissemination and Outreach Core (DOC) will develop such models to serve this role, thus incubating solutions to overcome systemic barriers and accelerating dissemination. DOC Aim 1 is to translate research findings produced by TCCMS investigators into scientific leverage for guiding public investments in child protection. This will involve using unprecedented access to multiple administrative record systems to map the fiscal cost of child maltreatment across service systems. Building on this, the DOC will link Project 1's PA Cohort with administrative records to develop models for predicting downstream public costs (e.g., healthcare, crime social service). With this unique data infrastructure, the DOC will be able to evaluate the return-on-investment from strategies to detect, treat, and prevent child maltreatment?including the Clinical Decision Rule (CDR) for Abusive Head Trauma tested in Project 2. This strategic focus on quantifying public and private costs will frame child maltreatment prevention and treatment as not only a key public health issue, but a matter of fiscal responsibility. DOC Aim 2 will employ a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) Model in two powerful demonstration projects: (1) to devise and test workable solutions that will facilitate implementation of new child welfare laws; and (2) to develop data-driven solutions to reduced caseworker turnover. This model will serve as a national resource for the dissemination of evidence-based tools, and will assist the many states similar to PA where massive child welfare reform has occurred without appropriation of essential resources to assist implementation. Finally, DOC Aim 3 will package the scientific leverage and innovative solutions developed in Aims 1 & 2 into communications that resonate deeply with end- users and policy-makers. This will include a policy brief series to provide empirically-driven guidance around detection, treatment, and prevention of child maltreatment. Through this work, the DOC will provide the foundation of the TCCMS Research-to-Policy Bridge and develop a national model for accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge and strategies for evidence-based policy and practice."
"9226340","Abstract Mindfulness meditation and Real-time Brain Activity in Schizophrenia (MARBAIS). Recent work suggests that mindfulness training is effective to treat schizophrenia. In mindfulness training, meditation takes a central position. However, learning to meditate is not straightforward as no immediate feedback to students is possible as there are no easily discernible outward signs of performance. In addition, a teacher's feedback may inadvertently be confounded, due to e.g. the ability of a student to describe internal states, the teacher's ability to interpret the students' verbal descriptions, or the student's interpretation of the teacher's instructions. A possible solution to this issue would be to provide neurofeedback during meditation, so individuals have an unbiased ?mental mirror? which directly informs them on their meditation quality in real time in an unbiased way. In a proof-of-concept study, we showed that EEG neurofeedback from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) tracks mindfulness meditation quality in healthy novice meditators. However, as patients with schizophrenia suffer from a broad range of symptoms, including cognitive impairment and reduced attentive capabilities, it is currently unclear whether PCC activity and meditation quality are associated in schizophrenia. In the proposed study, Aim 1 will determine whether EEG neurofeedback from the PCC tracks the subjective experience of mindfulness meditation in schizophrenia. To achieve this, 20 patients with schizophrenia will perform a neurofeedback test-battery while performing mindfulness meditation. Aim 2 will determine whether patients with schizophrenia can volitionally modulate EEG neurofeedback from the PCC using mindfulness meditation. In addition, exploratory aim 3 will investigate whether there is an association between the ability to volitionally modulate neurofeedback from the PCC and schizophrenia- related symptomatology. This would be the first study to assess the association between a neurofeedback signal and meditation quality in schizophrenia. If we find that PCC activity tracks with meditation quality and patients are able to volitionally modulate activity by meditating, it would provide the rationale to investigate the efficacy of this non-pharmacological intervention in a randomized clinical trial."
"9335270","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (GWVI) profoundly influence quality of life and functional outcome in many Veterans with a history of deployment to the Persian Gulf Theater. Although elucidation of the precise physiological underpinnings of these complex symptom constellations remain a focus of ongoing scientific inquiry, it is clear that multi-system involvement is one of the hallmarks of GWVI.  There is currently a dearth of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GWVI, and effective new interventions are urgently needed to enhance functional outcomes in Gulf War Veterans and to effectively treat persistent chronic symptoms spanning multiple clinical domains - including pain symptoms, cognitive symptoms, fatigue, and global psychological symptoms. An optimal pharmacological intervention would potentially target all of these functional and clinical domains. The identification of biomarkers for the prediction of therapeutic response to the intervention would also be critical. In addition, a rapid trajectory to therapeutic development and dissemination would be ideal. Compelling preclinical and clinical data suggest that neurosteroid interventions may potentially meet all of these important criteria.  Neurosteroids are endogenous molecules that are enriched in human brain and synthesized de novo from cholesterol in the central nervous system (CNS). Neurosteroids have pleiotropic actions that are potentially relevant to multiple functional and clinical domains in GWVI - including analgesic actions, anti-inflammatory  effects, enhancement of learning and memory in rodent models (and associations with cognitive  improvements in pilot clinical studies), neurotrophic and antidepressant properties, neurogenesis-promoting  effects, and pronounced neuroprotective actions. Because neurosteroids such as pregnenolone are available over-the-counter as dietary supplements in the United States, their translation to clinical therapeutics is potentially very rapid. For example, we have conducted pilot RCTs in Veteran cohorts and hold FDA Investigational New Drug numbers for the use of neurosteroids in traumatic brain injury [TBI] (FDA IND #78,270) and psychotic disorders (FDA IND #71,768). Our preliminary data also support the possibility that neurosteroids may be predictors of therapeutic response. We thus hypothesize that a neurosteroid intervention with pleiotropic actions could be advantageous for the diverse clinical manifestations in GWVI. We therefore propose an RCT with a neurosteroid intervention in Gulf War Veterans with a history of deployment and symptoms of GWVI. We also propose to conduct neurosteroid biomarker investigations by mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolic profile of pregnenolone, to obtain valuable pharmacokinetic data, and to identify possible windows of optimal therapeutic efficacy and potential neurosteroid predictors of clinical response.  Specific Aim 1: To conduct an RCT with the neurosteroid pregnenolone in 140 Gulf War Veterans with  GWVI and a history of deployment (70 Veterans randomized to adjunctive pregnenolone, 70 Veterans  randomized to placebo), targeting functional outcome as the primary endpoint as assessed by the SF-36.  Based on our preliminary data with neurosteroid interventions, secondary endpoints will be pain symptoms, cognitive symptoms, fatigue, and global psychological functioning.  Specific Aim 2: To conduct candidate biomarker investigations quantifying pregnenolone and  pregnenolone metabolite levels (allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, androsterone, others) at baseline, during  treatment, and post-treatment with pregnenolone using mass spectrometry-based methodologies in order  to: a.) characterize the pharmacokinetics of pregnenolone and its metabolic profile - which could yield  valuable dosing information and identify pharmacological windows of optimal therapeutic efficacy, and b.) identify potential neurosteroid predictors of therapeutic response, which could lead to the development of  new neurosteroid interventional strategies that build on the current investigation and exhibit promise as  pharmacological candidates in GWVI."
"9390009","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of eye disease is critical for preventing vision loss that affects more than 38 million Americans. Current diagnostic tools often reveal retinal changes only after vision loss has already occurred. Tests of visual function are limited by their subjectivity, and by the pooling of signals from tens to thousands of retinal cells. Tests of retinal structure are limited by the substantial anatomical variation among individuals, which makes early disease detection impossible without baseline measurements. In most cases structural tests can therefore detect only macroscopic changes that follow major cell death. These limitations could be overcome by a non-invasive method to detect chemical changes that precede cell death. For this purpose, we will develop two novel technologies, adaptive longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) correction and axially- resolved hyperspectral retinal imaging. These will be demonstrated in combination with ophthalmic adaptive optics, to characterize the spectra of idiopathic epiretinal membranes, with or without associated retinal traction or macular hole, as well as age-related macular degeneration and central serous retinopathy."
"9281899","PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally, and in the US, where one-quarter of COPD occurs in non-smokers. Non-smokers represent 50% of the US population over 50 years old, but have been excluded from major COPD studies. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Lung Study, we recently demonstrated that variant airway anatomy was common and associated with higher COPD prevalence. Findings were consistent among smokers and non- smokers but underpowered in the latter group. The current application would define the clinical significance of variant airway anatomy among non-smokers for COPD and respiratory symptoms, and for incident COPD and lung function decline over 10 years. Hypothesis 1: Variant airway anatomy is independently associated with COPD and respiratory symptoms cross-sectionally among 2,635 non-smokers and with incident COPD and decline in lung function among 2,000 non-smokers followed for a median of 10 years. Preliminary computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling suggests that variant airway anatomy may alter airway resistance and particulate matter transit to the distal airways. Additional pilot work suggests that these proximal airway variants may be markers of altered airway branching through the lung, suggesting a global increase in airway resistance with the variant applying to non-smokers. The current application would test if these mechanisms apply differentially to non-smokers and smokers to facilitate personalization of risk and care for COPD. Hypothesis 2: Mechanisms of COPD risk differ by common airway variant among non-smokers and smokers: 2a The accessory segmental airway variant, which is associated with increased risk among non- smokers, reduces regional airflow in a CFD model of participant-specific geometry, whereas the absent segmental airway variant, associated with increased risk among smokers, increases particulate transfer to the distal lung. 2b The accessory segmental airway variant is associated with globally altered airway branching, whereas the absent segmental airway variant represents lobe-specific altered airway branching. Airway anatomy has developmental origins and may provide a refined phenotype (compared to lung function) for genetic investigation. Preliminary analysis by the PI identified genetic variants in fibroblast growth factor 10, a gene implicated in airway development, to be associated with variant airway anatomy. The proposed study will increase the sample size 5-fold to perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of variant human airway anatomy, with replication in an independent sample. Hypothesis 3: GWAS will discover genetic variants underlying the common airway variants, with replication in an independent sample. The current application represents the largest structure-function evaluation of COPD among non-smokers; and will test developmental and biological hypotheses to identify novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for this understudied but majority subgroup of the US population."
"9440750","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere length is associated with longevity and with the risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease cancers. The relative ranking of a person's telomere length is largely determined at birth and subsequent telomeric erosion may be exacerbated by environmental factors which induce oxidative damage to the genome. This makes telomere length a prime mechanistic candidate to explain some of the observations of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD), which connects perinatal events with long-term chronic disease susceptibility. Augmented telomere length at birth may have far-reaching implications with respect to overall health and chronic disease susceptibility throughout the life course. The prenatal period from conception to birth is of particular interest since it isthe phase of life marked by the most rapid physical growth and thus accelerated mitotic proliferation of cells. This may make the terminal restriction fragments particularly vulnerable to adverse intrauterine conditions. Surprisingly, few studies have considered the relevance of intrauterine conditions on telomere length. Specifically, hormonal factors have been implicated to play a role in the erosion of the terminal restriction fragments, suggesting that intrauterine exposure to endocrine- disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may disrupt hormonal signaling and telomere development. The impact of prenatal EDC exposure on telomere length has not previously been studied. We therefore propose to determine if maternal first trimester urinary phenol and phthalates levels are associated with telomere length of the offspring at birth using samples from the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, in Boston."

"9455075","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancers of the breast are the second most common type of breast cancers (after invasive ductal carcinoma, IDC) and account for 10-15% of all breast cancers. More than any other breast cancer, lobular cancers present as multifocal, multicentric and bilateral disease. Among histological types, re- excision rates are highest (28.3%) for invasive lobular carcinoma and substantially more than invasive ductal carcinoma (19.1%). For subjects diagnosed with lobular carcinoma, breast MRI is currently the preferred modality for evaluating disease extent as ultrasound and mammography have been shown to be inferior in accurately estimating tumor size. Meta-analysis of pooled data have shown that breast MRI has a sensitivity of 93.3% for detecting lobular carcinoma with additional lesions detected in 32% and 7% of patients in the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts, respectively. However, for approximately 25% to 35% of tumors, the size estimated from breast MRI differs from pathology by more than 1 cm. The use of pre-operative breast MRI for evaluating disease extent has been associated with increased odds for mastectomy. A recent study analyzing 243 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) concluded that ILC can be safely treated with conservative surgery but a more accurate preoperative evaluation of tumor size and multifocality is needed to reduce re-excision rate. We hypothesize the high spatial resolution 3D imaging provided by dedicated breast CT that is capable of resolving features in the 200 to 250 microns range would improve the proportion of tumors that are concordant in size with histopathology and hence would increase the likelihood of subjects being treated with breast conserving surgery. Dedicated breast CT does not require physical compression of the breast and takes 10 seconds for a scan. This prospective clinical study is designed to address if all foci observed with contrast-enhanced breast MRI are also visible with contrast-enhanced breast CT (sensitivity) and if the tumor size determined from breast CT is more concordant with pathology than breast MRI. The study will also investigate two automated segmentation and tumor size quantification methods to determine, which quantitative algorithm is more accurate, with tumor size from surgical pathology serving as reference standard. Thus, the proposed study challenges existing paradigms on the accuracy of tumor size measurements and paves for the way for reducing mastectomy rates."
"9253409","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the mechanisms and transition states of phosphoryl transfer enzymes is important for understanding biological catalysis as well as facilitating the design of novel catalysts and supporting the development of enzyme inhibitors as potential drugs. In solution these reactions can occur by several different mechanisms with characteristic transition states. Transition state protonation, nucleophile and leaving group bonding and overall charge distribution are highly sensitive to the same catalytic modes (electrostatic stabilization, Bronsted acid/base, Lewis acid/base) that are proposed in models of catalysis by phosphoryl transferases. These insights strongly underscore the importance of addressing long standing unanswered questions in the field of biological catalysis: How do the catalytic modes employed by enzymes alter transition state charge distribution? Do enzymes with different active site geometries (isoenzymes) stabilize different transition states? Can differences in transition state structure facilitate the development of competitive inhibitors as potential drugs? Answering these questions will require a mechanistic framework grounded in theory and experiment for solution reactions, and the ability to apply this framework in structure-function studies to determine the transition states and catalytic modes for representative phosphoryl transfer enzymes.  A powerful approach to understand enzyme mechanism is by analyzing kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), which measure the differences in ground state and transition state bonding, and integrating this information with molecular and quantum mechanical simulations to evaluate specific mechanistic scenarios and focus experimental efforts. Until now, technical barriers prohibited application of this powerful approach to reaction involving native RNA oligonucleotide substrates of ribozymes and protein phosphoryl transfer enzymes, leaving the questions highlighted above unanswered for an important enzyme class. Now, having established methods for KIE analyses RNA and nucleotide reactions, we using an integrated approach of theory and experiment to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of phosphoryl transfer enzymes. The impact of these experiments is amplified by collaboration with Dr. Joseph Piccirilli (U Chicago) and Dr. Darrin York (Rutgers) who provide complementary technical strengths and importantly contribute independent intellectual perspectives. Our combined efforts are directed at providing new insights into how the active site environments of enzymes act to stabilize reaction transition states. The information gained will shed new light on the interplay between active site chemistry and chemical mechanism, which will significantly impact our understanding of biological catalysis and broadly support advances in design of new catalysts and discovery of inhibitors with potential therapeutic application."

Hospital laboratories routinely perform Gram stain, glucose/protein levels, cell count, and bacterial culture (where media/reagents are available) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via lumbar puncture from patients with AFI. This study would look for pathogens by using ELISA based serological tests and subject the specimen to a battery of other tests to lead to pathogen detection.        In our study, clinical samples will be tested for a variety of etiologies associated with AFI such as, Bacterial pathogens (Leptospira, Salmonella, Brucella, Lyme borrelia, S. pneumoniae, H.influenzae, N. meningitidis, Shigella, Campylobacter etc.  ), Rickettsial group of organisms (Scrub typhus, Spotted fever group, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma etc.) and Viruses ( KFD, Dengue, Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile Virus, Chikungunya virus, Tick borne Encephalitis virus, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Coronaviruses, Enteroviruses, Diarrhoeagenic viruses etc.) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analyses of patient blood, CSF, Throat swab and Stool samples will be used to identify additional pathogens known to cause Acute febrile illness. Clinical samples also will be tested for unknown pathogens using PCR- sequence based pathogen discovery techniques."
"9325994","Project Summary  Most traits that differ between males and females arise from differential expression of shared genes. Despite the ubiquity of sex-biased expression, we still lack an understanding of both the mechanisms that cause sex-specific gene regulation and the process by which male and female expression becomes uncoupled. These questions have fundamental health implications, as sex-biased diseases such as autoimmune disorders and drug responses show significant genotype-sex interactions. My research will establish how sex-specific gene expression originates by studying a female-limited color dimorphism (FCD) in Drosophila serrata, a species where females have two color morphs (light or dark) but males have only one color morph (only light). Identifying the female dimorphic element and how it functions will provide a useful counterpoint to studies of male-limited pigmentation, enabling me to determine if alleles evolve female- and male-specificity by the same rules. Last year, I mapped female pigmentation to a non-coding structural variant (SV) in the first intron of POU domain motif 3 (pdm3), a transcription factor that I showed represses dark pigmentation. At this variant, dark females have an allele that is radically divergent in size and sequence from the light allele, suggesting that the SV harbors a cis-regulatory element that directs female- and morph-specific pigmentation. Using transgenic experiments, I have confirmed that the sequences flanking the SV function as tissue-specific regulatory elements. In this proposal, I will (1) determine how the D. serrata SV affects pdm3 expression in a binary manner, (2) identify if this SV is regulated sex-specifically because it is controlled by doublesex (the main sex determination effector in Drosophila), and (3) test the necessity and sufficiency of this SV in the origin of FCD using genome editing. This in-depth analysis of a female-specific regulatory element in an experimentally tractable Drosophila model will improve our understanding of how sexual differences arise, and provide a framework for research in other organisms including humans. In particular, this work will inform the design of genetic studies aimed at identifying human alleles that contribute to sex-biased diseases."
"9256413","PROJECT 2 LAGIER TOURENNE ABSTRACT RNA processing alterations are increasingly recognized to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases including two devastating neurodegenerative conditions, frontal temporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The seminal discovery in 2011 of a hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf72 gene as the most common cause of familial FTD and ALS significantly changed our perspective of these neurodegenerative diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms of this expansion are not understood, however, with initial observations pointing to either a loss of function of the endogenous C9orf72 gene or an RNA toxicity mechanism. The later, initially described in other repeat-expansion diseases, corresponds to the sequestration of one or more RNA binding protein(s) by expanded RNAs leading to broad misregulation of RNA processing. In this project, we will characterize mice modeling either a loss of C9orf72 function or a toxic gain of function to unravel the relative contributions of each mechanism and identify animal models strongly needed by the community to tackle FTD and ALS. In a second approach, we will use state of the art methods in sequencing to obtain an unbiased RNA profile in these model mice and in post-mortem tissues from ALS and FTD patients. Defining a set of RNA alterations that delineate a disease-dependent molecular signature is an important step toward the development of therapeutic strategies. In particular, the combination of the proposed approaches will provide crucial information to evaluate the safety and pertinence of a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce C9orf72 expression using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that induce degradation of RNAs carrying the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion."
"9251229","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that is activated following Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Genetic variants in IRF5 hav been robustly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility in both genome-wide and candidate gene association studies. While IRF5 is strongly and consistently associated with SLE, the mechanisms by which IRF5 predisposes to human SLE are still unclear. Our central hypothesis is that SLE-associated variants in IRF5 promote autoantibody formation and alter transcriptional patterns in human immune cells following TLR ligation, resulting in risk of SLE. We have previously shown that SLE-risk haplotypes of IRF5 are associated with autoantibody formation in both SLE patients and healthy autoantibody positive individuals. The HLA locus is strongly associated with SLE, and the MHC molecules encoded by this locus can direct the immune response against particular self-antigens. We propose that SLE-associated variants in MHC molecules present self-peptides derived from particular nuclear antigens, and then IRF5 variants cooperate in autoantibody production by enhancing activation of self-reactive B-cells directed against these antigens. In our preliminary data, we support this concept with evidence for a strong gene-gene interaction between IRF5 and HLA upon autoantibody formation in SLE patients (OR=3.42). IRF5 is a transcription factor, and it seems likely that risk variants should influence SLE risk by altering transcriptional profiles in immune cells. In preliminary data, we show that IRF5 risk variants result in differential binding to ISRE promoter elements in human cell lines. IRF5 translocation to the nucleus was greatly augmented in SLE patient monocytes, while little increased translocation was observed in NK and T cell lineages. These data support an important role for IRF5 variations in human monocytes. We have two Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define gene-gene interactions between HLA haplotypes and IRF5 genetic variants upon autoantibody traits in human populations. We will genotype 1500 SLE patients at the IRF5 and HLA loci to examine IRF5-HLA gene-gene interactions upon autoantibody traits. Additionally, we will study a unique cohort of individuals with SLE-associated autoantibodies who have a range of diagnoses, including asymptomatic people who are at risk of progression to SLE. Aim 2: Determine changes in transcriptional targeting of the IRF5 SLE-risk variants in monocytes and B cells from SLE patients, autoantibody positive asymptomatic subjects, and healthy controls. We will purify cells from the two lineages noted above from subjects homozygous for risk or protective haplotypes of IRF5. Cells will be stimulated with TLR7 or TLR9 ligands. ChIP-seq will be performed, and peaks will be compared between genotype categories and between patient groups. Our long-term goal is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of human SLE, so that diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can be informed by the molecular biology of disease in a given individual. We will make progress toward this goal via the following expected outcomes: 1. Identify robust IRF5-HLA interactions that contribute to the break in tolerance to nuclear antigens observed in autoimmune disease and 2. Define transcriptional targets of IRF5 that are characteristic of the SLE-risk haplotypes and determine how these transcriptional patterns are associated with varying degrees and stages of autoimmunity in human populations (healthy, asymptomatic seropositive, and SLE)."
"9225927","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Up to 15% of the population has hypomagnesemia which is associated with a higher risk of developing common disorders like diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. Urinary Mg2+ losses contribute to hypomagnesemia, but knowledge about renal Mg2+ homeostasis is very limited. This proposal seeks to improve our understanding of renal Mg2+ homeostasis. The major organ for regulated Mg2+ reabsorption is the kidney. The final urinary Mg2+ concentration is determined by the epithelial Mg2+ channel TRPM6 in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Uromodulin (Umod) is a possible new modifier of renal Mg2+ handling as Umod gene expression is increased in hypomagnesemic mice. Our preliminary data confirm urinary Mg2+ wasting in Umod knock-out (Umod-/-) mice. In addition, we found increased TRPM6 whole-cell current density and TRPM6 cell surface abundance with UMOD expression. Our overall objective of this application is to study the effect of the urinary protein UMOD regarding the regulation of the Mg2+ channel TRPM6. Our preliminary results raise a novel hypothesis that UMOD, secreted from TAL, upregulates TRPM6 activity in the DCT from the luminal side by impairing TRPM6 endocytosis, thereby increasing channel cell surface abundance and so enhancing tubular Mg2+ reabsorption. We hypothesize that in low Mg2+ conditions, tubular UMOD secretion increases which then enhances renal Mg2+ reabsorption via TRPM6 to mitigate Mg2+ losses. In aim 1, we will test this hypothesis in vitro by analyzing the mechanism by which extracellular UMOD regulates TRPM6 activity. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and protein biochemistry in cultured cell expression systems, we will test if UMOD increases TRPM6 cell surface abundance by impairing TRPM6 endocytosis and examine which UMOD domains are required for TRPM6 regulation. In aim 2, we will test the role of UMOD regarding renal Mg2+ handling in vivo. We will examine by immunofluorescent imaging if urinary Mg2+ wasting in Umod-/- mice is due to decreased apical TRPM6 expression. To study if UMOD is part of a renal feedback mechanism responding to systemic Mg2+ changes, we will analyze the response of wild-type and Umod-/- mice challenged with normal, low and high Mg2+ diets. Given our experience in ion channel physiology, mouse physiology, TRP channels and UMOD, we are very well equipped to perform this study. The contribution of this work will be significant as renal Mg2+ regulation by a urinary protein represents a novel concept. We expect a positive translational impact of this project, as the proposed feedback mechanism targeting systemic Mg2+ homeostasis may provide a novel explanation for a predisposition for urinary Mg2+ wasting. As UMOD polymorphisms affect urinary UMOD secretion, we will test in a future R01 application in a human cohort if UMOD polymorphisms contribute to urinary Mg2+ wasting by decreased UMOD secretion and if these UMOD polymorphisms are associated with common disorders. We hypothesize that specific UMOD polymorphisms reduce an individual?s adaptability to adjust to low Mg2+ conditions which could provide a link between hypomagnesemia and common disorders."
"9306553","The purpose of this study is to determine mechanisms by which internal states generate variability in behavior. According to the NIMH, behavior changes account for almost 40% of the risk associated with preventable premature deaths in the United States. Despite the importance, it is extremely difficult to identify neurons in the brain that control behaviors and generate variations associated with different states. This has hindered the field?s progress in understanding mechanisms of how neuron activities are altered and influence behavior patterns. In order to advance the field, an experimentally tractable platform is required that can identify specific sets of behavior regulating neurons and allow us to study how their activities change in different states. Understanding how the neurons function normally will allow us to study the neural underpinnings of altered behavior. My preliminary data indicates internal states like the ovarian cycle sensitizes such well defined sets of olfactory sensory neurons. This has a Boolean effect on behavior: only when these neurons are sensitized, can the female initiate social behavior whereas when the neurons are silent, she displays no response. It has been thought the function of the olfactory system is to detect environmental cues and relay all the information indiscriminately to the brain. However, my data shows the olfactory neurons are bifunctional and detect internal ligands such as hormones that surge at various points in the reproductive cycle. The neurons integrate the external and internal chemical signals and relay to the brain such information that is relevant to the specific state the individual is in. To study this unexpected new function of the olfactory neurons my aims will 1) identify the hormone receptors on the olfactory neurons that detect ovarian hormones and 2) determine the mechanisms by which neuron sensitization occurs. The olfactory system provides a simple experimental platform with easily accessible neurons that can be studied using straightforward molecular and genetic tools. Completion of these aims will open new horizons to examine the breadth of functions performed by the olfactory system. The results of this study will provide a molecular blueprint to investigate how internal states affect the more complex brain. I anticipate the findings will bring new knowledge on how the sensory system works in tandem with the brain to generate differences in behavior."
"9452620","DESCRIPTION: There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which occurs frequently in HIV+ patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) treated with antiretroviral medications. This poses a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic conundrum, since neurological deterioration associated with inflammation in PML-IRIS cannot be differentiated from the demyelination occurring with the natural evolution of PML. In addition, a growing number of PML patients are developing seizures, thought to originate in the cerebral cortex. How PML, a disease affecting predominantly the CNS white mater triggers seizures is unknown. Our long term goal is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of PML-IRIS, and the cause of epileptogenesis in PML and its association with IRIS. Our objective is to establish precise criteria to diagnose and track IRIS and predict the development of seizures in PML, which can then be used for preventive and therapeutic purposes. We have shown that the T-cell response to the causative agent of PML, JC virus (JCV), was associated with PML survival. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, we have defined differences in the metabolism and perfusion of PML lesions with and without IRIS. Finally, we have identified a novel MRI marker associated with seizures and IRIS. This hyperintense cortical signal (HCS) can be seen on pre- contrast T1-weighted images in cortical gray matter adjacent to PML lesions. We hypothesize that hyperperfusion seen in PML progressors delineates virologically active lesions and is triggered by local production of nitric oxide (NO). We postulate that HCS is caused by an infiltrate of macrophages and astrogliosis in deep layers of the cerebral cortex affected by JCV demyelination, and constitutes the nidus of epileptogenesis in PML. We propose that IRIS is caused by an imbalance between Th1, Th2 and Th17 immune responses. The rationale for the proposed research is that a combination of immunological, neuroradiological and electrophysiological parameters will predict the development of IRIS and seizures in PML, and directly help in the management of these challenging patients. To test these hypotheses, we will pursue the following set of Specific Aims: 1) Characterize immunological and radiological determinants of inflammation and outcome in PML patients with and without IRIS. We will study JCV-specific T-cell responses, MRI, 1H- MRS and perfusion MRI to define further the mechanisms of IRIS and identify surrogate markers of PML progression and survival. 2) Analyze the role of IRIS in PML-associated epileptogenesis. We will determine prospectively the value of HCS and of dense array electroencephalographic findings as predictive markers of IRIS and seizures in PML. 3) Decipher the histopathological substrates of PML progression, epileptogenesis and IRIS. We will characterize histologically the pathogenic mechanisms leading to HCS, hyperperfusion and IRIS. Our multifaceted innovative approach will have direct impact on the management of patients with PML-IRIS and seizures. The knowledge gained will greatly advance the fields of Neuroradiology, Immunology and Epileptology."
"9260030","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To be able to establish, maintain, and exit from the pluripotent state, embryonic stem cells require dynamic and precise coordination of their molecular machinery. Significant headway has been made in elucidating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and non-coding RNA-driven post-transcriptional mechanisms that govern this unique state, but far less is known about the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that directly enable the post- transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression, despite evidence of their dominant role in shaping the molecular landscape of ESCs. The overall goal of the proposed project is to define the functions of a specific RBP in pluripotency. To this end, I conducted an RNAi screen of 356 putative RBPs in an assay tracking the differentiation of ESCs to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), a progression that represents the first cell fate decision made in the embryo proper. Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (Ilf2) was identified as a candidate RBP whose knockdown promoted differentiation to the EpiLC state. Ilf2 is a remarkable protein, because it appears to participate in many different molecular processes extending across transcription, splicing, translation, and miRNA biogenesis. While there is circumstantial evidence that Ilf2 is involved in pluripotency, it is unknown where in the spokes of the pluripotency network Ilf2 is situated. I hypothesize that Ilf2 controls the expression pattern f a core set of ESC-specific target genes through simultaneous participation in multiple regulatory layers, and the combination of these activities promotes the pluripotent state. Ilf2-/- and wild-type (wt) ESCs will be compared to determine the validity of this hypothesis. Specifically, Aim 1 will characterize the effects of Ilf2 loss on ability of ESCs to self-renew and differentiate. Aim  will determine whether Ilf2 directly affects transcription, transcript stability, and translation i ESCs. Finally, Aim 3 will assess the role of Ilf2 in the miRNA regulation of ESCs. Addressing these aims will not only increase appreciation of the scope of RBP involvement in pluripotency but also enable the more informed use of ESCs as an in vitro platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, and tissue regeneration. This research project is also designed to promote my development as a future physician-scientist and educator capable of leading an independent research lab. The multidisciplinary skills needed to achieve the proposed aims will provide me solid training in both wet lab techniques and computational methods. My training will also include coursework in developmental biology, bioinformatics, ethics, and medicine. Additionally, I will gain experience in pedagogy by mentoring high school, undergraduate, graduate, and medical students."
"9262121","Glucose metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of cognitive disability in the United States. It affects over 5 million Americans at annual cost in excess of $150 billion. Despite the human suffering and financial burden, there are no proven therapies to stem progression of the disease. Members of this program project have provided support for the notion that alterations in brain glucose metabolism are not only highly correlated with cognitive decline in AD, but can precede symptom onset by years in those at risk. The ability of normal function to be maintained in those with diminished glucose suggests the existence of compensatory mechanisms which forestall the disease but fail over the long term. This proposal will explore the interplay of those adaptive compensatory mechanisms and the maladaptive ones that lead to cognitive decline over the long term. In preliminary studies, we have unexpectedly found that lowering glucose uptake into cultured neurons or into the hippocampus in vivo enhances activity-dependent gene expression but increases vulnerability to oxidative stress. Our overall hypothesis is that diminished glucose into neurons early in AD preserves learning and memory but creates long term vulnerability to oxidative stress and A-beta overproduction. We believe that diminished glucose leads to near term improvements in synaptic function via the deglycosylation of transcription factors, specifically CREB. Deglycosylation at serine 40 leads to recruitment of the coactivator TORC (transducer of regulated CREB), and induction of genes associated with learning and memory (CREB, BDNF) as well as mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1?). Our aims, which integrate with all members of the PPG using differentiated human cortical neurons (Project 2) or an AD mouse model (TG19959, Projects, 3 and 4) are targeted at developing strategies to maintain the short term, beneficial effects of glucose deprivation on learning and memory while interdicting the ability of this enzyme to trigger oxidative death and increased A? production over the long term. In our last aim, we will use a novel reporter of the redox regulated transcription factor, Nrf-2 expressed in astrocytes as a strategy to identify when redox dyshomeostasis occurs in the TG19959 model of AD. We will also use this reporter to develop, with Project 4, a safer and more effective approach using an FDA approved Nrf-2 activator in combination with an FDA approved antioxidant which we predict will nullify oxidative stress while maintaining adaptive plasticity associated gene expression.Together these studies will evaluate novel targets and therapies for optimizing the adaptive effects of reducing glucose into neurons on learning and memory while minimizing deleterious consequences related to oxidative stress and bioenergetic dysfunction.

"9263340","CORE B ? SUMMARY Wide deployment of malaria control tools in the past decade has significantly contributed to substantial reduction of the incidence and deaths related to the disease in Sub-Sahara Africa. Yet, the region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden of malaria deaths. Moreover, incidence remains high but stable in some settings while rebounding in others after a long period of decrease associated with intensive deployment of malaria control tools. The Overall goal of this ICEMR is to understand the variable effectiveness of current malaria control interventions in different ecological settings of West Africa through research to understand interactions between the parasite (response to drug treatment, genotypes, gametocyte survival), human (immune response and host genetics) and the vector (ecology, behaviors, and response to insecticides) and regulating influences of the local environment and human behavior. The goal of the Data Management and Biostatistics (DMB) Core is to provide data management and biostatistical support to the ICEMR investigators of Mali in order to produce reliable and high quality research data and data analysis.

"9257453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) is prevalent in Africa and the African diaspora, including the United States. Especially severe forms of FGMC may harm the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls. Despite a range of interventions, declines in prevalence are slow, potentially due to under- studied contextual factors. Aim: The aim of this project is to understand how community norms disfavoring FGMC and extra-marital opportunities for women may be directly associated with a girl's lower risk of FGMC and may condition the influence of maternal attitudes on the decision to cut a daughter. Data: The Demo- graphic and Health Surveys (DHS) are the main existing source of nationally representative data on FGMC. We propose to analyze DHS data from nine countries spanning West, North, Central, and East Africa: Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Gambia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, and Nigeria. Countries vary in current prevalence of FGMC, forms of cutting, age at which FGMC usually occurs, and legal context for the practice. Sample countries were chosen based on the availability of DHS data since 2008 and appropriate measures from women and their daughters. The main sample for all surveys is women of reproductive age (15-49 y), who provide direct reports of their own experience with FGMC, including type and timing; experiences of FGMC among any daughters; and views about FGMC. Sample sizes of women are 9,142 - 38,948 across countries. We will analyze FGMC among daughters age 15 y or younger. Method: We will estimate multilevel event history models for each country to test the associations of community FGMC norms and women's extra-marital opportunities with a daughter's risk of experiencing FGMC. We also will test whether these community attributes moderate the effect of a mother's FGMC attitudes on the decision to cut a daughter. We will integrate the results of country-specific models to understand cross-national variation in FGMC, accounting for parent- /household- and community-level factors and to estimate variance in the effects of these factors across countries. We will adopt a Bayesian approach to assess the prospects of generalizing from our nine countries to African contexts. Innovation: Attention to the community influences on FGMC across countries in Africa is a key innovation of our project. We offer an integrated theory for the relevance of community FGMC norms and extra-marital opportunities for women. We propose rigorous multilevel methods to assess the direct influences of these community factors on the risk that a daughter is cut, and their moderating influence on the relationship of a mother's attitudes and FGMC status on the risk that her daughter is cut. Because we have rich, comparable data on FGMC for 9 countries in Africa, we also can assess whether national context accounts for additional variance in a daughter's risk of FGMC. Impact: This is the first rigorous, comparative study of the multilevel determinants of FGMC, offering unique evidence to inform national and cross-national decisions about promising social policies and community interventions to further the abandonment of FGMC in Africa."
"9249642","Project I will study the role of adenosine in coordinating fetal coronary vascular growth and myocyte function  during conditions of hypoxemia in the heart, as well as the long-term consequences of altered adenosine  signaling in fetal life upon cardiac function in the adult. Studies using a model of fetal anemia to study fetal  hypoxemia have shown that fetal adaptations for survival include a 30% increase in heart to body weight ratio,  a 50% increase in stroke volume and cardiac output, a 6-fold increase in coronary blood flow and a doubling of  coronary conductance with preservation of coronary reserve. This occurs in the face of a fall in fetal systemic  arterial blood pressure and vascular resistance. Changes include an increase in myocardial HIF-1a and VEGF,  and an increase in cardiac capillary volume density in both ventricles. Ventricular remodeling occurs with both  myocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy as eccentric hypertrophy normalizes wall tension. The vascular remodeling changes found in the fetus persist in the adult, and lead to greater myocardial damage following ischemia/reperfusion. A critical link between fetal environment and adult disease that is missing is the step that  coordinates fetal myocyte and vascular growth and function. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that intracellular adenosine signaling regulates fetal coronary vascular growth and cardiomyocyte function in fetal hypoxemia. In Aim 2, we will study the in vivo and in vitro role of intracellular MAP kinase (also called extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or ERK) signaling on adenosine-stimulated fetal coronary growth and myocardial function. In Aim 3 we will determine the long-term consequences of either reduced or increased fetal adenosine receptor signaling upon coronary conductance and myocardial function in adulthood with the use of adenosine receptor specific agonists/antagonists."
"9250060","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline and dementia have become important public health issues in our time as medical science has increased lifespan and our society becomes progressively older. A great deal of the cognitive decline due to aging can be explained by decline in working memory (WM), a mental function central to cognition in which aging deficits appear almost universally. Attempts to use WM training to increase WM ability in older adults has had some success, but the transfer of performance enhancements caused by this training to other cognitive skills is controversial. Another intervention that shows much promise is noninvasive stimulation of cerebral cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has been shown to increase performance in many cognitive tasks. In previous work we developed a paradigm using fMRI-guided TMS in which we identified a cortical network sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation and to WM and targeted it with TMS, almost completely remediating the deficits in WM performance caused by the sleep deprivation, and whose effects outlasted TMS stimulation by at least a day. We then applied this paradigm to healthy young and older adults, to assess the effects of aging on WM. Stimulation to the left lateral occipital complex, a region involved in the maintenance of visual information, enhanced WM performance in both young and older groups. Here we propose to use our fMRI-guided TMS enhancement paradigm to stimulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region involved not only in the maintenance of items in WM, but also in their manipulation, in order to create WM performance enhancements that will be long lasting and that will transfer to other cognitive tasks as well. This will be achieved through three studies. In the first we will stimulat both old and young healthy adults while they perform different WM tasks that will increasingly engage DLPFC in order to demonstrate enhancement of WM performance that is greater in the older adults. In the second and third studies, older adults will receive active or sham TMS over two weeks of daily sessions while they perform the WM tasks. In the second study, we hope to demonstrate that the cumulative effect of multiple TMS sessions, in tandem with the synergistic effects of simultaneous TMS + WM training, create WM performance enhancements greater than those found with WM training alone, whose effects are long-lasting, continuing a month following the course of TMS sessions. In the third, we will investigate whether the WM enhancements generated by the two- weeks of TMS sessions will generalize to other cognitive tasks. Success of these studies will provide proof in principle for long-lasting, transferable effects of TMS in remediating WM and more general cognitive deficits due to aging, and point to a possible non-invasive brain stimulation therapy for cognitive decline in healthy aging and in dementia."
"9346907","ABSTRACT Talee Bio is developing a gene therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), the first curative treatment for this disease. CF is an autosomal recessive disease involving any of a number of mutations to the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a membrane channel that influences the composition of mucous secretions in the gut and respiratory tract. CF is primarily characterized by progressive airway infection and inflammation, and, in the majority of individuals, death from respiratory failure. The standard of care for CF includes therapies that address symptoms of the disease (such as bronchodilators, mucolytics, and antibiotics), and those that attempt to modulate the activity of defective (mutated) CFTR. However, none of these treatments are curative. Talee has developed a novel transgene and a number of innovations in a well- characterized delivery vector that collectively will overcome challenges that have previously limited the clinical viability of gene therapy for CF. In this phase 1 proposal, Talee will demonstrate the feasibility of its approach by demonstrating functional transformation of human CF cells in vitro, and the transduction efficiency and distribution of a marker transgene delivered with its proprietary vector. If successful, this work will pave the way to future development in animal models of CF and for safety and PKPD studies (in Phase 2) that will inform a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. Talee Bio is a collaboration among drug development professionals with more than 60 years of combined experience, and academic founders of the company, from the University of Iowa, who have been investigating CF pathogenesis and treatment, including gene therapy strategies, for more than 25 years."
"9288229","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) the proposed research will evaluate the efficacy of two culturally-tailored technology- mediated disease prevention interventions for supporting change in multiple risk behaviors in rural Alaska Native (AN) men and women. Directly informed by the research team's fieldwork over the past 6 years in rural Alaska, continued community partnership with the tribes, and ethnographic research, the interventions will be tailored to AN health needs and values to target 5 of the American Heart Association's 7 Strategic Impact Goals for 2020.  In a randomized controlled 2-group design, the trial will compare two active treatment conditions: Group 1 targets tobacco and physical activity; Group 2 targets control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia (HTN-HCL) through medication adherence and nutritional changes. Both conditions utilize trans theoretical model-tailored, computerized interventions, delivered via telemedicine by Indigenous-focused counselors located in Anchorage reaching AN people in their rural home villages. Computerized intervention contacts occur at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months with final assessment at 18-months. Study design provides an equivalent contact time and technology comparison; facilitates individual-level randomization within communities, as all participants receive highly individualized counseling and intervention materials; and allows for comparison of traditional risk factor (HTN-HCL) versus risk behavior (tobacco/ physical activity) interventions. Participants (N=300) will be daily smokers with at least one additional cardiovascular disease risk factor (e.g., inactivity, overweight, HTN, HCL) or established vascular disease. The trial aims to reach AN people regardless of residential location or intention to change.  The primary hypothesis is that Group 1 will achieve significantly greater biochemically- confirmed tobacco abstinence than Group 2 through 18-months follow-up and secondarily will significantly increase their physical activity. Secondary hypotheses are that Group 2 will achieve significantly greater control of HTN and HCL than Group 1 through (i) medication compliance and (ii) dietary change. Tertiary aims will: (a) compare the interventions on overall behavior change; (b) model cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of each intervention; and (c) examine moderators/mediators of treatment outcome, including the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio, a noninvasive measure of nicotine metabolism rate. The proposal combines technology, pharmacology, behavioral science, and health economics for advancing the health of AN people who face significant health disparities with limited access to interventions given their isolated geographics."
"9262261","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mathematical ability is essential for almost every aspect of human existence and yet there is large variability in math competency in adults and extremely poor math ability is linked with long-term health problems and higher criminality (Parsons and Bynner, 2005). Math skills at school-entry predict later math achievement and are a better predictor of later overall academic achievement than literacy skills (Jordan, et al., 2009 Duncan et al., 2007). Therefore improving early math skills in very young children could have global effects on academic success and perhaps life outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to build upon a recent finding from our research group demonstrating that training with approximate nonsymbolic arithmetic (ApprA) using dot arrays leads to positive transfer in exact symbolic arithmetic (SymA) performance (Park and Brannon, In press). In Aim 1 we ask why ApprA training improves SymA. We decompose the cognitive ingredients of ApprA training to assess which aspects are critical for improving symbolic arithmetic. In Aim 2 we test specific predictions about how overlap in the brain regions that support approximate nonsymbolic arithmetic and exact symbolic arithmetic give rise to this transfer effect. For example, we ask whether ApprA training changes the neural tuning curves in the intraparietal sulcus, which are known to embody the mental representation of quantity. Such a finding would provide strong evidence that ApprA improves SymA by changing the primitive number sense. Finally Aim 3 proposes an iPad intervention study in a diverse public school district to test the efficacy of ApprA training to improve SymA in young children. Pilot data is presented for all three aims. Understanding the relationship between ApprA and SymA could have broad implications for understanding the roots of human mathematics. While ApprA training is unlikely to be practically useful as an avenue for improving math competency in adults or older children who have mastered the symbolic number system it could be critically important for improving math ability in very young children who have yet to master the symbolic number system."

"9245718","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early adolescence represents a key transition period in development yet little is known, particularly for children in rural poverty, about the ways in which trajectories established in early childhood support or constrain the development of self-regulation with implications for key outcomes. Accordingly, we propose to continue to follow a population-based predominantly low-income longitudinal sample known as the Family Life Project (N=1292 oversampled for African American ethnicity and poverty). Extensive child, family, home, and school data were collected through two rounds of funding as an NICHD program project with 11% attrition. Data collection beginning at child age 2mos through age 8yrs occurred in 10 home visits, 5 childcare visits, and 8 school visits. In this follow-up, we continue to focus on child self-regulation and stress response physiology, as well as family, peer, school, and neighborhood contexts measured in the first two phases. Data will be collected in 1 home visit (7th grade) and 2 school visits (6th & 8th grades.) We will test specific hypotheses about the influence of the timing and chronicity of poverty-related adversity in families on the development of stress response physiology and self-regulation from early childhood through early adolescence. Most importantly, we will test hypotheses about the ways in which peer, school, and neighborhood contexts increase or decrease risk for key outcomes, including mental health, substance use, and school achievement. Primary innovation in this phase concerns our ability to test key questions about the malleability of self-regulation development and the role of emerging sensitivity to reward and delay in risk taking behavior in early adolescence. We hypothesize that alterations to the stress response and accompanying self-regulation difficulties will be most severe and most likely to lead to poor outcomes for children facing sustained high levels of poverty-related adversity; however, we also hypothesize that this influence will be moderated by the quality of peer relations, as well as school, and community characteristics. Specifically, for children facing sustained adversity, higher quality peer relatios (taking into account potential bidirectional relations between self-regulation and peer quality, including social isolation and affiliation with deviant peers), higher levels of school quality, an higher levels of neighborhood quality will each be associated with improvements in stress responsivity and in self- regulation abilities, and thereby higher achievement, reduced substance use, and better mental health. To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to test complex longitudinal relations among adversity, stress response physiology, self-regulation, and key outcomes across multiple geographically and economically defined social contexts in a population-based sample. By testing the malleability of development using a psychobiological model, the proposed research will have clear implications for prevention efforts and efforts to promote positive youth development."
"9330342","The purpose of this proposal is to seek support for the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Investigative Pathology (ASIP), which will be held in Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center April 22-26, in conjunction with the Experimental Biology convention. ASIP's Annual Meeting provides a unique forum for presentation and sharing of cutting-edge research in experimental pathology. The target audience and subject matter for the meeting are diverse but united by a common focus on mechanisms of disease. The theme of the ASIP 2017 Annual Meeting is `Deciphering the Pathways of Health and Pathology: Informing Biomarker Development, Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Disease.' Reflecting the interests of the ASIP membership, the 2017 Annual Meeting contains strong components in neoplasia, stem cells, precision medicine, and angiogenesis. Topics include cancer chemoprevention and biomarker development; epigenetics and cancer; molecular features of breast cancer; Wnt signaling, stem cells, and cancer; targeting of transcriptional regulation in disease; liver carcinogenesis; and cancer genomics. Additional sessions on technical advances in imaging and computational pathology have direct relevance to the study of cancer. Application of insights gained from basic research to therapy and prevention will be a particular focus throughout. The five-day program comprises symposia, workshops, and lectures by award recipients, as well as abstract-driven minisymposia and poster sessions. The program further provides a number of educational initiatives, both targeted and of interest to the biomedical research community as a whole. These include two linked sessions on developing a personal brand for career success. ASIP regards promotion of the career development of trainee and young investigators as an extremely important aspect of the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the meeting provides not only special events designed for their needs but also sessions that showcase their work. Similarly, the Program Committee works hard to ensure diversity among the participants with respect to gender, ethnic/racial group, and stage of career. The sole specific aim of this application is to promote the participation of trainees and junior investigators in the Annual Meeting through expansion of travel award programs and provision of special sessions targeted to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, clinical residents and fellows in pathology, and faculty in the early stages of their careers."
"9330339","Project Summary This project investigates the neurobiological mechanisms of sensory symptoms in patients with obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) and their unaffected siblings using task-based fMRI, resting-state functional connectivity, and diffusion MRI approaches. OCD is a chronic disorder presenting a high public health burden. Treatment presents a particular challenge because OCD is extremely heterogeneous, with clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing neural etiologies. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to address this problem by investigating dimensional components of behavior that more closely align with brain circuitry. This application focuses on the dimensional symptom of sensory phenomena (SP), which are uncomfortable or aversive sensory experiences that drive repetitive behaviors in OCD, including ?not just right? sensations, physical urges, and sensations of disgust. SP are very prevalent, occurring in 60-80% of OCD patients, and experienced as highly distressing. Unfortunately, SP are not well addressed by standard treatment approaches, which may be in part because their neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood. Our preliminary data indicated that severity of SP in OCD patients was associated with activation of the insula, somatosensory cortex, and motor regions ? areas previously associated with the detection of body sensation and physical urges ? during two different fMRI tasks. Furthermore, greater severity of SP was related to greater resting-state functional connectivity between somatosensory regions, insula, and prefrontal cortex. This project builds on these promising preliminary data to (1) investigate the neural mechanisms of SP in a larger OCD cohort showing the full range of SP severity and (2) probe for familial risk markers in unaffected siblings. For Aim 1, SP will be measured in 100 OCD patients using the Sensory Phenomena Scale. Diffusion and fMRI data will be acquired during rest and fMRI tasks previously validated to recruit insula and sensorimotor regions. In order to identify familial risk markers, Aim 2 will compare sensory phenomena and neural circuitry between OCD probands, 50 of their unaffected biological siblings, and 50 unrelated healthy controls without a family history of Axis 1 disorders. Additional analyses will investigate the relationship between neuroimaging measures and other dimensional symptoms relevant for OCD (perseverative thought, harm avoidance, perfectionism), with path analyses testing a model of direct and specific pathways from neuroimaging measures to SP. This proposal investigates a significant and highly prevalent cluster of symptoms whose neurobiology remains elusive. Our use of complementary neuroimaging techniques will comprehensively assess the neural circuitry underlying SP and probe for markers of risk that could be targeted by future treatments."
"9249641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised renewal request for year 16-20 of a Program Project Grant (PPG) designed to administratively combine a group of related studies on maternal and fetal cardiovascular signaling at OHSU. This application is submitted in year 15 of ongoing studies. The proposed projects are directed by experienced senior scientists who actively work together. This application is designed to discover underlying mechanisms that regulate the growth and maturation of the cardiomyocyte and its association with the vascular bed of the coronary tree. Our epidemiology work has shown that all of the three main causes of cardiovascular death, which kill more people than any other disease, have their roots in the intrauterine environment. A key feature of the intrauterine environment is its role in determining the number of cardiomyocytes that endure beyond birth and their relationship with vascular elements. Three models of clinically applicable fetal stress will be studied in sheep: fetal anemia, fetal systolic load, placental insufficiency. A low myocyte number is associated with high risk for extensive ischemia reperfusion injury and subsequent heart failure as is excess capillarity. This Program Project includes 3 projects related to cardiomyocyte growth and coronary function and 4 supporting cores. Project I will test the hypothesis that fetal anemic stress leads to pathological changes in the myocardium. Project II tests the hypothesis that systolic load on the fetal myocardium generates an inadequate coronary tree because of limitations of its growth imposed by a reduced cardiomyocyte endowment. Project III tests the hypothesis that growth factors (IGF-1, tri-iodo-L-thyronine and Cortisol) have interacting signaling pathways that mutually operate through the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositol-3 kinase pathways and that these pathways can be manipulated to augment the fetal cardiomyocyte endowment. The advantage of the PPG mechanism is the cores that support the projects. Each of the 3 projects will use all cores. Core A is the Administrative Core,  Core B is an Animal Core, Core C is the tissue Histopathology Core and Core D in the Ultrasound Imaging Core."
"9418253","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the U.S. and the third leading cause of mortality world-wide. The most common form, ischemic stoke, is caused by blood clots occluding arterial supply, resulting in permanent neurological damage or death. For a minority of patients, blood clots can be removed or lysed to prevent or limit stroke injury. However, neuroprotectants that improve survival and recovery are not available. Following arterial occlusion, neuronal death spreads outward from the initial infarct as neurons depolarize causing massive glutamate release and hyperactivation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR). As a result, excitotoxic Ca2+ flows into cells where it activates the protease calpain. This excitotoxic cascade is a major component of stroke pathophysiology. However, efforts to block the cascade with NMDAR antagonists have not proven effective in clinical trials due to unwanted effects. We discovered that the protein kinase Cdk5 physically links calpain to the NR2B subunit of NMDARs. Cdk5 is also bound to its activator p35. Through this NR2B-calpain- Cdk5/p35 signaling complex, excitotoxic activation of NMDARs causes calpain to convert p35 to p25. Cdk5 associated with p25 causes neuronal death and has been suggested to mediate to ischemic injury. However little is yet known of how Cdk5 or p35/p25 contributes to stroke pathophysiology or how it may be effectively targeted to improve outcome. Here we propose to characterize the dysregulation of Cdk5 following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and determine the neuroprotective effects of loss of Cdk5 or p35 in mice. As a novel strategy to achieve neuroprotection we will target the NR2B-calpain-Cdk5/p35 cascade by identifying functional protein-protein interaction motifs and developing small interfering peptides (SIPs) that prevent calpain-Cdk5 and NR2B-Cdk5 interactions. These SIPs will be optimized as molecules that potently and specifically dissociate the NR2B-calpain-Cdk5/p35 and prevent Cdk5/p25 generation by NMDAR hyperactivation without otherwise affecting the functions of the receptors, calpain, or Cdk5. We will then assess their ability to neuroprotect and improve behavioral and histological outcome in mice subjected to MCAO. These translational studies will advance our knowledge of the mechanisms that mediate stroke injury and derive novel neuroprotectants that will potentially lead to the development of therapies that improving recovery and reduce stroke-related disability."
"9328459","PROJECT SUMMARY Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons that is rapidly progressive and uniformly fatal. In 90-95% of cases, ALS is sporadic with no clearly associated risk factors. The other 5-10% of ALS is inherited with a genetic cause. The most common inherited cause of ALS, a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) found in the gene chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), accounts for about half of all familial cases and about 8% of sporadic cases of ALS (called ?C9- ALS?). This HRE is hypothesized to be caused by a gain-of-function either by expression of repeat RNA and sequestration of RNA-binding proteins, or through the production of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) through repeat-associated non-AUG translation (RANT). Using a genetic screen for modifiers of GGGGCC-mediated toxicity in Drosophila, we have identified p62/SQSTM1 as a strong genetic modifier of c9orf72 ALS. In addition to being a genetic modifier, p62-positive aggregates are a key pathology in C9-ALS, and p62/SQSTM1 mutations have rarely been shown to cause ALS in patients. Furthermore, p62 plays a key role in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and protein degradation, which have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Although p62 appears to be a key genetic target, its role in ALS pathogenesis is poorly understood. This project will determine 1) the mechanism by which protein homeostasis is disrupted in C9-ALS and 2) the role that p62 plays in C9-ALS pathogenesis. First, I will use novel transgenic lines to determine whether DPRs or GGGGCC RNA are responsible for neurodegeneration and protein homeostasis defects by selectively degrading each DPR. Next, I will determine the mechanism by which p62 regulates GGGGCC-mediated neurodegeneration using molecular and genetic tools in Drosophila to determine which protein homeostatic and signaling pathways contribute to p62-mediated toxicity in GGGGCC expressing Drosophila. Lastly, I will use CRISPR to generate novel alleles of p62 in order to assess the role of p62 in motor neuron degeneration. These alleles will be used to study the interactions between p62 and GGGGCC expression as well as other ALS-causing genes in order to provide insight into the genetic basis of ALS."
"9243298","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Principal signs of inflammation include edema and bleeding, indicators of impaired vascular integrity. Vascular leakage often leads to impaired wound healing, and delayed clearance of pathogens, even hypotension and organ failure during severe systemic inflammation. Platelets prevent microvessels from leakage during inflammation. However, how platelets safeguard vascular integrity remains unclear. Our preliminary studies show that mice lacking platelet C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) and its ligand podoplanin have increased vascular leakage in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia. These data support the novel hypothesis that interaction of platelet CLEC-2 with podoplanin protects vascular integrity in systemic inflammation. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesi by determining: 1) whether and if so, how platelet CLEC-2 interacts with perivascular podoplanin to protect vascular integrity during inflammation. Our preliminary data on confocal imaging detected staining for platelets on the abluminal side of venules and staining for podoplanin on perivascular macrophages during inflammation. These data suggest that interactions of CLEC-2 on extravasated platelets with podoplanin on perivascular macrophages limit vascular leakage during inflammation. In addition, platelets interact with leukocytes during inflammation. We will use spinning-disk and two-photon confocal intravital microscopy to determine whether platelets emigrate with or follow emigrating leukocytes through venules to interact with perivascular podoplanin. Models of systemic inflammation (such as cecal ligation and puncture) will be used to determine whether platelet CLEC-2 and perivascular podoplanin protect vascular integrity in different organs. 2) How platelets activated by podoplanin maintain vascular integrity during inflammation. We hypothesize that podoplanin-CLEC-2 interactions induce local platelet secretion of S1P that activates S1PR1 on endothelial cells to stabilize endothelial adherens junctions during inflammation. We will examine whether deficient podoplanin-CLEC-2 interactions exacerbate or platelet S1P ameliorates vascular leakage and organ failure in systemic inflammation. We will determine whether platelet S1P protects vascular integrity by maintaining endothelial adherens junctions during inflammation. Our preliminary data show that platelets, after podoplanin-CLEC-2-mediated activation, also release angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), another mediator of vascular integrity. Therefore, we will determine whether platelet S1P and Ang1 function cooperatively to protect vascular integrity during inflammation. These studies will provide key mechanistic insights into how platelet CLEC-2 limits vascular permeability during inflammation. Our results could offer exciting translational applications, for example, S1P receptor agonists or related drugs to restore endothelial barrier function in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis."
"9263343","SUMMARY This project of the ICEMR focuses on the ecology of Anopheles malaria vector populations in Mali, West Africa, where, as in most African countries, current vector control tools used inside houses are not sufficient to achieve successful malaria control and local elimination. A better understanding of malaria vector and transmission ecology is needed. Research on malaria vectors is typically done in villages because this is where mosquitoes blood-feed on humans and transmit malaria parasites. Much less is known about how the ecology of vectors beyond the periphery of villages affects transmission. Key gaps in outside-village ecology that represent a major void in the understanding of transmission dynamics include: 1) sources and survival strategies of vector populations during the long dry season; 2) how vector survival and transmission potential are influenced by local environmental resources used for resting and sugar feeding; and 3) how recently- discovered natural infections of Wolbachia in anopheline mosquitoes may impact transmission. Therefore, the goal of this project is to investigate important neglected aspects of malaria vector and transmission field ecology at four sites in Mali, representing three major eco-zones that span the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Study sites are already well characterized with respect to vector populations, seasonal Plasmodium falciparum transmission, and malaria epidemiology. This project, which builds on extensive preliminary studies in Mali, includes three specific aims: 1) Evaluate how malaria vectors use limited natural and often cryptic habitats as refugia during the dry season and how these habitats serve as the source for population expansion with the onset of rains; 2) Determine how local environmental resources used for vector resting and sugar-feeding behavior impact malaria parasite transmission dynamics; and 3) Investigate the prevalence of Wolbachia and Plasmodium falciparum parasites in natural populations of the Anopheles gambiae complex in different ecological settings and experimentally test how Wolbachia affects vector competence. Innovative aspects include: First, preliminary results demonstrating isolated refugia along the River Niger, where during the dry season high densities of Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes exist and actually feed predominantly on birds, gives confidence that an integrated approach (ground searches, camera mounted drones, and satellite imagery) can be used to identify and define cryptic dry season habitats that are sources of vector populations during the dry season. Second, this is the first study to address the question of how vector sugar-feeding and resting specifically on invasive and agricultural plants affects transmission. Third, this is the first longitudinal ecological study of Wolbachia infecting malaria vector populations in Africa, and the first to examine how Wolbachia infections impact vector competence. New insights how on vector ecology impacts transmission in three eco-zones in Mali will provide field-based evidence needed for understanding how to overcome major barriers to malaria elimination in West Africa. !"

"9418242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug addiction is a widespread and severe neuropsychiatric disorder and a major public health concern. It is characterized by loss of behavioral control as the neurobiological processes of learning and memory of information that motivates actions to acquire rewards are overwhelmed by the pharmacological effects of the drug. Combined with other environmental and emotional factors, motivated drug taking leads to compulsive craving, seeking, and taking that define addiction. Reward and addiction learning are mediated by molecular mechanisms of synaptic remodeling at dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses. Identifying and validating these mechanisms is key to understanding addiction and developing effective strategies to treat it. We have discovered a new mechanism that mediates cognition through the regulation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). This mechanism involves the modulation of the phosphorylation state of Ser1116 of the NR2B subunit of these receptors. This site is phosphorylated by the neuronal protein kinase, Cdk5. Cdk5 knockout (KO) or inhibition reduces phospho-Ser1116 NR2B, increases cell surface levels of the receptor, increases NMDAR-mediated current, and enhances cognition. Interestingly acute cocaine exposure, causes dephosphorylation of this site, likely facilitating reward learning. In contrast, chronic cocaine exposure potentiates this site, possibly attenuating further learning, thereby contributing to the perpetuation of the addicted state. We believe this mechanism provides a new avenue to understanding the molecular basis of addiction. We propose to study the regulation of this mechanism by cocaine and dopamine signal transduction. We will characterize its modulation during acquisition of self-administration (SA), chronic SA, and extinction after withdrawal from sucrose and cocaine SA in mice. We will define the effects of loss of Cdk5 and reduced phospho-Ser1116 NR2B on sucrose and cocaine SA by temporally and spatially controlled Cdk5 KO. Finally, we will specifically target and validate the role of this mechanism in acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of sucrose and cocaine SA by viral gene delivery of novel drug-like small interfering peptides that disrupt NR2B-Cdk5 interactions. This translational research will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of addiction and may contribute to the development of treatments to help addicted individuals recover."
"9253430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of the proposed trial, entitled International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA), is to define the role of an invasive approach in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). The trial hypothesis is that cardiac catheterization followed by complete revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) is superior to OMT alone as the strategy for initial management of patients with moderate-to-severe ischemia on stress imaging. The primary endpoint will be time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for an acute cardiac event (unstable angina, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or heart failure). We will also test the hypothesis that the invasive strategy will improve quality of life. Cost effectiveness will be assessed.    The COURAGE and BARI-2D trials found that an initial management strategy of coronary revascularization did not reduce the risk of death or MI in SIHD compared with OMT alone when patients were selected based on coronary anatomy. These data have prompted inference that cardiac catheterization (cath) may not be required in stable patients. Cath in such patients usually leads to revascularization. COURAGE and BARI-2D included a broad range of severity of myocardial ischemia on provocative testing; most patients had mild-moderate ischemia. However, observational data suggest that revascularization is associated with a lower likelihood of death and MI in patients with moderate-severe ischemia but not in patients with lesser degrees of ischemia. Only about half of patients with moderate-severe ischemia are referred for cath. It is unknown whether use rates for cath and revascularization are appropriate for optimal patient management in the era of modern medical therapy (high dose statins and antiplatelet therapy). This issue cannot be resolved using available data, because prior clinical trials in SIHD have enrolled patients after cath, at which point there is substantial selection bias for enrollment based on anatomy. Given the potential for extension of life and avoidance of adverse clinical cardiac events as a result of revascularization, and the significant expense and risks associated with invasive management, the role of an invasive strategy is critically important to define.   The proposed ISCHEMIA trial will be a prospective, multicenter, international, randomized, controlled trial that will directly address the need for an invasive strategy, cath and revascularization, in patients with SIHD. We plan to enroll approximately 8,000 patients from among 400-500 sites with moderate-severe ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction >35% who are recruited after stress imaging. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo blinded coronary CT angiography to exclude significant left main coronary artery disease and nonobstructive disease. Patients randomized to the invasive group will undergo optimal revascularization following study guidelines."
"9379018","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The microenvironment within tumors is significantly different from normal tissue. The chaotic vasculature leads to transient or chronic hypoxia which leads to acidification of the interstitial space. This creates a cytotoxic environment for normal cells while favoring tumor growth through degradation of extracellular matrix, induction of angiogenic factors, enhanced migration, and immunologic evasion. Our application focuses on the mechanisms that regulate acidification. We have assembled a group of outstanding investigators and will use state-of-the-art approaches to provide new insights in control of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. Our overall goal is to understand the role of membrane-bound carbonic anhydrases, whose catalytic domains face the extracellular milieu, in controlling acidification in breast cancer. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that membrane bound carbonic anhydrase is mechanistically responsible for regulating pH in the tumor microenvironment. Increased carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) expression in primary breast cancers is a marker for hypoxia, an indicator of poor prognosis, and associated with high-grade estrogen receptor negative tumors. For unknown reasons, carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII) expression in breast cancer is an indicator of good prognosis. Few investigators have studied CAIX or CAXII in the native breast cancer environment, as we propose, which will provide the most accurate appraisal of their roles in pH control. We have developed the methodology to compare the kinetics of these two proteins to determine if differences in their intrinsic activity r environment underlie this paradox. We challenge the current paradigm that CAIX contributes solely to the development of the acidic tumor microenvironment. Rather, our data suggest that CAIX has the ability to balance tumor extracellular pH by improving extracellular buffering using the CO2/bicarbonate system. In contrast, CAXII is a better enzyme at higher pH. The aims of our proposal are: 1.) To compare the kinetics of CAIX and CAXII in basal B and luminal breast cancer cells. 2.) To analyze the mechanism(s) by which breast cancer cells control extracellular pH. 3.) To assess the role of CA on pH control in xenograft breast cancer tumors comprised of breast cancer cells and human tissue grafts. These data will be particularly important for those women who have triple negative breast cancers. These cancers are strongly associated with CAIX expression, predominate in the minority populations, and have no specific treatment modalities. We believe that our proposal has high impact as it uses innovative approaches, addresses unique hypotheses, may reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer, has applicability to other cancer types, and has a great chance of success."
"9263342","1 This Project of the ICEMR focuses on genetic variation in the malaria parasite and human  2 host, and their impact on malaria transmission and effectiveness of malaria control measures  3 in four sites in Mali, West Africa. Recent advances in genome research provide unprecedented  4 opportunities to tackle questions that decades of immunological research have failed to resolve, such  5 as how people naturally clear malaria parasites from the blood stream or why some people get  6 severe malaria. By investigating how the natural genetic variation in humans and parasites affects 7 malaria susceptibility, and efforts to control malaria, we can build a catalogue of host/parasite  8 molecules that are critical for protective immunity. Recently, Plasmodiun falciparum has developed  9 resistance to the artemisinins, the most effective antimalarial drugs, and the continued evolution of its 10 genome is a major obstacle to malaria control. Now, next generation sequencing approaches coupled 11 with advances in statistics and informatics have transformed our ability to study genetic variation in 12 Plasmodium parasites. These advances are paving the way for large-scale, high-resolution 13 monitoring of genetic variation in malaria parasites. Furthermore, enzymes responsible for the 14 metabolism of antimalarial drugs have been shown to vary in the sequence of the human genes 15 coding for them resulting in varying metabolic efficiency and possible failure of the drug to function 16 accordingly. Apart from the impact of known human genetic polymorphisms related to protection 17 against malaria, novel human gene polymorphisms are as well a major focus of this Project as they 18 may reveal molecular processes that are critical for protective immunity, and will help us to 19 understand the factors that could cause control measures to succeed or fail. Therefore, the goal of this 20 project is to investigate important neglected aspects of malaria immunogenomics at four sites in Mali, 21 representing three major eco-zones that span the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Study sites are already well 22 characterized with respect to parasite populations, seasonal P. falciparum transmission, and malaria 23 epidemiology. This project, which builds on extensive preliminary studies in Mali, includes three specific aims: 24 (1) investigate the genetic diversity of P. falciparum in Malian communities living in different malaria 25 endemic areas, and its relation with disease outcome; (ii) quantify P. falciparum gametocytes using 26 molecular approaches in different epidemiological settings of malaria transmission in Mali, and (iii) 27 assess the host genetic variability and antimalarial molecular markers of resistance in Malian 28 populations living in areas of distinct transmission patterns and compare to parasite genetic diversity."
"9264002","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed mentored research is to investigate the neurobiology of food-seeking behaviors in children, and to provide Dr. Mimi Kim the in-depth training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in childhood obesity and metabolism. This proposal targets children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) as a natural human model for the study of brain and adipose contributors to obesity. Her long-term goal is to become a clinical research leader in childhood obesity with an emphasis on prevention and treatment. Dr. Kim joined the Department of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and the Division of Endocrinology at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in 2009 under the mentorship of Dr. Mitchell Geffner, an expert in childhood endocrine disorders, including CAH. Children with CAH have abnormalities in neuroendocrine function and brain structures related to self-control and reward, and are more likely to be obese than children without CAH. Specifically, Dr. Kim will measure food-seeking behavior, body fat, metabolic hormones, and brain activity in regions involved in reward (e.g., amygdala and nucleus accumbens) and inhibitory control (pre-frontal cortex) in children with CAH and in an unaffected comparison group (Non-CAH). Prior research has shown that children with CAH have abnormal amygdala volumes and function, and decreased inhibitory control during motivated behavior. Food-seeking behaviors have not been studied in children with CAH; however, there is a wealth of animal research on impaired amygdala function and food- seeking behavior. Dr. Kim hypothesizes that 1) a small amygdala, as observed in CAH, is associated with obesity, and that 2) children with CAH exhibit less inhibitory control and greater brain reward response to highly palatable food cues. The specific aims are to: 1) determine whether amygdala size is inversely associated with adiposity and body composition in CAH youth vs. Non-CAH youth; 2) determine whether activation of inhibitory control regions is decreased and activation of reward regions is increased in response to food cues in CAH youth; and 3) evaluate decision-making with regard to food choices in CAH and Non-CAH groups from Aim 1. Through mentored training and didactic learning, Dr. Kim will develop specific expertise in: 1) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and abdomen, 2) functional MRI of the brain and administering a food cues-based task in the scanner, 3) a neurobehavioral task involving food decision- making, and 4) statistical methods useful for conducting human research. Guided by highly expert and collaborative mentors from multiple disciplines, Dr. Kim will acquire technical skills and an understanding of how to effectively conduct and lead team science. Her project will establish a human model for the study of the amygdala, appetite, food-seeking behaviors, and obesity in children using sophisticated MRI measures. Understanding the neurobiology of food-seeking behaviors in children could inform much-needed development of interventions for obese children with and without CAH."

Motor variability must be minimal for optimum motor performance, however high levels of variability are a necessary ingredient for motor learning. One key function of the Basal Ganglia (BG) is the regulation of neural variability and ultimately variability in motor performance. Pathology of the BG is implicated in numerous disorders including Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). As these disease states are characterized by abnormal correlations of BG activity, an emerging hypothesis is that pathological correlations drive dysfunction in the regulation of neural variability, which ultimately leads to behavioral symptoms. However, a direct link between levels of correlated activity in the BG and the regulation of neural variability and resulting behavior has not been demonstrated. Moreover, the neural mechanisms responsible for the regulation of variability generation in the BG have not been well defined. Songbirds possess unique features that allow for rigorous dissection of neural mechanisms underlying the generation and regulation of motor variability. They possess a motor behavior, song, with highly quantifiable variability. Additionally, in songbirds levels of variability have been convincingly linked to learning. Further, songbirds modulate the level of song variability with social context allowing for a powerful assay to assess neural mechanisms involved in variability regulation. Moreover, neural sources of variability generation have been proposed. Indeed, recent work has suggested correlations in the firing rate of spiny neurons (SNs) in the BG may be critical mediators of variability generation. Multiple lines of evidence have advanced the activity of midbrain dopaminergic cells that project to the BG (MBBG cells) as well as dopamine as critical to driving context dependent changes in song variability. Thus, the songbird provides a platform to test a unified model of variability regulation where midbrain dopaminergic cell activity drives changes in the activity of SNs to ultimately determine levels of motor variability. This study will contribute to understanding the links between MBBG cell activity, correlations in SNs, neural variability, and motor variability through the following aims Aim 1. To investigate the neuronal population dynamics of spiny neurons during singing. Aim 2. To determine the effect of modulating MBBG cells on motor variability. Aim 3. To determine the effect of modulating MBBG cells on SN spatiotemporal activity dynamics. Methods: Aim 1 employs a viral strategy to specifically infect SNs with the fluorescent calcium activity reporter,  GCaMP6f. Population calcium imaging is then employed in vivo in freely behaving songbirds to record activity from populations of identified SNs in the BG. Correlations in population wide neuronal activity between individual SNs will be quantified and analyzed to determine the relationship between SN correlations and variability in song. Aim 2 uses optogenetic methods to bidirectionally modulate MBBG cells with an excitatory channelrhodopsin and an inhibitory halorhodopsin to determine the effect of MBBG cell activity on song variability. Aim 3 combines the imaging approach of Aim 1 with optogenetic manipulation in Aim 2 to directly test the effect of this MBBG cell activity on SN correlations. Objectives: The results of Aim 1 will test the link between correlations in the activity of BG SNs and variability in motor performance. These results will define the natural BG spatiotemporal dynamics during singing to test the hypothesis that the level of correlated activity in SNs is modulated with social context. Aim 2 will extend ths work using causal experiments to test how midbrain dopaminergic cell modulation influences motor variability. Aim 3 will determine the effect of this modulation on SN correlations. These experiments directly and independently characterize the links between MBBG cell activity, SN correlations, and motor variability to test the hypothesis that MBBG cells drive changes in the level of correlated activity in SNs, ultimately determining variability in motor performance."
"9229048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of frail, elderly, and chronically ill patients lose functional capacity during hospitalization. The result is an unnecessarily increased risk of falls, near-term rehospitalizations, and discharges to institutional rather than home settings. Our current clinical care model systemically engenders these often avoidable losses of function due to its unnecessary and ineffective reliance on busy clinicians to detect functional decline and initiate simple, yet effective, treatment plans. There is a critical need to reconceptualize this situation by: 1) minimizing reliance on overburdened clinicians to detect, address, and monitor patients' rehabilitation needs; and 2) immediately initiating resource-appropriate individualized care plans. A non-burdensome assessment strategy capable of accurately profiling patients' evolving functional capabilities and rehabilitation needs is needed. However, no measure currently offers this capability. We propose to develop and evaluate the needed assessment tool by refining the extant item response theory (IRT)-modeled Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) item banks to create a disease-independent multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT). In addition to enhanced efficiency and precision, MCAT may definitively address threats to measurement validity that arise when an item's or an IRT model's psychometric properties differ across clinically relevant subgroups (as has been reported for the aged, the intensely symptomatic, and ethnic minorities). The benefits of these achievable efforts will be enormous given that the use of this multidimensional approach will radically enhance assessment scope and efficiency without a commensurate increase in clinician burden in a manner that can be easily integrated into current care practices. More specifically, our approach will be to enrich the current AM-PAC banks and administer them to 1500 hospitalized patients. These data, combined with existing AM-PAC data sets, will be used to evaluate differential item functioning, item density across relevant trait ranges, multidimensional IRT model fit, and cut points for score stratification to match physical therapist (PT)-assigned functional stages. The resultant parameter estimates will be used to create a fixed-length short form (SF) and MCAT specified to assign patients to functional stages that link to validated care plans, as well as to detect meaningful change. We will administer the MCAT and SF to 600 hospitalized patients and 300 proxies, 50% verbally and 50% via tablets, who will concurrently be evaluated by experienced PTs. The resultant data will be used to evaluate the MCAT's and SF's validity relative to the gold standard criterion of PT assessment, association with clinical outcomes, robustness to proxy (i.e., caregiver vs. patient) and mode effects, and responsiveness."
"9473166","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) contributes disproportionately to the global burden of disease. In our prior application, we have provided evidence for an important link between particulate matter <2.5 mm (PM2.5) exposure and development of HTN. In this competitive renewal application, we propose to further investigate these links in the context of our findings that inflammation mediated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in circumventricular organs (CVO) in the brain represent an integrative mechanism for PM2.5 induced HTN. Our hypothesis is consistent with an evolving shift in our understanding of the SNS as an arbitrator of acute tonal changes in HTN to a facilitator of chronic functional and structural changes via immune mechanisms. We propose to test this hypothesis in both animal models and humans as part of our established inter-disciplinary collaborative group. In aim 1, we will investigate the time course, loci and impact of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation on BP with PM2.5 exposure conducted in a versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) using C57/Bl6 and NFkB reporter mice. We will directly assess the impact of PM2.5 in exaggerating BP using a model of central SNS activation and also assess the impact of activating inflammation proximally on SNS activation on BP response to FA/PM2.5. Dose response studies and analysis of PM2.5 components responsible for HTN, will be performed in pre-disposed models. In Aim 2, the role of central TLR activation in the CVO organs will be tested by deleting TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF6), selectively in the CVO using UbcCre-TRAF6flox/flox(TRAF6pCNS) mice using Tamoxifen injected intra-cerebroventricularly (ICV), followed by exposure to FA/PM2.5. TRAF6 is a unique member of the TRAF family that functions at nodal points where signals induced via multiple TLRs converge. We will additionally distinguish between neuronal and glial cell specific role of TRAF6 in CNS inflammation in response to PM2.5. In Aim 3, we will test the involvement of central SNS as a relevant pathway in humans, exposed to sub-acute time periods to ambient PM2.5, as part of a blinded randomized cross-over intervention. Our hypothesis is that Guanfacine an approved a2A agonist will obviate the association of ambient PM2.5 with 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP and SNS activity measured by HRV measures. Our experiments are highly relevant to continuing risk posed by air- pollution to people living in urbanized environments."
"9261589","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular differentiation is at a basic level a specification of the global protein complement, or proteome. The scale and speed of these changes are remarkable in the case of terminally differentiated cells such as erythrocytes, spermatozoa, and others. Global remodeling of the proteome consists of the programmed elimination of most generic constituents of the cell in parallel with abundant synthesis of a small number of new, cell-type-specific proteins such as globin. Reticulocytes are a canonical example of a proteome in rapid transition, yet, even in this case, the mechanisms that drive rapid turnover of normally stable proteins largely remain to be identified. We have found that Ube2O/E2-230K is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme expressed selectively in the erythroid lineage and that null mutations in its gene have a highly specific phenotype of microcytic anemia. Further analysis of this murine mutant, hem9, suggests the hypothesis that Ube2O is a broad-spectrum ubiquitinating enzyme that plays a key role in the global remodeling of the erythroid proteome. To assess this model, an integrated set of approaches is proposed, incorporating mutant analysis, mass spectrometry, and in vitro biochemistry. A major point of focus will be to identify substrates of Ube2O in an unbiased and global manner. To date there has been significant progress towards this goal, as the globin chaperone AHSP, globin itself, and ribosomes have been provisionally assigned as Ube2O substrates. Accordingly, a distinctive phenotype of hem9 is markedly elevated levels of 80S ribosomes. In contrast, low ribosome levels are the signature feature of Diamond Blackfan anemia. Ube2O was found to be sufficient to induce ribosome degradation by dox-inducible expression in HEK293 cells; no other erythroid-specific factors are needed. The ubiquitination and degradation of AHSP and ribosomes will be reconstituted in vitro and in highly purified systems; the specificity determinants of these reactions will be mapped for both substrate and enzyme. In parallel with these biochemical investigations, the physiological effects of Ube2O loss will be studied at higher resolution through analysis of protein synthesis in the mutant reticulocytes, and bone marrow transplantation will be used to test whether hem9 erythroid phenotypes are cell-autonomous, as predicted by the hypothesis that Ube2O reshapes the proteome. Ultimately, our studies are expected to shed light on the fundamental process of proteome remodeling and provide new insights into underlying mechanisms of both microcytic anemia and Diamond Blackfan anemia."
"9243022","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Justine Wu, MD, MPH, is a family physician with clinical and educational expertise in family planning and primary care. Dr. Wu's long-term career goal is to become a successful clinical investiga- tor who leads efforts to develop practice-based interventions that improve contraceptive use and de- crease the rate of unintended pregnancy. She is particularly interested in understanding and address- ing the contraceptive needs of women with chronic medical conditions, including diabetes and hyper- tension. Upon completion of this 5-year career development award, Dr. Wu will have obtained the expe- rience and skills necessary to launch a career as an independent investigator. Public Health Context: The proposed project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it addresses the intersection of unintended pregnancy and chronic conditions, two significant public health issues that affect reproductive-aged women in the US. Adult women with chronic conditions have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy than adult women without chronic conditions. Chronic conditions and unin- tended pregnancy are both associated with pregnancy-related complications and adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Prior studies show that women with chronic conditions are not receiving ade- quate contraceptive counseling, particularly regarding highly effective contraceptive methods. There is an urgent need to improve contraceptive counseling and services for women with chronic conditions in order to decrease the rate of unintended pregnancy and improve reproductive health outcomes among this population. Proposed Research: The overarching goal of this proposal is to design and pilot test a theory-driven, interactive web-based contraceptive decision aid for women with chronic conditions and for use in pri- mary care. This decision aid will help women understand their contraceptive options within the context of their medical conditions, ongoing drug therapy, and personal preferences, and facilitate a shared- decision making process with their primary care providers (PCPs). The specific aims of this mixed methods, multi-phase study are: 1) to identify key factors on the patient-, provider-, and practice-level that are critical to the design of a contraceptive intervention for women with chronic conditions in primary care; 2) to develop an interactive, web-based contraceptive decision aid for women with chronic conditions, their PCPs, and implementation in primary care; 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) decision aid versus usual care to assess the feasibility of the intervention and to determine the population size needed for a future R01 RCT. Project Innovation: The proposed contraceptive decision aid is innovative because it will: 1) be cus- tomized for women with chronic conditions and for use in community-based primary care sites; 2) be informed by a new conceptual model that draws upon elements of traditional behavioral health models and counseling methods; 3) provide clinical decision support for PCPs (in contrast to decision aids that focus only on patient education); 4) be executed via a rigorously-designed mixed methods study; and 5) reflect principals of implementation science such that the decision aid can be adopted for use in non- research settings. Training Plan: Dr. Wu's proposed research aims are coordinated with a mentor-guided training plan to gain experience in the following complementary areas: 1) mixed methods research; 2) decision sci- ence; 3) primary care practice-based research ; and 4) dissemination and implementation science. Dr. Wu's training aims will be achieved through: mentorship from an interdisciplinary team of experienced investigators; advanced didactic course work; scientific presentations at national and international con- ferences; participation in seminars and journal clubs; implementing her research plan; and manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the proposed research. Dr. Wu will be prepared to submit a competitive R01 application in Year 4 of this award to test her decision aid in a large randomized controlled trial. Training Environment: The University of Michigan (UM) and the UM Department of Family Medicine provide an outstanding research infrastructure and supportive environment for junior investigators. Dr. Wu's training and research plan will be directly supported by the following programs, institutes, and schools all located on the UM campus: the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (UM- CTSA), the Center for Health Communications Research, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecolo- gy, the Program on Women's Health Care Effectiveness Research, the Summer Institute for Survey Research at the Institute for Social Research, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, the School of Public Health, and the Center for Statistical Consultation and Research."
"9270068","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 award will enable the investigator to launch a transdisciplinary mentorship program for mHealth research focused on obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. The candidate currently has 15 mentees including 7 post-doctoral fellows/junior faculty and 8 graduate students. Altogether she has co- authored 119 papers with mentees and they have obtained 17 grants under her mentorship. The proposed mentorship plan will formalize and intensify her mentorship activity by providing mentees with a transdisciplinary mentoring experience that represents experts in behavioral science, preventive cardiology, health informatics, health economics, computer science, and engineering. Mentees from collaborating labs at the UMass Medical School, UMass Amherst, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute will embed in each other's lab to learn a broad range of mHealth and clinical research skills. Mentees will learn how to: utilize mobile apps and online social networks in their research; analyze online social network data; conduct qualitative data analyses; conduct usability testing; employ behavior change strategies in mobile and social network environments; design preliminary studies; and write grants. The candidate's midcareer training goals are to enhance knowledge and skills in mobile technology and social network analyses, establish a transdisciplinary mentorship program in mHealth research targeting CVD risk reduction, assist mentees to become independent investigators, and ultimately, to contribute to the scientific workforce focused on mHealth solutions for CVD prevention. The overarching goal of the research plan is to test ways to leverage mobile technologies and online social networks to increase the impact, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and dissemination potential of behavioral interventions. Three research aims are proposed, all of which examine the feasibility of novel technology-driven ways to deliver behavior change strategies. The first aim proposes to develop and test the proof-of-concept of a mobile app that will use sensing technology to identify physiological and environmental triggers for overeating. Findings will inform an app designed to identify key moments users would benefit from behavioral support. The second aim is to develop and test the proof-of-concept of a weight loss mobile app that contains an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. The third aim is t test the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention that is delivered via an online social network. Al of the proposed interventions were designed to minimize or eliminate patient visits. This work will provide preliminary data for 3 trials testing the efficacy of these interventions in patient care settings. Identifying cost-effective and scalable means to treat obesity is a public health priorit given the spiraling healthcare costs associated with obesity. The proposed work will produce data toward that end and contribute to the mentorship of the next generation of researchers who will have transdisciplinary expertise to capitalize on mobile technologies in the prevention of CVD."
"9407087","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We found that poor oral health status is associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Because poor oral health status is due to oral bacterial dysbiosis, we hypothesize that oral microbiota potentiate pancreas carcinogenesis. Supporting this, recent cohort studies reported that individuals with greater circulating antibodies to multipe oral bacteria have a greater risk of pancreatic cancer. Directly assessing oral microbiome from high-throughput genomic sequencing of oral samples in our recent case-control study, we found that specific gram-negative oral bacteria are associated with 3-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We also showed that these bacteria are present in the human pancreatic duct and showed in animal experiments that oral microbiota access the pancreas and have oncogenic effects via inflammation at the organ site. Because case-control studies are limited for causal inference, a current critical research gap is the lack of prospective confirmation of the link between pre-diagnostic oral microbiome and pancreatic cancer risk. A second research gap is the limited understanding of the comprehensive functional roles of the microbiota and the human host response. The overarching goals of this study are to identify oral microbiota associated with subsequent risk of pancreas cancer and to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in host responses potentially related to pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our specific aims are: 1) to test whether oral microbiome is associated with subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer in a nested case-control study and 2) to identify metabolically active bacterial function in the human pancreas and correlate these bacterial activities with expression of human inflammatory signaling pathways. Strengths of this study include a large prospective study design, with oral samples collected prior to cancer development, and state-of-art genomic microbiome and transcriptome assays for assessing oral and pancreas microbiota and related functions. This study is the first study of oral and pancreas microbiome and pancreatic cancer risk. Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and little is known about ways to detect and prevent this disease. We expect to identify specific oral bacteria associated with risk of pancreas cancer and to identify metabolically active bacterial functions in the pancreas and related host pancreatic inflammatory responses. These outcomes will expand our current limited knowledge on the causes of pancreatic cancer, will help to identify people at high risk for this disease, and may lead to microbial-based prophylactic preventions for pancreatic cancer. Thus, findings may help to rapidly advance our ability to reduce the burden of this highly fatal disease."

"9088479","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with a multitude of physical and mental health benefits, yet fewer than half of school-aged children achieve the recommended 60 minutes of daily MVPA. Only 12 percent of states mandate the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) recommendation of 150 minutes of physical education per week at the elementary level, despite a positive association between MVPA and academic achievement. Further, disparities in physical activity (PA)-supporting policies, activities, and environments between lower-socioeconomic status (SES) schools compared to higher-SES schools, may result in even fewer minutes of school-time MVPA for lower-SES children. Adaptable and scalable school-based PA programs are needed to address disparities in PA opportunities available to underserved schoolchildren in socioeconomically disadvantaged and racially diverse school districts. In the fall of 2013, the Active Schools Acceleration Project (ASAP) provided 700 U.S. elementary schools with micro-grants to implement award winning school-based PA programs during the 2013-2014 school year, either 1) The 100 Mile Club, a walking and running program offered throughout the school day, or 2) Just Move, a classroom-based PA break program. In the 2014-2015 school year, these programs will be further expanded nationwide; however their impact on increased MVPA and academic success among underserved children has yet to be rigorously evaluated. The overall objective of this application is to examine the impact of two PA programs implemented in elementary schools, 100 Mile Club and Just Move, on physical activity engagement and academic success in underserved schoolchildren in a randomized controlled study. Outcomes of interest include school-time and total daily MVPA, cognitive performance, and academic achievement. We will further examine child-level correlates of PA program participation and school-level correlates of program reach. We propose to assess these outcomes by studying children in schools implementing either 100 Mile Club (n=7) or Just Move (n=7) compared to control schools (n=7) within underserved school districts with high obesity rates in Massachusetts. Outcomes will be assessed at 5 months and 1.5 years using accelerometry, a standardized cognitive performance assessment, and standardized test scores. This randomized and controlled study will answer the important question of whether school-based PA programs are an effective strategy to improve daily MVPA and academic success among underserved schoolchildren."
"9329327","Project Summary/Abstract Aging is accompanied by cognitive declines, including in declarative (episodic) memory and in cognitive control, which refers to a set of cognitive functions that align actions with internal goals. Extant evidence indicates that older adults exhibit difficulty in proactively adjusting cognitive control, failing to effectively adjust control based on contextual cues that signal upcoming cognitive control demand. This difficulty leads to reduced flexibility, impedes goal-directed behavior in, and can profoundly impact older people?s daily life, as contexts are common and powerful predictive cues to signal adjustment of cognitive control in real life. For instance, viewing a usually busy traffic circle can serve as a cue to increase control demand in driving before entering the traffic circle. While age-related deficits in proactive control likely stem from disruptions in memory system and control system processes, and their interaction, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting the formation and expression of associations between contexts and cognitive control demand and how these mechanisms change with aging. To answer these questions, three Experiments are proposed using a combination of virtual reality behavioral methods and human functional magnetic resonance imaging. Specific Aim 1 will delineate the mechanisms supporting the encoding and retrieval of associations between context and cognitive control demand, enabling proactive control in young adults. This experiment will also lay foundations for Specific Aims 2 and 3. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether and how context-control demand associations can be generalized to objects appearing in the context via the mechanism of memory replay. Specific Aim 3 will characterize whether reductions in proactive control in older adults are partially due to dysfunctional mnemonic mechanisms that build and express associations between contexts and cognitive control demands. Specific Aim 3 will further examine whether individual differences in hippocampal anatomical and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer?s disease relate to age-related differences in memory for context-control demand associations. In all proposed experiments, the applicant will harness virtual reality techniques to present contextual stimuli (virtual rooms) in order to more closely simulate real life scenarios. In analysis, univariate and multi-variate pattern analyses will be combined to comprehensively interrogate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying associations between contexts and cognitive control demand. The proposed studies promise to advance understanding of memory?cognitive control interactions, including how memory of procedural processing features (e.g., past levels of control demand experienced in a context) can drive flexible adjustments of proactive control, and will provide valuable new insights into how decreased cognitive control in older adults may stem, in part, from multi-system (memory and control) dysfunction."
"9440788","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cellular membranes are not simple barriers, and the appropriate membrane composition is essential to ensure proper function of the membrane. In fact, dysfunction as a result of altered membrane composition has been observed in a wide range of diseases including cancers, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases. The composition of the membrane is known to impact its key properties including permeability, curvature, and fluidity; however, the lipid processing pathways and regulators that affect these composition changes have not yet been identified. This is largely due to the fact that in vivo studies of membrane dynamics have been limited, because they require high levels of isotope enrichment to obtain the resolution required to analyze membrane lipids in detail. In the Van Gilst lab, I developed stable isotope enrichment strategies in C. elegans that allow for the quantification of dietary carbon into the fatty acids of the animal. These isotope feeding strategies provide the enrichment levels required for flux analysis of phospholipid membrane dynamics. In this proposal, I will expand the scope of these stable isotope tracer methods to assay the turnover and synthesis of the acyl chains and phospholipid head groups in membranes via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectometry (LC/MS), respectively. In doing so, I hope to define many of the pathways that impact membrane composition and its ability to respond to stress and ultimately contribute to the overall understanding of membrane biology and dynamics. One of the most dramatic impacts of membrane composition is in aging, where the phospholipids begin to contain drastically more saturated fatty acids, ultimately making the membranes much more rigid and negatively impacting their function. As examples, the increased saturation index in the aged membrane can affect diffusion properties, transporter function, vesicle fusion, and even signaling. The progressive accumulation of saturated fat in the membranes over aging has been theorized as a major contributor to aging and aging-related dysfunction. The genetic tools of C. elegans will allow us to determine the relative contribution of membrane turnover on the overall membrane composition in young and old animals. The goal of this proposal is to define the genetic regulators and pathways that influence membrane aging and, in doing so, contribute to the understanding of how membrane biology impacts the aging process."
"9243313","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysregulated trafficking of the ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and glutamate receptors contributes to the pathogenesis/pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The SorL1 protein interacts with APP and changes in SorL1 expression or function affects the subcellular distribution and thus the processing of APP. The retromer complex is composed of VPS35, VPS29, VPS26 and Sorting Nexins 1 and 2, and regulates retrograde sorting from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Deficits in retromer transport are implicated in sporadic AD but most studies propose a link between the retromer complex and ?-secretase (BACE1) transport. Although VPS35 and VPS26 interact with SorL1, how retromer regulates APP trafficking and processing is largely unknown. Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to the Sorting Nexin family whose members regulate protein endocytosis and recycling. Our recent findings published in Nature Medicine demonstrate that SNX27 directly mediates glutamate receptor sorting to the plasma membrane, and attenuated SNX27 expression in Down syndrome (DS) brain contributes to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Significantly, we find that SNX27 re-expression can ameliorate neuropathological and behavioral phenotypes in a DS mouse model. We attempt to further establish molecular mechanisms underlying SNX27-mediated neurodegeneration through the trafficking and homeostasis of glutamate receptors and APP. Our preliminary results indicate that SNX27 interacts with VPS26 and VPS35, components of the retromer complex. In addition, we find that SNX27 regulated cell surface glutamate receptor levels in a retromer-dependent manner and downregulation of VPS26 or VPS35 abolished the effect of SNX27 overexpression on promoting cell surface levels of glutamate receptors. Additionally, we find that overexpression and downregulation of SNX27 reduced and increased A? levels, respectively, further suggesting that SNX27 can also regulate trafficking and processing of APP. Our results also show that SNX27-mediated APP trafficking potentially occurs through direct interactions with the APP trafficking receptor SorL1 since overexpression and downregulation of SNX27 can increase and decrease SorL1 levels, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesize that interactions between SNX27, SorL1 and the retromer complex play important roles in AD by coordinating APP endocytic and golgi retromer trafficking pathways that attenuate A? generation, and by maintaining proper cell surface homeostasis of glutamate receptors. In this proposal, we will ascertain whether SNX27, SorL1 and the retromer complex coordinately regulate APP trafficking/processing and cell surface homeostasis of glutamate receptors and synaptic function. Moreover, as deficiencies in VPS35 and SorL1 may accelerate onset of disease-like phenotypes in AD mice, we will study whether overexpression of SNX27 can delay early-onset neuropathological and cognitive phenotypes in AD mice bearing VPS35- or SorL1-haploinsufficiencies."
"9276320","ABSTRACT  Enhancers are non-coding DNA elements near genes that positively regulate gene expression. Because enhancers often act in a cell type specific manner, they confer biological specificity on gene regulation. Common genetic variation within enhancers appears to be a prevalent means of trait association. Super-enhancers are a recently described set of enhancers highly enriched for regulatory elements of cell lineage-defining genes and genetic variants related to lineage-specific disease susceptibility. However the structural determinants of super-enhancer function remain poorly understood. Enhancers are typically defined by their correlated biochemical features or ectopic potential in reporter assays. Nonetheless the gold-standard test of enhancer activity is loss-of-function mutation to discern the requirement for regulatory sequences in their natural chromosomal environment. Our group has developed a Cas9-mediated in situ saturating mutagenesis technique that allows for high-resolution, high-throughput functional analysis of enhancers in the native genomic setting. The assay involves design and synthesis of guide RNAs saturating a region of interest followed by pooled lentiviral CRISPR screening. This method when coupled with genomic target deep sequencing allows for an evaluation nearing nucleotide resolution of the functional sequences critical for enhancer function. In this proposal, we apply this technique to systematically perturb twenty erythroid-specific super-enhancers of key erythroid genes. We extend the Cas9 mutagenesis strategy by making use of a variant Cas9 to allow for increased genome editing resolution. In addition, we take a variant-informed guide design approach to improve mutagenesis even in the face of natural genomic variation. We utilize bioinformatic methods to identify essential sequences, predict interacting transcription factors, and refine models to estimate enhancer activity. We use biochemical techniques to determine the occupancy of transcription factors and chromatin regulators at required sequences. We focus on defining and testing super-enhancer looping interactions in which the key transcription factors GATA1 and TAL1 participate. Finally we employ prospective reverse genetics to validate both cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors necessary for super-enhancer function. These studies will help determine emergent cooperative properties of clustered components within super-enhancers. We expect these experiments to inform a further understanding of crucial aspects of erythropoiesis as well as fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation."
"9251228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoclasts are the body's sole bone resorbing cells. Pro-inflammatory T-cells, commonly called effector T-cells (TEFF), produce cytokines that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Prolonged exposure to the inflammatory cytokines leads to osteoporosis. Normally, regulatory T-cells, TREG, counteract the activity of TEFF. TREG suppress TEFF, suppress inflammation and promote healing. We have recently discovered that osteoclasts can induce a novel class of TREG, belonging to the CD8 lineage. These regulatory CD8+ T-cells, termed TcREG, like the more extensively studied TREG of the CD4 lineage, also express the transcription factor FoxP3. We have demonstrated that TcREG can negatively regulate bone turnover and production of TEFF in a mouse model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Osteoclasts induce TcREG from naive CD8 T-cells, which then negatively regulate osteoclast numbers and activity, to form a negative feedback loop. TcREG could potentially be very important for maintaining and restoring skeletal and immune homeostasis. We propose, in the application to study the mechanisms underlying the negative feedback loop. We propose to first uncover the mechanism by which osteoclasts induce FoxP3 in CD8 T-cells. Knowledge of these mechanisms could be used to induce TcREG locally to treat chronic inflammation. Second, additional proposed experiments will reveal how TcREG negatively regulate osteoclasts. Insights into how TcREG suppress bone turnover in osteoporosis is likely to lead to new treatment modalities, with relevance to other bone erosion diseases. This approach would represent an entirely new and mechanistically distinct avenue than those currently in use or development."
"9393386","Project Summary Sensory systems must be plastic in order to allow learning throughout the lifespan; however, brain regions involved in processing sensory information undergo a significant decline in plasticity during both normal aging and in concert with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, olfactory deficits are estimated to affect more than half of the elderly population in the United States. One promising feature of the olfactory system, however, is its extensive capability for lifelong plasticity. In rodents, the olfactory bulb (OB) is one of the most plastic areas of the adult brain due to ongoing neurogenesis. Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) are the most numerous population of adult-born neurons, and during their maturation, they develop synapses with existing cells and integrate into the OB circuit. However, there is still limited information about the development of abGCs? responses to stimuli in vivo. This project aims to use longitudinal in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging of individual abGCs? odor-evoked responses to characterize (1) when abGCs first become responsive to olfactory stimuli and how the responses of individual neurons change over time as the cells mature and (2) how this process may be modified in the context of olfactory learning. Preliminary data indicates that on a population level, abGCs are more responsive to odors early during their development. This supports the hypothesis that abGCs? initially broad representations may be refined to enhance their selectivity for particular odors as they mature. Analyzing the odor response profiles of identified cells over time will allow the investigation of the timecourse of an individual cell?s odor response magnitude, stability and odor selectivity on a single cell level. In addition, training mice in an operant behavioral task during the critical period of a cohort of abGCs will provide insight into the effects of odor exposure and odor-reward associations on the stability and prevalence of abGC responses. Together, these experiments will provide important insights into the process by which adult-born neurons integrate into an existing circuit and possible mechanisms by which this process may be modified by learning in order to enhance sensory processing."
"9296780","Project Summary/Abstract The cerebellar vermis is increasingly implicated neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). It has structural and functional connectivity to regions beyond the motor brain, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, as well as functional connectivity with multiple neural networks including the default mode, fronto-parietal, and salience networks. Evidence suggests the vermis may affect cognition and emotion through modulation of neural activity and temporal dynamics within neural networks with which it interconnects. As shared involvement of specific cortical networks including those with connectivity to the vermis and common genetic and environmental risk factors are increasingly evident among SCZ, BD, and MDD, vermis abnormalities and how they may alter cortical network modulation could have key roles in the neural mechanisms that lead to the similarities and differences in impairments and clinical features across SCZ, BD, and MDD. Intriguingly, vermis stimulation has led to cognitive and emotional changes in SCZ, although with mixed results due to limited understanding of how the vermis is involved in SCZ and neuropsychiatric disorders in general. Nevertheless, prior findings strongly support the significant involvement of the vermis in neuropsychiatric illnesses and its potential use in novel treatments for these illnesses. The vermis has largely been understudied in SCZ, BD, and MDD, and current understanding of its functional topography is still in nascent stages. A more systematic examination of the vermis across SCZ, BD, and MDD is clearly needed. This would provide greater understanding of the important interplay between the vermis and cortical networks in SCZ, BD, and MDD and could advance the development of novel treatments using vermis stimulation in these disorders. The proposed project will utilize structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques and complementary methods to further delineate the nature of vermis abnormalities across SCZ, BD, and MDD and their relationship to cognitive function. Through a strong international collaboration, the proposed study will expand upon an ongoing, independently funded data collection in a large unique sample in China that includes a significant proportion of first episode and medication nave individuals. At present, this sample consists of 297 healthy controls (HC) and 216, 180, and 204 individuals with SCZ, BD, and MDD, respectively, from ages 13 to 65 years old, including total 240 first episode (105, 41, and 94) and 147 medication nave (49, 30, and 68) individuals (SCZ, BD, and MDD, respectively). Aim 1 of the proposed study will determine differences in vermis volumes between SCZ, BD, MDD, and HC groups. Aim 2 will determine differences in resting state functional connectivity of vermis subregions with four neural networks, default mode, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and salience networks in SCZ, BD, MDD, and HC. Aim 3 will determine the relationship of cognitive measures to vermis volumes and resting state functional connectivity across SCZ, BD, MDD, and HC. Given the importance of early development in vermis structure and function and across SCZ, BD, and MDD, all aims will incorporate neurodevelopmental considerations of prenatal patterning during vermis development and sex to bridge early developmental considerations with vermis alterations at later developmental stages. Inclusion of neurodevelopmental considerations could improve understanding of the developmental processes in SCZ, BD, and MDD. Further, the proposed study would address knowledge gaps in how the vermis is involved across SCZ, BD, and MDD and how it could be utilized in novel treatment interventions for these debilitating illnesses. The proposed transdiagnostic approach would provide greater insight into the similarities and differences in brain structure and function across SCZ, BD, and MDD. In addition, the proposed complementary methods for vermis analyses could have implications for the use of more automated methods to examine the vermis in research and clinical settings. Altogether, the proposed study could have significant contributions for understanding the neuropathophysiology of SCZ, BD, and MDD and advancing diagnostic and treatment strategies for these disorders."

"9278568","Project 2. Project Summary. This Project 2 is a renewal of Project 3 in our current Conte Center. It has Ralph Adolphs (overall Center Director) and Cendri Hutcherson (formerly post-doc on current Project 3, now faculty) as co-PIs and includes a modest subcontract to the University of Toronto, Canada (Hutcherson). Its overall goal is to understand how social inference and context (the focus theme of this Conte Center) guide social decision-making, with a specific focus on prosocial (altruistic) decisions. A counterpart to this is Project 3, which will investigate how social inference and context guide decisions related to social threat. Project 2 will focus on how we represent the internal states of another person (social inference representations, Aim 1), how such representations are then used to make altruistic social decisions (Aim 2), and where in these processes we find individual differences that may correlate with measures like autistic traits, empathy, or social network size (Aim 3).  As with Projects 1 and 3 in this Conte Center renewal, this Project 2 focuses on fMRI studies in healthy individuals. Also as with Projects 1 and 3, this Project 2 has links to Aims under other Projects that offer a complementary approach. Specifically, it features computational models (drift-diffusion models) that will also be leveraged in Project 3, and it will develop a battery of social inference tasks (versions of the RDoC-listed ?why/how? task) that will also be administered to patients with focal lesions of the prefrontal cortex under Project 5. As well, we plan to make specific comparisons between the neural systems for social inference revealed under this Project 2 with social neuroscience tasks such as the ?why/how? task, and the systems revealed with computational fMRI investigated for observational learning in Project 1 (using cross-task decoding in overlapping subjects). The strong links between Project 2 and others is reflected in its personnel: it lists PIs from other Projects (O'Doherty, Tranel, Camerer) and shares post-docs with other Projects.  The first two Aims will develop tasks for two focused fMRI studies that will each be conducted in 100 healthy participants recruited through Cores 2 and 3. A subset of 30 of these will be retested in future years to investigate stability over time. Aim 1 will develop six tasks that probe how specific contexts modulate social inference: through task set, for facial expressions or actions, for social or nonsocial events, as a function of cognitive load, and whether the person we are observing seems to be in need or to have merit. This latter need/merit context factor is further developed in relation to altruistic decision-making in Aim 2, which expands a task and approach we recently published, using drift-diffusion modeling to better understand how specific parameters influence the temporal evolution of the choice process."

"9215179","SUMMARY Skeletal muscle injury-repair and regeneration is a multi-cellular process that involves repair of acute injury to the sarcolemma, mobilization of satellite cells to replace the lost-muscle fibers, and control of fibrotic remodeling for maintenance of muscle integrity. In muscular dystrophy, compromised sarcolemma integrity or membrane repair triggers the cascade of muscle degeneration that incurs progressive, severe morbidity and ultimately mortality. Developing therapeutic approaches to improve sarcolemma integrity while facilitating regeneration of injured muscle fibers remain a major challenge in muscle physiology research. This project builds on the discovery of MG53, a member of the TRIM-family protein, as an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. MG53 functions in vesicle trafficking and facilitates the nucleation of intracellular vesicles to sites of membrane disruption for repair patch formation. Native MG53 is present in blood circulation, at levels directly correlating with injury or secretory activity of the muscle. Administration of recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein protects muscle fibers and stem cells from injury, and reduces muscle fibrosis in the mdx mouse model. Our research with MG53 over the past few years has established a potential tri-functional role for MG53 in muscle injury-regeneration, as a facilitator to repair acute sarcolemma injury, a contributor to activate satellite cells during the early phase of muscle injury, and a modulator of fibrosis by controlling fibroblast differentiation associated with chronic muscle injury. We envision that targeting the tri-functional role of MG53 will have advantage over the current paradigms for treating muscular dystrophy. In Aim 1, we will determine the pathways that transduce the newly identified myokine function of MG53 into activation of satellite cells in response to acute muscle injury; define the mechanisms that underlie MG53?s function in regulating fibrosis during chronic muscle injury; and test if non-invasive interventions can modulate circulating MG53 levels toward muscle injury-regeneration. If circulating MG53 plays a role in satellite cell activation, we predict that ischemia-preconditioning that releases MG53 without muscle injury, or inducible secretion of MG53 from a transgenic mouse model, will effectively activate satellite cells and muscle regeneration following injury. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy for sustained elevation of MG53 in circulation to preserve muscle integrity/satellite cell activation/fibrosis control in animal models of muscular dystrophy. Fulfillment of the studies in this project will advance the biology of MG53 in muscle injury-repair and regeneration, and lay the foundation for our translational approach for targeting MG53 function for treatment of muscular dystrophy."

This objective will be met through successful completion of four specific aims. The first aim involves execution of the two- semester capstone design experience by multi-disciplinary student teams consisting of seniors in Engineering and Business who will work together to develop, construct and potentially patent designs. The two-semester course sequence begins with clinical rotations where student teams shadow physicians, therapists and medical personnel, facilitating identification of real clinical needs for improved instrument/devic design. The second aim is to incorporate guest lectures by UAB Business faculty and local entrepreneurs to enhance student exposure to real-world product development and business models, including regulatory issues and successful project management techniques. The third aim involves immersion of students in a manufacturing rotation where they will gain hands-on experience associated with state-of-the-art manufacturing methods for metals and plastics, quality assessment and control, and good manufacturing practices (GMP). The fourth aim is the initiation of an innovation partnership with the UAB Department of Neurosurgery that will expand the scope and types of projects available to our students. Successful completion of these aims will result in measurable enhancements of the current undergraduate design experience at UAB, while fulfilling the NIBIB mission to improve public health by producing a BME workforce that can develop and successfully translate their design ideas to reach intended end-users. The proposed activities are distinct from and complimentary to the existing senior capstone design experience. The deepened alignment with academic medicine and medical device manufacturing will provide cohesive and engaging hands-on experiences and will encourage entrepreneurial approaches to solving health problems. Results will be disseminated through journals and technical conferences on engineering education, through local K-12 outreach and dedicated links on our department website. Assessment of student learning through application of direct and indirect measurement tools will provide immediate feedback for continuous quality improvement of the capstone experience. An External Advisory Board will assess program success and advise future enhancements to the newly developed collaborations between the UAB School of Engineering, School of Business, and Hospital, as well as local industry and manufacturing."
"9259936","Human Phenotyping Core PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Studies of the molecular physiology and genetics of body weight regulation are increasingly dependent upon highly sensitive and accurate measurements of energy expenditure, body composition, adipose tissue biology, ingestive behaviors and brain imaging, as are the analyses of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Hence, the current Human Phenotyping Core (HPC) and affiliated laboratories are critical resources in the NYONRC's (and NIH's) commitment to advance understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity. The combined HPC resources are unique to the NYONRC, and the laboratories attract students and visiting scientists at all levels from around the world. The use of the HPC laboratory by Members/Users continues to grow. The HPC has provided consultative advice to investigators on phenotypes to be measured and the interpretation of these tests. The HPC has a large training function and is therefore highly responsive to the needs of Members and allows for greater productivity at lesser cost for them. The Research Base includes a large group of federally funded investigators who require the methodologies offered in the HPC to conduct their studies. The facilities and services provided by this Core are unique and not available commercially or to the individual Core users (reasons include too costly, too labor-intensive, or too specialized). During this current cycle, 18 investigators with support from 18 NIH grants that included 3 NYONRC Pilot & Feasibility awards submitted 9000 Core service requests, which were met, contributing to 108 peer-reviewed publications and the generation of 21 grant applications (14 funded and 7 pending). The overall objective of the HPC is to enhance and expand the research capabilities of investigators performing clinical and translational studies in humans related to obesity and eating disorders and their related physiological/medical phenotypes. The Specific Aims of the HPC are to: 1) Make available to Center members specialized measurements in body composition, energy expenditure, imaging & analysis, and adipose tissue analysis in human subjects; 2) Provide investigators with consultation/advice in determining which methods or combination of methods are best suited to their needs based on the scientific questions in the context of budgetary constraints; 3) Provide a setting in which instruction in these technologies and strategies can be provided to students, postdoctoral research fellows, and interested scientists; 4) Sponsor and participate in the conduct of periodic seminars on state-of-the-art body composition, energy expenditure, sleep physiology, imaging analysis, adipose tissue analysis, with ultimate emphasis on those aspects of greatest relevance to the problem of human obesity; 5) Provide reduced-cost access to these technologies to NYONRC Pilot and Feasibility recipients and post-doctoral fellows; 6) Advance/develop non-invasive, in-vivo methodology for body composition and energy expenditure measurements in infants, children, and adults."

The meeting will assemble leaders in the field, together with junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, to discuss the latest advances in our understanding of metabolic regulation and its role in normal physiology as well as a variety of disease states ranging from obesity to cancer. Metabolic processes are required for life, and are remarkably similar from organism to organism and from cell to cell. In mammals, specific cell types use metabolic pathways in highly specialized ways to conduct their cell-specific functions. Further, the specialized function of some cell types serves to maintain metabolic homeostasis of the, multicellular organism by regulating levels of hormone and metabolite messengers in the bloodstream. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes result when those processes fail. At the same time, cancer is increasingly recognized as a state whereby the malignant cell proliferates by altering its fuel metabolism and ignoring metabolic signals. The meeting will cover a broad spectrum of topics ranging from regulation of metabolism in many different cell types to dysregulated metabolism in a variety of disease states. Each session will be chaired by a leading scientist in the field. Oral presentations will be given by a group of distinguished invited speakers as well as speakers selected from submitted abstracts. Selected speakers will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty aiming for maximal inclusion of young investigators. Of special importance are the two poster sessions, where many participants can present their work in an atmosphere conducive to informal discussion. The meeting will be of moderate size, and we expect about 250 people to attend, the vast majority of whom will be presenting a poster or talk."

"9301690","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Clinical Evaluation of a Resorbable Inferior Vena Cava Filter  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the 3rd leading cause of death, claiming the lives of at least 100,000 Americans annually ? more than breast cancer, AIDS, and vehicle fatalities combined. Metallic Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filters have been proven effective in reducing PE to about 1-2% in at risk populations; however, they come with a heavy post deployment price, namely the expensive retrieval procedure and long term complications such as caval penetration and end organ puncture.  Our proposal is the continued development to FDA clearance of the first totally absorbable IVC filter to prevent PE. Following dissolution of blood clots, the filter itself vanishes into CO2 and H2O within 8 months. The value proposition is the prevention of PE without requiring filter removal, and alleviation of life-threatening, long term complications of metallic IVC filters. The IVC filter prophylaxis market has been growing 26% annually and is currently $500M, with an untapped market opportunity of approximately 10-fold.  This Phase IIB SBIR program is focused on advancing the totally absorbable IVC filter and delivery system through a clinical trial at leading US academic hospitals in the pursuit of FDA 510(k) clearance. Phase II feasibility has been established with MD Anderson Cancer Center and validated through 5 publications in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. These studies have demonstrated preliminary safety and efficacy in large animals where the filter provided 100% clot capture when challenged with thrombus, without filter migration (0%), caval penetration (0%), caval thrombosis (0%) or PE (0%).  The FDA has been very receptive to our totally absorbable IVC filter and claimed our approach is both ?comprehensive? and ?well thought out? following our two Pre-submission meetings. Aim 1: Complete Filter and Delivery System - finalize filter and catheter delivery system with goals:  ? Meet ISO medical device standards: 37137,10993,25539-3,17137,10555-1,11070,11135,11607-1,  ? Demonstrate one-year shelf life in real-time aging studies, and 95% functionality with 100 units. Aim 2: Conduct US Pivotal Clinical Study ? conduct multicenter clinical trial (6 month follow up) with goals:  ? Recruit 80 patients (70% with proven VTE and contraindicated to anticoagulants, 30% prophylaxis),  ? 82% clinical success (successful technical deployment without subsequent PE or other complications),  ? Pulmonary embolism ? 5%, IVC filter occlusion ? 10%, and filter migration ? 1% per SIR guidelines, Aim 3: File Regulatory Submissions ? file appropriate regulatory documents in collaboration with CRO:  ?

"9246583","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Step asymmetry post-stroke (i.e., limp) substantially affects the quality of life of stroke survivors because it impairs patients' mobility, thereby limiing their daily activities and increasing their dependency on others. Consequently, a primary interest for patients, clinicians, and researchers is to correct the step asymmetry in stroke survivors. Promising studies show that patients can re-learn to walk symmetrically if their step asymmetry is exaggerated with a split-belt treadmill that moves the legs at different speeds. While these results are encouraging, gait improvements are highly contextual and do not persist when walking over ground. To address this critical issue for gait rehabilitation, the PI is proposing a combination of computational and experimental approaches to identify key factors regulating the generalization of locomotor learning after stroke. The PI's central hypothesis is that inherent features from one's movement (e.g., kinematic errors and walking speed) regulate the generalization of locomotor learning. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of the PI's preliminary data showing more generalization of treadmill learning to over ground walking when kinematic errors or walking speed during split-belt adaptation are similar to those naturally experienced. In the proposed computational approach, model inputs are errors that subjects experience during split-belt walking (for example, unexpected leg motions disturbing one's balance), model outputs are actions to correct these errors (for example, a larger step to prevent falling). The mathematical relationship between inputs and outputs is used to predict the effect of error size (Aim 1) and walking speed (Aim 2) on the generalization of learning in an individual basis. Once factors mediating the generalization of learning are identified, they can be harnessed to develop interventions that improve the gait of stroke survivors during real-life situations. PI qualifications: the PI is a prolific and creative bioengineer. Her first class trainng in physics, biomechanics, and neuroscience, in addition to her strong interest in rehabilitation make her the adequate individual for doing the proposed work. Her studies in human motor control are well recognized (>700 citations; h-index 11) in a relatively short, but highly productive academic career. Through this award she will receive mentorship from two extraordinary investigators with complementary expertise: Michael Boninger, MD, PhD. (clinical rehabilitation) and Reza Shadmehr, PhD (computational motor control). They will serve as primary co-mentors. In addition the PI will receive mentorship from an expert panel of collaborators including Dr. Subashan Perera (biostatistics), Dr. Steven Graham (neurology), Dr. Julie Fiez (neuropsychology) and Dr. Skidmore (post-stroke rehabilitation). Thus, this award will provide the mentorship and career development allowing the PI to become an independent researcher able to compete for R01-level funding to study gait deficits post-stroke through computational modeling."
"9252502","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina has some of the largest health disparities in the nation, and these are invariably more extreme in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans. The chronic diseases that present the greatest public health challenges are now known to be inflammation related, and AAs tend to have greater inherent sensitivity to inflammation modulators. The proposed dissemination and implementation research is based on our efficacious intervention trial, Diet & Activity Community Trial: High-Risk Inflammation [R24 MD002769- 01], which focused on diet, physical activity, and stress reduction in collaboration with the AA faith community to reduce inflammation (referred to as the HEALS intervention). Extraordinary success in engaging the AA faith and greater AA community allows us to propose to disseminate and implement this intervention. We will ensure that the proposed dissemination and implementation research contributes to achieving our overall goal of reducing health disparities among AAs through the following specific aims: (1) Disseminate and implement the successful HEALS intervention in the AA faith community; (2) Evaluate and monitor the dissemination process for adoption, recruitment, retention, and fidelity to the HEALS intervention trial including testing the effect of the disseminated intervention using a variety of non-invasive measures that are relevant to overall health status, proven to be related to chronic inflammation in the intervention-phase trial, and that can (and will) be employed in a community setting; (3) Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities in parameters associated with inflammation, from both budgetary and societal perspectives; and (4) Enhance the capacity of the target community to sustain the delivery of the evidence-based intervention and for community partners to engage in future research and programming to address health disparities through cultivation of a network of active church and community educators and leadership development activities. We will utilize a community-based participatory research approach to recruit 30 churches and 450 participants using a lay health, train-the-trainer model that decentralizes the research process and is suitable for dissemination and implementation research. We also will engage 30 mentor lay health educators (members of church education teams) who participated in the intervention trial phase to mentor and train newly recruited lay health educators for church education teams for the proposed dissemination and implementation research. We propose to use non-invasive approaches to measure key variables during dissemination and implementation. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important component and will yield information on required inputs and outputs. The proposed research offers an opportunity to build upon a history of successful collaboration by disseminating and implementing evidence- based intervention with a focus on sustainability of efforts through capacity-building and leadership development to address health disparities in the AA community to address health disparities."
"9276319","Abstract Hematopoiesis is regulated by transcription factors that activate lineage-specific programs. Transcription initiates, and pauses; the pause is then released, a process guided by cdk9, a kinase that phosphorylates Pol II. TIF1? is a chromatin factor that is mutated in the bloodless moonshine zebrafish mutant: we have demonstrated that a mouse knockout of TIF1? has decreased marrow erythropoiesis, no B cells, and expanded myelopoiesis. Using chemical genetics in the zebrafish, we found that clofibrate and leflunomide, activators of the nuclear receptors PPAR? and SXR, rescue blood development in the moonshine mutant. We now propose to examine the genetic program that establishes this rescue, including an evaluation of gene expression in the rescued mutants. We will purify the PPAR? and SXR complexes by affinity tagging and mass spectroscopy, and use zebrafish genetics to establish the downstream pathways that affect the rescue. A prior genetic screen for moonshine demonstrated rescue with mutations in the PAF1 complex or in spt5, both of which regulate transcription elongation. The paf1 zebrafish mutant is rescued by mating to a cdk9 mutant, which suggests that some transcripts hyper-elongate in the paf1 mutant. A recent large-scale knockdown screen for chromatin factors that are required for erythropoiesis during zebrafish development revealed that antisense morpholinos to 6 chromatin factors reduce red blood cell development, and knockdown of 9 chromatin factors increases erythropoiesis: we will assess whether these chromatin factor genes can be rescued by mutations in PAF1, spt5, or cdk9. We will also determine whether activators of specific nuclear hormone pathways can rescue the chromatin factor mutants. Our study will provide a comprehensive analysis of chromatin factors and how they regulate transcription elongation, and will offer the clinical opportunity to modify these pathways for the treatment of blood diseases such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. 1"
"9262126","Reduced glucose metabolism always accompanies Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the decline is highly correlated with the decline in cognition. Promotion of AD pathology by manipulation of glucose/oxygen utilization in pre-clinical models supports the possibility that these deficits are not mere consequences of the disease, but promote the disease and are potential therapeutic targets. An understanding of the underlying basis for the decline in glucose utilization and its consequences are required to therapeutically target glucose utilization. The decline in mental function before AD patients die is highly correlated to changes in the activities of enzymes related to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle including the entry level enzyme- the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and the rate controlling step-?-ketoglutrate dehydrogenase (KGDHC. The proposed studies will test the overall hypothesis that the changes in the TCA cycle underlie the abnormal metabolism and pathology in AD and that reversing them or the downstream consequences will benefit AD patients. We propose that determining the post-translational modifications that diminish the activity of KGDHC in brains from AD patients will reveal the cause of the modification and suggest effective ways to reverse the deficit. The possibility that KGDHC and PDHC may directly modify other TCA cycle enzymes will be tested. The experiments will test whether diminished KGDHC alters the response to drugs that promote mitogenesis and determine the link between the KGDHC and signals for mitochondrial repair in order to manipulate them to enhance mitochondrial repair. Surprisingly little is known about the response of the genes and proteins of the entire TCA cycle to metabolic perturbations and some ?mitogenic? therapies may diminish activities. Thus, the proposal is to test the response of these enzymes at the level of the gene, activity and protein (including post-translational modifications by acetyl or succinyl groups) to select metabolic perturbations to determine better therapeutic targets. The experiments will test the hypothesis that changes in the mitochondrial TCA cycle and the consequent downstream signaling changes are central to the disease process and provide a therapeutic target that is not responsive to mitogenic therapies. Successful completion of these studies will identify additional mechanisms to reverse the deficits and ameliorate the disease process. "
"9292312","Project Abstract  The genetic hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in at least 90% of CML cases. This translocation leads to the production of functional BCR-ABL fusion tyrosin kinase, conferring a proliferative advantage to the tumor cells. Prior to the introduction of Gleevec in 2001, the first tyrosine kinase inhbitor (TKI), the only cure for CML was hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, and the median survival of all patients was 4-5 yrs. Since the introduction of Gleevec, ~87% of patients are expected to be alive at 8 yrs of follow up.  CML patients are recommended to continue TKI therapy indefinitely, despite significant side effects associated with long-term use of TKI and financial burden on the US health care system. Several small clinical studies suggest that about 50% of CML patients can maintain complete molecular response (CMR) even after discontinuing TKIs; patients who relapse after discontinuation can restart with TKI to achieve CMR. With annual costs of $100,000 per patient, an estimated prevalence of 70,000 patients in 2010 alone, and with an estimated 36% of patients in stable CMR, a discontinuation rate of 50% could lead to savings of over $500 million to the US health care system each year. However, it is not possible to predict the cohort of patients who may have recurrence after TKI discontinuation. This is caused in part by the inability of current assay based on real-time PCR for accurately assessing BCR-ABL transcripts when they are present at very low levels.  Preliminary studies suggest low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts present in CML patient samples that are undetectable by real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) may be detected and quantified by digital PCR, which in turn can be used to differentiate recurring from non-recurring patients after discontinuation of TKIs. To confirm this hypothesis, we propose to develop a new digital PCR platform with the requisite workflow and minimal user interference, thus improving reliability and accuracy of the results. With this new capability, we will analyze archived CML samples with linked clinical outcome data. This project therefore has the potential to provide a molecular diagnostic assay capable of predicting recurrence after TKI discontinuation. In addition to enabling monitoring of BCR-ABL transcripts from CML patients with minimal residual disease, this new digital PCR technology will advance current PCR measurements, especially in the clinical setting, so digital PCR will be adopted for use in a wide range of clinical diagnostic and prognostic tests."
"9461670","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human brain selectively processes the visual information that enters the eyes, prioritizing some parts of the available information over others. This is called visual attention, and it plays a central role in determining what we see and how well we see it. Visual attention is allocated flexibly across space and dynamically across time, but most studies of visual attention have focused on its spatial aspects. Here, I propose to study temporal attention: the dynamic fluctuations of visual attention over time. I propose to develop and then empirically test a computational model of temporal attention that specifies how different types of temporal attention dynamically interact to affect visual responses. This work will unify different sources of temporal attention, previously investigated separately, into a singe theoretical framework, accounting for a range of previous findings. My proposed experiments to distinguish between alternative candidate models will identify neural processes that underlie the fluctuations and limitations of visual attention over time.  In Aim 1, I will develop a model that integrates two types of temporal attention: involuntary temporal attention, which is automatically evoked by the presentation of a behaviorally relevant stimulus, and voluntary temporal attention, which is the deliberate control of attentional allocation over time. These processes work together to prioritize processing and enhance perception of a visual stimulus at a time when it is likely to be most useful for behavior. My empirical studies (Aims 2 and 3) will systematically investigate how they are integrated and provide precise measures of their individual and joint time courses in humans. The studies will also clarify the sources of temporal attentional limitations in visual processing. Informed by model predictions, I will test hypotheses about how involuntary and voluntary temporal attention jointly influence the gain of visual responses dynamically over time, using both behavioral measures of visual sensitivity (Aim 2) and MEG measures of the sensitivity of cortical neuronal responses to visual stimuli (Aim 3).  During this fellowship, I will receive training in behavioral, computational, and cognitive neuroscience methods through interactions with my research mentors, the broader NYU neuroscience community, and formal coursework. The proposed research is fully in line with the NEI mission. It investigates visual attention, an important mechanism of visual function (NEI Mission Statement). Further, as the dynamic allocation of attention is a central function of the visual system, the proposed research in healthy observers is readily applicable to translational research in special populations, and may clarify previously observed temporal attentional differences in individuals with visual neglect and ADHD."
"9252299","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's Disease (HD) is a debilitating autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, characterized by slow-onset cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and loss of motor function. There is currently no cure. It is estimated that 1 in every 10,000 people in Western countries are affected or at risk for inheriting  the disease from an affected parent. The genetic origin of this disease is a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (Htt) gene. The mechanism of neurodegeneration is not fully understood, but recent studies sug- gest that transient neuronal knockdown of Htt mRNA can reverse disease progression without compromising normal cellular function in vivo. RNA interference via siRNA is the most promising therapeutic approach for transient Htt mRNA silencing. Treatment of HD and other neurodegenerative diseases with siRNA is particular- ly challenging, however, because siRNAs do not cross the blood-brain barrier and must be directly injected into the brain. Unmodified siRNAs directly injected into the brain are rapidly degraded or cleared through the cere- brospinal fluid. Typical siRNA formulations (e.g., lipid nanoparticles cholesterol bioconjugates) that improve retention and cellular uptake in other organs show pronounced toxicity when administered in the brain. There is a clear, unmet need for methods that improve neuronal delivery of therapeutic siRNAs and minimize off-target effects, toxicity, and immunogenicity.  We have synthesized and evaluated an extensive panel of naturally occurring, neuroactive conjugates for brain delivery (including steroids, dopamine reuptake inhibitors, gangliosides, and polyunsaturated fatty acids). We discovered that docosahexaneoic acid (DHA) is amenable to hsiRNA conjugation and exhibits an optimal hydrophobicity profile for brain retention, distribution, and global Htt mRNA silencing. Following a single, intra- cranial injection, DHA-hsiRNA shows diffuse spread and Htt knockdown in the tissues primarily affected by HD. Moreover, there are no indications of neuronal death or immune system stimulation following administration of doses in great excess of what is required for activity. This level of tolerance and diffusion following a single, direct injection has never been documented for a CNS-directed oligonucleotide therapeutic. The mechanism behind this unprecedented safety is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of DHA-conjugated oligonucleotides in the brain of Huntington's disease mice. This will be accomplished by determining the mechanism of DHA-hsiRNA uptake and metabo- lism and evaluating efficacy and toxicity in Q140 mice, a transgenic strain expressing 140 CAG repeats.  The completion of this proposal will offer new insight into the chemical design of siRNAs for delivery to brain. Successful completion will overcome a significant obstacle to the use of siRNA for the treatment of HD and potentially other autosomal-dominant neurological diseases."

"9326448","PROJECT ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) impacts millions of people worldwide, creating a significant burden on healthcare costs and decreasing quality of life for those affected. The pathological processes due to DM manifest severely in the nervous system. DM-induced nerve damage often presents as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), where sensory nerve loss leads to concurrent pain and numbness, particularly in the limbs. DPN also manifests itself in the cornea, where a high density of sensory nerves makes it particularly susceptible to the effects of hyperglycemia, resulting in a complication termed diabetic neurotrophic keratopathy (DNK). The loss of sensation and neurotrophic nourishments makes patient susceptible to injuries, increasing the likelihood of persistent or unhealable wound, ulceration, infection and possibly blindness. Moreover, the ability of the injured corneal sensory nerve to regenerate is impaired in the diabetic patients. Knowledge of the processes that guide nerve regeneration and pathological mechanisms of DM in delaying this process are still largely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to identify the roles of the class 3 semaphorins in mediating the regeneration of the corneal sensory nerves, and whether their expression and function are altered in diabetes. The semaphorins are a family of proteins most well-known for their ability to act as directional cues to growing axons in the embryo. Our recent data suggests that expression of Sema3C is up-regulated in the corneal epithelium after wounding and this up-regulation is suppressed in diabetic cornea. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that expression of the Sema3s and their receptors are altered after corneal wounding in a manner conducive to increased axon regeneration, and that this healing response is perturbed by DM. This proposal will first examine time-dependent expression changes of these molecules in both epithelium and trigeminal/sensory nerves after wounding in normal and diabetic mouse corneas. The functions of the various Sema3s and therapeutic potential of Sema3C in sensory nerve regeneration, particularly in diabetic corneas, will then be assessed both in vitro and in vivo. The results from this proposal should increase our understanding of DNK at the molecular and cellular levels, and may lead to the development of therapies that treat DPN, where there is great unmet clinical need. Completion of the proposed study will provide the trainee with additional independence in how to ask a scientific question, design a study, discuss the results with others, and use data to generate future questions; these are skills important to both basic science research as well as clinical medicine, and will ensure a successful and productive career as a physician-scientist."
"9254433","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This is an application for a Career Development Award (CDA-2) for Dr. John Greenland, a staff physician in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Section of the San Francisco VA Medical Service who is establishing himself as an investigator in patient-oriented research into the immunology of lung transplantation. This CDA-2 award will provide Dr. Greenland with the necessary support to accomplish the following goals: (1) to improve the understanding of predictors of chronic lung rejection, (2) to acquire theoretical and practical skills in bioinformatics and advanced T cell immunology, (3) to establish the mechanistic foundations for future interventional trials to improve post-lung transplant surveillance, and (4) to establish an independent clinical research career focused on lung transplantation immunology. To achieve these goals, Dr. Greenland has assembled a mentoring team consisting of (1) primary mentor Dr. George Caughey, an internationally respected authority in pulmonary immunology with a track record of mentoring translational researchers, (2) Dr. David Daikh, a recognized translational T cell immunologist, (3) Dr. Qizhi Tang, an expert in human transplant immunology; and (4) Dr. Jeffrey Golden, who has over 25 years of experience with clinical research in lung transplantation. Additionally, he will benefit from tutorials and mentorship from Drs. Nick Jewell, Scott Boyd, and Kirk Jones, in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and pathology, respectively; and research support from Drs. Lewis Lanier and Mark Ansel. The proposed research expands on Dr. Greenland's recently published findings that lymphocytic bronchitis (LB) on post-lung transplant surveillance biopsy predicts the development of chronic rejection in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The proposed study will establish a prospective cohort of lung transplant recipients to achieve the following specific aims: (1) determine the phenotype and specificity of infiltrating T cells in LB, (2) assess regulatory, humoral, and innate lymphocyte responses during LB, and (3) prospectively assess LB as a predictor of BOS. These studies will make use of next-generation flow cytometry and sequencing techniques to characterize immune responses in peripheral blood, airway brushings and biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients undergoing post-transplant surveillance bronchoscopy. A better understanding of LB may allow it to become an important biomarker for the development of BOS, while understanding LB in the context of the post-lung transplantation donor-specific immune response will lead to new tools for optimizing immunosuppression and inducing tolerance."
"9230850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term goal of this Research Program is to understand how newly translated proteins fold in eukaryotic cells. The proposed research will focus on folding events as they occur at the ribosome during synthesis of a polypeptide and will examine the role of molecular chaperones in their folding process. The conceptual framework for understanding de novo protein folding originates from our work in the previous funding cycle, which showed that a network of chaperones named CLIPS (Chaperones Linked to Protein Synthesis) is physically and functionally linked to the translation machinery. Our working hypothesis is that the CLIPS chaperones are tasked with guiding newly synthesized polypeptides to their folded conformation. Chaperone-mediated folding pathways appear to involve the cooperation of different classes of CLIPS, including chaperones that act early in the folding process, such as the Nascent Chain Associated Complex (NAC), the Hsp70 proteins and the GIM/prefoldin complex, and the mechanistically distinct chaperones TRiC/CCT and Hsp90, which appear to act later in the folding process. Our general strategy to elucidate how chaperones mediate the folding of newly synthesized proteins relies on the close integration of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our proposed experiments are aimed at obtaining functional, mechanistic and structural insights into the role of chaperones in de novo folding."
"9327481","Project Summary  The manner by which adipose tissue remodels during obesity is a key determinant of metabolic health. Expansion through the formation of new adipocytes (hyperplasia) is more metabolically favorable than through the enlargement of existing adipocytes (hypertrophy). Moreover, individuals that store excess adipose tissue preferentially in the subcutaneous region (typically females) have a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome than those that store adipose tissue predominately in the visceral region (typically males). Our lab has recently identified cells of mural origin that contribute to adipogenesis in the gonadal depot of the male mouse during high fat diet feeding. However, the contribution of these cells to other adipose depots in male mice, as well as in female mice, has not been explored. In this proposal, we aim to characterize mural cell adipogenesis in subcutaneous and gonadal adipose depots in male as well as female mice. This will shed insight into the differential regulation of adipogenesis in a sex- and depot-dependent manner. Mural preadipocyte cells can be identified by the expression of Zfp423. Zfp423 is a transcription factor that regulates Ppar?, the master regulator of adipogenesis. Using novel inducible gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, we propose to investigate the functional role of Zfp423 in mural cell adipogenesis in adult mice. We hypothesize that Zfp423 is necessary and sufficient to stimulate healthy adipocyte hyperplasia during high fat diet feeding. The experiments in this proposal will explore the unique metabolic outcomes of manipulating adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. Moreover, these studies will uncover new insight into the regulation of adipogenesis in the adult. "
"9249643","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world. Epidemiological studies have  shown the profound importance that the prenatal period has on life-long health. A likely explanation for this  relationship is that the late fetal period, a period of robust growth, determines the number of cardiomyocytes  and the structure of the coronary vasculature for life. Adverse intrauterine conditions leading to fetal growth  restriction alter cardiac load and compromise heart growth. While the ability of adult heart to adapt to  cardiovascular disease is limited, the fetal heart is highly plastic, undergoing rapid adaptation to best meet  intrauterine conditions. The number of fetal cardiomyocytes and the anatomical dimensions of the fetal  coronary circulation are not fixed but can be changed, both up and down, by prenatal conditions. Unfortunately,  fetal responses to sub-optimal intrauterine environments may not lead to favorable outcomes in the fetus or  later in the adult. It will not be possible to understand the devastating effects of intrauterine growth retardation  on the fetal myocardium unless we deliberately study cardiomyocyte and coronary microvascular growth in a  well controlled experimental load model.   The overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that fetal heart growth is exquisitely sensitive to  hemodynamic load and that altered growth leads to irreversible changes in cardiac myocyte and coronary  vascular function for life. The proposed experiments will demonstrate for the first time the precise responses  that determine how the fetal heart adapts to changes in loading conditions during late gestation when all the  terminal maturation processes are underway.   Completion of the proposed work will provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between fetal  cardiomyocyte and coronary vascular growth, how this interrelationship affects fetal cardiac function, which  changes persist into adulthood and how adult heart function is affected. This work is an essential step in  understanding the mechanisms responsible for the association between fetal growth restriction and adult  cardiovascular disease."
"9258478","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to decipher cell type-specific crosstalk of signaling pathways in hematopoiesis and hematological diseases. This application is compelled by our new and surprising data indicating that two well-known signal regulators, Pten and Shp2, can work cooperatively or antagonistically in different blood cell lineages. Thus, the outcome of signal interplay in different cell types cannot be simply deduced from previously known functions for each molecule.  Shp2 is a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase possessing two SH2 domains that promotes Erk signaling, and dominantly activating mutations in PTPN11/Shp2 have leukemogenic effect. Ablating Shp2 suppressed hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in mice, defining a positive role of Shp2 in hematopoiesis. In contrast, Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway and is frequently mutated in human leukemia. Targeted deletion of Pten resulted in dramatic expansion of short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), excessive myeloid cell proliferation and development of leukemia.  To test whether Pten and Shp2 have directly opposing functions in leukemogenesis, we generated conditional Pten and Shp2 double knockout (DKO) mice. Preliminary data suggest that additional deletion of Shp2 indeed suppressed excessive myeloid cell proliferation and leukemia induced by Pten-deficiency as expected, but surprisingly the Pten and Shp2 DKO mice developed lethal anemia. These results argue that although Shp2 and Pten have antagonistic roles in myeloid cells, these two regulators act in concert to promote red blood cell (RBC) development and maturation. This application seeks to elucidate the opposing as well as cooperating functions of Shp2 and Pten in blood cells. We will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell type-specific crosstalk of Shp2- and Pten-modulated signals. The success of this project will not only advance our understanding of the interactive molecular pathways driving hematopoiesis in mammals, but also suggest better therapeutic strategies for leukemia and anemia."
"9253031","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central goal of this project is to identify and characterize small molecule inhibitors of Ubiquitin specific peptidase 51 (USP51), a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme exclusive to sperm, as a means to develop a reversible, non-hormonal male contraceptive. The ubiquitin system is fundamental to ensure protein turnover within mammalian cells. Ubiquitin-activating enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin protein ligases catalyze the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to proteins, a process that targets them to the proteasome for degradation. DUBs catalyze the removal of ubiquitin to facilitate their recycling. We have identified USP51 to be specifically expressed in late elongating spermatids and epididymal sperm. USP51 depletion in mice using Vivo-Morpholinos results in male infertility due to a complete block of sperm motility.  Our overall hypothesis is tat USP51 is a viable contraceptive target and that small molecules existing in nature or modified in the laboratory will effectively and reversibly inhibit USP51 function in epididymal sperm. We will pursue the following Specific Aims to address this hypothesis: 1) Validate the targeting of USP51 as an effective strategy for contraceptive development. 2) Screen small molecule libraries in silico and in vitro to identify hit compounds. 3) Perform hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry optimization and assess the exposure of sperm, testes and animals to candidates for efficacy and reversibility. These studies will advance our basic understanding of spermatogenesis and sperm function, as well as provide the potential for developing new contraceptive agents that reversibly inhibit a critical sperm enzyme."
"9285851","ABSTRACT Anemia is a common medical condition with significant morbidity and mortality, especially if present with other diseases. The development of recombinant Erythropoietin (Epo), a pro-erythrocyte hormone produced in adult kidney and liver during anemia, revolutionized anemia treatment. Unfortunately, non- physiological bolus Epo also promotes thrombosis, hypertension, and cancer growth. Furthermore, many anemia patients are iron deficient and require parenteral or intra-venous iron supplements, which are poorly tolerated. Endogenous Epo production and iron uptake are tightly controlled by the stress- responsive transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 2 (HIF-2). During hypoxia, HIF-2 undergoes cyclical acetylation/deacetylation modifications, which augment HIF-2 signaling. HIF-2 acetylation is rate-limiting and conferred selectively by the acetyltransferase Cbp. Acetylation of HIF-2 by Cbp is regulated by a specific acetyl CoA generator, acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (Acss2), which normally is present in the cytosol. Acetate, whether generated endogenously in anemic mice or provided exogenously as a therapeutic intervention, functions as a biochemical flare to activate Cbp- mediated HIF-2 acetylation and is accompanied by the de novo appearance of nuclear Acss2. We hypothesize that acetate induces translocation of Acss2 from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it generates a specific acetyl CoA pool used by Cbp to acetylate HIF-2 and augment HIF-2 signaling. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism and biological role for Acss2 in mammals. We will do so with three aims employing integrative molecular, cellular, and animal studies. First, we will identify the molecular basis for Acss2 nuclear localization using molecular and biochemical assessments in cell culture models. Second, we will assess how restricting Acss2 to the cytosol or changing the genetic background of an Acss2 null mutation through CRISPR-modified targeting or congenic breedings in mice, respectively, affects the erythropoietic response to anemia. Third, we will determine what effect cell-specific ablation of Acss2 has on molecular and physiological responses to acute anemia and iron uptake in mice. Deciphering how the acetate/Acss2 switch regulates HIF-2 signaling will provide key insights into a novel signal transduction mechanism. Defining its role in the mammalian response to anemia will foster innovative and economical treatment strategies for anemic patients, which may significantly reduce costs associated with current approaches."
"9213306","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Over 40,000 Veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War (GW) have a persistent form of chronic multisymptom illness that defines Gulf War Veterans Illness (GWVI). With no existing proven treatments to provide relief to these sufferers, it is critical to find efficacious and acceptable treatments for GWVI.  Our long-term goal is to develop a safe, readily available, mind-body treatment to reduce pain and other chronic symptoms and enhance wellness in Veterans with GWVI. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body therapy that has been practiced for centuries. In the last decade, we have demonstrated that Tai Chi can improve both physical health and psychological well-being in patients with a variety of chronic conditions.  The proposed randomized trial will establish the effectiveness of a Tai Chi mind-body treatment in Veterans with GWVI. One hundred and twenty participants meeting criteria for GWVI will be randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi exercise or a stretching and wellness education group for 12 weeks with a post-treatment assessment, and follow-up assessments. For an exploratory sub-study, 40 Veterans (approximately 20 from each condition) will undergo MRI scanning at each assessment point. We will accomplish the following Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention will reduce symptoms of pain in Veterans with GWVI more than the Wellness intervention. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will show a greater reduction in pain symptoms than those in the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period.  Specific Aim 2: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention improves fatigue, cognition, quality of life, and physical functioning in GW Veterans with GWVI, as compared to the Wellness intervention. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will evidence more improvement in fatigue, cognitive functioning, quality of life, and physical functioning than those  randomized to the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period.  Specific Aim 3: Explore a potential neurobiological mechanism by which Tai Chi can reduce pain and other symptoms and improve quality of life in Veterans with GWVI. We hypothesize differences in resting state fMRI and on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention compared with Wellness intervention participants and that these differences will maintain over the 9-month follow-up period.  The proposed trial, informed by our prior investigations, with a robust study design and strong research team, will produce valuable results that can have a direct and immediate impact on healthcare practices for GWVI. If proven as an effective treatment for the symptoms of GWVI, this non-pharmaceutical treatment could easily be implemented in VA facilities, and Veterans could be taught how to continue to practice independently within their own homes. Providing GW Veterans even moderate relief from chronic and debilitating symptoms of GWVI could have a profound impact on improving their overall sense of well-being and quality of life, the ultimate measure of treatment efficacy."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the next several decades there will continue to be a demand for scientists who have a thorough understanding of the functional abilities of older adults given the ever-increasing number of seniors in the general population. The goal of this Training Program, entitled Research Training in Cognitive Aging, is to train predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers who will pursue careers in which they can use their expertise in cognitive aging to improve the lives of aging adults, advancing science and practice as well as contributing to the education of future cognitive aging researchers. Our Training Program is designed to produce PhD and postdoctoral researchers who are well-trained in theories, methodological techniques, and practical aspects of conducting research on aging and cognition. Our focus, historically, has been to emphasize training in basic and applied aspects of cognition from the perspective of cognitive psychology. Our approach is to train scientists with specific expertise on psychological approaches to studying cognition who can collaborate in interdisciplinary research teams to study aging (e.g., cognitive neuroscience, human factors). Our program provides training in (a) experimental approaches to assessing cognitive processing and mechanisms; (b) differential approaches to measuring cognitive constructs, relevant psychological traits, and background characteristics that may be associated with differential outcomes (e.g., transition to dementia); and (c) designs and statistical methods for analyzing data from experiments (including training and intervention studies), surveys, and longitudinal panel designs relevant to research questions about cognitive aging. Our trainees leave the program with expertise in how to assess cognition and cognitive mechanisms. They understand how to conduct research focusing on basic cognitive mechanisms, expertise, and knowledge structures and how they change (normatively and non-normatively) across the adult life span. They are also trained in how to apply knowledge about cognitive aging to improving the quality of life of older adults. Our Training Program has been successful because it has evolved to reflect advancements in science and the growing needs of an aging society. Our core faculty members represent the broad space of 'cognitive aging research' and provide trainees with the research experience and skills they need as scholar- scientists of the 21st century. We have a rich network at Georgia Tech and in the Atlanta community that provides unique interdisciplinary research opportunities for our trainees. Our trainee alumni are highly successful in their chosen careers and are having a broad impact in the research community.

However, short-read sequencing technologies lose critical contiguity information and are limited in assembling genomes de novo and reconstructing maternal and paternal haplotypes of diploid genomes. Contiguity information is valuable for understanding the genetics of human health and disease, and therefore critical for advancing precision and personalized medicine. Long- read technologies (e.g. Pacific Biosciences) only reach megabase-scale chromosomal contiguity, but are 5-7X more expensive than Illumina short-read, limiting its use. Recent advances in DNA preparation can preserve long-range information that is compatible with Illumina short-read sequencing. These ?synthetic? long-reads (or SLR) methods can improve short-read technologies with, long-range contiguity and short-read economy. However, the maximal SLR contiguity is only 1-5% the contiguity a 100Mb average human chromosome. To construct multi-megabase contiguity, SLR methods require genomic DNA (gDNA) fragments >100-150Kb, but obtaining long gDNA fragments is challenging and this limits current SLR methods. Arima Genomics has repurposed HiC technology as an SLR-based DNA preparation kit that preserves chromosome-span contiguity and haplotype phasing that is short-read compatible. Arima key technical innovation is, rather than using purified gDNA, our method leverages the long-contiguity information preserved naturally in the 3-dimensional (3D) organization of genomes in cells, as 3D information is long-range information. By capturing 3D genome information, Arima's Contigo kit reconstructs chromosome-span information. The Contigo kit from Arima therefore has complete contiguity with short-read economy. The Contigo kit is affordable, does not require esoteric reagents, additional skills or equipment, and is compatible with exiting short-read workflows, to offer easy user adoption. In addition, Contigo is the only kit to preserve 3D genomic information essential to interpreting non-coding functional genomics. The Contigo kit has the potential to serve as a new standard in next-generation sequencing with broad applications in genotyping, phasing, allele-specific gene expression and epigenetics on phased genomes, structural variation analyses, metagenomics and 3D genomics. In this proposal we will commercialize the Contigo technology by improving sensitivity to wide range of cell-inputs and uniformity in genome coverage, and enabling 96-well compatibility. In addition, we will design for manufacture, reduce cost and improve sourcing, assure robust performance in real-world shipping and storage conditions, improve user-experience, and finally, benchmark performance of the Contigo kit with domain experts, key opinion leaders, and power users to demonstrate commercial viability."
"9262312","Project Summary Development of an advanced research bioreactor for regenerating lung tissue, including complete human size lungs, is proposed. This reactor will be capable of decellularizing a human-size lung and using the resulting scaffold to bioengineer an autologous lung through recellularization. This requires efficient means to deposit cells and biologics on the airway walls while maintaining the gas-liquid interface and the breathing action. Also, it is desirable to operate the reactor in a closed chamber and automate the process, while closely monitoring the critical process parameters. Our proposed approach is to adapt a proprietary spraying catheter technology to the lung bioreactor and leverage the applicant?s expertise in automation and control to develop the advanced bioreactor system. The proposed airway sprayer will be capable of accessing the trachea and bronchi of the lung scaffold and safely deposit liquids containing cells and biologics on the airway walls. Airway sprayer will generate liquid aerosols that will be transported deep in the lungs with the aid of a ventilator, which will maintain the breathing action during and after the agent delivery. The base technology is already proven to gently aerosolize cells and large molecules. In this Phase I SBIR project, we propose to further develop airway sprayer technology and validate it in an existing bioreactor. We propose to optimize the device for the best cell delivery outcomes and incorporate an angulation mechanism to access the bronchi. Further, we plan to include an aspiration channel in the catheter device to sample cell secretions for efficient monitoring and control of the recellularization process. Successful completion of this work would establish the feasibility of the novel airway recellularization technique. In Phase II, this device will be incorporated in a fully automated lung research bioreactor. This advanced bioreactor system will be commercialized and made available to the research community."
"9291243","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to develop a circuit-level understanding of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) by resolving their molecular and functional diversity and local and long-range connectivity. The LHA is a linchpin in the orchestration of fundamental aspects of behavior including arousal, stress, feeding and motivated behavior. Owing to its unique position at the intersection of multiple neural and humoral systems, the LHA drives essential behavioral programs that maintain homeostatic balance in physiology and behavior. Underlying the diverse functions of the LHA is an exceptionally heterogeneous population of neuronal cell types, of which few have been identified. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the LHA (LHAGABA) have emerged as potent actuators of feeding, reward and stress. However, within this broad class of neurons lie poorly resolved but functionally important subpopulations, which may differentially determine behavioral output. Conventional methods are limited in their ability to decipher the molecular and functional diversity of LHAGABA neurons, which represents a major barrier in our understanding of the role of LHA circuits in health and disease. There is, therefore, a critical need to systematically delineate the neurochemical identity, cellular properties and connectivity of functional subpopulations of LHAGABA neurons as a prerequisite to circuit-level behavioral analyses. To fill this knowledge gap, we will establish the first large-scale and systematic molecular, cellular and connectivity analysis of LHAGABA neurons at single-cell resolution using an integrated approach of electrophysiological phenotyping, optogenetics-based circuit mapping and single-cell transcriptional profiling. Our central hypothesis is that LHAGABA neurons can be classified into distinct functional subtypes according to key molecular markers, electrical signatures and patterns of synaptic connectivity. We will probe this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will systematically define the electrophysiological and neuromodulatory phenotypes of candidate LHAGABA neuron populations and refine these characteristics based on long-range projections to the locus coeruleus (LC). Aim 2 will determine the synaptic connectivity between populations of LHAGABA neurons and key, arousal-related targets, both within the LHA and the LC, using patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics. Aim 3 will apply cutting-edge quantitative single-cell transcriptional profiling methods to decipher novel, molecularly distinct populations of LHAGABA neurons. Impact: As the first comprehensive neurochemical, electrophysiological and anatomical census of inhibitory cell types in the LHA, this project will yield functional subpopulations of LHAGABA neurons that, in turn, will allow the identification of key markers for the design of novel cre driver lines and intersectional genetic tools for circuit-specific dissection of LHAGABA circuits in behavior. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of LHAGABA cell types and circuits holds the promise of identifying therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric illnesses, addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep and metabolic disorders."
"9247874","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide is a major public health concern as about 35,000 people die of suicide in the U.S. every year. Recent studies of patients with suicidal behavior and of postmortem brain samples of suicide victims strongly suggest that suicide is associated with neurobiological abnormalities, such as abnormalities in serotonin function. It has also been observed that suicide and suicidal behavior are associated with abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis function. The molecular mechanisms and causes of HPA axis abnormalities in suicide, however, are not well understood. It is believed that HPA axis abnormalities may be related to an abnormal feedback mechanism and excessive secretion of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the brain. The main objective of our proposal is to examine if HPA axis genes are abnormally expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex/gyrus (CG), hippocampus, and amygdala of suicide victims. To achieve this specific aim, we will determine the protein and mRNA expression of the HPA axis genes, glucocorticoid receptors (GR-? and GR-?), mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), CRF, the receptors for CRF (CRF-R1 and CRF- R2), CRF binding protein (CRF-BP), and the target genes for GR, which are GILZ and FKBP in the PFC, CG, hippocampus, and amygdala of adult suicide victims of different diagnoses (depression, schizophrenia, other suicide) and in non-suicidal patients with different diagnoses (depression, schizophrenia) as well as normal controls. Abnormalities of epigenetic regulation have been implicated in the regulation of some of the HPA axis genes, especially the GR. We therefore propose to study epigenetic regulation of these genes by examining the effects of DNA methylation on the regulation of HPA axis genes. We propose to determine the protein and mRNA expression of enzymes that methylate DNA (DNA methyl transferase 1 [DNMT1], DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) and hydroxmenthylate DNA (TET1, TET2, and TET3) in the PFC, CG and hippocampus of adult suicide victims, non-suicidal subjects and normal control subjects. We also propose to determine the DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation of promoter proximal regions of HPA axis genes in the PFC, CG and hippocampus of adult suicide victims, non-suicidal patients and controls. We will use methyl DNA immunoprecipitation of DNA (MeDIP) and hydroxymethyl DIP (hMeDIP) to identify differentially ethylated/hydroxymethylated regions of interest in HPA axis genes of adult suicide cohorts. We will validate differences in identified regions using pyrosequencing of DNA isolated from each postmortem region. Together these studies will provide important information to support our hypothesis that suicide is associated with abnormal expression of some of the HPA axis related genes and with abnormal methylation/hydroxymethylation of HPA axis genes critical to the downstream effects of this stress response. These studies will not only enhance our knowledge of the pathophysiology of suicide in general and the role of HPA axis in suicide in particular, but also may result in identifying important sites that may be used for the development of appropriate therapeutic agents for treatment of suicidal behavior and as biomarkers for suicide."
"9249679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More Americans are affected by pain than heart disease, stroke, and cancer combined. In particular, neuropathic pain is responsible for a large percentage of these incidences of pain. The mechanisms that underlay the development of neuropathic pain are highly sought after, because current therapeutics fails to offer relief in ove half of patients. Neuronal injury or stimulation leading to maladaptive hyperexcitability appears to play a huge role in the development of neuropathic pain and the identification of therapeutic targets that can modulate neuronal action will be important as viable treatment options. Interestingly, TLR4 has been shown to be expressed on peripheral sensory neurons, which suggests neurons are activated directly by TLR4 agonists (LPS, HMGB1, free fatty acids etc.) to play an active role in peripheral nervous system plasticity leading to neuropathic pain. This study will focus on the peripheral nervous system bringing genetic tools to clarify the functional role of DRG nociceptive neurons versus macrophage/microglia TLR4 in developing neuropathic pain. Importantly, downstream signaling events connected to TLR4 activation in neurons are largely unknown and provide an additional layer of therapeutic focus. The Price lab has generated evidence that translation control signaling mechanisms via the eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4E (eIF4E) are required for the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain; and other groups have recently shown that TLR4 may activate the MAPK pathway that modulates eIF4E.  A key feature of this proposal is that we will, for the first time, study the physiological relevance of TLR4 in specific cell populations in vivo to determine whether nociceptor or macrophage/microglia TLR4 is necessary and/or sufficient for the development of neuropathic pain. We will take advantage of the cre-lox transgenic system offering cell-specific ablation or reactivation of TLR4 using newly developed floxed mice and continued development of null-reactivatable mice (Joel Elmquist). We will cross these animals with Nav1.8-cre (sensory neuron) and LysM-cre (macrophage/microglia) animals to assess these particular populations in developing neuropathic pain. Our research is aimed at understanding mechanisms driving chronic pain and moving these molecular insights toward new therapeutic strategies for pain alleviation. To accomplish these goals we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of cell-specific TLR4-eIF4E signaling to develop neuropathic pain during the mentored phase, and 2) Determine the contribution of TLR4 expression in nociceptors vs. microglia to neuropathic pain in phase II.  These studies will hopefully suggest novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment and prevention of chronic pain by targeting nociceptor and microglial TLR4 signaling, translational control, and phenotype switching. Drs. Theodore Price and Joel Elmquist are ideally suited as mentors for this project with their complementary expertise in chronic pain development and mouse genetics, respectively."
"9246529","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lab animals such as mice are critical tools for understanding the disease development, testing drug candidates, and devising treatments. In spite of the vast amount of knowledge generated, molecular biology assays on mice have mostly been done via ensemble measurements of the average properties of a group. However, similar to the rationale behind single molecule studies, ensemble averages often bury important details about the dynamics and ignore population heterogeneity and subsets. In this project, we will study the temporal dynamics in gene regulations during disease development (i.e. endotoxemia-induced atherosclerosis) based on single live animal experiments. We will develop ultrasensitive microfluidic ChIP-qPCR and ChIP- seq assays for testing based on tiny amounts of blood samples from mice. In principle these tests can be minimally invasive and do not perturb the state of the animal and the disease process. We will be able to conduct periodical examination of the same live mouse over the course of the disease development and understand the temporal dynamics in the transcription factor/promoter bindings and histone modifications. We believe that the single live animal data will grant unique insights into the molecular events involved in these biological processes and provide important basis for diagnosis, prognosis, drug design/discovery, and treatment strategy. Such data also most closely mimic what occurs in human patients during disease development and treatment, thus offer direct clinical relevance."
"9288427","Project Summary: Risk-reduction bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) after completion of childbearing has become the standard-of-care for prevention of gynecologic and breast cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carriers. Although surgery reduces the risk of death due to cancer by over 75%, knowledge regarding the impact of this procedure and subsequent hypogonadism on brain structure, function and neurotransmitter systems is limited. Menopause before the age of 40 is associated with significant cognitive decline in the years that follow and an almost 2-fold increased risk of dementia if a woman does not supplement with estradiol (E2) However, E2 is not an option for many post-RRSO women due to enhanced risk of cancer. Systematic assessment of a large group of women who underwent RRSO suggests subjective deficits in executive functions (EF), with severity inversely correlated with age at RRSO. As the prefrontal cortex is impacted by loss of E2 and is critical for working memory and other EFs, we propose to examine the biological and behavioral impact of the psychostimulant lisdexamfetamine (LDX) in 100 women between the ages of 35 and 55 with post-RRSO EF complaints. Participants will undergo multi-modal imaging (functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fMRI; and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 1H-MRS) using the ultra- high magnetic field strength of 7 Tesla pre and post a 6-week course of the psychostimulant lisdexamphetamine (LDX; Vyvanse) or placebo followed by a 3-week washout before crossing over to the other condition. Our overarching aim is to determine the impact of LDX treatment on brain function (neural activation and chemistry) as it relates to subjective and objective measures of EFs such as 1) organization and activation for work, 2) attention and concentration, 3) alertness, effort, processing speed, 4) managing affective interference, and 5) working memory, accessing recall. While an unconventional use of psychostimulants, this novel approach has already demonstrated the potential to improve new-onset EF difficulties among women who underwent a natural menopause and has provided important information regarding a potential mechanism of therapeutic action, specifically LDX-induced changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) glutamate (GLUT) levels."
"9276318","Project 2: Project Summary Our goal is to understand how a burst- forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) progenitor integrates multiple environmental (e.g. low oxygen) and hormonal (e.g. cortisol, PPAR? agonists) signals and makes the decision to undergo a self-renewal or differentiative division; in particular we will elucidate the network of transcription factors and the genes regulated by these factors that control this key developmental decision. In Aim 1 we will characterize in detail the transcriptomes as BFU-Es initiate and undergo in culture self-renewal divisions in the presence of dexamethasone together or not with Prolyl Hydroxylase 2 (PH2) inhibitors or PPAR? agonists. Parallel ChIP-Seq analysis of BFU-E cells initiating self-renewal divisions will identify genes potentially directly regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), HIF1?, and PPAR?. We will use this information in multiple bioinformatic approaches to identify additional transcription factors, chromatin- modifying enzymes, other transcriptional regulatory proteins, and RNA-binding proteins that potentially regulate self-renewal. In this analysis we also anticipate identifying novel cell surface proteins for isolation of early, mid, and late BFU-Es to higher levels of purity. In Aim 2 we will use cultures of purified early BFU-Es and a combination of dye staining to count cell divisions and single cell RNA sequencing to determine whether BFU-E self-renewal divisions, as well as differentiation divisions toward the CFU-E, progress through successive discrete transcriptional states or form a continuum of states. These studies will define how transcriptional states and numbers of cell divisions are coordinated during BFU-E self-renewal divisions and also during differentiation toward CFU-Es. In mouse BFU-Es we showed that PPAR? co-occupies many chromatin sites with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR); these presumed distal enhancer regions are enriched for DNA binding motifs for Smad 2 and 9 other transcription factors, many of which are known to play important roles in self-renewal of different stem cells. In Aim 3 we will use gain- and loss- of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo to test whether Smad 2 and ~5 other selected novel gene regulatory proteins identified in Aims 1 and 2, are important for BFU-E self-renewal. By determining the genes regulated by these factors, as well as by mapping the binding sites of these transcription factors and RNA binding proteins that are functionally important in the self-renewal process, we can construct a wiring diagram of the important genes and proteins in the self-renewal network. In addition, our understanding of how self-renewal occurs in this population of transit amplifying cells will likely have a wide impact on understanding of the self-renewal process in other cell lineages. Finally, our understanding of the self renewal of BFU-E cells and the consequent increase in numbers of red cells produced from each BFU-E progenitor, will likely pave the way for new types of treatments of many Epo-resistant anemias, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia."
"9464077","My career goal is to become an independent academic researcher and to contribute to the development of new treatments for relief of itch and pain, guided by new knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these sensations. To date, I learned a variety of molecular biology methods, obtained extensive training in the behavioral assessment of pain and itch in rodents, and gained extensive experience using in vivo electrophysiology and cellular imaging methods to investigate itch mechanisms under the mentorship of Prof. Y. Kuraishi and Prof. E. Carstens. Through the research project described below, I will acquire additional training in these and other neuroanatomical and human psychophysical approaches that I consider essential to my career development. In particular, I believe it is essential to address whether the novel neuronal mechanisms of itch identified in rodents are conserved in humans, in order to develop new mechanisms-based strategies to treat itch and pain. Additionally, I will teach in established courses and seminar series, a valuable component of my career development in academia that is consistent with the goals of the K99/R00 award mechanism. The NPB department and larger UC Davis campus houses many internationally-recognized neuroscience faculty, providing an outstanding intellectual environment that has positively influenced my career development. Therefore, I believe that my background and training in a supportive research environment make me a highly appropriate candidate for the K99/R00 award. Chronic itch associated with dermatitis and systemic diseases is a substantial clinical problem that is poorly treated, significantly decreasing the quality of life. Warmed skin is the most commonly reported factor that exacerbates itch. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying enhancement of itch by warming is urgently needed to identify cellular targets for development of novel antipruritic treatments. This proposal will take a multidisciplinary approach, using pharmacological and genetic tools combined with behavioral assessment, calcium imaging and immunohistochemistry of sensory neurons, electrophysiology recording, and human psychophysics to investigate mechanisms underlying the enhancement of itch by innocuous skin warming. At the molecular level, temperature sensation involves thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. One of these, TRPV4, is activated by innocuous warmth. Using scratching as a rodent model of itch, our preliminary data show that scratching elicited by serotonin requires TRPV4 and is enhanced by warming. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TRPV4 is required for enhancement of serotonin- evoked itch by warming. The present proposal represents a departure from the research program of my mentor, Prof. Carstens, by incorporating genetic approaches to investigate the role of TRPV4 in itch and the modulation of itch by innocuous warming."
"9434279","Project Summary/Abstract The C9ORF72 repeat expansion mutation is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), accounting for over 50% of ALS cases in northern Europe and 10% of cases worldwide, making it a critical target for therapeutic intervention. The pathogenic mechanism of the C9ORF72 repeat expansion is unclear and is the focus of this proposal because its elucidation is crucial for therapeutic development. Studies showing that the repeat expansion generates neurotoxic species including dipeptide repeat proteins and nuclear RNA foci have oriented the field towards a therapeutic focus on blocking the toxicity of these products. However, our preliminary studies using patient-specific induced motor neurons (iMNs) generated by cellular reprogramming, and primary patient tissue analysis, suggest that C9ORF72 has guanine exchange factor activity for RAB GTPases that mediate early endosomal trafficking and lysosomal biogenesis. Moreover, they indicate that haploinsufficiency for this activity leads to neurodegeneration. The goal of this study is to definitively show that haploinsufficiency for guanine exchange factor activity leads to neurodegeneration in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD through the following specific aims: (1) Identify neurodegenerative processes caused by low C9ORF72 protein levels, (2) Determine the function of C9ORF72, (3) Determine if PIKFYVE inhibition promotes iMN survival by rescuing endosomal trafficking. This application seeks to shift current research by demonstrating that haploinsufficiency for guanine exchange factor activity induces neurodegeneration in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. The proposed study will establish C9ORF72 protein activity as a critical therapeutic target. More broadly, our work will highlight a mechanistic convergence on endosomal trafficking in ALS and FTD, identifying a pathway with therapeutic potential for a large percentage of ALS/FTD patients."
"9461642","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neural correlates of object perception have been traditionally identified in ventral cortical regions that form a visual processing hierarchy, with deeper regions containing cells with larger receptive fields that are thought to underlie abstract (viewpoint-, position-, and scale-invariant) object representations. These forms of representational invariance are important for the categorization and identification of static objects. However, most objects in our natural environment are not fully visible due to occlusion and are not static as they or as we move. Rather than representational invariance, the visual system requires precise representations about object fragment position, velocity, and orientation in order to integrate many fragments across space and time into perceptual wholes or spatiotemporal objects. We have conducted two preliminary studies that suggest that dorsal regions (V3A, V3B, and the intraparietal sulcus) may be involved in the representation of dynamic forms. This opens the question of whether shape information in dorsal and ventral areas is similar or redundant or whether there is communication and a relaying of information between them that ultimately leads to both invariant representations in ventral areas and specific representations in dorsal areas. To identify the signaling pathway (Aim 1), subjects will perform a shape identification task with objects that are gradually revealed over time (spatiotemporal objects) or with objects whose shape information is available all at once while EEG data is recorded. In order to relate the signaling time-course to cortical areas, structural and functional MRI data will be collected in order to enhance source-localization accuracy and to define ROIs in source-localized space. Using MVPA, we will decode shape identity in each ROI as a function of time. If spatiotemporal object representations are first constructed in dorsal areas and then passed down to ventral ones, shape decoding will be possible earlier after stimulus onset in dorsal areas than in ventral. Static object identity may only be decodable in ventral regions. To confirm the causal role of dorsal areas in spatiotemporal object representation (Aim 2), we will conduct two experiments in which we apply transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior parietal cortex (dorsal visual areas) to disrupt dynamic form integration. If dorsal areas are necessary for integration of shape information over time, tDCS should decrease the time over which such forms can be integrated, but should have no effect on the perception of static shapes."
"9212423","Abusive head trauma (AHT) is the leading cause of traumatic death and disability in early childhood, affecting at least 690,000 children annually in the United States. AHT is missed or unrecognized in 30% of head-injured children and more than 25% of children with unrecognized AHT suffered additional inflicted injuries. Ten percent of children with unrecognized AHT subsequently died or were killed?80% of whom could have been saved by earlier recognition of abuse.8 A flawed decision to launch an abuse evaluation can increase parental stress, expose the child to additional risks, prolong hospital stays, and increase health care costs.9,10 Doctors who care for young victims of trauma must make important decisions to launch or forgo child-abuse evaluations when presented with head-injured children. These decisions can be difficult, and the stakes are high. Unfortunately, doctors routinely struggle to define a ?reasonable suspicion? of abuse and have demonstrated inherent biases related to child age, race, marital status, and socioeconomic status. The principal investigator (Hymel) conceptualized, designed, and directed sequential multicenter studies to derive and validate an effective AHT screening tool in the form of a clinical decision rule (CDR)?an evidence-based tool developed specifically to guide a discrete decision in the continuum of AHT care. Though the CDR has shown promise in preliminary studies, it has not yet been subjected to a formal randomized trial, which is the purpose of this project. The proposed CDR trial will demonstrate the CDR's impact on AHT screening accuracy, hypothesizing that CDR application will increase AHT detection and reduce unnecessary abuse evaluations. We will conduct a stratified cluster randomized trial (SCRT) at eight US pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 4) or control (n = 4) conditions. The SCRT will compare AHT screening accuracy after the deployment of active multifaceted implementation strategies designed to promote CDR acceptance, utilization, and accuracy at the intervention sites (Aim 1). In addition, the SCRT will determine what?if any?site-, provider-, and patient-specific factors predict CDR application in PICU settings (Aim 2). Once the SCRT has concluded, we will conduct a 12-month sustainability trial at intervention sites, systematically repealing the implementation strategies one by one to discern their relative importance to sustainability (Exploratory Aim 3). We anticipate that this simple, inexpensive, and reliable CDR will decrease the negative impacts of physicians' inherent biases and practice disparities, significantly increase AHT detection, decrease unnecessary abuse evaluations (and their associated risks), and reduce AHT-associated healthcare costs. Most importantly, the CDR will save lives?the lives of children who will otherwise suffer additional fatal inflicted injuries if/when their AHT is missed or unrecognized."

"9440774","ABSTRACT We still know very little about the mechanisms that regulate and synchronize morphogenetic events during later stages of vertebrate development. Nonetheless, understanding the factors controlling these later developmental periods is essential to understanding how adult traits form, and will lend insight into morphological defects and disorders that arise during human post-embryonic fetal and neonatal periods. This research utilizes the zebra?sh, which undergoes extensive post-embryonic development involving modi?cations and maturation in many different organ systems; many of these changes are similar or identical to processes that occur following embryogenesis in humans. This proposal employs several strategies towards understanding the mechanisms underlying the zebra?sh transformation from larva to juvenile. The ?rst aim adopts a targeted approach, testing the speci?c roles of thyroid hormone in post-embryonic developmental transitions. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that thyroid hormone is involved in several developmental processes in zebra?sh, but the ability of this hormone to effect speci?c morphogenetic processes and cellular behaviors remains unclear. This aim will test roles of thyroid hormone in promoting both global somatic developmental progression and the behaviors of a speci?c, well-characterized cell lineage that produces adult pigmentation during the larval-to-juvenile transition. The second aim takes a forward genetic strategy to identify novel genes required for post-embryonic stage transitions. This approach has already identi?ed two mutants that exhibit complete somatic arrest during larval development, ceasing ontogenetic progression at stages normally reached by 2- and 3-week old wild-type larvae. These phenotypes suggest an impairment of genes absolutely required for post-embryonic progression. Mapping and cloning the mutations and characterizing the pathways to which they belong will reveal mechanisms essential for post-embryonic developmental processes; continuation of this screen will identify further larval arrest phenotypes. The ?nal aim utilizes a species related to zebra?sh that exhibits a natural failure to execute the terminal stages of somatic post-embryonic development. Focusing primarily on the structure and expression within the skin, changes in genetic and developmental architecture will be elucidated in this context of post-embryonic developmental truncation. These analyses will reveal the both extent of decoupling between traits and regulatory pathways, and whether dormant genetic pathways retain responsiveness to a key endocrine mediator of post-embryonic development. Overall, these efforts will characterize the morphogenetic roles of a known endocrine regulator, will identify novel factors that regulate normal post-embryonic progression, and will establish a novel model for dissecting the ways in which developmental genetic pathways and endocrine mechanisms can evolve. Moreover, this project will complete the developmental biology and genetics training of a scholar with a background in population ecology, and will establish establish the foundation for her independent research laboratory."
"9278571","Project 5. Project Summary.  Project 5 will conduct behavioral and fMRI studies in people who have focal lesions to the prefrontal cortex, recruited from the lesion registry at the University of Iowa. It is a major extension of our current Conte Center, and has a subcontract to PI Daniel Tranel at Iowa. Its three Aims focus on dissociation of basic decision-making systems (continuous with Project 1 in our current Conte Center), studies of social inference (the same tasks as under the renewal Project 2, Aim 1), and fMRI studies probing compensatory processing. Given the strong links to other Projects, it also includes as personnel several PIs from other Projects (Adolphs, O'Doherty) as well as shared post-docs.  The overarching goal of Project 5 is to use the lesion method to investigate the necessary role of specific sectors of the prefrontal cortex, the brain region most important for social decision-making. We are particularly interested in medial regions of the PFC, known to be critical for representing value and social inference, and in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, known to be important for context-dependent regulation. How damage to these regions may dissociate specific components of the social decision-making process, let alone how it may engage compensatory processing through remaining intact network components, is largely unexplored. This will be a crucially important complement to all other studies under this Conte Center, since it provides a window into the necessary role of brain regions.  Aim 1 focuses on the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in goal-directed or habit-based control in instrumental choice. We will build on strong pilot data that shows, for the first time in humans, that the vmPFC is essential for goal-directed, but not habit-based choice. Aim 2 will use the full battery of tasks developed under Aim 1 of Project 2 to probe the necessary role of the prefrontal cortex in social inference. This task battery probes inferences made to social or nonsocial stimuli, as a function of cognitive load, to facial expressions or hand actions, and other factors. Finally, Aim 3 will analyze the tasks under Aims 1 and 2 done in fMRI experiments, to examine the neural regions responsible for possible compensatory task performances.  The studies will be executed in 30 patients with focal, chronic lesions to the prefrontal cortex, 30 subjects with lesions elsewhere, and 30 healthy comparison subjects, using a combination of ROI-based and voxel-based lesion mapping. Some of the ROIs we will specifically query are those generated from the fMRI studies in Projects 1, 2 and 3: those fMRI studies tell us which regions are activated in healthy brains, but only Project 5 can tell us if damage within those same regions also compromises social inference and decision- making performances."
"9309925","ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and disproportionate rates are seen in minority African American populations. Thrombosis and vascular inflammation are important contributors to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and vascular occlusion that underlie myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, as well as venous thromboembolic disease. The identification of novel biomarkers and their assessment in different ethnic populations can augment the information obtained from traditional CVD risk factors as well as illuminate underlying disease mechanisms and health disparities. While blood biomarkers have been shown to be critically important in the study of CVD, there is a deficit of studies of these measures in African American populations. Preliminary data suggest that thrombin generation, as quantified ex vivo by plasma measurement of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is a novel approach to understanding the connection of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to thrombus formation in vivo. Whole genome sequence (WGS) data, including both coding and functional noncoding variants, are required to identify the full spectrum of contributions of rare variants to common diseases. WGS data are particularly important among non-European ancestry groups, where there is still relatively limited genomic information. Using stored baseline Jackson Heart Study (JHS) plasma samples from 3,500 African Americans, we propose to measure several emerging thrombosis and inflammation plasma biomarkers (endogenous thrombin potential, fibrinogen gamma', coagulation factors VIII and VIIa, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, soluble CD14, and soluble CD163) that are likely to reflect and/or account for increased thrombogenicity and therefore may contribute to higher rates of CVD in African Americans. We will assess the association of thrombosis biomarkers and biomarker-associated genetic variants with more complex subclinical and clinical CVD endpoints available in JHS and other African American cohorts, including REGARDS. By adding these key measures of thrombosis and inflammation to the JHS and REGARDS data sets, utilizing existing whole genome sequence data available through the NHLBI TOPMed project, and using innovative analytical and population genetic approaches, we will be able to greatly expand our knowledge of the role of thrombosis and inflammation in CVD health disparities."
"9278570","Project 4. Project Summary. Project 4 is a continuation of our basic-research intracranial recordings in humans, which were scattered across Aims in multiple Projects in the current funding period and have now been collected in one focused Project. It is co-directed by Richard Andersen and Ueli Rutishauser, both of whom are also on our current Conte Center. Its overarching Aim is to use single-unit recordings in humans to understand the representations and circuits for social inference and its contextual modulation, with an emphasis on comparing this to representations of one's own states. It links to other Projects: Aim 1 will investigate the responses of amygdala neurons to social threat, a question linked to Project 3. Aim 2 will investigate the responses of posterior parietal neurons in representing another person's actions from which we could learn, a question linked to Project 1. These links are reflected in the personnel of Project 4, which includes PIs from other Projects (Adolphs, O'Doherty, Mobbs) as well as shared post-docs and students.  The Aims of Project 4 map onto recordings in two distinct patient populations. Aims 1 and 3 will be led by Rutishauser, and tested with single-unit recordings from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in epilepsy patients (10 per year), through a subcontract to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Aims 2 and 4 will be led primarily by Richard Andersen, and tested with single-unit recordings from the posterior parietal cortex in rare patients who have brain-machine interfaces implanted chronically for control of neural prosthetics (tested at a rehabilitation center close to Caltech). Aim 1 will record the responses of neurons in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala to social stimuli such as faces and a range of threats. It will investigate the category-selectivity of neurons, and ask how this is modulated by attention, using concurrent eyetracking. Aim 2 will record primarily in the posterior parietal cortex, but also include some experiments with recordings in amygdala and prefrontal cortex, and examine how the observation and execution of actions are represented by these neurons (a question related to so-called ?mirror neurons?). It also includes a close link to Project 1 in testing whether single neurons encode signals for observational learning. Aim 3 will investigate error signals in a Stroop task by recording from neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor cortex in epilepsy patients; it will also feature an observational Stroop task, where the subject sees the errors made by another person. This Aim will also be conducted, in the same patients, using fMRI (prior to their electrode implantations). Aim 4 will capitalize on the ability record in posterior parietal cortex in the brain-machine interface patients from over a year, and will compare recordings done over this long period as a function of state variables such as mood."
"9249646","This Program Project Grant designed an animal core to improve cost effectiveness and provide efficiency for  the projects in the program. Projects I, II,III will all use sheep through the assistance of the core. The Animal  Core provides many advantages for PPG investigators. First, it is much easier to schedule a time-mated  breeding program with sheep suppliers, and less expensive by use ofthe economy of scale. It would be  chaotic to have every sheep investigator trying to buy sheep independently. Second, it is often possible to  share tissues, and on occasion live animals with other investigators who need similariy instrumented animals  for a slightly different purpose. Third, the Department of Comparative Medicine shares animal laboratories  within the animal facility for the purpose of chronic experimentation. It would be difficult to overstate the  convenience of not having to transport instrumented animals across campus, apart from the otherwise  worrisome considerations of the transmission of zoonotic diseases. Fourth, many of the personnel in our  Department of Comparative Medicine are highly skilled in the handling of pregnant and neonatal sheep; these  skills need to be preserved and an animal core under the directorship of one of the DCM veterinarians is the  logical way to do this. Fifth and finally. Dr. Saunders is able to be more involved in each project than is  normally possible with the usual arrangement between research projects and DCM veterinary staff. She is an  outstanding asset to the University and to the PPG. As a member of the PPG team. Dr. Saunders understands  the special needs of each project.  Cost effectiveness of this core comes in several forms: First and foremost is coordination in the buying and  delivering of animals, 2) sharing personnel for routine care of animals and surgery suite, 3) saving money on  veterinary care, 4) saving by buying drugs at lower cost."

"9315492","Project Summary: Though a reference human genome and even excellent characterization of the epigenome (ENCODE, Epigenetics Roadmap) has been generated, the significance of noncoding genetic or epigenetic changes is still far from clear. With the advent of affordable DNA- sequencing technologies, methods have been developed for examining nuclear organization, chromatin state/histone post translation modifications, chromatin accessibility and methylation state. But these methods do not directly interrogate the DNA strand, and the reads are typically too short to provide critical correlative information. We propose the development of a novel epigenetic characterization methodology, fundamentally through the practical implementation of the sequencing of modified bases using a nanopore sequencing platform. Nanopore sequencing directly probes the chemical structure of the molecule in the pore with exquisite sensitivity. Its long reads enable correlation of epigenetic state over large (>10kb) stretches of the genome; each of these reads originates from a single cell, probing the epigenetic heterogeneity of the sample."
"9220860","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year millions of Americans are concussed from sport-related incidents, accidents or military service. While extensive research has been done to identify biomarkers for diagnosing concussion, a specific biomarker for concussion recovery has yet to be identified. Concussion is a brain injury with physiological effects on cerebral blood flo (CBF) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. These effects may be why exercise exacerbates concussion symptoms. Thus, exercise intolerance is a physiological sign of concussion. Ergo, normal exercise tolerance indicates physiological recovery. Our long-term goal is to better understand the systemic physiological disturbance of concussion to develop reliable methods for the differential diagnosis of concussion and of post-concussion syndrome, to establish objective markers of recovery, and to develop novel treatments to speed recovery. The overall objective of this application is to identify the physiological mechanisms of exercise intolerance in concussion. The rationale for the proposed study is that our work could show that systematic determination of return of exercise tolerance is a specific biological marker of recovery from concussion. This would help patients and clinicians know with confidence when it is safe to return to activity. We developed the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test to systematically evaluate exercise tolerance in concussed athletes. We have found abnormally elevated CBF during exercise after concussion in association with altered sensitivity to the effects of CO2 that blunts ventilation. We have also detected that cardiac output (CO) is low after concussion. A fundamental question is whether exercise tolerance after concussion is limited centrally (brain) or peripherally (cardiovascular/muscle). We will examine this by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) Identify the source (central or peripheral) of exercise intolerance in concussion and (2) Identify the mechanism of central exercise intolerance in concussion. Concussed male and female participants will have measures of CO2 sensitivity, ventilation, CBF (by arterial spin labelling in the MRI), blood lactate, and CO at res and during simulated exercise (head down tilt, HDT) in the MRI machine and during the Buffalo treadmill exercise test soon after concussion and upon recovery. We will also measure DTI to evaluate for injury to the brainstem and corpus callosum. Values will be compared to those in healthy controls. The work is expected to identify that the physiological mechanism of exercise intolerance in concussion is central from abnormal control of CBF. The work is expected to establish that return of normal physiology (and of normal exercise tolerance) is a functional biomarker of recovery from concussion. The work is significant because a physiological biomarker will impact how patients are judged clinically to be recovered from concussion, i.e., physiologically ready to return to sport, work and military duty. Our work is innovative because we are using exercise intolerance as a clinical measure of abnormal physiological control of CBF as a result of concussion."
"9272268","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  All blood cell types that make up the adult cardiovascular system are created and maintained by self-renewing, multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Conserved across vertebrates, HSPCs are specified early in development, arising from a unique population of vascular cells called the hemogenic endothelium. Given the difficulties in the ex vivo differentiation and expansion of HSPCs from pluripotent stem cells for regenerative therapies, it is readily apparent that knowledge about HSPC specification is significantly lacking. This gap in understanding stems from the challenges in visualizing HSPC emergence in mammalian embryos that develop internally. The proposed study will address these biological problems with the zebrafish model because the transparency and external fertilization of zebrafish embryos will allow for the molecular dissection of the mechanisms that control this dynamic endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) in vivo.  Small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of stem cell and cardiovascular biology because of their ability to post-transcriptionally silence a diverse array of target genes.  While miRNA regulation is crucial for HSPC self-renewal, maintenance, and differentiation into multiple lineages, the role for miRNAs in hemogenic endothelial specification and HSC emergence is largely unexplored. From a reverse genetic screen to identify the cardiovascular function of endothelial-enriched miRNAs in zebrafish, mir-223 was identified as a novel candidate regulator of HSPC specification because the loss of mir-223 led to an expansion of HSPCs at the onset of HSPC induction. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to directly test the hypothesis that mir-223 functions to negatively regulate the transition from endothelial to hematopoietic cell fates. By employing an innovative strategy to create a mir-223 fluorescent reporter, mir-223 localization patterns will be assessed for the first time in vivo and correlated with the dynamic emergence of HSPCs from the hemogenic endothelium in zebrafish. The proposed research will also examine whether mir-223 functions in HSPC production by visualizing changes in hemogenic endothelial specification and cellular behaviors of emerging HSPCs when mir-223 activity is lost or elevated. Finally, the genes that are directly targeted by mir-223 during EHT will be identified by their upregulation in mir-223 mutants compared to wildtype hemogenic endothelial cells. Altogether, this proposed work will implicate miRNA regulation as a fundamental mechanism of HSPC specification, and will better define the genetic network regulating this process. Importantly, these studies will establish the zebrafish mir-223 mutant as a new leukemogenesis animal model, and will have the potential to instruct regenerative medicine approaches in the ex vivo production of HSPCs for the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders."
"9282198","Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an adaptive response to stress. However, when repeatedly activated, HPA axis dysregulation can result. Stress in childhood alters biological systems and the expression of genes regulating HPA axis and immune responses in a manner that persists across decades. Stress is also associated with increased risk for depression and PTSD, a risk that continues into adulthood, and both are associated with increased risk for suicidality. However different neuroendocrine profiles are described with increased cortisol and reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsiveness in depression; and attenuated cortisol and enhanced GR responsiveness in PTSD. Inflammation, also associated with stress, is believed to result from reduced GR sensitivity, possibly as a result of chronically elevated cortisol. Yet inflammation is associated with both depression and PTSD, which is difficult to rectify with their apparently differential pattern of GR responsiveness. The discrepant HPA axis profiles also do not conform with the high comorbidity rate between these disorders. Our overarching goal is to examine the trajectories of the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways in response to stress in children; and identify biological trajectories that predict maladaptive stress responses. We propose to recruit 200 children, aged 12-17 years, of parents newly diagnosed with advanced stage cancer (stress) within 3 months of diagnosis (intake) and follow them at 6 and 18 months following intake. This population will allow us to study the unfolding of stress responses, which is almost impossible to capture for other stressors. We will also recruit and follow 100 children from families where a parent or siblings do not have cancer or chronic illness or death (controls). We propose to measure gene expression in the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways; hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) to measure chronic HPA axis activity; salivary cortisol to measure cortisol awakening response (CAR); GR sensitivity; C- Reactive Protein and inflammatory cytokines; and collect clinical data. We hypothesize that within 3 months of parental diagnosis, stress children will show increased expression of HPA axis and inflammatory genes and increased HCC, CAR, and inflammatory markers compared to controls; but no differences in GR sensitivity. In response to chronic stress, stress children will show decreased expression of HPA axis genes, enhanced GR sensitivity, and decreased HCC and CAR over time compared to controls. They will also continue to show increased expression of inflammatory genes and inflammation. Biological responses early on and their trajectories will predict symptomatology (depression, PTSD, and suicidal ideation) and onset of depression and PTSD; and these relationships will be influenced by pre-existing and ongoing vulnerability and protective factors. This study will advance our understanding of the neurobiological, environmental, and behavioral pathways of stress responses in children and its impact on liability to psychiatric illness. It will also result in biomarkers that signal risk in children early on and can be targeted by early preventions and interventions."

ATMN is a short, intensive 2.5 week hands-on course which prepares students to enter directly into research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized molecular techniques in contemporary aspects of neurobiological research. Experimental modules in the course will include an introduction to the design and use of animal virus vectors in neuroscience research; the use of CRISPR genome editing and RNAi approaches for regulating the expression of specific genes in neurons and glia; practical exercises in gene delivery systems including mammalian cell infection and transfection and electroporation techniques for targeted gene transfer in vivo; an introduction to overall strategies, use and design of BAC transgenic vectors; real time RT-PCR analyses; assays of chromatin and chromatin structure in neurons, and mRNA isolation from specified neural subtypes by translating ribosome affinity purification. Experimental techniques are taught in the context of the broader conceptual advances that they may provide. The course invites lecturers who have made significant contributions in their fields to give up-to-the-minute reports on current research. The trainees are chosen by the course faculty from larger pools of applicants and range from graduate students to senior investigators and research physicians. Because of the short duration of this course, senior, as well as junior individuals can attend and receive a short, intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their time and attention. The ATMN course also provides an unusual opportunity for established scientists to apply these advanced techniques to their own research interests, or to retrain in an important specialty within neuroscience with which they may not be familiar. Methods and concepts taught in the course are disseminated to the wider research community through the publication of laboratory manuals and online resources."
"9251304","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of interactions between infants and their mothers is widely held as a primary process affecting infant development. The Mutual Regulation Model (MRM) conceptualizes infants and their mothers as co- regulating their social interactions by responding to each other's communicative displays of their needs and intentions on a moment-to-moment basis. A major tenet of the MRM is that stressing either the mother or infant will disrupt their regulatory capacity leading to interactive disorganization. Oddly, while experimental manipulations have been developed to examine infant capacities for regulation of a stressor (e.g., arm restraint, the still-face), few studies have examined mothers' capacity for regulation when she is experimentally stressed and how such a disruption dysregulates her infant. To help fill this gap in the research, the goal of this project is to experimentally manipulate maternal exposure to stress for first-time mothers and their infants and to study the stressors' cascading effects on the organization of the dyadic-interactive regulatory system in both a typical, full-term and stress-vulnerable, preterm sample of infants and their mothers. Within each group, dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions, an experimental maternal stress or non- stress condition. Following a resting physiological baseline, all dyads begin with a baseline face-to-face play episode (PlayBL) to evaluate pre-stress regulatory communicative behaviors and physiology. Next mothers participate in the maternal stress condition in which they listen to a known parental stressor, infant distress cries, or a non-stress condition in which they listen to << infant positive vocalizations>>. Both groups will then experience the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm which consists of a play episode (Play1), followed by the still-face (SF) infant stressor, and a final play episode (Play2). Individual and dyadic stress effects will be evaluated using a unique combination of multiple measures that includes behavior, salivary hormones, cardiac, and electrodermal activity collected from mothers and infants, and self-reported stress recorded from mothers.  The proposed project will introduce a reliable paradigm for manipulating maternal stress and will evaluate the immediate and direct effects of stress on dyadic organization. Knowledge gained from this study will help in identifying mothers who are more vulnerable to stress which in the long run has the potential to continually disrupt dyadic interactions and subsequently compromise the infant's capacity for healthy emotion regulation and development."

"9308481","Project Summary Currently, 86 million Americans have prediabetes, but 9 in 10 of them remain unaware. Randomized trials have demonstrated that more than half of all new cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed when high risk adults are offered resource-intensive lifestyle intervention programs, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). While numerous organizations have engaged in efforts to expand screening and subsequent access to interventions for adults with prediabetes, those services are far from routine in clinical and public health practice. However, implementation efforts in this arena are expected to accelerate rapidly during the next 3 years as several forthcoming policies will catalyze efforts to identify and intervene upon prediabetes. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a grade B recommendation that all overweight or obese adults with cardiovascular risk conditions (including prediabetes) be offered intensive lifestyle interventions, specifically referencing the DPP as a case example. This recommendation, together with Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation requiring commercial and public payers to provide coverage of USPSTF A and B recommendations, has led payers to begin structuring coverage policies that will include a mix of clinical and community intervention services. In parallel, key stakeholders such as YMCA of the USA and the American Medical Association (AMA) have engineered a series of strategic regional initiatives to strengthen healthcare-community linkages for the screening and diagnosis of prediabetes, as well as the coordination of referrals to community-based interventions, and the billing and payment for delivery of those interventions. In close collaboration with these stakeholders, we propose this natural experiment, employing a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods, and leveraging available data from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI), OptumHealth Care Solutions, and other accessible sources to evaluate the reach, implementation, effectiveness, and costs of these interrelated policies likely to impact the prevention of type 2 diabetes for potentially several million Americans over the next 5 to 10 years. Our proposal aims to: (1) evaluate and compare the impacts of large-scale, regional healthcare-community linkages on changing rates of prediabetes screening, diagnosis, and National DPP intervention attendance following enactment of USPSTF recommendations for those services; (2) describe implementation features and elicit barriers and facilitators of implementation, replication, and future scaling of large-scale regional initiatives; and (3) compare the effects of exposure to the YMCA?s DPP on healthcare costs and utilization for different subgroups of patients with prediabetes. This evaluation will provide critical information about whether particular strategies should be discontinued, refined, or replicated on a larger scale to achieve maximal impact over the coming decade."

"9326492","Project Summary Human health and well-being hinges on frequent and meaningful social contact with other humans, which is satisfied by establishing close social relationships (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Indeed, independent of the frequency of social contact, perceptions of social connectedness predict well-being (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, Baker, Harris, & Stephenson, 2015), suggesting that the psychological distance between one's self and close others reflect important individual difference measures that are not, as of yet, objectively measurable. To better gauge this psychological representation of relationship closeness, the proposed research turns to multivariate neuroimaging techniques capable of parsing the representational content reflected in patterns of brain activation. A region of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) consistently and robustly activates when making judgments related to the self relative to judgments of others, though it occasionally activates moderately in response to judgments of close others. This proposal takes a more fine-grained approach to understanding the relationship between relational closeness and MPFC activation by modeling the activation patterns associated with the self and a gradation of close others. In doing so, we will determine if relationship closeness is represented in the similarity of neural activation patterns to judgments of the self and of close others (Aim 1). Moreover, by analyzing the similarity of neural activation patterns elicited by making trait judgments for one's self and close others, we aim to determine how the structure of self-representation might reflect social well- being (Aim 2). That is, is the neural representation of the self more dissimilar from close others in lonely individuals than in well-connected individuals? In sum, the present proposal applies a novel computational neuroimaging technique to the psychological construct of self-representation to determine if self-representation is instantiated in neural patterns of activation; and further, if the structure associated with such representation is 1) inclusive of close others and 2) sensitive to cognitive distortions (e.g., perceived social disconnectedness) and thus diagnostic of psychological well-being."
"9245783","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal is being submitted in response to RFA-AI-16-006, US-China Program for Biomedical Collaborative Research (USCPBCR) and is based on a long-standing collaboration between Professor Zhigang Tian (China) and Dr. Wayne Yokoyama (US). It concerns natural killer (NK) cells which are major components of the innate immune system providing host defense against pathogens and developing tumors. However, most of what is known about NK cells was derived from study of NK cells in mouse spleen and human peripheral blood. The collaborators found that the mouse liver contains two populations of NK cells, conventional NK (cNK) cells that resemble splenic NK cells and which circulate in the vascular system, and tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells that reside in the liver sinusoids. In published work, the investigators demonstrated that these cells form distinct NK cell lineages, based on phenotypic and functional analyses and transcription factor dependence. In preliminary studies, the investigators have identified a unique NK cell in the human liver which has properties of trNK cells found in mice, indicating that the concept of trNK cells is broadly applicable across species, suggesting that they have important, conserved biological functions. Thus, they propose the following Specific Aims to: 1) Study mouse liver trNK cells in sinusoids; 2) Determine role of mouse trNK cells in liver inflammation; and 3) Study human liver trNK cells. These studies will provide novel insight into the role of liver-resident NK cells and their contribution to host immune defense."
"9274885","ABSTRACT  The La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LJI) is a premier immunology research institute in the US whose 24 principal investigators are supported by ~$40 million in NIH grants and contracts. At LJI we study the behavior of immune cells in diseases prominent in the US and around the world, including: type 1 diabetes, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Zika infection. Nearly all of our scientists use laser scanning confocal imaging to visualize cellular interactions, signaling, and function and the results have been published in Nature, Science, and other prominent journals. However, to progress further in this important work, we need a versatile confocal microscope with super-resolution capabilities.  Currently, LJI lacks a dynamic, capable, and technologically current confocal system and needs one that will yield the most impactful data for each NIH research project. This need includes a host of fluorescence based assays such as quantitative receptor translocation, protein co-localization intracellularly and in tissue, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and photoactivation. We have a 10 year old Leica SP5 combined confocal and multiphoton system that is dedicated to intravital imaging and a simple automated Olympus FV10i confocal suitable for fixed cells and tissues at lower resolutions. LJI has no super-resolution capability. Here, we seek support for purchasing a state-of-the-art Zeiss 880 confocal microscope with an Airyscan super-resolution detector, highly sensitive detection devices (GaAsP detectors), the greatest signal-to-noise ratio system for both fixed and live acquisition, multiple laser lines covering the entire visible light spectrum, and a fully tunable spectral emission collection grating. Airyscan is a novel super-resolution technology that can achieve 140 nm resolution using standard immunofluorescence protocols. After comparing all instruments on the market, it is clear that the Zeiss LSM 880 system is best suited for the needs of LJI investigators and, if funded, it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on NIH-supported scientific progress."
"9277182","Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal combines my two NIGMS grants. Our work on the M2 proton channel from influenza A virus (GM56423) currently focuses on the mechanism of proton movement through the channel. M2 is also the target of the amantadine class of influenza drugs, and most isolates of influenza A virus are now amantadine- resistant. Crystallographic structures of M2 in various functional states will be solved at very high resolution using the X-ray free electron laser to enable structure determination at room temperature. Parallel, collaborative studies use single-molecule measurement and 2DIR to probe dynamics. Very high-resolution structures of a series of small molecule inhibitors in complex with amantadine-resistant mutants of M2 are being determined, to enable our collaborators to conduct structure-based drug design.  De novo protein design (GM54616) provides a means to test and refine our understanding of protein structure and function. We address questions of sequence-specific recognition in membranes. A variety of methods exist for the design or selection of antibodies and other reagents that recognize the water-soluble regions of proteins. However, companion methods for targeting Transmembrane (TM) regions are not generally available. Therefore, we are developing methods for the computational design of peptides that target TM helices in a sequence-specific manner, focusing on EGF receptors (collaboration with Natalia Jura) and integrins (collaboration with A. Orr). To elucidate the mechanisms by which proton-coupled transporters function, we have designed model proteins that use proton gradients to drive transport of transition metal ions up a gradient. We are increasing the efficiency of these minimal models and also expanding our methods to allow design of phosphate transporters and lipid flippases. We propose to continue work on the design of model diiron proteins to determine how a protein tunes the properties of these cofactors to affect diverse O2- dependent processes such as substrate oxidation and radical formation. We are designing water and membrane-soluble versions of the protein; by varying the identity and geometry of ligands and the water- accessibility of the center to determine how these parameters they define reactivity.  We are studying the mechanisms by which bacterial histidine kinases transmit conformational information through multi-domain TM proteins. HKs are widely used by bacteria to sense and respond to diverse environmental cues such as nutrients or noxious substances. Crystal structures of various truncated domains of HKs have been solved. However, there are no high-resolution structures for HK membrane- spanning domains or full-length HKs, and their signaling mechanism is a matter of debate. By integrating structural information from diverse experimental techniques and functional measurements of HKs we seek to elucidate the mechanism of signaling in HKs. 59"
"9236214","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a strong influence of gravity on the lung. The lung deforms under its own weight, stretching some regions and compressing others, affecting ventilation and blood flow. The deformation is strongly posture dependent because the thorax (the container shape) is not symmetrical. This asymmetry can be envisioned as a wedge, with the lung hanging from the shorter side in supine posture and the longer side in prone. The effects of asymmetry and gravity are additive in supine posture, but oppose one another in prone.  Goal/Significance Early adoption of prone ventilation in severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) markedly improves survival. This is especially true if arterial partial pressure of CO2 and dead space are decreased by prone posture, implying that this intervention recruits blood flow to match regions of well-ventilated lung. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which lung deformation and thoracic shape interact to affect pulmonary blood flow and gas exchange. Since prone ventilation greatly complicates patient care, understanding posture effects on blood flow distribution is critically important. This information will be to develop patient-specific metrics to identify which ARDS patients might benefit most from prone ventilation. This work may have other implications for patient management including fluid balance and inotropic therapy.  Innovation Can the effects of prone posture on pulmonary blood flow and gas exchange be predicted from regional lung density distribution measured supine? To answer this question we have developed a suite of functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques that allow regional quantification of lung proton density, alveolar ventilation, and perfusion. This allows the evaluation of how container shape and lung deformation alter ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) matching and regional dead space under clinically relevant conditions. We propose to combine our sophisticated imaging techniques with person-specific modeling of tissue deformation in collaboration with Dr. Merryn Tawhai (University of Auckland) to calculate regional tissue deformation and trans-pulmonary pressure gradients and evaluate the effect on local blood flow and VA/Qmatching.  Approach we will test the hypothesis that regions of highly stretched (high local trans-pulmonary pressure) lung corresponding to regions of high V /Q ratio in supine posture will be reduced in prone posture. A resulting in more uniform V /Q matching. In normal subjects we will use data acquired in supine posture A combined with person-specific modeling to predict the effects on blood flow and VA/Q matching in prone posture, and test our predictions against measurements made in prone posture. This information will be used to develop biomarkers for optimal blood flow based on density distribution and thoracic shape (and thus measureable with routine clinical CT) that predict improvement with prone posture. This will be tested in collaboration with Dr. Harm Bogaard (VU Univ. Amsterdam) in a retrospective study of patients with ARDS who have undergone prone ventilation."

"9346733","ABSTRACT TessaTM is validated medical device wearable capable of providing clinical sleep quality metrics for multiple nights to assess the efficacy of a sleep disorder treatment. Tessa records the forehead EEG to stage sleep in an automated report that tracks changes in sleep architecture before and after a treatment for many sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. There is a trend for tracking one?s sleep health at home with unvalidated consumer electronic wearables. Yet, sleep diaries, actigraphy watches, and smart phone sleep apps have been shown to be inadequate, inaccurate, and have poor specificity as compared to polysomnography (PSG). There is clear need for a validated medical device that can provide primary care physicians and sleep medicine specialists with clinically-actionable, quantitative information on a person?s sleep architecture with the sensitivity and specificity of PSG for multiple nights in the user?s home. TessaTM is a medical device worn on  the forehead at night to track sleep To address this clear medical need, Epitel has developed a prototype quality by monitoring the EEG. Its of its Tessa device that records EEG from two gold electrodes centered form and compliance make it above the eyes with a common reference along the midline based on comfortable to wear and sleep with for frontal scalp locations that have been shown to contain the EEG multiple nights in the user?s home. signatures of sleep architecture, including eye movements (Stepnowsky et al, 2013; Huang et al, 2014; Popovic et al, 2014). Tessa is simply placed on the forehead each night where it records the EEG signatures of the different sleep stages. Each night, a fresh conductive and adhesive ?sticker? is placed on the bottom of the device. Each morning, Tessa is removed from the forehead and the conductive/adhesive sticker is peeled off and thrown away. After use, Tessa is mailed back to Epitel where accredited sleep technicians generate a personalized sleep quality report that becomes part of the user?s electronic medical records.  Tessa is semi-disposable, designed The goal of this Phase I study is to demonstrate the feasibility of Tessa to be used for up to 90 nights.

"9461639","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  USH1b is a syndrome characterized by inherited, usually congenital deafness, followed by progressive retinal degeneration. Despite the severity of the disease, there is currently no cure. In order to define the best course for treatment of USH1b, it is essential to define the disease mechanism of USH1b in human cells. This is particularly important, since mouse models for USH1b do not undergo retinal degeneration. In these studies, we will perform phenotypic characterization of human cell models for USH1b. In the process, we will test novel hypotheses about MYO7A function in the primary cilium. We will use the phenotypic characterization from our knockout studies in order to test the efficacy of gene replacement using cDNA containing either of the two dominant splice isoforms of MYO7A. Taken together, this project is expected to provide important biological insights, as well as urgently important preclinical knowledge."
"9342602","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ! Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a variant of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD), displays classic AD amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology but preferentially affects the occipital cortex and visual system. Our recent findings on neuronal genomic mosaicism (NGM) and DNA content variation (DCV) in SAD neurons (Bushman & Kaeser et al., eLIFE) may provide a mechanistic framework for understanding PCA through somatically acquired, pathogenic changes (e.g., genomic amplifications) that occur in some (not all) single cells. These changes include increased DCV, with average gains of over 200 megabase pairs, as well as mosaic APP CNVs in single SAD neurons. The current proposal is designed to understand the role of NGM in PCA. Over the next 3 years, we will test the hypothesis that PCA neurons are enriched in SAD-related forms of NGM including APP CNVs, preferentially increased in occipital over temporal and prefrontal cortex. Two Specific Aims will be pursued. Aim 1 will Assess DNA content variation (DCV) including APP CNVs in neurons from PCA vs. non-PCA SAD and non-diseased brains, and identify affected neuronal subtypes. This aim will provide an understanding of NGM at the level of cortical regions (e.g., occipital and parietal vs. frontal) and layers. Aim 2 will assess CNVs in other known AD genes and will identify novel CNVs showing mosaic alterations amongst occipital lobe PCA neurons. This aim could provide a mechanism for the neuroanatomical regions affected by PCA, via enrichment of one or more AD genes by NGM, and could also identify novel disease-related genes. Completion of both Aims will add a new facet to understanding PCA through NGM, with potential relevance to other SAD variants as well as possible therapeutic targets preferentially affected by NGM."
"9268782","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to conduct the first investigation of the neurobiological underpinnings of social communicative impairments, i.e., autistic traits (AT), in children with ADHD and ASD. AT, a key feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occurs in 20-30% of children with ADHD. These children incur relatively elevated school failure and poor global functioning, highlighting the clinical significance of AT in children with ADHD (ADHD+AT). We aim to advance our understanding of AT across ADHD and ASD, applying state of the art brain imaging methodology as a first step in efforts to foster advances in treatment. Hypotheses emanate from the literature and our preliminary data. We aim to test that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between the fusiform face area (FFA) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) underpins AT across ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1a: FFA-ACC iFC is reduced in children with ASD and in those with ADHD+AT, relative to children with ADHD but no AT (ADHD-AT); H1b: Across groups, weaker FFA-ACC iFC is associated with more severe AT. H2a: FFA-ACC iFC is positively associated with accuracy in emotion face recognition, and H2b: FFA-ACC iFC is significantly more related to accuracy on an emotion task than on a control non-emotion task. In addition, we will explore 1) similarities between R-fMRI and task-fMRI connectivity; 2) brain-behavior relationships beyond the FFA-ACC circuit, deriving whole-brain voxelwise R- fMRI metrics and iFC between regions-of-interest representing the `social brain'; 3) behavioral relations with structural connectivity indexed by fractional anisotroy, focusing on the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and other relevant tracts; and 4) data-drive approaches combining available clinical and imaging data to identify homogenous neurophenotypes regardless of diagnosis. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete datasets from at least 70 children per group - ADHD+AT, ADHD-AT, and ASD (total N=210), group-matched for age, sex, full IQ, handedness and socioeconomic status. Assessments. A partial list includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (administered blind to all other clinical data), K-SADS and ADI-R interviews, Parent and Teacher rating scales. The emotion face recognition task, and the holistic configural face processing task will assess emotion face processing; a Go-No Go task, and motion tracking will measure attention and motion. Brain-behavior analyses will rely on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), structural, diffusion tensor imaging and task- fMRI (matching face task). Significance. The study informs the neurobiology of a shared phenotype, and will bring the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals with AT a critical step for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Additionally, we will share unidentified data with National Database for Autism Research yearly to accelerate scientific progress."
"9240647","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The classical view of cellular decision making is that individual cells make predictable choices based on the information presented to them in the form of both environmental and intracellular signals. However, recent theoretical and experimental studies have unambiguously shown that biological noise, typically arising from inherent stochasticity in underlying biochemical reactions or variability in cellular machinery, ca often play a crucial role in influencing cell fate outcomes. In this proposal, we examine the interconnected roles of signaling and noise in cell differentiation and we hypothesize that noise in cell signaling molecules can engender entirely new trajectories from one cell state to another. We will use computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand how such trajectories may arise, and we will use systems biology approaches to experimentally demonstrate and manipulate these trajectories in model systems of neurogenesis and hematopoiesis. The results of our study will yield deeper insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying cellular decision making, particularly in differentiation, and should allow for more robust engineering of stem and progenitor cells for applications in regenerative medicine."
"9373820","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intestine is a complex organ home to one of our body's largest immune system networks, 100 trillion commensal bacteria, and a variety of specialized eukaryotic cells, such as epithelium, Paneth cells and mucus- producing goblet cells. A high antigenic burden in the intestine exists because it is a common entry site for pathogens, the site for absorption of food proteins and the high number of commensal bacteria. Dysregulation of the immune responses can lead to disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colitis-associated cancers. In order to prevent aberrant immune responses communication and regulation between these compartments is essential. The close proximity of the microbial world to the human cells of our intestine suggest that innate receptors, such as Toll-like Receptors (TLR), which recognize conserved microbial motifs, may play an essential role in regulating homeostasis and inflammation. Our previous work has identified TLR1 as a critical mediator of intestinal immunity during pathogenic infection. Further, we have found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in TLR1, which abrogates surface expression and signaling, is associated with pediatric IBD. Further this mutation impacts disease severity and response to immune-therapies. Intriguingly, we have found that nave mice deficient for TLR1 signaling produce elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory innate cytokines IL-23 and IL-1 in the colonic lamina propria. IL-23 and IL-1 are important for the expansion and maintenance of TH17 cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). We have found that homeostatic levels of TH17 cells are normal, however ILC3 are significantly increased in the colons of TLR1-deficient mice. Importantly ILC have been identified in patients with IBD, though their induction, regulation and role are still unknown. The proposed research will examine the regulation of IL-23 and IL-1 in the absence of endogenous TLR1 signaling in the colon and how this impacts the development of ILC3. Specifically, we will determine whether IL-1 and IL-23 are necessary and sufficient for the homeostatic increase in ILC3 and determine the cell types necessary for this increase. We will also determine how the absence of TLR1 signaling in the colon leads to up-regulated IL-23 and IL-1. Lastly, as ILC can have both protective and pathogenic roles in the colon, we will examine how ILC induced in the absence of TLR1 signaling impacts intestinal inflammatory responses. The results of these studies will contribute to the understanding how specific TLR1 signals regulate of innate immunity in the colon. Further, as we have identified a mutation in TLR1 signaling in pediatric patients with IBD, a greater understanding of the regulation of innate immunity by TLR1 may lead to the development of individualized therapies or treatments to prevent disease or relapses."
"9236078","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of effective therapies for treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) and adult respiratory distress syndrome remains a challenging task. Relatively low efficiency of existing pharmacological therapies may be due to differences between pre-treatment models used in experimental studies and treatment of ongoing condition in clinical scenarios. It is very possible that pre- and post-treatment models target distinct molecular pathways activated during onset, peak and resolution phases of ALI. Our pioneering studies during the previous cycle characterized barrier-protective properties of oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs). We have described molecular mechanisms of endothelial barrier enhancement and protection during OxPL co-treatment in septic (LPS) and aseptic (Thrombin, IL-6, pathologic mechanical ventilation) models of ALI. We identified key roles of small GTPases Rap1, Rac, Cdc42 and Rap/Rac-Rho crosstalk mechanism in OxPL-dependent control of cytoskeleton, cell-cell junctions and endothelial barrier. Pilot studies for this application reveaed unique protective effects of OxPL post-treatment still achieved after 16 hrs of inflammatory insult. Preliminary data show OxPL-dependent induction of lipoxin, a lipid mediator shown to downregulate existing inflammation and promote resolution. Our pilot studies also suggest involvement of prostanoid family receptor EP4 and cell membrane-associated OxPL-interacting protein GRP78, recently described by our group, in anti- inflammatory effects and restoration of endothelial barrier properties and lung function induced by OxPL post- treatment in the mouse model of ALI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Aim-1 will test the hypothesis that beneficial effects of OxPL post-treatment in the Staphylococcus aureus model of lung injury involve OxPL- induced lipoxin induction leading to suppression of inflammation and improved ALI recovery. Aim-2 will test the hypothesis that lipoxin pathway is initiated by OxPL-induced activation of GRP78-EP4 signaling complex in the caveolin enriched microdomains (CEM). This proposal will further explore therapeutic potential of OxPL post-treatment, and Aim-3 will test effects of a group of synthetic cleavage-resistant phospholipid compounds generated in our group as prototypes for future treatments. The results of this project will uncover novel, previously unexpected mechanisms accelerating ALI recovery by oxidized phospholipids and may lead to discovery of a new group of pharmacological molecules for the treatment of ALI, ARDS, and other diseases associated with increased vascular leakage and inflammation."
"9457093","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our research application is addressing PQ8: Why do certain mutational events promote cancer phenotypes in some tissues and not in others? The goal of our proposed research is to identify factors responsible for tissue-selective tumorigenesis following inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a familial cancer syndrome characterized by tissue-restricted tumorigenesis, provides a unique and tractable model with which to accomplish this goal. Bi-allelic inactivation of Men1, a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor encoding the transcription factor menin, is required for tumorigenesis in MEN1. Our experiments using Cre-lox deletion of Men1 demonstrates that differential inactivation of Men1 in various tissues does not explain the tissue restricted nature of tumors in MEN1. Rather, additional factors are required to enhance or suppress tumorigenesis in tissues that have lost Men1. For example, homozygous deletion of Men1 in all cells of the pancreas results in tumors in the endocrine tissue but not exocrine tissue of the same organ. Given that inactivation of Men1 is tightly linked to MEN1, we postulate that operation of these modulating factors is regulated by loss of menin. Our central hypothesis is that loss of menin differentially regulates expression of factors that influence carcinogenesis in various tissues so as to generate the tissue restricted characteristic of tumor formation in MEN1. To test this hypothesis, we propose to undertake both unbiased, genome wide screens and candidate approaches to identify relevant factors. Aim 1 employs ChIP- Seq and RNA-Seq respectively to identify DNA binding sites for menin that are differentially occupied and transcriptomes that are differentially expressed in tissues that develop MEN1 tumors versus those that do not. Specifically, we will compare tissues from the endocrine pancreas (develops tumors) versus the exocrine pancreas (does not develop tumors). Aim 2 will validate these findings in the parathyroid gland, a second site of tumor development in MEN1. Aim 3 will explore the role of the candidate protein ARC, an apoptosis inhibitor and cell cycle promoter that has already been implicated in mammary carcinogenesis. Our preliminary studies show that ARC is up-regulated by deletion of Men1 in the endocrine pancreas and parathyroid gland, but not in the exocrine pancreas. Moreover, ChIP-CHIP studies suggest that menin binds to the promoter of nol3, the gene encoding ARC. Taken together, these studies will provide novel and important insights into why tumors develop in some tissues and not in others following loss of a tumor suppressor gene."
"9340804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide the candidate with advanced training in developmental affective neuroscience and psychopathology. The proposed research will test a novel neurodevelopmental model of depression in which stressful life events and insufficient sleep increase risk for depression in adolescents by disrupting the development of reward-related neural circuitry. Two studies are proposed to test this model of depression. The first study will evaluate whether neural and behavioral response to rewards and depressive symptoms are associated with daily stressful life events and sleep duration from the previous week. Participants for this study will be recruited from an ongoing longitudinal fMRI study of neural reward circuitry and risk for depression in adolescent girls. The second study will evaluate whether increasing sleep duration can increase neural and behavioral response to rewards and decrease depressive symptoms in 18- to 20-year-old girls with insufficient sleep and depressive symptoms. Participants for this study will be recruited from university and college health clinics and the surrounding community. In combination, these studies will help characterize reward processing as a putative mechanism of depression onset and provide data on the efficacy of sleep extension as an intervention for depressive symptoms in late adolescent girls. The candidate has expertise in several domains relevant to the proposed project, including affective bias in depression, the role of sleep in cognitive processing and psychopathology, and cognitive neuroscience research methods. She will build on this experience through her K01 by developing expertise in: 1) reward circuit neurodevelopment in late adolescence; 2) stressful life events and physiological stress-reactivity; 3) sleep and circadian rhythms; and 4) advanced skills for longitudinal data analysis. The University of Pittsburgh is an ideal environment to accomplish these research and training aims for two reasons. First, the applicant's selected mentors, Drs. Erika Forbes and Martica Hall, are both highly successful independent investigators with extensive mentorship experience and collective expertise in stress and sleep as risk factors for aberrant development of reward-related neural circuitry and depressive symptoms. Second, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the premier centers for affective developmental neuroscience and sleep research. The proposed research and training plan will contribute to a future R01 application that will examine neural and behavioral response to rewards and neural and physiological response to stress longitudinally as mechanisms of psychopathology in adolescents. This application is consistent with priorities outlined by the National Institute of Mental Health for research on the development and function of neural circuits, mechanisms and modifiers of aberrant developmental trajectories with a focus on periods of sensitivity to disruption, and Research Domain Criteria standards for research on basic dimensions of functioning (e.g., positive valence systems) that are relevant to psychopathology."

"9415552","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use."
"9249655","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders show persistent avoidance of activities, places, or people associated with their traumatic event. Persistent avoidance interferes with routine activities and also prevents individuals from overcoming their fears through extinction. Our goal is to understand the neural mechanisms of avoidance, in light of what is known about the neural circuits of fear learning. We will utilize a platform-mediated avoidance task, in which rats avoid  tone-signaled shock by stepping onto a nearby platform. Based on our pharmacological data, the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) and ventral striatum (VS) are necessary for platform avoidance. For this proposal, we will first characterize single unit activity in PL during avoidanc expression (Aim 1), and then determine when these responses are necessary for avoidance by optogenetically silencing PL neurons during specific time periods (e.g. tone onset, platform mounting; Aim 2). This will allow us to test a causal relationship between PL neuronal firing and avoidance expression. We will then determine when VS activity is critical for avoidance by optogenetically silencing VS neurons during the same time periods used for silencing PL neurons in Aim 2 (Aim 3) and reveal how the contribution of VS compares with PL in avoidance expression. These findings will advance our understanding about the differences between the neural circuits of fear and avoidance and their implication for anxiety disorders."
"9244917","Excessive alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which manifests a spectrum of liver disorders including steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcohol related liver cirrhosis accounted for 0.9% of all global deaths and 47.9% of liver cirrhosis mortalities in 2010. The statistical numbers highlight the significance of alcohol effects on the liver pathology. However, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive and therapeutic treatments are lacking. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of ALD and identify potential drug targets, this principal investigator (PI) is investigating a critical epigenetic regulator, sirtuin 6 (Sirt6), an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, which has been implicated in metabolism and inflammation. Sirt6 systemic knockout mice suffer chronic inflammation in multiple organs including the liver and develop progressive hepatic fibrosis. The PI's preliminary study has revealed that knockout of the Sirt6 gene in the liver significantly worsens the alcohol-induced liver injury with elevated levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and increased expression of fibrosis markers, suggesting that Sirt6 is involved in ALD. We hypothesize that Sirt6 functions as a safeguard against the alcohol- induced liver damage. To test this hypothesis, the PI proposes to carry out the following specific aims: 1) Define the role of Sirt6 in the development of ALD; 2) Explore a novel Sirt6 pathway in the protection against the alcohol-induced liver injury. Overall, the proposed research addresses an important problem in the ALD field. Better understanding of the role of Sirt6 in ALD is expected to have significant implications for the development of prevention and treatment of this serious disease."
"9473265","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integration of facial gestures and vocal signals is an essential process in communication and involves many brain regions. One brain region that has been shown to play a crucial role in the processing of face and vocal information is the ventral frontal lobe, home to our language processing areas. While previous studies have described the role of the frontal lobes in working memory, decision-making, and goal-directed behavior with regard to visual information few have examined the cellular basis of auditory and integrative processes in the primate prefrontal cortex. The goal of the experiments in this proposal is to understand how neurons in the ventral prefrontal cortex process and integrate complex auditory and visual information, especially face and vocalization information that is relevant to social communication. We have previously shown that single neurons which respond to faces, to vocalizations, and to their integration are found in the ventral lateral prefrontal cotex (VLPFC), a region homologous to language regions in human inferior frontal gyrus. However, vocalization responsive neurons, which also respond to faces, are mainly found in anterior VLPFC. This suggests that portions of VLPFC may be specialized to process and integrate social stimuli, such as faces and vocalizations, or speech and gestures in the human brain. We will assess neuronal activity in primate prefrontal cortex during audiovisual memory tasks which will determine: 1) Is vocalization processing a multisensory process; 2) What factors contribute to multisensory processing and integration of social versus non-social stimuli; and 3) Is the ventral prefrontal cortex necessary in remembering a face-vocalization stimulus? If we can understand the neural processes that normally occur when a facial gesture is integrated with, or enhanced by vocal information, we may begin to understand the problems that occur when this process is disrupted as it may be in language disorders and in autism spectrum disorders."
"9332857","The heart reduces fatty acid (FAs) oxidation and switches to greater glucose utilization with ischemia. While this process allows more ATP production with less oxygen use, it occurs at the expense of limiting the use of FAs, the major substrates for cardiac energy. We hypothesize that this leads to fuel deprivation, especially as blood flow reduction decreases energetic substrate availability. If this hypothesis is correct, then storage of more triglyceride in the heart would lead to reduced ischemic damage; this we speculate is the reason for the ?obesity paradox? in which obese humans who have more ischemic disease also have increased post myocardial infarction survival.  This proposal includes experiments to study basic and clinically relevant relationships between heart FA metabolism and heart function. Specifically, we will use mice created by the PI to study how changes in triglyceride stores and lipid uptake alter cardiac response to ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, we will test whether deletion of genes required for normal uptake of FAs by myeloid cells affects their conversion to an alternatively activated and reparative phenotype. These studies will include assessment of cardiac gene changes and lipidomics and will utilize tracer kinetics to assess uptake and oxidation of glucose and lipids, and to determine their downstream products. The experiments will require the collaboration of two laboratories: one with expertise in heart lipid metabolism and the second with expertise in ischemic/reperfusion models and analysis of substrate metabolism. The three aims of this application are the following: Aim 1. To determine whether increased cardiomyocyte storage of triglyceride improves response to ischemia. Aim 2. To assess whether mice with reduced heart lipid uptake have altered response to ischemia. Aim 3. To assess ischemic injury and repair in mice with macrophage-specific deletions of lipoprotein lipase and cluster of differentiation (CD)36. The experiments will use several lines greater cardiac triglyceride stores due to transgenic expression of diacylglycerol acyl transferase 1 and peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor ?, and mice with reduced uptake of FAs due to tissue specific deletions of lipoprotein lipase and CD36. These studies will illustrate possible metabolic approaches to reducing ischemic injury and improving repair of damaged myocardium."
"9250104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in promoting breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that this important process is also responsible for the generation of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are resistant to conventional therapy and contribute to tumor metastasis and relapse. Independent of these findings, mutations in BRCA1/2, TP53 and PTEN have emerged as high- penetrance susceptibility genes and are clinically relevant for the determination of breast cancer risk and prognosis. Among these genes, PTEN inactivation promotes both EMT and CSC enrichment. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these activities are largely unknown. In our genetic analysis of PTEN functions in epithelial morphogenesis, we have identified Abi1, a key component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), as a new substrate for PTEN. Protein interaction studies have further demonstrated a novel interaction between Abi1 and Smarcc1 of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which links PTEN to SWI/SNF-mediated epigenetic regulation of cancer. PTEN dephosphorylates Abi1 and consequently downregulates Abi1 and Smarcc1. Overexpression of Abi1 or Smarcc1 in human mammary epithelial cells promotes EMT and enhances stem cell activity. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PTEN loss induces EMT and CSC enrichment through Abi1 and Smarcc1 in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, the role of Abi1 in PTEN loss-induced EMT, CSC enrichment, tumorigenicity and metastasis will be analyzed by gain- and loss-of-function approaches in breast cancer cells and a mouse xenograft mammary fat pad model. In addition, we will delete one or both Abi1 alleles in PTEN- null mouse mammary glands to determine if Abi1 elevation mediates PTEN loss-induced breast tumor formation. To elucidate the signaling events downstream of PTEN-Abi1, we will focus on the interaction of Abi1 with WRC components and Abl kinase and their role in the EMT and CSC enrichment. In Aim 2, we will map the binding sites that mediate the Abi1-Smarcc1 interaction by site-directed mutagenesis. We will then analyze the functional consequences of the Abi1-Smarcc1 interaction in SWI/SNF complex assembly and chromatin remodeling activity at the promoters of the EMT-inducing transcription factors. The impact on EMT and CSC activity will be analyzed both in breast cancer cells and mouse xenografts. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that elevated Smarcc1 competes with Smarcc2 in the SWI/SNF complex and thus induces EMT and CSC activity by overexpressing Smarcc2 and knocking down Smarcc1 in PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the foundation for developing therapeutic strategies targeting EMT and CSCs in PTEN-deficient breast cancer. It will also shed light on the new PTEN- Abi1-Smarcc1 pathway."
"9299462","Title: B-lines Lung Ultrasound Guided ED Management of Acute Heart Failure (BLUSHED-AHF) ABSTRACT Nearly 80% of acute heart failure (AHF) patients admitted to the hospital are initially treated in the emergency department (ED). Once admitted, within 30 days post-discharge, 27% of patients are re-hospitalized or die. Attempts to improve outcomes with novel therapies have all failed. The evidence for existing AHF therapies are poor: No currently used AHF treatment is known to improve outcomes. ED treatment is largely the same today as 40 years ago. Congestion, such as difficulty breathing, weight gain, and leg swelling, is the primary reason why patients present to the hospital for AHF. Treating congestion is the cornerstone of AHF management. Yet half of all AHF patients leave the hospital inadequately decongested. We propose a novel approach to aggressively decongest patients in the ED setting: lung ultrasound guided, protocol driven, AHF management. LUS B-lines are a measure of extra-vascular lung water (EVLW). In the setting of AHF, LUS are a measure of congestion. This simple, easily learned technique has excellent reliability and reproducibility. We hypothesize that a strategy-of-care will outperform usual care. At the present time, usual care is largely empirical. This study will improve the evidence base for ED AHF management. This proposed pilot study, if successful, will lead to an outcome trial examining whether an ED AHF strategy-of-care increases days alive and out of the hospital for patients."
"9262128","Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and metabolic disturbances, such as reduced glucose utilization precede the ?-amyloid and tau pathology. We hypothesize that therapeutics targeting and correcting metabolic dysfunction will be efficacious in treating AD. PGC-1? enhances both mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of antioxidant enzymes, which produces neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo. Sirtuins are NAD+ dependent enzymes which play important roles in regulating metabolism. SIRT3 is of particular interest since it is localized to mitochondria where it activates enzymes of energy metabolism, and protects against reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing MnSOD and mitochondrial glutathione concentrations, and it inhibits activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition by deacetylating cyclophilin D. We will examine whether crossing transgenic mice with increased SIRT3 expression will exert neuroprotective effects in transgenic mouse models with increased amyloid deposition (Tg19959 and APP-NL/G/F), or with increased tau phosphorylation and NFTs (P301S). We will also determine whether treatment with nicotinamide riboside (NR), which increases brain and mitochondrial NAD+ and activates SIRT1 and SIRT3, will produce neuroprotective effects in Tg19959, APP-NL/G/F or P301S transgenic mice. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of nuclear receptors is a group of ligand modulated transcription factors that regulate gene expression of metabolic pathways, including PGC-1?. We will determine whether the PPAR? agonist palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), the PPAR? agonist pioglitazone or the panPPAR agonist fenofibrate which modulate energy metabolism and inflammation, are neuroprotective in transgenic mouse models of AD with either APP or tau mutations. Levels of thiamine and the thiamine dependent enzymes ?-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase are reduced in AD. Lastly, we will determine whether the lipid soluble thiamine analogue benfotiamine can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and is neuroprotective in transgenic mouse models of AD with either APP or tau mutations. We will utilize microPET and MRI to determine the time course of the development of impaired glucose metabolism amyloid plaques (PIB) and tau (T807), which areas show the most susceptibility, and whether these can be altered by therapeutic interventions including NR, PPAR agonists and benfotiamine. These experiments are highly significant since they may lead to novel treatments to slow or halt the cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative processes which occur in AD and related dementias."
"9198246","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human infant is typically sterile in utero and then born into a world dominated by microbes, which selectively assume residence of the body surfaces and enteric tract of the newborn. The assembly of the early human microbiome is particularly an issue relevant to the very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) infant, where infection and activation of immunological and inflammatory responses produce acute morbidity and mortality and exacerbate co-morbid diseases of the eyes, enteric tract, and central nervous system. However, the selective forces that alter primary colonization and secondary persistence of more or less pathogenic microbes within the developing microbiota are not well understood, particularly in humans. Specifically, the extent to which colonization is recognized by the adaptive immune response and how the adaptive responses contribute to shaping the microbiome of the premature infant, and how the microbiome influences concurrent and subsequent adaptive immune development, is poorly understood. The immediate goal of the proposed research is to identify antigens from the pioneering microbiome of the intestine in the preterm infant that are recognized by natural birth antibodies and the adaptive humoral response. This work will then determine whether and how the peripheral and mucosal antibody response alters the dynamics of secondary colonization. The central hypothesis is that natural antibodies present at birth modify primary colonization while antigens of pioneering Gram negative enteric bacteria drive adaptive antibody responses that alter secondary colonization and long-term immune memory. The hypothesis will be addressed through an innovative combination of molecular tools in the following aims: 1) To determine the relationship between natural and adaptive antibodies and colonization of the VLBW infant intestinal tract, 2) To determine the specificity of breast milk IgA to the breast milk microbiome and the early intestinal microbiome in the VLBW infant, and 3) To measure the specific antigens of the neonatal microbiome recognized by antibodies in the first year of life. These studies will uniquely define the constellation of antigens recognized by preterm infant and maternal natural and adaptive antibodies as the infant becomes colonized. By determining the dynamic interface between mucosal antibody response and specific antigens recognized by the newborn human host, new interventions may be envisioned through which to alter primary and secondary colonization of infants through stimulation of natural and adaptive antibodies. In turn these advents may lead to approaches to alter long-term outcomes including infectious diseases, allergy, and metabolic syndrome."
"9212419","The Translational Center for Child Maltreatment Studies (TCCMS) at Penn State will increase the rigor and quality of research conducted in the field of child maltreatment via exciting research projects and cores. Through a large-scale partnership with the State of Pennsylvania's Department of Human Services, Project 1 is a prospective cohort study of 1200 maltreated and comparison children aimed at elucidating the multiple etiological processes believed to play a role in the onset and maintenance of adverse health outcomes for victims. By using state-of-the-art assessment methods across multiple levels of analysis?neuroendocrine, autonomic, epigenomic, immunological, behavioral, familial, contextual, and several aspects of resilience? Project 1 will identify the putative and protective mechanisms of subsequent health outcomes, including physical health, behavioral health, and brain development. This rigorous science will significantly advance knowledge of the complex interplay between biological and behavioral mechanisms responsible for health disparities in maltreatment victims and illuminate avenues for promoting resilience and opportunities for reversibility. Project 2 is stratified cluster randomized trial (SCRT) of a Clinical Decision Rule (CDR) for Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) designed to increase child abuse evaluations of high-risk head trauma cases and saving lives where AHT is currently unrecognized. This SCRT will comprise 416 AHT patients aged 0-3 in 8 Pediatric ICUs across the country. Project 2 also includes a sustainability trial of implementation strategies utilizing another 104 AHT patients. By translating high-quality science into fiscal messages that will leverage legislative action, the TCCMS's Dissemination and Outreach Core (DOC) will develop a national model for advancing the basic, yet illusive, tenet of science as a vehicle for impacting and mobilizing social change. Using administrative data the DOC will employ predictive analytics to craft translational messages about the economic impact of child maltreatment. The DOC will also use predictive models to translate knowledge generated in Projects 1 & 2 into compelling fiscal messages regarding the public costs incurred by maltreated children in the Project 1 cohort, and the Return-On-Investment of implementing the Project 2 CDR. By engaging community providers, the DOC will use a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to devise and test workable solutions to facilitate implementation of child welfare reform. The DOC will package TCCMS research into products that will entreat increased public investment. The Admin Core will maximize and accelerate TCCMS impact by ensuring that its research and products receive high-level exposure to the public and to policy leaders. The Admin Core will serve as a national model for growing new science and nurturing budding scientists through access to a national data repository and innovative experiential learning forums. The TCCMS will emerge as THE premier center where transdisciplinary scientists work together with practitioners and policy-makers to implement solutions to the complex problem of child maltreatment."

"9278828","Summary This study will address the following important issues in research of noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy (NICS) in humans: (1) whether synaptopathy occurs in noise-exposed workers; (2) if so, how to measure cochlear synaptopathy in humans; and (3) the association between the type of noise exposure and NICS. This will be addressed as follows:  (1) Collecting a large number of human subjects with well-documented noise exposure data  from diverse industrial settings. This will consist of the following: i) digitally record  complete shift-long temporal waveforms of the noise that individual workers are exposed  to (8-hour) in a variety of heavy industries; ii) obtain audiograms from workers exposed  to each of the specific noise environments; iii) screen subjects using high-frequency  audiometry and Distortion product optoacoustic emission to confirm that the selected  subjects have normal hearing thresholds and normal cochlear functions.  (2) Conducting three supra-threshold measures for detecting cochlear synaptopathy in  selected subjects. Four hypotheses related to NICS in humans and the relationship  between the type of noise exposure and NICS will be tested using these three measures. The proposed study will be the first large investigation of synaptopathy in noise-exposed workers. The data collection and measurement techniques outlined in this proposal are very innovative and will help us to explore NICS in noise-exposed workers. Over the proposed 5-year course of this research 11 groups of subjects with 100/group will be collected and investigated. The success of the project will be extremely useful to understand how to measure synaptopathy in humans and apply it to develop a more accurate hearing protection protocol."
