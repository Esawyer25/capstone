"9250191","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypothesis: Our previous studies using elastase-perfusion models of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have shown that IL-1R1 KO mice have a decreased incidence and size of aneurysm formation. We have also recently shown that treatment with the IL-1 pathway inhibitor, anakinra, in both prevention and treatment studies results in significant protection from aneurysm formation in a mouse model of AAA. In the current proposal, we will investigate the role of IL-1 signaling in smooth muscle and macrophage phenotypic transitions using novel rigorous lineage tracing mouse models of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation and to examine the mechanism of IL-1R1 signaling in AAA formation as a method to selectively determine treatment strategies to protect against AAA formation. Methods: We will use a elastase perfusion and Angiotensin II murine models of AAA coupled with rigorous smooth muscle and macrophage lineage tracing analysis in conditional IL-1 receptor 1 KO mice. Anakinra treatment will be administered via osmotic pump to determine the role of Anakinra treatment on smooth muscle cell and macrophage transitions during aneurysm formation. Aortic diameter will be measured on day 3, 7, 14, and 28. Aortic tissue will be harvested to analyze pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1?, TNF-?, MCP-1, IL-6, and RANTES), MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by zymography, serine proteases (uPA, tPA and PAI-1) by western blots, elastin and collagen degradation as well as aortic smooth muscle expression by histology, and immune cell (macrophages, T cells, neutrophils, B cells) infiltration by flow cytometry. Results: Preliminary data found significant attenuation in aneurysm formation in IL-1R1 KO mice 14 days following elastase perfusion in AAA formation. Wild-type male mice administered anakinra via osmotic pump 3 days before TAA formation also exhibited decreased aortic diameter. AAA formation in IL1? and IL1R1 KO male mice display a decreased aortic diameter, decreased cytokine production (TNF?, MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-27), decreased MMP-9 expression and decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration compared to wild-type male mice. Finally, IL-1R1 is increased in human AAA samples versus non-aneurysmal controls via qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: IL-1 pathway inhibition can attenuate aneurysm formation and inflammation in the topical elastase murine model of AAA. We propose to delineate the mechanism of IL-1 signaling in AAA formation using novel lineage tracing analysis in smooth muscle cell and macrophages and to examine the role of IL-1 signaling in the pathology of aneurysm formation with the overall goal to develop aneurysm treatment."

"9257910","Project Summary/Abstract  This study aims to develop a tissue engineered meniscus implant with functional attachments, or entheses, in order to produce a clinically viable alternative to cadaver tissue. The entheses anchor the meniscus into the subchondral bone of the tibia, allowing the meniscus to redistribute loads in the knee generated by walking, jumping, etc. Injuries to the meniscus account for over one million surgeries in the United States every year. The only currently viable surgical technique is the transplant of tissue taken from deceased patients. Tissue engineering provides a promising alternative given its potential for patient speci?city and post-implantation, cell-based remodeling. The author?s lab has previously produced tissue engineered meniscus implants, but the viability of these implants requires the formation of functional entheses. Not only are entheses required for meniscus function, they also allow for easier integration with the body by relying on the superior abilities of bone healing versus soft tissue healing. The entheses have a complex tissue structure that has been shown to mediate stress concentrations between the compliant meniscal tissue and the stiff subchondral bone. Mimicking the structure of native meniscal entheses in tissue engineered constructs will produce viable entheses for a functional tissue engineered meniscus implant. Aim 1 is based on the hypothesis that morphological and biomolecular structuring at the micron scale will correlate with micromechanical gradients that correspond to bulk mechanical properties. The proposed work will examine the microstructure of native meniscal entheses using Raman microspectroscopic mapping, confocal ?uorescent microstrain mapping, and bulk tensile testing on the same sample to create a model for the development of tissue engineered constructs. Aim 2 part A is based on the hypothesis that injecting a cell-seeded high density collagen gel into a cell-seeded partially demineralized bone plug will create a triphasic, mechanically tunable, enthesis-like structure. The proposed work will produce mechanically graded enthesis constructs that mimic mechanical and spatial gradients observed in Aim 1. Aim 2 part B is directed at applying this enthesis construct to previously produced meniscal implants to form a fully functional tissue engineered meniscus. Aim 3 will study these implants in a pilot animal study using sheep. This aim will show the clinical feasibility of the implant from Aim 2 and examine the effects of implantation on the tissue engineered meniscus. This study will provide insight into the enthesis structure and produce tissue engineered menisci that can be used as implants in further studies."
"9441911","Long nuclear retained non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) represent a large and relatively unmined class of RNAs that are likely to play critical roles in gene regulation and disease etiology. A major challenge is to understand the molecular functions of specific IncRNAs both at the cellular level and within the context of an organism. The long-term goal of this project is to identify and characterize IncRNAs that play a critical role in mammary gland development and the initiation and progression of breast cancer. Here, a series of Aims are presented to dissect out the role of Malati, an abundant IncRNA localized to nuclear speckles and focally amplified in a significant number of metastatic breast cancers. Studies are proposed to develop innovative loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse models combined with cell biological approaches to assess the function of Malati in normal development and in breast cancer initiation and metastasis. The impact of alterations in the level of Malati on tissue organization will be examined, and its effect on alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner will be pursued by next-generation RNA-sequencing analyses. Complementary cell biological studies will delve into the role that Malati plays in nuclear organization and its impact on the dynamics of pre-mRNA splicing factors enriched in nuclear speckles. The Malati RNP will be purified using an RNA-tagging strategy and its proteome will be characterized in order to identify proteins responsible for its nuclear retention and to provide additional insight into its function. In the final Aim a series of newly identified IncRNAs, that are misregulated in breast cancer, will be prioritized and several will be selected for functional analyses, to identify genes and pathways that they target, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they contribute to breast cancer tumorigenesis. Together, the proposed studies will provide important insights into the role of several IncRNAs in normal development and cancer and will lead to new opportunities for the identification and characterization of a new and exciting class of potential therapeutic targets."
"9211324","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Despite advances in the scientific knowledge related to diabetes prevention and management, diabetes prevalence, complications, and costs continues to rise. A majority of the dollars that go towards diabetes care are spent on Emergency Department visits, hospitalizations, and the management of diabetes complications. Changing the trajectory of the diabetes epidemic in the United States may require a fundamentally new approach to chronic disease management and reimbursement that emphasizes disease prevention and management. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) could be such an approach. Under this model, an organization is charged with the care of a population, receives a capitated payment and may be eligible for either a share of any savings achieved and/or at risk for a portion of any spending over the set target. As such, ACOs have been proposed as a means to simultaneously improve population health and reduce health care costs. The Alabama Medicaid program is undergoing a major transformation from a traditional fee for service model to the establishment of ACOs (referred to in Alabama as RCOs or Regional Care Organizations). The Alabama Care Plan, one of 6 probationary RCOs, will assume care for over 70,000 Medicaid recipients in Region B, 11% of whom have diabetes. In April 2015, VIVA Health, a local managed care organization and the lead entity in the Alabama Care Plan, began creating care coordination teams that will work with individuals' current health care providers to comprise a larger health home. This phased transition provides a unique opportunity for us to assess the impact of policy change related to reimbursement and the delivery of health care as it relates to diabetes. With this proposal, investigators will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of this transition on outcomes in three dimensions: health of a population, experience of care, and per capita cost. The specific aims are: 1. To examine changes in diabetes related population health measures, including glycemic control (HbA1c) and indicators of diabetes care (quarterly HbA1c, annual eye exam); 2. To examine patient experience of care using a telephone-administered survey and qualitative interviews with a subset of individuals with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the Health Home; and 3.To examine changes in health care utilization and overall cost effectiveness of the newly implemented RCO and Health Home compared to diabetes care before RCO implementation. Using Medicaid data beginning in 2010 through 2019, investigators will conduct interrupted time series analyses of data from enrollees within Region B and difference-in- differences analyses to compare changes over time in Region B with changes over time in 3 southern, non- ACO states. The multidisciplinary team of investigators has expertise in diabetes research, use of CMS data, survey administration and qualitative methods. Alabama has the highest rate of diabetes in the United States. As such, this study could have important local and national policy implications for new approaches to diabetes management."
"9237177","In the past, the ADCS has had an active and successful minority recruitment core. In this submission we have expanded the function of the recruitment core to improve recruitment to all protocols and to evaluate recruitment efforts at the site level as well as across all sites. The specific aims of the recruitment core are as follows:  1. Identify a full range of recruitment and retention activities, including both successful previously tried and newly proposed.  2. Review protocols with Project Directors to reduce barriers to recruitment. Aspects of the protocol to be reviewed include subject eligibility, study procedures, and schedule of events. The goal of the review will be to avoid unnecessary restrictions, and to minimize subject burden while maintaining scientific rigor.  3. Support and train site staff in recruitment and retention efforts. While the sites have been chosen for their expertise in evaluation and treatment of cognitive deficits and dementia as well as their commitment to conduct clinical trials, many are less familiar with communication techniques that can maximize recruitment. This mandatory training will provide an opportunity to introduce the techniques and methods and provide a dialogue for specific needs. The trial sites will be evaluated continually throughout the trial and lags in recruitment will lead to additional contact from the trial PI and the recruitment core leader, and a site-specific remedial program will be developed, implemented and monitored for success.  4. Maximize minority participation. We will continue our efforts to insure that our sites provide maximum opportunity for participation by minority populations. We will include training at the sites. In addition, we will continue our efforts to bring on selected sites which primarily serve minority populations."
"9330978","Project Summary The 2017 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Inhibition in the Central Nervous System will be held at Les Diablerets Conference Center, Les Diablerets, Switzerland, on June 25-30, 2017. This international research conference has been held every 2 years since 2005 as part of the GRC conference series. It will be preceded on June 24-25, 2017, as in previous editions, by the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which is reserved for graduate students and postdocs in order to give them an introduction to the main topics of the GRC. Inhibition, mediated primarily by the neurotransmitter GABA, regulates all aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function and represents a major target for therapeutics. The scientific community working on inhibitory neurotransmission is broad and very dynamic. This GRC provides a major forum bringing together leaders in the field along with rising new stars among early-career investigators. The goal of this meeting is to increase our understanding of the molecular, synaptic and network mechanisms contributing to the critical role of inhibitory neurotransmission in normal and abnormal CNS function. To achieve this goal, the meeting will pursue specific aims that include dissemination of the latest discoveries about inhibition in brain function and dysfunction, promotion of diversity and collaboration within the field, and advancement of the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. These aims will be met by convening 35 world-class speakers and 9 discussion leaders actively working in diverse areas of inhibition from eight different countries (21 from the US; 17 women), ensuring internationality and diversity. The GRC will accommodate up to 200 participants at a five-day conference in an isolated setting. The health relatedness of this application is that discussions at the Inhibition in the CNS GRC/GRS meetings will define the questions that require experimental resolution in areas related to cognition, human development, drug abuse, and a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that involve dysregulated inhibition including epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia and other diseases. Taken together, it is expected that the scientific discussions, research talks, poster sessions, and various informal interactions between the diverse participants of this conference will advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying in CNS function and human disease."
"9237184","Disruptive agitation frequently emerges as a troublesome and often chronic clinical problem during the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It dramatically increases caregiver burden in both home and long term care settings, is distressing to patients and others in the patient's environment, and is a common precipitant of long-term care placement. Current psychopharmacologic approaches to agitation in AD and related dementing disorders, particularly the widely-prescribed antipsychotics, are of limited demonstrated efficacy and are associated with substantial adverse effects. The latter include increased risk for stroke and death, excessive sedation and pseudoparkinsonism.    The development of more effective and safer pharmacologic approaches to the treatment of disruptive agitation in AD is an important clinical goal. Neurobiologic studies in the clinic and in postmortem brain tissue provide rationale for involvement of enhanced central nervous system (CNS) responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE) at the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor (AR) in the pathophysiology of disruptive agitation in AD. Our preliminary placebo-controlled clinical trial feasibility data support potential efficacy of the generically available brain active alpha-1 AR antagonist, prazosin for agitation in AD and good tolerability of this drug in this elderly and often frail population. We propose a placebo-controlled trial of prazosin, for disruptive agitation in AD."
"9328627","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The goal of this project is to characterize the multifaceted inhibitory and tumor-targeting properties of SP2043, a type IV collagen-derived peptide, in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. TNBC is a particularly lethal cancer owing to a high propensity for metastasis and limited treatment options. Attempts to limit the metastatic progression of TNBC using anti-angiogenic agents have not been very successful, in part due to lymphatic dissemination. However, attempts to block lymphangiogenesis using broad-range inhibitors was met with significant toxicity. Peptide inhibitors offer a unique opportunity to design potent inhibitors with low toxicity. SP2043 and its early analogs were found inhibit the activation of multiple growth factor receptors, including many related to both angiogenesis and lymphangiogensis (ie. VEGFR2 and VEGFR3). As a possible explanation for this multimodal inhibition, these peptides were found to interact with several species of integrins. Integrins are highly expressed in tumors and their vasculature and associated with the progression of metastatic disease. In addition to their roles in adhesion and migration, integrins can contribute to metastasis through the regulation of growth factor receptors by clustering them into large, functional protein complexes or by altering their intra-cellular trafficking. Disruption of these processes can have profound effects on receptor stability and signaling profiles, emphasizing the potential benefit for development of SP2043 as a therapeutic agent. Here, we propose to investigate the inhibitory mechanisms of SP2043 through their interactions with integrins as well as offset one of their major disadvantages, their short half-life in vivo, through their incorporation into tumor target-nanoparticles. Specific Aim 1 will use biophysical and cellular based methods to determine the affinity of SP2043 for specific integrin pairs and investigate the effects of this peptide on the stability of integrin-growth factor receptor signaling complexes. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism through which SP2043 influences cellular responses to growth factor signaling, including changes in the distribution of specific growth factor receptors and processes involved in vessel stability and permeability . Finally, in Specific Aim 3, optimal formulations for the anti-angiogenic activity of SP2043-coated nanoparticles will be investigated using mouse xenograft models of the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line in order to improve the bioavailability and test the efficacy of these compounds. Together, these experiments will allow for the better characterization of SP2043?s multimodal inhibition and pave the way for its development as a targeted therapy for the treatment of TNBC."
"9293685","Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have recently attracted much attention as they play key roles in tumor spread and in response to therapy: TAM substantially accelerate the progression of untreated tumors; they also markedly influence the efficacy of anticancer drugs, including checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Furthermore, targeting TAM themselves, e.g. through the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), can effectively control the progression of advanced tumors. However, TAM show considerable plasticity by assuming opposing phenotypes and functions that can be either tumoricidal (e.g. M1-like cells) or tumorigenic (e.g. M2-like cells) and currently there is a significant knowledge gap on how TAM function in vivo and how these cells' activities can be harnessed to improve anticancer therapy. This is largely because most of our knowledge on TAM has come from histological and in vitro profiling studies, which are are invaluable methodological approaches but cannot address how TAM functions are integrated within the dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME). The goal of this project is to perform high resolution imaging??in combination with broader coverage imaging and complementary readouts??to reveal fundamental aspects of TAM and other myeloid subtypes during tumor progression in vivo. Further, we aim to use imaging to uncover how most recent treatments (e.g. anti-PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint blockers) and new promising approaches (CSF-1R inhibitors) affect TAM functions in vivo and in turn how drug effects on TAM impact treatment efficacy. Specifically, to advance our knowledge of TAM subtypes and other myeloid cells, we will combine: i) new mouse models and reporters for these cells; ii) single cell resolution intravital imaging of tumor environments; iii) broad coverage microscopic imaging and other ex vivo readouts; and iv) new computational analysis. Taken together, findings from this research proposal should not only deepen our understanding of mechanisms regulating myeloid cell responses but also help uncover new opportunities for next-generation immunotherapeutic strategies and TAM imaging. This immunotherapy imaging project brings together tumor immunology (Pittet) and imaging (Weissleder) expertise from two different laboratories. We are well positioned to achieve our goals, having demonstrated the feasibility of the experiments outlined in this application."
"9311625","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The relative scarcity of recurrent somatic mutations in neuroblastoma, a tumor of the developing sympathetic nervous system, has challenged efforts to devise effective targeted therapies for this devastating childhood cancer. One exception to this otherwise disappointing picture is the mutated ALK receptor tyrosine kinase, which appears at a relatively high frequency in neuroblastoma, and has been highlighted as an important player in the pathogenesis of this tumor and a key target for drug development. Research progress over the past 5 years in the principal investigator?s (PI?s) laboratory (under 1R01CA148688) and recently acquired preliminary data indicate that targeted therapies combining improved ALK inhibitors (ALKi) with novel synergistic inhibitory compounds are needed to induce durable remissions in neuroblastoma patients with activating ALK mutations. This projected advance will need to be coupled with greater knowledge of the origins of resistance to such treatment, as well as strategies to extend ALK-directed therapy to larger numbers of patients. To address these challenges, the PI will pursue three pivotal questions that are intended to propel targeted therapy research in neuroblastoma into the next era ? the long-term goal of this research. Aim 1: Can the cytotoxicity of ALKi be improved and resistance delayed by combining these agents with transcriptional CDK inhibitors (CDKi)? Hypothesis ? The combination of CDKi with ALKi in ALK-mutated, MYCN nonamplified neuroblastoma cells produces synergistic activity by disrupting transcriptional regulation through enhanced inhibition of ALK signaling. Aim 2: What are the mechanisms by which ALK-mutated, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells develop resistance to ALK inhibitors? Hypothesis ? The acquisition of resistance to ALKi is associated with global redistribution of super-enhancers to BRD4 enhancer sites, leading to novel molecular vulnerabilities that could be exploited for therapeutic gain. Aim 3: Can wild-type ALK cleavage be leveraged as a therapeutic target in high-risk neuroblastoma? Hypothesis ? Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of ALK could be therapeutically targeted through MMP9 inhibition to impede NB cell migration. Positive results in this renewal proposal would clearly benefit children with high-risk neuroblastoma and may also benefit patients with different cancers that express aberrant ALK, from non-small cell lung cancer to anaplastic large-cell lymphoma."
"9223710","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA is a dynamic molecule that goes through conformational changes such as bending, twisting, and stretching. Bending of DNA, which leads to most noticeable conformational changes, is associated with DNA packaging, DNA looping and DNA mismatch repair inside a cell. Errors in any of these processes can cause human diseases, and therefore, understanding intrinsic bending properties of DNA is related to human health. To understand how frequently sharp DNA bends can arise, we need to know their energy cost. People have estimated this energy by measuring how likely it is for a linear DNA to form a loop by thermal fluctuation. Based on the results, we can all agree on how much energy is needed to bend a 500 base-pair long DNA into a circle, which is considered as normal bending. But experimental data disagree regarding a 100 base-pair long DNA, which requires sharper bending to form a circle. These contradictory results prompted different models about how DNA achieves sharp bending. One model suggests that double-stranded DNA can locally melt into unpaired single strands and acquire increased flexibility. However, experimental evidence for this bubble formation is lacking. In this proposal, we investigate the energy stored in a DNA loop as small as 50 base pairs and test various models of DNA bending in the sharp bending regime. The key idea is to form a small DNA loop shaped like a teardrop, and measure how long it stays as a loop. Loop formation or breakage will be observed on a microscope using a technique called Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The lifetime of the loop will depend on its energy; a loop with a higher energy will be less stable. Therefore, we can test a classical polymer model of DNA known as the worm-like chain model with accuracy in the sharp bending regime. Because a teardrop also has a pointy tip unlike a circle, we can place various DNA content near the tip to compare their bending rigidity in different bending regimes. We will measure bending rigidity of various sequences and mismatches in normal and sharp bending regimes as a function of temperature. We will also compare our results against DNA-melting theories to elucidate the role of DNA melting in DNA bending. This proposal will address some of the most controversial topics on DNA biophysics."
"9390627","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this program is to train promising young scientists at the postdoctoral level in the multi- disciplinary strategies of molecular, cellular, behavioral, and clinical neuropsychopharmacology of ethanol. The Scripps Research Institute Alcohol Research Center (TSRI-ARC), combined with a very active independent but interactive San Diego Alcohol Research Community, has developed a conceptual framework for the study of the neurobiology of alcoholism and the neurobiological basis for individual differences in vulnerability to alcoholism. Methods have been developed by combining biochemical, morphological, physiological and behavioral research to arrive at broad based studies of the neuropsychopharmacology of alcoholism through such fields as molecular biology, immunocytochemistry, electrophysiologic analysis (in vitro and in vivo), neuroendocrinology, behavioral pharmacology, and cognitive and motivational testing applied to animal and human subjects, and clinical studies. In addition, we also attempt to develop other important skills for pathways to independence: creative research expression, critical selection of problems, experimental design, data recording, validation and security, data interpretation, manuscript and grant preparation, promotion of transition awards, and ethical conduct of research. Trainees participate in scientific project development, research seminars from visiting scientists and journal clubs is well as actively participating in research programs. Each trainee will also receive a course on ethanol neuropsychopharmacology and a course in ethical conduct of research. Both informal and formal recruitment mechanisms are well established and have provided a sufficient number of high quality applicants. Extensive programs are in place for recruitment of minority and for facilitating minority interest in alcohol research. Significant success in the past funding period has resulted in retaining and promoting two minority faculty to the training program, training of two minorities and recruitment of two young faculty members. An evaluation of the success of the program is in place charting the career development of pathways to independence in alcohol research of former fellows with use of a formal evaluation survey. Postdoctoral fellows and other advanced trainees are selected with preferential weighting towards those seeking interdisciplinary methodologies. They are then assigned to one of the Principal Investigators of the training grant who coordinates their initial research project selections. Depending upon a trainee's prior research skills, collaborations with more than one senior scientist are encouraged. All combined, the training program provides a dynamic environment for fellows to develop and pursue a foundation for career in the neuropsychopharmacology of alcoholism."
"9312109","Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a ?scanner-to-clinician? platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease."
"9265339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects over 1.7 million Americans each year and is the leading cause of death and disability in young children in the United States. For children with TBI, current treatment options are largely extrapolated from studies on adults, despite significant differences between pediatric and adult brains. Therefore, this proposal aims to specifically study pediatric injury, using clinically-relevant models of childhood disease. Specifically, we will focus on the role of astrocytes in pediatric TBI, a highly understudied area of research. It is well established that astrocytes in the brain and spinal cord play a major role in both acute and long term response to injury. Astrocytes associated with injured tissue, termed reactive astrocytes, are characterized by profound changes in protein expression leading to changes in the fundamental properties of these cells. Yet, little is known about the genetic regulation of the astrocytic injury response. This proposal seeks to address this question by examining the regulation of two essential functions of astrocytes following injury: the ability to buffer extracellular K+ ions and to regulate extracellular glutamate concentrations. These two astrocytic functions are largely mediated via the inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, Kir4.1, and the astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT-1. In the adult spinal cord and brain, dysregulated K+ and glutamate homeostasis in the extracellular space leads to neuronal hyperexcitability, changes in synaptic physiology, and plasticity. Furthermore, both proteins are developmentally regulated with the most significant increases in expression in humans and rodents during early postnatal development at the peak of glutamatergic synaptogenesis, establishing an important role for these two proteins in the immature brain. This developmental period also correlates with the age group highest at risk for TBI. Despite the importance of these two proteins in brain function, very little is known regarding their regulation during development or in response to injury. Using a highly clinical relevant model of TBI, this proposal aims to specifically ask the following questions: 1) Following pediatric injury, is there  persistent decrease in Kir4.1 and GLT-1, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability? 2) Is loss of these proteins a direct result of epigenetic modulation of gene transcription? 3) Can manipulation of DNA methylation using FDA-approved drugs reverse the loss of Kir4.1 and GLT-1 in pediatric injury models? This proposal seeks to enhance our understanding of the role of astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the CNS, in the pathophysiology of pediatric traumatic brain injury and abnormal brain development following injury. Results from these experiments could lead to novel therapeutic strategies using FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of TBI in pediatric patients."
"9456924","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Funding is requested to renew a training program that aims to train the next generation of behavioral scientists with expertise in the prevention of HIV and related co-morbidities (i.e. TB, viral hepatitis and STls) among substance using populations. Our program builds upon the joint doctoral programs (JDP) in public health and clinical psychology offered through a longstanding partnership between the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and the San Diego State University (SDSU) Graduate School of Public Health and School of Social Work. In this renewal, a new JDP beginning in 2013 on Social Sciences Research in Substance Abuse will further enhance our applicant pool, and our extended focus beyond HIV co-infections to consider co-morbidities reflects additional breadth. Our objectives are: 1) To provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research training experiences for predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in epidemiology, health behavior and psychology who wish to focus on prevention research at the intersection between substance abuse and HIV and related co-morbidities; 2) To offer students hands-on experience in the prevention of HIV and related co-morbidities in international settings; 3) To recruit and train researchers from diverse academic backgrounds and under-represented minority (URM) populations with state-of-the-art skills to address challenges in substance use and HIV prevention research; and 4) To train individuals in the responsible conduct of research with human subjects, especially in international and cross-cultural settings. After 4 years of support, our program has supported 16 trainees. Of the 6 postdoctoral fellows and 3 predoctoral trainees who completed training, all remain active in the field; 4 completed Fellows are now Assistant Professors. Three Fellows successfully competed for K01s; one predoctoral trainee received an R36 dissertation grant and a second was granted a Diversity Supplement. We have supported 5 URM, of whom 3 already completed training. Collectively, trainees published 59 manuscripts during their training. We request support for 3 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees, mentored by 17 Core Faculty. Depending on their level of training, mentees are required to complete courses in substance abuse and infectious diseases, instruction in responsible conduct of research, quarterly cultural sensitivity training workshops, monthly 'Work In Progress' seminars and a grant-writing seminar. Our active research programs in nearby Mexico and 8 other countries create the opportunity for unique, hands-on international training experiences and an infrastructure for trainees to develop into independent investigators."
"9240048","It is well established that women exhibit a significantly higher rate of affective disorders than men do. This difference is particularly strong in post-traumatic stress disorder, where women are more than twice as likely to experience PTSD than men.  Recent evidence suggests that women?s susceptibility to PTSD varies with their levels of ovarian hormones. During the luteal phase, when progesterone is elevated, women are more than three times as likely to develop PTSD symptoms after trauma. Similarly, women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression, and depressive  symptoms also vary by menstrual phase. Both of these disorders involve alterations of memory, stress responses, and resting connectivity  in the brain?s intrinsic networks. In PTSD, individuals experience intrusive memories of traumatic  events, while individuals with depression show a marked negative retrieval bias. Stress-evoked release of the stress hormone cortisol is also elevated in both disorders. Similarly, resting connectivity between the default mode network, a group of structures engaged during the retrieval of memories, and the salience network, a group of structures involved in processing emotion, is elevated in individuals suffering from both disorders. Recent research indicates that affective memory, stress responsiveness, and resting connectivity are all influenced by changes in ovarian hormone levels.  Negative memories acquired during the progesterone-rich luteal phase are better retained than during other menstrual phases.  Increased progesterone is also associated with increased stress-evoked cortisol secretion.  Similarly, ingestion of progesterone pills increases the connectivity between key nodes of default and salience networks.  No study to date, however, has assessed the influence of changes in ovarian hormones on inter-network connectivity over the menstrual cycle. We hypothesize that changes in hormone levels over the menstrual cycle produce natural windows of  vulnerability to traumatic life events, during which changes in the connectivity of the brain facilitate stress responses and enhance memory for negative experiences. To test this hypothesis, we will measure resting connectivity, stress hormone levels, physiological responses, and memory for negative material learned at hormonally distinct phases of the menstrual cycle. We predict that connectivity between resting and default mode networks will be at highest levels  during the luteal phase, and that material learned in a negative emotional state will be best retained during the luteal phase. Additionally, we predict that the amount of connectivity between these two networks will significantly predict the enhancement of memory by negative affect, as well as the physiological response to negative mood induction. The results of this study could help to identify periods of maximum vulnerability trauma, thus facilitating prevention, as well as point to new and more targeted drug treatments."
"9385528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are limited options for reconstruction of bone defects resulting from congenital anomaalies, trauma, infection, and oncologic resection. Nearly one million bone graft procedures are performed annually, with the clinical 'gold standard' being the use of decellularized allografts. Of these allograft implantation procedures, nearly 60% fail within 10 years of implantation due to poor graft-host integration and microcrack propagation. Unlike allografts, autografts fully heal and integrate, mediated by the periosteum, a thin layer of tissue and periosteal cells (PCs) surrounding bone, where healing is coordinated by a variety of contextual cues including matrix and paracrine factors. PCs, which persist during autografts healing for only ~21 days, are phenotypically similar to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Therapeutically, however, MSCs are favored compared to PCs as they are isolated from bone marrow, reducing bone tissue morbidity resulting from PC isolation. A critical knowledge gap exists in identifying the critical cues (paracrine factors, matrix interactions, etc. that orchestrate autograft healing and are absent in allografts, preventing the translation of therapies to effectively revitalize allografts. Our objective is to develop periosteum mimetics composed of synthetic hydrogels (poly(ethylene glycol), PEG) for MSC transplantation to (1) promote cell-mediated allograft healing/integration, to (2) isolate the critical factors of the periosteum in healing, and to (3) develop cell-free therapies that result in complete allograft healing and integration. Hydrogels will be used to surround allografts, taking advantage of structural integrity of allografts and improving what is insufficient in healing and integration by recreating the periosteum. We hypothesize that hydrogel nanoarchitectures can be tuned through alterations in degradation and biochemical functionalities to promote MSC-mediated allograft healing and integration. We further hypothesize that MSCs promote healing through simple release of paracrine factors, thus, cell-free revitalization approaches can be developed. The rationale for this work is to identify translatable therapies, based on critical healing factor, to improve healing and integration of the 300,000 massive allograft procedures performed annually in the US. Three specific aims are outlined: Aim 1: Develop periosteum- mimetic PEG hydrogels to support MSC-mediated allograft healing in vivo. Aim 2: Identify critical paracrine factors produced by hydrogel-transplanted MSCs that modulate allograft healing. Aim 3: Develop paracrine factor-releasing hydrogels to enhance allograft revitalization in the absence of cell transplantation. Successful completion of these Aims will significantly advance our understanding of how MSCs coordinate allograft healing and integration and of how to design synthetic polymer scaffolds to promote natural bone regeneration processes. This material platform should be readily tailored for applications towards regenerating tissues beyond bone, as well as providing specific advantages for future directions in the design of cell delivery vehicles."

"9285375","Project Summary Pertrubed affective processing is a defining symptom of a host of psychiatric disorders, such as depression where it is a primary symptom, and disorders where affective disturbances are secondary symptoms, for example, schizophrenia. Studies of healthy individuals and those with depressed mood implicate a network of areas centering on ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala in the control of long-term changes in affect. Despite this understanding, the neural mechanisms that generate and regulate affective experiences are unclear. One reason for this lack of clarity stems from the fact that studies of affect in animals typically only assess instantaneous and short-lived behavioral and neural responses to discrete aversive or positive stimuli. These stimuli typically last less than a second and generally belonging to a small class (e.g., juice) that are not particularly ecologically relevant. To date, no studies in non-human primates have probed the neural basis of affective states that extend over minutes or hours, durations typical of mood states in humans. Such studies would form the foundation for understanding how mood is controlled at the level of brain circuits and single neurons. The objective of this proposal is to determine how the circuit connecting ventral ACC and amygdala functions before, during, and after the induction of either negative or positive affective states in non-human primates. We hypothesize that negative and positive temporally extended affective states will be associated with unique patterns of local and circuit-level neural activity within ventral ACC and amygdala during affect induction and the selection (or regulation) of affective state. We will test our hypothesis by first determining how local and circuit level activity within ventral ACC and amygdala encodes the valence of dynamic, ecologically relevant stimuli that generate unique affective states (Aim 1). We will record both single neurons and local field potentials in both ventral ACC and amygdala and analyze the timing of the neural responses and LFP coherence among these areas to gain circuit-level understanding. Then, using a translationally- relevant affect induction technique that mirrors affect induction paradigms used in humans, we will establish how affect-related neural activity within the ventral ACC-amygdala circuit is altered when temporally extended changes in affective state, both positive and negative, are induced (Aim 2). The induction of affective state will be confirmed using both behavioral (i.e., response selection) and cardiac correlates of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, measures of affective state that are well validated in humans. Once the neural mechanisms, the specific patterns of neural activity within the ventral ACC-amygdala circuit that control affective states are known, we anticipate being able to either increase or decrease activity in this circuit to influence affective states. This project marks a significant departure from standard approaches to studying affective non-human primates and has the potential to provide vital knowledge for treating mood disorders."
"9240649","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well recognized in the medical community that a medical intervention (e.g. a drug or a device) may have different effects on different people, e.g.  some patients may benefit from an intervention whereas others do not or even are harmed by it. Application of a medical intervention to patients who do not benefit from it not only puts unnecessary financial burden on individual patients and the society, but also results in suboptimal health outcomes for these patients. Patients may miss the best treatment window because of the use of an intervention that has a null effect for them. On the other hand, as drug development has become increasingly expensive with high failure rates, there is an urgent need to identify patients who benefit from a new drug even though others may not. A major gap exists in the methodology to extract knowledge on who will or will not benefit from a medical intervention. Moreover, there is no software specifically designed to serve this purpose on a routine basis by analyzing medical data.  Our long-term objective is to produce generic software specifically designed for the analysis of treatment effect in different subpopulations, which can be applied on a routine basis using data from randomized or observational studies. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) develop a set of statistical methods to examine whether or not there exists subpopulations who benefit from or are harmed by a medical intervention, and if yes how to identify the subpopulations using patient characteristics and estimate the treatment effect in these subpopulations; 2) apply the developed methods to data from both randomized trials and a real-world electronic medical records (EMRs) database to understand the effect of a medical device called implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in reducing mortality; and 3) implement the methods in a popular statistical software that is publicly available.  The project has impact. First, the methodological research in this proposal addresses key AHQR priority areas of focus on accelerating implementation of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research and make health care safer. As a general statistical methodology, the methods to be developed can be applied to essentially any diseases/conditions to study heterogeneity in treatment effect (HTE) including treatment benefit and harm for patient-centered outcomes. Second, knowledge obtained by our method generates more informative and relevant information to facilitate decision-making for patients/clinicians and guideline-making for policymakers. Third, this project will provide critical evidence towards improvement of ICD guidelines that account for the heterogeneity in response to ICDs."
"9379140","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supportive health care measures instituted during childhood successfully prevent serious infections and many other life-threatening complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), resulting in improved survival to adulthood. This has, in part, shifted the demographics of SCD to include a growing proportion of young adults with chronic health impairments. While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has curative potential, very few individuals with SCD are treated by HCT, due in part to the toxicity of this treatment. Recently, advances in Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing techniques and supportive care have improved outcomes of HCT, particularly after unrelated donor HCT. Our overarching hypothesis is that HLA identical sibling and well- matched unrelated donor HCT in adults with severe SCD is feasible and has an acceptable safety profile with a 2-year event free survival of at least 80%. In order to test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of HCT in young adults with severe SCD. 2. Measure the impact of donor hematopoiesis on functional outcomes and end-organ function. We will conduct a comparative clinical trial of HCT vs. standard supportive care in adolescents and young adults with SCD age 15-40 years of age. For this purpose we have organized an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in HCT or SCD and a data-coordinating center very experienced in the conduct of clinical trials for the Blood and marrow transplant clinical trials network (BMT-CTN). This trial will compare outcomes after HCT to outcomes observed in those who receive standard supportive care, the first comparison of this kind in hemoglobinopathies. We will assign 60 patients who have an available suitably matched donor to the HCT arm. We will contemporaneously enroll 120-140 SCD who do not have an available suitable donor to a parallel comparison cohort. The primary endpoint is 2-year event free survival in the HCT patients. Secondary endpoints will compare functional outcomes including cardiopulmonary function, effort tolerance, health related quality of life, pain, organ function and SCD complications in those with or without an available donor, in a modified intent to treat analysis. HCT specific outcomes and complications, and lineage specific donor chimerism will also be studied. We will establish a long term follow up cohort of all eligible patients for the purpose of future studies of long term impact of HCT on outcomes in SCD. If successful, this study could establish the place of HCT in and broaden the therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of adults with severe SCD."
"9243247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a resubmission of a competing renewal application for an ongoing collaborative program among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New England Eye Center and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Eye Center. This is a multidisciplinary program which integrates imaging technology research, clinical and small animal imaging studies. The specific aims are:  Aim 1. Next generation OCT technology and methods for structural and functional imaging. We propose to develop ultrahigh speed swept source OCT (SSOCT) at 1050nm which will enable wide field volumetric retinal and choroidal structural imaging, OCT angiography of retinal and choroidal microvasculature as well as Doppler OCT to measure total retinal blood flow and functional stimulus response. In parallel, we will continue development of ultrahigh resolution (UHR) spectral domain OCT (SDOCT) with 2-3?m axial resolution to visualize and measure outer retinal structures. We will also develop 3D image processing techniques to correct motion artifacts, enable volumetric data averaging and quantitatively analyze 3D data. Volumetric data from different patient visits will be registered to track disease progression and measure subtle changes in pathology.  Aim 2. Structural and functional imaging of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma. Cross sectional and longitudinal structural and functional clinical imaging studies will be performed in patients with AMD, DR and glaucoma. Changes in photoreceptors, RPE and Bruch's membrane are possible markers of disease in AMD and will be investigated using UHR SDOCT. Volumetric structural imaging of the retina and choroid will be performed using ultrahigh speed SSOCT. 3D vascular and capillary structure in the retina, ONH, choriocapillaris and choroid, potential markers of AMD, DR, and glaucoma will be investigated using OCT angiography. Alterations in blood flow and functional flicker stimulus response (neurovascular coupling) will be investigated in DR and glaucoma patients using Doppler OCT and OCT angiography. Studies will include patients with different levels of disease as well as normal controls. The objective is to identify new structural and functional markers for early diagnosis, monitoring progression and response to therapy.  Aim 3. New OCT techniques for structural and functional imaging in small animals. We propose to develop ultrahigh speed OCT methods for structural and functional hemodynamic imaging in small animals. Studies will investigate the streptozotocin-induced rat diabetes model compared to normal controls. We will also develop spectroscopic OCT techniques to measure retinal vascular permeability with Evans blue dye exogenous contrast. Spectroscopic OCT will provide 3D maps of retinal vascular permeability and will be more efficient than current ex vivo Evans blue vascular permeability assays. Advances in small animal imaging will be powerful tools for both fundamental studies of disease mechanisms and pharmaceutical development."
"9325355","ABSTRACT A common problem with any chronic drug therapy is non-adherence. Non-adherence to therapy,  including HIV anti-retroviral therapy, can be due to a combination of factors including pill  fatigue, intolerable side-affects, and the complexity of therapeutic regimens. Non-adherence is  associated with a rebound in viral loads which can be  accompanied by the emergence of  drug-resistant HIV strains. This poses a major public health threat not only because of ensuing  disease progression, but also because drug-resistant strains are spread in the population through  de novo infections. Even as the HIV drug pipeline continues to generate novel and potent  anti-retroviral compounds, much attention is now being directed towards developing long-lasting  drug delivery options. In order for combination therapy with HAART to continue to be effective in  improving AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, therapies need to be formulated so as to require  infrequent and convenient dosing while achieving sustained and effective tissue concentrations. To  date, the most successful strategy for prolonged and controlled delivery of small molecule     treatments relies on slow-releasing nano-suspensions or polymeric microspheres that are injected  either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. There are, however, many drawbacks to the injectable  approach. Injectables are limited to highly potent, very hydrophobic molecules, and can produce  long, sub-therapeutic tails with uncertain risk. Long-acting oral therapies are potentially the most convenient route for patients, and may offer  significant advantages over injectable solutions. But no existing oral delivery system can provide  more than 12-24 hours of sustained release of small molecule therapies. Lyndra has developed an  orally-available, gastric-resident dosage form engineered to deliver therapeutic doses of drug(s)  over a period of a week, before disintegrating and safely passing out of the body. The basic  modules of the device are an elastomeric center fused to six arms made of a polymer-drug blend;  break points called linkers are strategically placed in the arms to ensure timed disintegration of  the dosage form, leading to quick and safe passage out of the body. We have demonstrated in large  animal models that this platform is capable of once weekly administration with near steady-state  pharmacokinetics for a variety of small molecule therapies. The objective of this proposal is to  integrate a highly potent anti-HIV molecule into this platform for a once weekly oral regimen. In  Aim 1, we will optimize a formulation of Dolutegravir, a potent integrase inhibitor, for sustained  delivery from a polymeric matrix blended with various excipients that control the rate of release.  In Aim 2, we will develop novel, enteric linkers that quickly dissolve in the intestinal  environment. A tracer system to monitor residence of drug-loaded doses will be based on release of  sub-therapeutic doses of short half-life FDA-approved drugs. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose to test  gastric residence as well as pharmacokinetics of drug and tracer release in a large animal model.  Our target product is a 0-size capsule comprising a single dosage form loaded with enough  Dolutegravir to sustain serum levels similar to those achieved by the current clinical regimen, for  one week. In the long term, we plan to develop formulations that carry combinations of highly  potent anti-retrovirals and tracers that allow patients to self-track the presence of the doses."
"9209221","CORE E: MAGNETIC RESONANCE & OPTICS SPECTROSCOPY ? PROJECT SUMMARY Core E provides state-of-the-art in vivo assessment of mitochondrial energetic and redox state. This is made possible by applying Magnetic Resonance (MRS) and Optical Spectroscopy (OS) methods to intact animals. Because the cell environment plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial function in vitro assays of both energetics and redox will not fully reflect the local environment and function of the intact tissue, cell and mitochondria. To that end, we will use new innovative tools to reveal cell and mitochondrial NAD redox states (NAD+ and NADH) in vivo in addition to established measures of cell energy status (ATP, PCr, ADP, pH). This breakthrough in measuring NAD redox states permits measurement of intrinsic factors that underlie mitochondrial inhibition that comes with age and its reversal with a targeted intervention. Changes in mitochondrial energetics and NAD redox status are key aspects of the hypothesized mechanisms underlying age-related dysfunction and reversal by SS-31 tested in all three PPG projects. Therefore, assessment of these properties is an important requirement of the three PPG Projects that are based on enhancing mitochondrial function in heart, skeletal muscle and vision. Here we apply our innovative multimodal (MR and optical) approaches in combination with physiological perturbations to measure key mitochondrial functional properties that change with age and are impacted by interventions. These measures provide ? for the first time in vivo ? the critical measures of mitochondrial function that are the gold-standard in vitro: mitochondrial O2 uptake and ATP synthesis, as well as mitochondrial capacity (ATPmax) and coupling efficiency (P/O). These measures are made non- invasively in rodent models in muscle and heart in vivo. Our preliminary studies demonstrate change in cell energy state, NAD redox states and reduced mitochondrial function in these organs with age. Most importantly, these same techniques are sensitive to detect the impact of interventions to reverse the cell energy state reductions and redox changes, as well as improve mitochondrial function in old tissues. We will use this approach in to assess in vivo cell energy status (ATP, PCr, ADP, pH) and NAD redox status (cell NADH, NAD+ and mitochondrial NADH) by measurement of new spectroscopic signatures (Aim 1) and to assess in vivo mitochondrial energetics by measurement of mitochondrial oxidation, phosphorylation and coupling in vivo (Aim 2)."

By the year 2020, one third of the world's population-over 2.5 billion people-will be affected by myopia alone. The global economic productivity loss from uncorrected refractive errors has been estimated to be $268 billion. Hence, refractive errors are a significant Public Health problem, especially in regions of East Asia where myopia has reached ?epidemic? proportions.  Refractive errors are complex traits, in which both inherited genetic and environmental/behavioral factors are thought to play significant roles. The objective of this project is to study the effects of gene-environment interactions on ocular refraction within the context of whole-genome association studies. The proposed research will make use of 6 large datasets from genomic studies conducted in the United States, Germany, and Singapore. Our specific aims are to: 1) discover of genetic polymorphisms which interact with environmental factors in gene-environment-wide interaction studies of refractive error; and 2) identify biological pathways or gene-sets through which environmental factors mediate refractive error development in humans. The ultimate goals of the research are to better understand the complex biology of ocular refractive development, and identify specific genes which interact with environmental factors (as measured by proxies of exposure to high visual demand, such as education and reading) in refractive error.  The proposed research is part of a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award. Training in the grant period will focus on developing skills necessary in the design, management, analysis and interpretation of large-scale gene-environment-wide studies. Dr. Wojciechowski's long-term career will be devoted to translating the vast data provided by large genomic studies into clinically useful, comprehensible, and practical information. This information will ultimately benefit scientists, clinicians, Public Health practitioners, policy makers and, most importantly, the public at large."
"9261150","Well over a thousand patients have now received chemically distinct, nano-encapsulated chemotherapeutics, generally showing lower toxicity, increased tumoral accumulation of payloads and occasionally improved progression free survival. Experimentally, an even larger number of new constructs and approaches have been pioneered by Nanotechnology Alliance members and other groups. Testing in mice usually involves measuring tumor sizes, survival or the use of histopathology and other molecular diagnostics. Yet, despite these advances, much less is known on how these nanomaterials actually work or fail in vivo, what the spatial and temporal heterogeneity is and how efficacy can be improved. Armed with new biological insight from recent feasibility studies leading to this application (Sci Transl Med, 2015;7,314ra183; Nat Comm 2015;6,8692) and the recent developments of new in vivo imaging technologies (Nat Commun 2013;4,1504; PLoS One 2013;8:e60988; Nat Methods. 2015;12:577-585; ChemMedChem 2014;9:1131-5) we are now able to address these important cancer nanotechnology questions in ways that were not previously possible. The goal of this project is to perform imaging analyses of therapeutic nanoparticles, addressing key questions on nanoparticle distribution (pharmacokinetics, PK) and cellular response (pharmacodynamics, PD): i) why aren't current clinical TNP more efficient (aim 1); ii) how much does tumor targeting with affinity ligands help to improve efficacy (aim 2) and iii) can we select responders from non-responders by nanoparticle enhanced MR imaging (aim 3)? We hypothesize that a considerable proportion of tumor cell accumulation is mediated by tumoral myeloid cells (macrophages) rather than by cancer cells, offering a new strategy to further enhance efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, this project is complementary to existing Alliance projects and will be useful to other Alliance members across the consortium through future interactions. It will also provide a much needed biological understanding of nanoparticle enhanced MR imaging findings to interpret clinical data."
"9441910","The central goal of Project 2 is to understand the role of alternative splicing in cancer. Cancer cells display extensive qualitative and quantitative dysregulation of splicing, and a subset of the isoforms that are inappropriately expressed can contribute to tumorigenesis. The mechanisms and pathways through which the splicing-factor oncoprotein SRSF1 and related members of the SR protein family transform cells will be investigated. Organotypic culture, as well as orthotopic and transgenic mouse models will be used to study transformation promoted by these splicing factors and their cooperation with other oncogenes in different cancer contexts. How these factors themselves are regulated in normal cells and upregulated in cancer will be addressed. High-throughput methods will be employed to systematically identify the splicing targets of SR proteins in human cells, and selected targets involved in tumorigenesis will be analyzed in detail. Splicing factors that contribute to the distinctive glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells will be identified and characterized, and alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase pre-mRNA will be investigated as a potential therapeutic target by specifically manipulating this process in tumors."

"9309201","Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects about 1 in 50,000 children worldwide. HME is characterized by cartilaginous tumors called exostoses that form in perichondrial cells along the growth plates and protrude into surrounding tissues. The exostoses can thus cause skeletal deformities, compression of nerves and blood vessels, chronic pain, and become malignant in about 5% of the patients. Current therapies are limited, and patients struggle with pain and limited mobility and undergo multiple surgeries through life. Most HME patients bear a heterozygous mutation in EXT1 or EXT2 that are responsible for heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis, thus causing a partial systemic HS deficiency. The HS chains - and the proteoglycans of which they are part- regulate and distinctly modulate many processes. Notably, they interact with and stimulate signaling by fibroblast growth factors, but interact and inhibit signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins. FGFs and BMPs generally exert anti- and pro-chondrogenic roles, respectively. However, it was unclear whether HS partial decrease is sufficient for exostosis formation, whether HS loss reverses those signaling activities ?thus decreasing FGF and increasing BMP signaling-, and whether such changes induce exostosis formation. In the previous funding period, we made significant progress. We created Ext1+/-, double Ext1+/-;Ext2+/- and conditional Ext1-null mice. While single het mice were largely normal, double hets and conditional-null mice (both producing far less HS) displayed multiple exostoses and mimicked human HME. Exostosis development was preceded by local decreased levels of FGF signal transducers pMEK/pERK and increased levels of BMP signaling mediators pSmad1/5/8. In vitro studies reinforced these findings. Counter-intuitively, the HS deficiency also stimulated endogenous heparanase expression, likely enhancing chondrogenesis even further. Indeed, treatment with recombinant heparanase stimulated BMP signaling and chondrogenesis, while the heparanase inhibitor Roneparstat blocked both. Our central hypothesis is that exostosis formation is caused by: (i) a steep local deficiency in HS; (ii) decreased FGF signaling and increased BMP signaling; and (iii) a boost in chondrogenic potentials in mutant cells along the chondro-perichondrial border. We posit also that exostosis formation is preventable by drug treatment. The project will continue to provide fundamentally new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of exostosis formation and by extension on the normal functioning of these mechanisms in normal perichondrial and growth plate cells. It will also test possible therapies based on those insights and thus has strong basic research value and translational medicine implications. The number of HME patients is relatively small, but the community of their families is large. This project will thus provide a renewed sense of hope to patients and families alike that this neglected disease will continue to be actively studied and a cure may one day be found."
"9267484","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic interaction mapping is an emerging methodology that provides a powerful tool for understanding cellular function. However, despite all of the exciting prior work in this field, several points stand out as remarkable: First, almostall networks to date have been examined under a single static (usually standard laboratory) condition. Biological networks, however, are highly dynamic entities that continuously respond to a host of environmental and genetic changes or are altered more slowly over an evolutionary period. Second, such network changes occur across a wide range of scales, some impacting individual gene interactions, others affecting protein complexes, still others best summarized at the level of broad cell processes.  This project addresses these two core issues (network dynamics and scales) by studying how a genetic network is reconfigured under complex species and stresses and by performing these comparisons using tools that capture a network's multi-scale, modular architecture. In the previous funding period, we successfully focused attention on generating genetic interaction maps across two yeasts, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. We now pursue this analysis in mammals by furthering methodology to generate quantitative genetic networks using combinatorial RNAi in mouse fibroblast cells. Also, in the previous period we developed an approach termed dE-MAP (differential E-MAP), which allowed for the comparative analysis of yeast genetic interaction maps generated across different exogenous stresses. We now propose to leverage this analysis to create the first dE-MAPs in mammals, allowing us to study the evolution of stress response networks across the eukaryotic lineage. Finally, we will further develop a novel systems biology framework to use genetic interaction maps to drive the creation of a data-driven Gene Ontology (GO), which ultimately feeds back to design of subsequent E-MAPs and iterative refinement of GO.  This work will be carried out over three Specific Aims: (1) Improvement and scale-up of a platform for high- density quantitative genetic interaction mapping in mammals; (2) Generation of differential genetic networks in response to stress in mammals and yeasts; and (3) Development of a computational methodology called network-extracted ontologies to enable multi-scale modeling and comparison of genetic networks. Successful completion of these aims will generate important community resources, including a large database of genetic interactions and modules in three different eukaryotic species and further development of network-based ontologies as a new multi-scale approach for network analysis.  Because this project will involve close coordination between the Krogan and Ideker laboratories, this grant invokes the co-Principal Investigator mechanism. It joins two University of California campuses as well as two California Institutes for Science and Innovation, QB3 and Calit2, which support the PIs in the San Francisco and San Diego areas, respectively."
"9231435","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Drug abuse is a major global problem with often devastating societal consequences. While therapeutics designed to treat drug addiction have focused on medicinal intervention with concurrent behavioral therapy, much progress remains to be made in reducing this major social and economic burden. All drugs of abuse appear to work on the dopamine (DA) pathway in the brain, which is normally activated by neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that function, in part, to signal reward. However, DA neurons are not a homogenous population, but rather are composed of multiple subtypes with distinct functions. During the first few years of my postdoctoral fellowship, using a new rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing approach, I constructed a detailed input-output map of VTA-DA neurons, including the inputs to specific subpopulations of VTA-DA neurons. In a subsequent set of pilot experiments, I conducted a brain-wide input screen using the rabies virus to identify the locus of synaptic changes onto VTA-DA neurons that occur after a single administration of a variety of drugs.  Preliminary data from this screen suggest that certain inhibitory inputs (from the globus pallidus external segment, or GPe, and the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens) are altered by a single dose of cocaine, and that these changes occur specifically onto the VTA-DA neurons projecting to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens. In addition, these changes occur in animals that display behavioral sensitization, suggesting that these inputs may be specifically modified in this aspect of addictive behaviors. To more rigorously understand the roles of these inputs in addiction, I propose to analyze the roles of these synaptic adaptations in a self-administration model of addiction. First, I will examine the nature of the plasticity occurrng from these defined synapses onto VTA-DA neurons. Secondly, I will use the knowledge of these changes to direct optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations in-vivo in an attempt to prevent or reverse the drug- induced behavioral alterations occurring with cocaine self-administration. Lastly, in the independent phase, I will use the self-administration model, but now focus on the role of lateral habenula inputs to the midbrain for the development and expression of cocaine withdrawal. As the LHb contains unique subtypes that project either to VTA-DA neurons or GABA neurons in the rostrotegmental area (RMTg), I will analyze the effects of self-administration and withdrawal on the LHb?VTA-DA and LHb?RMTg-GABA connections, the role that each input plays in withdrawal, and if manipulations of each subtype can either exaggerate or alleviate symptoms of withdrawal.  As my preliminary data suggest that the rabies virus can be used as a non-biased technique to screen for drug-induced synaptic alterations, the immense power of this technique in generating hypotheses will be highly useful in generating a unique research plan independent from that of my postdoctoral mentor."
"9395540","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The magnitude of the problem of pain in the US is astounding. More than 100 million Americans have pain that persists for weeks to years. The financial toll of this epidemic cost over $500 billion per year according to the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) recent report, Relieving Pain in America. Similarly, there is a tremendous personal and society cost associated with substance abuse disorders (SUDs). Contemporary neurobiologic, psychological, and epidemiologic research has shown a clear intersection of pain and SUDs. Two of the IOM committee's recommendations for improving research at a national level are (1) increase support for interdisciplinary research in pain, and (2) increase the trainin of pain researchers. In this proposal, we describe a collaborative, postdoctoral (PhD, MD/PhD and MD), interdisciplinary, training program that will produce scientists with rigorous grounding in pain and SUDs research. The 18 accomplished faculty are all committed to interdisciplinary collaboration, which possess complementary expertise that ranges from cells-to- society. The training program includes both required and elective coursework, mentored research experiences, an individual integrated research project, seminars, and exposure to professional development skills, including grant proposal and manuscript writing. The training program in the Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesia, Stanford University School of Medicine, is intended to develop postdoctoral trainees' skills, so that they will become independent investigators in the fields of pain, SUD and their intersection. The training program will be led b Dr. Sean Mackey, in collaboration with a steering committee comprised of senior and successful scientists. They will oversee the training, scientific, and administrative aspects of the program, including a rigorous process of internal and external evaluation. In summary, this training program will bring together a talented group of post-doctoral trainees, an accomplished team of interdisciplinary mentors, an effective administrative structure, and a world-class research environment at Stanford University. The combination of talent and environment will launch the next generation of researchers who will advance our scientific knowledge and practice of pain and substance use disorders."
"9388612","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For ten years the Prevention and Methodology Training Program (PAMT) has met a critical need in the nation's training of prevention scientists and in the NIDA portfolio by fostering careers focusing on the integration of drug abuse prevention science and highly innovative methodology. The objective of PAMT is to produce two types of well-trained scientists. One is drug abuse/HIV prevention scientists who apply the most appropriate methods in their research, are enthusiastic about and comfortable with adopting advanced methods, and engage in career-long learning as new methods emerge. The other is methodologists who improve and disseminate innovative methods for use in drug abuse/HIV prevention research, and who understand and are committed to prevention so that their methodological work truly enhances this field. We achieve this objective by capitalizing on the close collaboration between two well-established and vibrant research centers at Penn State: the Bennett Pierce Prevention Research Center and the Methodology Center. The training program we have established prepares young scientists to address critical research questions in drug abuse prevention that most graduate students and new Ph.D.s would be unprepared to tackle. Examples of prevention topics in PAMT include cost-benefit analysis; research across the translation continuum, including implementation fidelity; understanding heterogeneity in response to prevention interventions; tailoring and adapting intervention content to individuals at  particular times; the interplay between services research and efficacy issues; the role of positive  youth development strategies in prevention; innovative delivery of prevention content via mobile devices; and the role of genetic and neurological variables in both risk behaviors and resiliency against risk factors. Examples of methodological topics in PAMT include sophisticated modeling techniques for the kinds of big data that are growing in importance in prevention, such as intensive longitudinal data, genetic data, and neurological data; statistical models for understanding meditational processes that underlie prevention programs; person-centered analytic methods (e.g., latent class and latent transition analysis); methods for studying effects of risk factors and behavioral interventions as a continuous function of age and/or time; and innovative approaches for building more efficacious and effective behavioral interventions. All PAMT trainees learn how to translate their knowledge and skills to develop and refine strategies to reduce the incidence of drug abuse and HIV. Additionally, fellows receive instruction and mentoring in writing journal articles and grant proposals and in the responsible conduct of research. To summarize, PAMT trainees are engaged in cutting- edge work that integrates two fields-prevention science and methodology-into a seamless, detailed, holistic approach to understanding and preventing drug abuse and HIV. The scientists we train will be at the forefront of this critical area for many years to come. With the present proposal we seek funding to continue and expand this important effort."
"9258315","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optic neuropathies damage retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of the optic nerve, resulting in permanent visual deficits. Substantial progress has been made in our ability to promote axon regeneration following axonal injury, but regeneration remains limited to a small number of RGCs. RGCs are a heterogeneous population, with more than 30 described subtypes. Through the use of transgenic mouse lines it has been determined that an RGC's subtype may predict its regenerative capacity. The molecular mechanisms that regulate subtype dependent differences in regenerative capacity have just started to be identified. The goal of this proposal is to determine: i) whether distinct subtypes of RGC display different responses to axonal injury, and ii) the transcriptional differences that correlate with regenerative capacity. In Aim 1, I will use transgenic mouse lines to investigate how altering light sensitivity affects RGC regeneration. In Aim 2, I will investigate how distinct subtypes of RGC respond to injury. This will be determined by immunohistochemical detection of proteins important for regeneration. Finally, in Aim 3 of this study I will identify potential positive and negative regulators of RGC axon regeneration. RGC subtypes with contrasting regenerative capacities will be selected for subsequent RNA-sequencing. Differentially expressed genes will be identified and validated by RT-qPCR. These genes will serve as novel therapeutic targets to enhance the regeneration of all RGCs, a critical step towards restoring lost vision."
"9272810","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to determine the role of actin-myosin structural dynamics in the molecular mechanism of muscle contraction. Structures, dynamics, and interactions of myosin and actin are fundamental in understanding mechanisms of contraction and its regulation. We focus on dynamic interactions of actin with the catalytic domain of myosin, and extend this investigation to include myosin's light-chain domain and myosin binding protein-C (CPro). To gain insight into structure-functional correlation, we vary active-site ligands, protein isoforms, phosphorylation, mutation, crosslinking, and drugs. Our approach is distinguished by our emphasis on dynamics as well as structure, and on the elusive weak-binding states of actomyosin as well as the more stable strong-binding states. Our core technology is a unique combination of site-directed protein labeling, coupled with high-resolution and time-resolved spectroscopies, to test and revise detailed mechanistic models for the functional interactions of myosin and actin as they transition from weak- to strong- binding states in force generation. In Aim 1, fundamental structural dynamics of the myosin catalytic domain (CD) is investigated, using probes designed to test and revise mechanistic models of actin-activated force generation with high resolution in real time. We seek to understand temporal and spatial coordination of this complex motor. In Aim 2, allosteric changes propagated from the light chain domain (LCD) through the CD to actin will be mapped by probes, with emphasis on regulation by protein isoform and phosphorylation. Similarly, Aim 3 uses the insights of the first two aims to assess structural dynamics of the actomyosin weak and strong interactions perturbed by the presence, isoform, and phosphorylation of CPro. Feasibility (preparations, preliminary data) has been established independently for all three aims, so they are not restrictively interdependent. Instead, the three aims are synergistic, in that they share reagents and are strategically aligned to strengthen each other with new discoveries. Our 3 aims arise from ten novel hypotheses, based on findings from the previous period, converging toward a new synthesis. The assembled research team brings together a powerful combination of techniques and concepts from molecular genetics and cell culture to biophysical spectroscopy and computational simulation, to solve the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction and regulation. This project remains grounded in fundamental biophysical mechanisms, but it is increasingly clear that the tools developed in this project can pave the way for design of molecular therapies in muscle disease. Once we understand the functions of actomyosin and its regulation, we can look to control these functions. It is anticipated that by th end of the next funding period, this project will generate the most detailed and cohesive structure-function model of muscle contraction and regulation to date, and projects will spin off involving the rational design of gene and drug therapies. More generally, the lessons learned in this project are applicable to a wide range of problems in the biophysics of muscle and molecular motors."
"9209223","PROJECT SUMMARY Previous work under this P01 has demonstrated that a single treatment with the mitochondrial targeted peptide SS-31 improves skeletal muscle performance, mitochondrial function, and reduces redox stress. These surprising results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction with age is a more dynamic process than previously thought and can be reversed by late-life treatment to improve healthspan. This new paradigm led directly to an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Washington led by Kevin Conley (PL-Core B) testing SS- 31 for improvement in skeletal muscle function in elderly humans. Preliminary data presented in this renewal also demonstrates that relatively short term treatment (4-8 weeks) with SS-31 can improve cardiac and skeletal muscle function and vision in aged rodents. Additional data from our lab, Core E, and others indicates that SS- 31 does not act as a traditional antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Instead there is growing evidence that SS-31 interacts with mitochondrial cardiolipin to improve mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) function and reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress. We propose that improved ETS function with short- term treatment reduces redox and energy stress which improves function and stress response of the aged muscle. With long-term treatment this improved stress signaling restores mitochondrial structure leading to further improvements in mitochondrial and skeletal muscle performance. Aim 1 uses normal aging and an ETS targeted toxin, doxorubicin, to test this hypothesis for the reversal of age-related muscle dysfunction. We assess the effect of 1 day, 1 week, and 8 week SS-31 treatment on the reversal of mitochondrial redox and energy stress, stress signaling regulating mitochondrial quality, and skeletal muscle performance. For short- term effects we will focus on targeted analyses of the thiol and phospho proteomes in key stress response and functional pathways. We have found that reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress reverses many of the age- related oxidative changes to the thiol proteome, including proteins involved in muscle contraction, EC coupling, protein quality control, and mitochondrial energetics. Aim 2 uses SOD1-/- mice to test whether protection of mitochondrial ETS function and reducing redox stress with SS-31 in this model of accelerated sarcopenia can prevent muscle atrophy when treatment is initiated at the onset of muscle dysfunction. Aim 3 is shared across projects and tests whether SS-31 treatment initiated at mid-life preserves healthspan in normal aging and in aging compounded by high fat diet. Many of the mechanisms tested in Project 2 are likely to be relevant to the aging heart (Project 1) and visual system (Project 3) as well. Therefore the parallel work in these three systems, in which we have already identified significant reversal of physiological decline with SS-31, provides the unique opportunity to identify aspects of mitochondrial function that contribute to the basic biology of aging across diverse physiological systems. The end result will be new insights into the mechanistic basis of this new paradigm for improving healthspan with potential for direct translation to elderly humans."
"9412255","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY A key effect of insulin is to increase glucose uptake into adipocytes by translocating the Glut4 glucose transporter from intracellular storage compartments to the plasma membrane (PM); a process essential for the postprandial blood glucose lower effect of insulin. Disruption of Glut4 trafficking contributes to hyperglycemia associated with insulin-resistance. In basal (unstimulated) adipocytes, Glut4 is predominantly excluded from the PM by a dynamic mechanism of rapid endocytosis and slow recycling. Insulin effects a net redistribution of Glut4 to the PM by accelerating exocytosis and inhibiting endocytosis. In both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions Glut4 is ferried to the PM by Glut4-specialized vesicles (GSVs). How insulin regulates the biogenesis and trafficking of GSVs to the PM are not known. The small GTPase, Rab10, is required for Glut4 translocation and in the past funding period we identified Sec16A as a Rab10 effector. Sec16A is known to function in the formation of ER COPII vesicles, and we have shown that its role in Glut4 trafficking is independent of that function. These data suggest that that Sec16A enhances GSV formation.  In aim 1 of the project we will characterize the roles of Rab10-Sec16A GSV formation, adopting multiple complementary approaches that utilize biochemical, molecular cellular and microscopy methods to define GSV biogenesis, and to identify the Sec16A interacting proteins required for GSV formation. These studies will provide novel information significantly advancing our understanding of the biogenesis of GSVs and will thereby be revealing of a poorly understood step of insulin-regulation of Glut4 translocation.  We have generated an adipose-specific Rab10 knockout mouse (aR10KO). The cellular phenotype of Rab10 KO primary adipocytes is identical to that of Rab10 knockdown in cultured adipocytes. Surprisingly, selective knockout of Rab10 in adipocytes induces insulin-resistance in the liver. Thus, adipocyte ablation of Rab10 alters adipocyte-liver communication to blunt liver insulin sensitivity. These data suggest that Rab10 KO alters the secreted adipokine profile (adipocyte hormones) in a way that impacts liver insulin sensitivity.  In the aim 2 we define the mechanism underlying liver insulin resistance in aR10KO mice. We test the hypothesis that the ablation of Rab10 alters the secretion of adipokines, thereby affecting liver insulin sensitivity. We will investigate how the liver of aR10KO mice differ from control livers, use mass spectrometry coupled with cell-based functional assays to characterize the impact of Rab10 KO on the adipocyte secretome and to identify the adipokines responsible for altered liver metabolism. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the endocrine role of adipocytes, and set the stage for future studies designed to elaborate the cellular mechanism by which adipocytes ?sense? changes in nutrients and how that information is relayed to alter secreted adipokines in response to changed nutrient status."
"9206913","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Esophageal cancer is the 6th leading cause of cancer death worldwide with more than 90% of all cases being esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The overall 5-year survival rate for this disease is only 13% in US, which is the fourth worst among all cancers. There is an urgent need to identify effective biomarkers for early detection, prognostic stratification as well as novel therapeutic interventions for esophageal cancer. Dysregulation in Ca2+ signaling has been linked to many human diseases including cancers. Understanding the pathophysiological roles of Ca2+ permeable channels has recently emerged as an exciting area of cancer research. We have obtained exciting preliminary data suggesting that Orai1, a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel, acts as an oncogene that contributes to the progression of esophageal cancer through regulation of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. In tumors removed from patients with ESCC, we detected elevated expression of Orai1 which was associated with poor survival rate. In cultured human ESCC cells, we identified a striking hyperactivity in intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, in sharp contrast to the quiescent nature in non-tumor cells. Inhibition of Orai1 by either pharmacological or molecular means could harness hyper Ca2+ oscillations, which in turn suppress cell proliferation and migration in ESCC cells. Moreover, our preliminary data showed that inhibition of Orai1 prevents tumor growth in xenograft nude mice. In this project, we hypothesize that hyperactivity of Orai1-mediated Ca2+ oscillations contributes to carcinogenesis in esophageal epithelia, and targeting Orai1 function represents a potential means for treatment of esophageal cancer. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the hyperactivity of Ca2+ oscillations resulting from elevated Orai1-SOCE. Next, we will define the oncogenic role of Orai1 during esophageal carcinogenesis in vivo. Lastly, we will target Orai1-SOCE for ESCC therapy. A multidisciplinary approach will be used including live cell imaging, ultrastructure analysis, intracellular Ca2+ measurement, robust xenograft and carcinogen-induced esophageal cancer animal models. The innovative aspects of this project include the first study on abnormal Orai1 expression and hyperactivity of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in ESCC, identification of the first molecule mediating endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes junctional structures in epithelial cells, a novel transgenic mouse model in which the expression of Orai1 is controlled in an inducible and reversible manner specifically in esophageal epithelial cells. The outcome of this project will reveal the cellular mechanistic understanding of the role of Orai1-SOCE-Ca2+ oscillations in esophageal carcinogenesis. These studies will provide proof-of-principle data on therapeutic approach for ESCC by targeting Orai1 channel activity."
"9243256","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 70 million people.  By 2000, 2.2 million Americans had been diagnosed with glaucoma, and this number is estimated to reach 3.4 million by 2020. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a spectrum of disease causing vision loss which is associated with progressive and irreversible degeneration of nerve cells in the retina. The prevalence of POAG is 3% among those of Asian ancestry, 6% among Caucasians, and 16% among those of African ancestry age 70 and older.  POAG appears almost 10 years earlier and progresses more quickly in African Americans (AAs), making it the leading cause of irreversible blindness in this population. Genetics are known to play a role in this disease~ however, POAG genetics are complex, and many risk factors are involved. This proposal represents the first large population study specifically evaluating AAs for genetic risk factors. In order to examine AAs for POAG risk factors, a genome wide association study (GWAS) will be performed. GWAS is a method that detects genetic variants in a large population to determine if any variants are associated with a disease or trait. The proposed GWAS will generate data on these variants in 17,000 AAs, 2,000 with POAG and 15,000 controls.  This experimental approach will identify genes associated with POAG in AAs, who disproportionately suffer from more severe forms of this disease. Many different clinical traits are associated with POAG, and investigation of clinica determinants of this diagnosis will be correlated with genetic data. Collaborations with other institutions that have explored this approach in other populations will be used to further enhance the data set.       In addition to the GWAS, the portions of DNA responsible for coding proteins will be specifically examined, since abnormal proteins are associated with disease susceptibility, progression, and severity. Genetic risk factors for POAG have been identified in other populations. The relevance of these known risk factors, along with new risk factors that emerge from the proposed GWAS investigation, will be evaluated for Americans of African ancestry.   The ultimate goal of the Primary Open Angle African-American Glaucoma Genetics Study (POAAGG) is to facilitate the development of rational, targeted screening, diagnosis and eventually novel treatments for AA POAG."
"9298458","ABSTRACT As the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic sweeps through the Americas, the risks to public health are tremendous. Although prospective studies are limited, microcephaly and other major fetal abnormalities may occur in up to 30% of children born to ZIKV-infected mothers. There is a pressing need for new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools to combat this global health threat. We propose that the maternal immune response may provide a window into understanding the pathogenesis of ZIKV during pregnancy. We therefore aim to define the transcriptional signatures of the immune response to ZIKV during pregnancy and to identify signatures predictive of adverse fetal outcomes. Defining these signatures could have a significant impact on the management of pregnant women exposed to ZIKV by serving as a basis for improved diagnostic tests for detecting ZIKV, therapeutic approaches targeting identified pathways, and an improved ability to predict fetal risk."
"9233108","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathologic angiogenesis can cause blindness in numerous diseases of the eye including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy, and promote disease progression in several cancers. Although vascular endothelial cell- derived growth factor (VEGF) is critical to this process, therapies targeting VEGF have been unable to prevent abnormal blood vessel development and may be ineffective in a subset of patients, implicating other factors in the pathophysiology of disease. As such, it is critical t identify novel factors that may play a role early in disease and that are potentially independent of VEGF. We have recently identified the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor signaling pathway as one that promotes choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in AMD. The mechanisms by which this occurs are novel and VEGF-independent. In these studies, we propose to identify the FGF ligands that drive pathogenic ocular neovascularization. Molecules identified by these studies are therapeutically accessible, potentially modifiable and might facilitate the development of targeted therapies to prevent blindness from complications of ocular neovascularization."
"9274773","Project Summary/Abstract We request funds to purchase 120 parallel computer nodes and 10 high-memory, many-core nodes to support computationally- and data-intensive NIH-funded biomedical research at Vanderbilt University. The proposed system will facilitate a wide range of compute-intensive applications and specific data-intensive applications that require high-memory and/or tightly coupled supercomputer performance, at a small fraction of the cost. This system will be built aside our successful 6000-processor parallel computer known as the Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE) at Vanderbilt, which supports high- performance computing for research ranging from elementary particle investigations using the Large Hadron Collider, to model system genetics and human behavioral studies. Despite our successes with the existing cluster, state-of-the-art biomedical computing has been in high demand and recently these data sets have outgrown the capability of our current system. These projects include macromolecular structure prediction, next-generation sequencing, vaccine design, and multi-dimensional imaging.  ACCRE users have access to the instrument and training through our established infrastructure. ACCRE is a grass-roots organization that was initially created by faculty from throughout the institution and later awarded the strong institutional support it enjoys today. It was initially established through a Major Research instrumentation Grant from NIH in 2004 along with Departments of Defense and Energy grants to the School of Engineering and Department of Physics. ACCRE was upgraded through NIH Shared Instrumentation Grants awarded in 2009 and 2012. ACCRE is managed by three co-directors, one each from the College of Arts and Science, School of Engineering, and School of Medicine. Policy and procedures are set by the co-directors upon recommendations of the Faculty Advisory Board, which consists of ten active PI users.  The proposed parallel computer will be used directly by forty NIH-funded research groups and its impact will reach many more investigators through outreach efforts of centralized facilities such as our Center for Structural Biology, Biostatistics Collaboration Center, Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, VANTAGE, Vanderbilt Institute for Imaging Science, and Mass Spectrometry Research Center. In this manner, the requested equipment will support more than 100 NIH grants. The ten major users of the requested system have primary appointments in nine different departments within the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, College of Arts and Science, and School of Engineering. Research programs with unmet demand for high memory and high-core nodes are concentrated in genetics. Together, the 130 requested nodes will replace 200 six-year- old nodes, making it possible to carry out data and computationally intensive biomedical investigations that would otherwise not be feasible."
"9441915","Core B supports every project within the Program by providing access to state-of-the-art RNAi tools. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were developed with the support of this program, and ongoing innovations by Core B and Program investigators have helped to make these extremely powerful biological tools. During the past funding period, the Core devised methods to rapidly engineer mice carrying regulated shRNA expression cassettes, devised strategies for functionally validating shRNAs in a multiplexed fashion, and created a third generation of RNAi libraries corresponding to annotated protein coding genes in humans and mice. During the upcoming period of requested support, the core proposes to aid Program investigators through five general aims. First, the program will continue to provide access to state-of-the-art RNAi tools for analyzing either single gene knockdowns or for performing pooled RNAi screens. Second, the Core will work with investigators to operate the sensor assay to identify optimal shRNAs tools against genes of interest. Third, the core will produce custom RNAi libraries against sets of genes that are of interest to Program investigators. Fourth, the Core will produce mice carrying regulated RNAi cassettes and aid investigators in combining these with other desired genetic lesions. Finally, the Core will carry on its efforts to improve RNAi technologies and make those innovations available to the Program and to the community at large."
"9331967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is a rare genetic disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in GNAS, the gene encoding the ? chain of Gs (G?s), and is associated with short stature, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications, and cognitive deficits. AHO patients with GNAS mutations on maternally inherited alleles manifest resistance to multiple hormones (e.g. PTH, TSH, LH, FSH, GHRH) as well as obesity, a variant termed pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a), due to paternal imprinting of G?s transcripts in specific tissues. AHO patients with GNAS mutations on paternally inherited alleles have the same phenotype but without hormonal resistance and marked obesity, a variant termed pseudopseudo- hypoparathyroidism (PPHP). Although both PHP1a and PPHP have been described as displaying cognitive deficits, we have found that patients with PHP1a lead compromised lives academically and socially, whereas those with PPHP do not. Based on preliminary data in a large cohort of patients with AHO as well as a mouse model, we hypothesize that the neurocognitive and psychosocial impairments observed in AHO are specific to PHP1a and may be secondary to imprinting in the brain. The aims of this study are four-fold and will be examined by forming a new collaboration between Dr. Germain-Lee, who has expertise in AHO (and established the Albright Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute), and Drs. Mahone and Ramos (married name, Scarborough), who have expertise in neurocognitive and psychosocial assessments. First, we plan to examine children and adults with PHP1a systematically for neurocognitive and psychosocial dysfunction. Second, we will compare PHP1a patients with PPHP patients in order to define the differences in these populations which have previously been assumed as similar in terms of these parameters. Third, because the patients being examined in this study have had or will have DNA and transformed lymphocytes banked and mutation analyses performed, we can begin to correlate the neurocognitive and psychosocial phenotypes with genotypes as well as with levels of G?s protein/message levels and G?s activity. Finally, we will correlate these phenotypes/genotypes with hormonal and metabolic parameters, providing a unique opportunity to link cognition and behavior to endocrine function as well as examine potential sexual dimorphisms. The overall goals of this study are to define the neurocognitive and psychosocial phenotypes in PHP1a versus PPHP and to establish the role of imprinting and G protein-coupled signaling, as well as genotype, sex, and endocrine function, in the etiology of the differences that are found. This study may reveal disorders unique to PHP1a and therefore target management more specifically, leading to improvements in the treatment and quality of life of these patients. In addition, the specific cognitive and behavioral phenotypes found in PHP1a are likely to be significant problems in the general population, and their mechanisms may be further elucidated through investigations of the role of imprinting of GNAS and G protein-coupled signaling."
"9308352","Abstract For over half a century, prostate cancer research has focused on the Androgen receptor (AR), its role in the initiation of the disease and progression to the highly metastatic stage, castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While AR antagonists such as enzalutamide or androgen- synthesis inhibitor abiraterone dampen AR functional activity, these are often ineffective long term, as the recalcitrant disease recurs within 2-3 years. CRPCs not only thrive under low or castrate levels of androgen, but also fastidiously maintain functional AR. Consequently, anti- androgen-resistance has become one of the most vexing problems in prostate cancer therapy. Despite intensive efforts, targeting co-factors that regulate AR and its splice variant, AR-V7 transcription, directly and efficaciously, with small molecule inhibitors has not yet been achieved. We uncovered that AR recruits the oncogene ACK1, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, to regulate its own expression- setting up a pathological positive feedback loop in androgen deprived condition. Mechanistically, activated ACK1 modifies chromatin via phosphorylation of the histone H4 at a novel site, tyrosine 88 (pY88-H4), upstream of the AR gene at three sites AREM1-3, to promote transcription. Conversely, reversal of this pY88-H4 histone modification by treatment with a novel ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9bMS, or overexpression of the H4Y88F mutant significantly suppressed transcription of the full length AR as well as AR-V7 splice variant, consequently downregulating expression of AR-target genes, such as PSA. Moreover, we demonstrate that WDR5/MLL2 histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase complex, interact with the pY88-H4 epigenetic marks, deposit the transcriptionally activating H3K4 tri-methyl marks in trans, thus uncovering a novel mode of epigenetic regulation at the AR locus. Based on these extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that inhibition of ACK1 epigenetic regulator activity that suppresses AR transcription and block production of AR splice variants will be critical to combat enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant CRPCs. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1. Assess the functional role of pY88-H4 deposition sites AREM1-3 on AR/AR-V7 transcription in CRPCs. Aim 2. Examine genome wide MLL2/WDR5/ASH2L and pY88-H4 co-association and its role in driving AR/AR-V7 expression and CRPC progression. Aim 3. Detail characterization of ACK1 inhibitor (R)-9bMS to overcome enzalutamide & abiraterone-resistance and ADME/DMPK studies."

Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs) and 10 healthcare systems where patients will be recruited - will determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based, multifactorial, patient-centered intervention to reduce the risk of serious fall injuries among non-institutionalized older persons. The investigators, patient and stakeholders worked together via conference calls and focus groups to prepare the application, and will continue to work together within a structured collaborative frame- work to implement the trial, including its interim and final analyses, and the dissemination of its results Our integrated strategy to reduce serious fall injuries, guided by input from our patient advisors and stakeholders during conference calls and focus groups, includes several patient-centered components: (a) screening to identify persons at high risk for falls, (b) defining a person's specific risk factors, (c) implementing an evidence-based multifactorial, individually-tailored intervention aimed at mitigating specific risk factors, based on the patient-centered approach developed at Yale and incorporating elements of the CDC and American Geriatrics Society Guidelines (d) reducing the risk of injury if the person falls (e.g., osteoporosis treatment); (e) changing organizational and provider behavior to initiate care processes, based on ACOVE-2 practice redesign model. The trial will utilize a cluster randomization strategy for participant allocation, randomizing clinical practices to our multifactorial intervention or standard care. We propose to enroll 6,000 eligible participants at up to 10 trial sites that reflect geographic and sociodemographic diversity. Enrollment will take place over an 18-month period, and we will follow the participants for a maximum of 3 years. The primary outcome is serious fall injuries, defined as those leading to medical attention, including non- vertebral fractures, joint dislocation, head injury, lacerations, and other major sequalae (e.g. rhabdomyolysis, internal injuries, hypothermia). Secondary outcomes, identified by patients and stakeholders, include all injurious falls, all falls regardless of injury, and indicators of well-being - fall efficacy, physcal function and disability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. During Year 1, the investigators, patients and stakeholders will collaboratively refine and pilot a strategy for identifying persons t risk for falling and optimize the study design and intervention. The trial will incorporate an adaptive design and a pre-specified mid-term analysis. In addition, the investigators, patients and stakeholders will together evaluate the post-trial scalability and sustainability of the fall injury prevention strategy."
"9312070","Glucocorticoids (Gcs) are among the most effective and frequently used anti-inflammatory drugs for different chronic inflammatory skin diseases including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Unfortunately, chronic glucocorticoids induce multiple deleterious side effects including skin atrophy. Thus, there is significant unmet need for novel safer glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ? targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. GR is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression via (i) transactivation that requires GR binding as a homodimer to glucocorticoid-responsive elements in gene promoters and (ii) transrepression that is chiefly mediated via negative interaction between GR and other transcription factors including anti-inflammatory factors AP-1 and NF-kB. Transrepression by GR is an important mechanism for anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. In contrast, GR transactivation often mediates steroid adverse effects. The molecular mechanisms of steroid- induced skin atrophy, the major side effect of topical steroids, are poorly understood. We found that glucocorticoids activated the expression of REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage response), a stress-inducible inhibitor of mTOR, in mouse and human skin. REDD1 knockout (KO) animals are partially resistant to glucocorticoid-induced epidermal and subcutaneous adipose atrophy, which correlated with the protection of CD34+ follicular epithelial stem cells as well as p63+ keratinocyte progenitors in REDD1 KO epidermis during chronic steroid treatment. At the same time, the lack of REDD1 did not affect anti- inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids as evaluated by ear edema test. Expression profiling revealed that ~ 70% of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) target genes activated in WT epidermis and related to lipid and protein metabolism were not activated in epidermis of REDD1 KOs, however, the negative effect of glucocorticoids on inflammatory gene expression was very similar in both genotypes. Overall, our findings reveal a novel feed forward pathway in GR activation by its target gene/protein REDD1; and established atrophogenic role of REDD1 in steroid-treated skin. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test our hypothesis that REDD1 inhibitors would significantly reduce skin atrophy caused by topical glucocorticoids. We propose to further explore the role of REDD1 in skin inflammation using chronic murine models of dermatitis; to determine the effect of REDD1 on major steps in GR activation; and to seek for pharmacological inhibitors among FDA- approved and experimental drugs using bioinformatics approach. This highly innovative program will strongly impact our understanding of major catabolic/anabolic pathways in skin and the results could be advantageous for the skin diseases as well as for various visceral inflammatory diseases treated by glucocorticoids as they induce atrophy in numerous tissues including muscle and bone."
"9254037","Project Summary The ability to record electrical activity from individual neurons has transformed our understanding of the nervous system1?3. Yet, it remains challenging to conclusively relate the activity of a neuron to specific features of visual perception. The goal of relating neuronal activity to perception has been hampered, in part, by an inability to measure visual function at a cellular-resolution in humans. Recently, the laboratory of Prof. Austin Roorda has developed techniques to deliver targeted spots of light small enough to stimulate individual cones in humans4,5. The ability to probe individual sensory neurons complements single-cone stimulation studies concerned with unraveling the cone contributions to visual receptive fields in lateral geniculate nucleus6 and in excised retina7 of monkey.  The proposed studies will first characterize the spectral properties of a mosaic of cones using densitometry and adaptive optics. Cone-sized spots of light will then be delivered to individual cones within the classified mosaic in order to relate their spectral properties directly to visual perception in human volunteers. The results of these studies will be used to constrain the development of a population model of retinal circuitry. This work will advance our basic understanding of the neural basis of visual perception and provide valuable information for designing future therapies to rescue function in the diseased retina. Together, these experiments offer an unprecedented opportunity to link cellular physiology, anatomy and visual perception in humans and primates. Briefly, the specific aims are: Specific aim 1. Resolve the contribution and extent of retinal lateral inhibition in color vision. This aim will precisely measure the influence of lateral interactions in the appearance of color and clarify the retinal contribution to these computations. Specific aim 2. Determine how the brain combines information from individual cones. This aim will answer how accurately predictions made from single cone studies will generalize to larger stimuli. Together these two aims will clarify how color and form are represented at the most elementary level in the visual system. The results will limit the possible circuits involved in computing color information and, subsequently, inform models of retinal processing that will be immediately translatable to researcher?s designing therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal visual perception in the damaged retina and to tools aimed at early detection of retinal disease."

"9450705","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this application is to develop novel products for routine point-of-care (POC) genetic testing, ranging from early cancer detection to pathogen identification by using an innovative biotechnology called, Isothermal Chain Reaction (ICR). ICR is a disruptive and enabling technology platform that will offer a new class of reagents relevant to biomedical research and medical healthcare. ICR does not require any enzymes, primers, nucleotides, master mixes, extension reactions, cDNA intermediates, or thermocycling. These benefits overcome constraints of PCR-based technologies by being resistant to enzyme inhibitors found in laboratory samples and clinical specimens, having higher specificity for rare mutations, and lowering reagent costs. ICR is anticipated to enable selective, rapid, and affordable biomarker detection without having to invest in costly instruments and labor-intensive sample preparation procedures. The envisioned products will be assays, panels, and kits for the early detection of genetic and infectious diseases in non-laboratory settings. Specific Aims: 1. Development of ICR probes to ovarian cancer SNP mutations: We will design and develop ICR assays to rapidly and isothermally detect SNPs that are associated with ovarian cancer mutations. ICR assays that can specifically identify a rare one-in-a-million SNP mutation from a mixed population of templates in less than 10 minutes under isothermal conditions, without enzymes, primers, nucleotides, or master mixes will be selected for use in Specific Aim 2. 2. Identification of somatic SNP mutations in ovarian cancer tumors: We will use selected ICR assays from Specific Aim 1 to identify 46 SNP mutations in DNA isolated from retrospective specimens of ovarian cancer patients. We will determine the percentage of ovarian cancers that are detectable by ICR using our biomarker assays. ICR results will be benchmarked and compared to next-generation sequencing to demonstrate the feasibility of using ICR for routine screening and early detection of cancer SNP biomarkers. Impact: Accomplishing the Specific Aims could significantly impact early detection of ovarian cancer when therapeutic interventions are much more effective, and enable routine clinical testing and screening of the disease to improve clinical triage decisions, routine monitoring, and treatment outcomes."
"9230358","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common subtype of kidney cancer, is characterized by mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers. One of these genes, SETD2, encodes the only methyltransferase capable of trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3). In patients, mutation of SETD2 has been associated with decreased overall survival and time to recurrence. Previous work has shown that mutation of SETD2 in human tumors is associated with altered chromatin accessibility and wide-spread RNA processing defects. Common mutations in SETD2 include early frameshift/nonsense mutations, mutations in the catalytic SET domain and mutations in the SRI domain, which mediates the interaction between SETD2 and RNA polymerase. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SETD2 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating chromatin during transcription, and that disruption of this process promotes cancer through both transcriptional processing defects and widespread reorganization of chromatin packaging. Aim 1 will identify the effect of specific SETD2 mutations in the SET and SRI domains on cellular transformation and RNA processing. Cell lines have been engineered for SETD2 inactivation and expression of tumor-associated SETD2 mutants in the SET domain and SRI domain. These cells will be used to study proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and cell migration. These cells will also be examined for altered RNA processing, including aberrant splicing, altered exon utilization, and alternate transcription start/termination sites, using RNA-seq data and published and custom generated computational algorithms. Aim 2 will examine the effect of SETD2 mutation on H3K36me3 placement as well as overall chromatin organization. H3K36me3 localization will be examined by ChIP-seq in cell harboring SRI domain mutants. Cells will be tested for changes in chromatin organization by FAIRE-seq and MNAse-seq. RNA, ChIP, chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning data will then be integrated to explore the role of SETD2 and its effect on chromatin organization. Results from this study will further our understanding of the ability of SETD2 to suppress tumor development by maintaining epigenomic organization and transcriptomic fidelity."
"9212786","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is a prominent cause of African Burkitt's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Lymphomas, malignant Lymphoproliferative Diseases in immune suppressed and HIV infected people, proliferative oral epithelial cell lesions in HIV infected people, as well as Nasophyangeal Cancers and Antral Gastric Cancers. EBV converts Resting B Lymphocytes (RBLs) to continuously proliferating Lymphoblasts (LCLs) by expressing Latency III EBV nuclear antigen proteins and latent membrane protein 1. EBV conversion of RBLs to LCLs is a relevant model that can be genetically manipulated to investigate the time course and EBV gene dependence for RBL conversion to LCLs.  We have shown that most EBNA2 binding sites are more than 2kB from the nearest gene and EBNA2 sites for 50 regulated genes, which are, on average, 330kB from the transcription start site of target genes. Many EBNA2 effects are mediated over long distances that require the intervening DNA to be looped out. Because EBNA2 binds >5000 sites in the LCL genome, the cell genes affected by EBNA2 sites are only partially defined. Furthermore, the proteins that EBNA2 employs to mediate looping have not been precisely identified. However, we have discovered that most of EBNA2 effects on MYC induced cell growth are mediated by long distance looping of EBNA2 enhancers to the MYC promoter. AIMS1 and 2 use innovative techniques and unique reagents established in our laboratory to 1) Identify EBNA2 enhancer interactions with cell promoters and protein looping complexes at promoter junctions. 2) Determine the biologic significance of EBNA2 enhancer/promoter interaction components in LCL proliferation and survival. and 3) Determine the role of EBNALP in enhancer and promoter interactions. In AIM1, Novel genomic approaches will be used to identify enhancer and promoter DNA sites that are brought in proximity by DNA looping (ChIA-PET). ChIP-seq will be used to determine the genomic localization of candidate looping factors and correlate binding with the transcriptional effects induced by EBNA2. In AIM2, the importance of each looping factor will be evaluated by the effect of shRNA knockdown in LCLs on EBNA2 induction of c-myc and LCL growth and survival.  In AIM 3 we will pursue the more recent discovery that EBNA2 is also co-activated genome wide by EBNALP, which binds mostly to promoters, which are marked by the presence of YY1, CTCF, and ZNF143, as well as Histone H2-Az. In AIM3, we will evaluate the effect of EBNALP on looping to identify the molecular mechanisms that underlie EBNALP-mediated co-activation. We propose to use recombinant viruses, inducible shRNA targeting EBNALP or looping factors, a dominant negative EBNALP mutant, and expression of EBNA2 and EBNALP in primary B cells to better delineate the EBNALP effects in MYC, Cyclin D2, and cell survival gene regulation. We will also evaluate the importance of EBNALP interacting proteins in looping, LCL gene transcription, and LCL growth.  These experiments use an integrative genomic approach to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which EBNA2 and EBNALP activate transcription in LCLs. Since EBNA2 and EBNALP mimic the Notch pathway and use the resting B-lymphocyte genome framework for their effects, our findings will also afford insight into the fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation in normal and malignant B-lymphocytes."
"9434664","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  How hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by dual oxidases (DUOXs) contributes to the defense of mucosal surfaces against infection is incomplete, representing a critical gap in knowledge. The long-term goal of this re- search is to elucidate how ROS (reactive oxygen species) contribute to innate immunity in epithelial tissues. The overall objective of this application is to identify how H2O2 produced by DUOXs contributes to immune defense, using C. elegans as a model. The central hypothesis is that the H2O2 produced by BLI-3 (C. elegans DUOX) contributes to immune defense (1) as a signaling molecule that affects the redox state and therefore the activity of a cytoprotective transcription factor, and (2) as a substrate for immune-specific peroxidases. The rationale for the project is that a more complete understanding of how H2O2 production by DUOX enzymes during infection contributes to the immune response will potentially allow for its therapeutic modulation. The central hypothesis will be addressed by the following aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine how thioredoxin TRX-1 regulates the protective transcription factor SKN-1. We will test the working hypothesis that under reducing conditions TRX-1 inactivates the SKN-1 regulator NSY-1, by direct binding. Under oxidizing conditions, such as those that occur during the immune response, oxidation of redox-sensitive cysteines in TRX-1 releases NSY-1. The approaches used to test this hypothesis will include studying appropriate mutants of trx-1 and nsy-1 and in vivo and in vitro approaches to test for a direct interaction between TRX-1 and NSY-1. Specific Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanism(s) by which putative peroxidases contribute to pathogen resistance. We have identified putative peroxidases that contribute to immune defense, and we will test the postulate that they do so by utilizing H2O2 to generate more powerful oxidants. The approaches used to test the hypothesis will include characterization of animals with mutated versions of these genes and purification and enzymatic analysis of the proteins they encode. Specific Aim 3: Determine if BLI-3 directly interacts with the putative peroxidases. Our working hypothesis is that these peroxidases interact directly with BLI-3, the enzyme that produces their substrate. The approaches used to test this hypothesis will include localization of the peroxidases by genetic and cell-biological techniques and in vivo and in vitro approaches to test for a direct interaction with BLI-3. The research proposed is significant because knowledge of how the H2O2 produced by dual oxidases affects biological systems could lead to treatments that modulate its positive and negative effects. For example, pharmacologically increasing the amount of ROS production may lead to protection against infectious diseases, while decreasing ROS may help resolve inflammatory conditions. The proposed research is innovative be- cause it takes advantage of C. elegans unique feature of producing a single DUOX enzyme to understand the roles of DUOX-generated H2O2 during infection in the natural context of the whole organism. Not having to ac- count for the effects of other NADPH oxidases will facilitate the study of DUOX at the organismal level."
"9316943","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that has spread rapidly across the Americas with 35 countries and territories reporting active viral transmission over the past year; this epidemic has prompted the WHO to declare ZIKV a worldwide public health emergency. An effective vaccine for ZIKV would be a cost-effective intervention that limits clinical disease and controls the spread of the infection since there is no antiviral treatment available. The goal of this proposal is to design novel ZIKV vaccine candidates and conduct initial preclinical testing in newly-generated mouse models of infection and disease. In this regard, vector-based vaccine systems offer key advantages including their robust efficiency to elicit humoral and cellular immunity by mimicking infection while producing ZIKV antigens de novo. Adenovirus (Ad) vectors have emerged as one of the most promising vaccine platforms that stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, and have been evaluated extensively in clinical trials in the cancer vaccine and infectious disease fields. The use of simian Ad species isolated from chimpanzee and gorilla offers a unique ability to bypass pre-existing immunity to human Ad. Here, we will test whether gorilla-based Ad (GAd) vectors expressing soluble envelope (E) protein or intact subviral particles (SVPs) can elicit neutralizing humoral and cellular immune responses and protect against ZIKV infection and disease. Furthermore, we hypothesize that targeting GAd vectors specifically to dendritic cells (DCs) will facilitate direct presentation of ZIKV structural antigens and improve vaccination outcome compared to conventional Ad-based vaccine. To test our hypothesis we have developed methods to ablate native Ad tropism via genetic modifications of the viral capsid while allowing recognition of the target cell receptor and the possibility of cell-specific delivery in vivo. We showed the utility of incorporating single domain antibody (sdAb) species into viral particles for Ad targeting to cancer cell types and immature myeloid murine DCs. We propose to use GAd developed by our commercial partner GenVec, Inc., as this vector platform has greater potential for clinical translation. In support of this study, we generated a panel of sdAb candidates that bind to the DC-specific receptor Clec9A that can be exploited to induce robust T- and B-cell immune responses following vaccination. The Diamond laboratory has developed new murine models of ZIKV pathogenesis including a model of maternal-fetal transmission. These models will allow us to assess rapidly the efficacy of our different candidate vaccines. In summary, our collaborative group has the necessary reagents, technology, and expertise to develop and evaluate novel GAd-vectored ZIKV vaccine candidates using relevant animal models. We believe the translation of these results could have a significant impact on reducing ZIKV disease and spread, a beneficial effect on human health."
"9320478","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are among the most lethal cancers because of their extensive invasion into surrounding tissues and metastasis to distant organs, even during early stages of tumor progression. The poor prognosis for this malignancy also reflects a generally poor response to current therapies. Thus, understanding the biology of these tumors and the mechanisms that promote their invasion and metastasis will provide a basis for developing new methods for diagnosis and treatment.  Tumor cells display metabolic alterations that result in enhanced tumor growth or metastasis. Specifically, metabolic reprogramming promotes tumor cell survival under harsh conditions during transit to distant sites and induces proliferation once the tumor cells establish metastatic loci. Aberrant glutamine metabolism is associated with tumor growth in Kras-driven pancreatic cancer. Likewise, our preliminary data demonstrate increased dependence of metastatic lesions on glutamine metabolism. Additionally, we demonstrate that glutamine metabolism regulates responsiveness against gemcitabine by regulating flux through the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. We identify SIRT5 as a key negative regulator of glutamine metabolism that diminishes glutamine uptake and dependence in pancreatic cancer cells. SIRT5 diminishes tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic models. We also observe that SIRT5 negatively regulates the expression of Elk-3, which promotes glutamine metabolism, pancreatic cancer cell survival, and invasiveness. Of particular significance to the proposal, ELK3 is significantly overexpressed by advanced primary and metastatic pancreatic tumor lesions, and hence ELK3- induced metabolic reprogramming is expected to be a target for suppressing pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis.  Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular basis of SIRT5/ELK3-mediated metabolic alterations that facilitate progression and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Here, we hypothesize that SIRT5/ELK3- mediated regulation of glutamine metabolism contributes to tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance in PDAC. Furthermore, we hypothesize that targeting glutamine metabolism can provide a therapeutic strategy to combat tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance in PDAC. Here, we propose to characterize the metabolic phenotype in SIRT5-deficient pancreatic tumor models (Aim 1) and investigate if Elk3-mediated transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming contributes to SIRT5-mediated metabolic phenotype (Aim 2). Furthermore, we propose to elucidate the role of ELK3 in regulating tumor progression, metastasis, and gemcitabine resistance in PDAC (Aim 3). These studies will elucidate the metabolic aspects of SIRT5/ELK3-mediated tumor progression and metastasis and are strongly expected to uncover additional therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
"9274596","This is a multiuser equipment grant application for a Siemens Prisma Fit upgrade to the existing Magnetom 3T TIM Trio MR scanner in the MRISC at the University of Kentucky. Funding to support this upgrade is being requested because of the significant advantages of the Prisma system for biomedical research particularly for a group of productive, NIH-funded investigators involved in neuroscience research. The Prisma system will be integral to maintaining and expanding the research program of this group of investigators.  Among the many advantages of the new instrument the most significant include the improved magnetic field gradient system, (higher amplitude and improved duty cycle) which will enable studies of white matter structure in a detail which is unavailable on the current Trio system. The upgrade will include an improved radiofrequency (RF) system which includes a doubling of the number of RF receive channels. The resulting higher signal-to-noise and higher resolution images will enable newer insights into brain degeneration and remodeling. The parallel transmit system on the Prisma will improve the homogeneity of excitation and enable 2D selective excitation for reduced FOV imaging. A state-of-the-art computer system and programming environment also included in the upgrade will facilitate enhanced collaboration with other biomedical researchers and a path to regular system modernization. The PI and multiple co-PIs, which form the Major Users Group on this application, have funded programs ranging from fundamental studies in neuroscience to clinical neuroscience research programs. Their research will significantly benefit from this advanced instrumentation which is not available at the University or elsewhere in the State. Through the University?s Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Center which also manages a small animal, high field MR imager, the infrastructure (including space, financial management, routine maintenance, technical support and personnel) exists to rapidly bring the new scanner on line when funding becomes available and to continue to develop its capabilities to aid biomedical research."

In addition to these programs which annually support 160 predoctoral and 208 postdoctoral fellows, 20% of whom are under-represented minorities, we will recruit international trainees from 8 D43 training grants across all four campuses, affiliated schools and international partner institutions. For each trainee, 4 principal components include: i) an 11-month, hands-on research project on-site with one of our international collaborative partners; ii) a strong, interdisciplinary mentored research experience; iii) instruction in global health and related topics provided through on-site, and on-line courses; and iv) career development to help ensure that trainees attain their short-term career goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career stage. These four components are closely interlinked; a Leadership Group and campus Steering Committees will ensure they form a seamless, integrated program. Innovative aspects include a unified consortium that offers synergy by capitalizing upon the UCGHI's ten campuses, Centers of Expertise and faculty that regularly interact and collaborate; faculty mentors offering training across diverse disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, public health, veterinary science, oceanography, agriculture, and biological and social sciences); training experiences on a wide range of diseases and problems of global health significance; an ability to leverage common resources across the four participating UC campuses (e.g., UCGHI, CTSAs, CFARs and Research eXchange consortia); and an innovative mentoring initiative."
"9328468","Project Summary/Abstract  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 68 children and is characterized by lifelong impairment in social interactions. Autism affects multiple brain structures including the prefrontal cortex, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Recent gene sequencing studies have identi?ed hundreds of mutations associated with the disease. Since each mutation is individually rare, studying a single mutation does not provide broad insight into common disease mechanisms. The study of many genes in parallel could provide generalized insight, but such efforts are limited to resource intensive settings such as large-scale consortia. Therefore, experimental approaches that allow a single investigator to study the functional impact for many autism mutations simultaneously would greatly expedite discovery.  Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an ideal system for parallel studies of gene function: 1) hPSCs are amenable to facile genome editing technologies, allowing rapid construction of many genetic disease lines; 2) hPSCs can differentiate into any cell-type of the body, offering unprecedented access to disease-tissue; 3) individual hPSC lines can in theory be pooled into a single assay, supporting increased throughput of genetic analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a multiplex hPSC platform where multiple disease lines are pooled into a single differentiation and analysis assay. The utility of this approach will be validated by testing a set of autism mutations for shared molecular and developmental phenotypes. Successful completion of this study will provide novel insights into underlying mechanisms of autism. Importantly, it will establish a scalable, ?exible hPSC platform that to could be applied to decode the functional architecture of all autism mutations. This proposal effectively supports the development of an aspiring physician-scientist in using human stem cells to study brain development and complex disease."
"9209224","PROJECT 3: MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND VISION AGING - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Progressive decline of visual function with age increases the susceptibility to social isolation and falls. It also leads to inactivity, which contributes to skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. The physiology of age-related visual impairment is not well understood, and there is no effective treatment. We have found that spatial visual function in C57BL/6 mice declines ~60% between 24 and 34 months, independent of optical changes in the eye, which is accompanied by mitochondrial abnormalities in photoreceptors, and disc pathology in outer segments. We have also found that feeding a high fat diet (HFD) to young mice leads to a more rapid decline of visual function, which was accompanied by mitochondrial abnormalities in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroidal vasculature. We hypothesized that impaired retinal mitochondrial energetics was the cause of age- and HFD-related visual decline. In support of this, we have found that the topical administration of the mito-protective peptide (SS-31) to the eye was able to reverse both age- and HFD-induced visual decline and its associated retinal pathology. Based on these and more recent preliminary results we now hypothesize that (1) age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in photoreceptors leads to visual decline; (2) HFD damages the choroidal vasculature resulting in ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the RPE; (3) Dietary excess will exacerbate age-related visual decline; (4) SS-31, by restoring mitochondrial structure and promoting bioenergetics in both photoreceptors and RPE, will ameliorate and even reverse visual decline caused by age and dietary excess; and (5) SS-31 exerts its anti-aging effects by promoting mitochondrial bioenergetics rather than simply scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will test these hypotheses in three aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms by which SS peptides reverse age- induced visual decline; 2) Determine the mechanisms of any interaction between age and HFD on visual decline, and whether treatment with SS-31 can reverse it; and 3) Establish the visual healthspan and aging benefits of SS-31 as a shared PO1 aim. Experiments will determine the degree to which oxidative stress, and bioenergetics failure, contribute to age- and HFD-related visual decline. They will also will evaluate a) cellular and mitochondrial structural changes in photoreceptors and RPE; b) changes in choroidal blood flow; c) mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in retina slices; c) oxidative changes to cytochrome c and electron transfer characteristics (with Core D); d) protein biomarkers for retinal blood flow, bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and inflammation; e) proteomic analyses of retinas (with Core C); and f) metabolomics for measuring redox state of retinas (with Core E). Finally, as part of a shared P01 aim to establish the translational benefits of SS-31, we will determine visual performance longitudinally over the mouse lifespan after SS-31 is continuously delivered from middle age to mice fed standard and high fat diets."
"9253314","Project Summary: Postpartum depression (PPD) constitutes a general health problem occurring in 10-16% of recently delivered mothers. The impact of PPD is profound with considerable emotional pain for the mother as well as disturbances in infant development and later child adjustment. Although the prevention of this disorder has garnered much attention, few preventative interventions have demonstrated efficacy, replicated findings, used validated diagnostic measures for PPD, or used heterogeneous samples of women. The ROSE Program (Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of newborns), an intervention that has been found in three clinical trials to significantly reduce cases of PDD in at risk pregnant women on public assistance, targets those factors that play a significant role in the development of PPD (i.e., poor social support, role transition, and life stressors) and is administered during weeks 20 - 35 of pregnancy and within 2-weeks postpartum. The aims of the phase 1 of this SBIR proposed project is to develop a high-reach, easily implementable, low-cost, prototype of the ROSE Program and test its acceptability and feasibility among pregnant women at risk for PPD. More specifically, the team will develop a functional prototype of a ROSE Program session, improve the clarity, content, acceptability, and feasibility of the ROSE session using information gathered from a preliminary group of pregnant women and antenatal healthcare providers, and assess the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the ROSE Program prototype for pregnant women at risk for PPD through pilot testing with our target population. Thus, phase I development will be accomplished by an iterative process of feedback and refinement through collaboration with Debra Fox, President and CEO of Fox Learning Systems, Inc., Dr. Zlotnick at Women and Infants Hospital (WIH), and Dr. Sarah Noble at Paley OB/GYN Clinic of the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network. Fox Learning Systems brings expertise in the development of multimedia health education tools across a range of technology platforms. Dr. Zlotnick at WIH developed the ROSE Program and tested the in-person version of ROSE in randomized control trials with pregnant women on public assistance at risk for PPD, with rural African-American pregnant women, and with pregnant teens. Dr. Noble will provide supervisory and clinical support at the research site in Philadelphia. Phase 1 will lay the foundation for the Phase II development and testing of a Web-based version of ROSE Program that will provide individualized and interactive feedback, retain the core features of the ROSE Program, and represent a low threshold, low-cost service with a high reach. This Web-based intervention to reduce the risk of PPD that is grounded in an empirically supported intervention would improve on products currently available in the marketplace. It will be accessible on kiosks in OB offices, on home devices, and smart phones.

During the current period of funding we were successful in providing molecular and even atomic level of analysis of alcohol sites on pentameric ligand-gated (pLGIC) ion channels, including the first crystallographic structure of alcohols bound within a channel protein. We also succeeded in constructing mutant mice with GABAa receptor subunits which are resistant to alcohol modulation allowing us to link specific GABAa receptors with discrete behavioral actions of alcohol. We are in the middle of the fourth year of this project period and t date have 30 publications with 7 more submitted or in preparation. Although we and others have made considerable progress, the molecular sites of alcohol action in the brain are not completely defined. Emerging evidence from human and rodent genetics, as well as recombinant receptors, indicates that several targets which have received only limited attention may be important sites of alcohol action in brain. We propose to define the role of two groups of ligand-gated ion channels, the glycine-activated chloride channels (GlyR) and GABAaRs formed from ? subunits (? GABAaRs) in actions of alcohol at the molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral levels. A strength of this proposal is the combined use of knock-out (KO) and knock-in (KI) mice allowing us to define the importance of the presence of a subunit (KO) and the importance of direct alcohol action on the protein (KI) for behavioral actions of alcohol. An innovative aspect is use of a new technology (transcription activator- like effector nuclease; TALEN) to be employed by our collaborator, Dr. Gregg Homanics, that markedly reduces the time and cost required for construction of mutant mice. In addition to our behavioral studies, mutant mice will be used by our collaborator, Dr. Neil Harrison for electrophysiological studies of glycinergic function in accumbal regions. Several GlyRs and ? GABAaRs are genetically linked with human alcohol dependence and understanding their role in alcohol actions may provide new targets for pharmacotherapies of alcohol abuse and alcoholism."
"9413612","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder and affects 2.3 million Americans, accounting for frequent health care utilization, increased hospitalizations and increased risks of stroke, heart failure and mortality.  Evidence suggests that ectopic beats from the pulmonary veins may trigger AF, a finding that has led to development of the non-pharmacological therapy called pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, which uses radiofrequency energy to cauterize the atrial tissue in the PV's atrium in order to terminate AF and restore sinus rhythm. Unfortunately, this therapy remains suboptimal, with long-term success rates of only 40% to 60%. The main reason for such unsuccessful outcomes is that it fails to eliminate AF drivers outside the pulmonary veins (PVs), and their targeted elimination is key to improving outcomes after AF ablation. Sustained rotor-like activities (RotAs) outside PVs have been shown to be relevant to the sustaining mechanism and perpetuation of AF and should be targeted for AF ablation. However, there is no well-defined algorithm for localization of RotAs using a conventional Multi-Polar Diagnostic Catheter (MPDC). Thus, the development of such an algorithm will play a significant role in the successful detection and ablation of AF drivers outside the PVs and in increasing the success of AF termination procedures. Our objective in this project is to dramatically improve detection of RotAs by combining MPDC with a mathematical, model-based catheter-guidance algorithm to locate RotAs. Based on our preliminary observations of RotAs in human AF, it is expected that using a catheter-guidance algorithm, as will be developed in the proposed study, will significantly increase successful localization of RotAs. Our research will proceed according to the following specific aims: (1) Develop a library of simulated AF datasets with RotAs and (2) Design a catheter-guidance algorithm to direct an MPDC towards RotAs. We will develop a novel catheter-guidance algorithm and validate its performance through simulation of clinically-oriented variations such as noise, poor contact, and cardiac motion, as well as complex models of cardiac cellular electrophysiology, atrial geometry remodeling, and fibrosis. Clinically, the proposed interdisciplinary collaboration should develop a novel, low-risk and low-cost algorithm add-on allowing improved and patient-specific localization of AF perpetuation sites, which cannot currently be achieved. This would significantly improve the success of AF ablation at first attempt and facilitate treating patients before progression of AF to the permanent stage. It would also significantly reduce the unnecessary ablation sites that destroy healthy endocardium and may result in future complications for patients, and thus enhance the health of millions of patients afflicted by this debilitating rhythm disorder so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives."
"9405315","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a common neurological disorder affecting neonates and infants, characterized by increased head size, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation, and CNS disability. Neurosurgical removal of CSF offers palliative treatment, yet affected individuals still suffer from neurological sequelae and a need for continual CSF removal and shunt revisions. No truly disease-modifying therapies are currently available. Our proposal explores a new mechanism in the etiology of PHH, particularly occurring during prenatal or premature life, through the actions of lysophospholipids (LPs). These small, membrane- derived lipids include the glycerophospholipid known as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that can be present at high levels in blood or hemorrhagic fluids. LPA activates a family of LPA receptors, and preliminary data demonstrate the involvement of at least one receptor, LPA1, in mediating the actions of hemorrhagic fluids and LPA in promoting PHH in an animal model. This model also recapitulates comorbid changes within the brain that have been associated with prenatal PHH in humans. Three specific aims will be pursued over a 5-year period to test the hypothesis that the initiation and progression of PHH involves LPA signaling that further provides a foundation for developing new, therapeutic approaches. Aim 1. Assess effects of prenatal LPA exposure on neuroanatomical changes associated with PHH. Aim 2. Assess intracranial fluid composition and compartments in the PHH mouse model. Aim 3. Determine LPA-dependent PHH developmental timing and assess therapeutic tractability."
"9251866","Project Summary  Molecular simulations have played important roles in biochemical and biophysical sciences. Advances have been made that have allowed extensive simulations of increasingly complex systems with growing time and size scales. The Amber force field consortium is a team of investigators with highly complementary expertise in areas ranging from QM calculations, polarizable and fixed charged force fields, and solvent models, to force field validation. This synergy has helped to unify and enable Amber force field development. The long-term goals of this consortium are to develop force fields that can reproduce biological structure, dynamics and interactions without sacrificing the computational efficiency necessary to reach biologically relevant timescales. With the release of Amber polarizable force field ff12pol, the consortium has made significant inroads towards accurately representing the energetic surfaces of proteins and nucleic acids. Furthering these advances, the Amber force field consortium proposes to develop parameters and simulation methodologies that are part of the foundation of molecular simulation platform to push the  Amber  force field efforts to the next level.  A key focus of this consortium is to not only develop general, reliable and widely applicable force fields for proteins, nucleic acids and drug-like molecules, but to validate the force fields via thorough testing and comparison to other available methods and force fields. At present, the choices to make in terms of the model (polarization, charge model, solvent representation) are still active research questions. This proposal is broad-reaching in that multiple approaches will be investigated. A key objective of the consortium is to further enhance the close collaboration that allows ideas to be tested and investigated much more quickly.  The proposed work is broadly categorized in the following areas. 1) Development of a polarizable general Amber force field model will allow more accurate representation of diverse sets of drug-like molecules interacting with biomolecules represented by the polarizable force fields; 2) Development of continuum solvent models with explicit consideration of atomic polarization will extend the range of applicability of polarizable force field and enable efficient and accurate free energy calculations; 3) The simulation methodology and the associated parameters will be rigorously scrutinized and critically assessed through direct comparisons with experiments on an extensive set of model systems."
"9296799","ABSTRACT For more than 20 years, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adolescents first contacted in 1994-95 who have now been followed into their fourth decade of life, has released all of its data to the scientific community. At present, Add Health has more than 30,000 users around the world across a range of scientific disciplines. Four waves of interviews have been conducted and a fifth wave is currently in the field. The comprehensive multilevel data includes survey responses, biological and genomic data, and social contextual data on friendship networks, romantic relationships, families, schools, neighborhoods, and the political, cultural, and built environment. Despite the widespread release and availability of Add Health data, updated documentation and metadata standards have not been applied to the rich longitudinal multilevel data. This application outlines a plan to substantially upgrade and expand the archiving, documentation, and dissemination of Add Health data. The intent is to make Add Health data even more easily accessible, straightforward to use, and clearly documented, while increasing awareness and facilitating expanded use of this national scientific resource. This project aims to: (1) enhance the archived Add Health data by applying the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) international standard and harmonizing variables across the waves, thereby augmenting the information researchers can explore within the extensive collection of Add Health data; (2) generate searchable Add Health metadata in a human readable and machine-actionable format that will expand data discovery for the research community by providing researchers with robust web-based tools that facilitate the exploration of research questions that can be addressed with the Add Health data, generate customized codebooks that are unique to their research interests, and facilitate receipt of Add Health's public-use and restricted-use data; and (3) increase dissemination of Add Health data to the research community by depositing all waves of the Add Health public-use data in the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub, linking the metadata tool (described in Aim 2) to all repositories where Add Health's public-use data are deposited while integrating the new tools into the Carolina Population Center's Data Portal, and promoting researchers' awareness of the Add Health data and the data discovery tools. Add Health will be one of the first studies to apply DDI standards and provide metadata for multilevel social, behavioral, biological, genomic, and environmental data, contributing new innovations to the science behind DDI structure and methodology. Accomplishing the aims of this project will significantly expand the Add Health user base and multiply the scientific impact that Add Health has on social and biomedical research."
"9233183","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 2100 heart transplants are performed per year in the United States alone, and for patients receiving a heart transplant, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of death. There is currently no non-invasive means to detect CAV at is earliest, most treatable stage. CAV is a unique disease that is characterized by diffuse concentric stenosis first of the microvasculature and then the coronary arteries that can lead to ischemia and small stellate infarcts. Because heart transplant patients lack innervation of the heart, they do not experience the chest pain usually associated with infarct allowing CAV to progress un- noticed. For this reason, screening diagnostic measures are particularly important in heart transplant patients. Currently, CAV is detected in its advanced stages with Xray-angiography or Intravasular Ultrasound (IVUS), but these are invasive procedures, and because they assess the coronary arteries instead of the microvasculature, CAV can often go undetected. We propose the development of two new MRI tools to assess changes in myocardial function that reflect early onset CAV: quantitative perfusion and quantitative blood volume. In the proposed work, we will develop these new sequences in healthy volunteers, validate them, and then apply them to the intended population of transplant recipients."
"9440579","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To become an independent and interdisciplinary computational neuroscientist, I have outlined a training plan in this proposal to: (a) develop broader knowledge of psychiatric and developmental disorders; (b) enhance theoretical and applied skills in advanced computational methods (including topological data analysis and graph theoretical modeling); and (c) refine skills in novel neuroimaging methods. I propose to develop and apply a novel computational framework to better understand the dynamical organization of intrinsic brain activity (IBA) in healthy participants and individuals with fragile x syndrome (FXS. To study the spatiotemporally rich phenomenon of IBA, resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data is typically analyzed by estimating statistical interdependence between time-varying signals from distinct brain regions over an entire scan period. By collapsing metrics over time, the resulting characterization only embodies an average snapshot across the complex phenomenon of IBA. Accordingly, there is a growing momentum towards quantifying the fluctuations in IBA. Several methods have been proposed, but they invariably average the data in either space (using seed- or network-based approaches) or time (using sliding- windows), thereby avoiding the examination of IBA in its entirety. I believ that comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of IBA holds the key to finding person- and disorder-centric biomarkers. To this end, I first propose to develop methods that can examine dynamics of rs-fMRI data while preserving space and time information. Our preliminary results are promising, suggesting that using topological data analysis, developed at Stanford, we can mine high-dimensions of rs-fMRI data while addressing the crucial issues of low SNR, statistical confidence, validity, and reliability of the proposed methods. Second, I propose to use graph theory and state- space modeling to mathematically analyze and quantify the state/network transitions in IBA. Such modeling will not only improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dynamical brain organization in healthy and FXS groups, but will also allow us to generate concrete and testable hypotheses for future research. For Aims 1 and 2, already collected rs-fMRI data in healthy and FXS groups will be used. We will also inspect the association of proposed metrics with behavioral and neuropsychological assessments to potentially identify novel disorder-centric biomarkers. Further, given the immense demand for resting-state biomarkers in pediatric and clinical populations for early detection of disorders, I propose to explore neuroimaging modalities that are both naturalistic and clinically relevant (esp., near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)). To extend the translational outcomes of my work, I also propose to port the methods developed for rs-fMRI (in Aims 1 and 2) to rs-NIRS platform and rigorously test the feasibility of rs-NIRS as an ancillary method of examining IBA in healthy adults and children. Altogether, I intend to reveal the dynamical structure of IBA in its entirety, thereby facilitating the discovery of person- and disorder-centric biomarkers in healthy participants and individuals with FXS."

"9209222","PROJECT 1: MITOCHONDRIAL ROS AND CARDIAC AGING ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aging is accompanied by slowly progressive and irreversible structural changes and functional declines in the heart that include increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, decline in diastolic function, and a decline in exercise capacity that contributes to frailty in the elderly. Extending work begun with mitochondrial targeted catalase, mCAT, we have recently demonstrated that short term (8 week) treatment with the mitochondrial protective drug SS-31 ?rejuvenates? cardiac function in old mice, reducing hypertrophy, improving diastolic function and remodeling the cardiac structure and proteome to a more youthful state. We hypothesize that SS-31 enhanced mitochondrial energetics and redox signaling subsequently result in remodeling of the cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix to a more youthful state. This proposal will define the mechanisms that mediate both acute mitochondrial (Aim 1) and subacute cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix (Aim 2) rejuvenating effects. As this approach offers the promise of substantial improvement in cardiac health of older humans, Aim 3 will help establish the potential longer-term benefits of these changes to murine healthspan and lifespan. Specifically, in Aim 1 In order to test the hypothesis that treatment with SS-31 restores redox and energy dependent signaling that results in improved mitochondrial structure and function we will measure mitochondrial and cardiac function, comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of mCAT, SS- 20 and SS-31 effects and their ability reverse cardiac aging in old mice and to protect mice challenged with doxorubicin to disrupt electron transport chain function. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms by which SS-31 treatment of old mice rejuvenates cardiomyocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) to improve aging diastolic function and cardiac performance. Aim 3 is shared across the entire P01, and will establish the translational benefits of SS-31 by determining whether SS31 can attenuate the decline of murine healthspan and extend lifespan after SS-31 is continuously delivered to mice beginning at middle age on regular and high fat diets. In this aim Project 1 will focus on cardiac healthspan."
"9309484","ABSTRACT T cell receptor (TCR) dictates T cell fate decision during development, steady state/homeostasis, and antigenic stimulation in periphery. Recent expansion of deep sequencing technologies has uncovered a previously underappreciated TCR diversity within antigen specific T cell responses. TCR diversity suggests a potential for functionally diverse T cell response where TCR parameters command T cell fate decisions: T helper lineage development, T cell activation, or T cell development into a regulatory T cell lineage. In order to understand the implications of this diversity observed in TCR repertoire studies, we need to combine such approaches with functional analysis of TCRs. We are proposing to utilize a combination of technologically advanced approaches to dissect TCR parameters that control Foxp3+ T cell development and function in autoimmunity. Development of type 1 diabetes is driven primarily by self-reactive T cells, which specifically recognize and target insulin producing beta cells for destruction. We have previously published that beta cell reactive TCRs vary in their ability to induce accumulation of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the pancreatic islets of mice. Multiple studies suggest that the strength of the TCR signal leading to Treg selection, expansion, and survival is unique and distinct from T effector T cells. However, functional implications of a unique Treg TCR repertoire, such as antigenic specificity, Treg accumulation, function, and stability of their regulatory phenotype in autoimmune diabetes are largely unknown. We hypothesize that distinct TCR repertoire of islet infiltrating Tregs has intrinsic functional differences. The proposed study will systematically characterize TCR repertoire, function, and signaling characteristic of islet infiltrating Treg TCRs. We will use TCR retrogenic approach in combination with cutting edge genetic mouse models to test the function of insulin reactive Treg TCRs in single TCR and competitive environments in the presence or absence of insulin epitope. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to uncover functional implications of Treg specific TCR parameters in autoimmunity. Insights gained from this study may lead to a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanisms behind Treg function and failure in autoimmunity, and reveal potential avenues to improve development or homeostasis of Tregs with relevant antigenic specificities."
"9249121","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Botulinum neurotoxins are a family of seven bacterial toxins (BoNT/A-G) that cause the disease botulism in humans and animals. They target neurons and cleave host proteins required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, thereby blocking synaptic transmission and paralyzing the hosts. This mode of action and its role in pathogenesis has been well established. Humans used to get exposed to BoNTs mainly via food poisoning, but significant changes have occurred in human- BoNT interactions. First, medical advances can now revive previously untreatable patients from acute BoNT actions. Second, BoNTs are utilized as therapeutics to target neurons via local injections over long periods of time. These changes have raised the critical need to examine the additional long-term consequences of exposure to BoNTs. Indeed, previous reports and our preliminary studies have revealed that a subset of BoNTs may induce degeneration of cultured rodent neurons in addition to blocking synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In Aim 1, we will examine whether BoNTs may induce degeneration of human neurons and in in vivo rodent models that mimic therapeutic applications. We will also investigate whether human genetic variations might render certain populations susceptible to potential cytotoxicity from the major therapeutic toxin BoNT/A. In Aim 2, we will examine our hypothesis that BoNTs induce neurodegeneration because their substrates play an essential role in maintaining the membrane balance at plasma membranes. Aim 1 will provide a solid foundation for establishing the potential clinical relevance. Aim 2 will provide a mechanistic understanding for BoNT cytotoxicity. Together, these studies will establish neuronal cytotoxicity as a newly emerged long-term consequence due to changes in BoNT-human interactions, with significant implications for understanding long-term effects of botulism in patients and for ensuring the safety of using BoNTs as therapeutic toxins."

"9348687","Project Summary  The HIV crisis in Bangkok men who have sex with men (MSM) is volatile with 31% HIV-infected and HIV incidence unbridled and ranging from 8.8% to 12.2% annually in young MSM (YMSM) aged 15-24 years. Consequently, HIV incidence in Bangkok YMSM is Asia?s highest, and in the absence of effective primary and secondary HIV prevention, will continue to increase. Scaling up ART has become the highest priority in responding to this crisis in Thailand. However, data are not available on the HIV care continuum, thus severely limiting critical information needed to design evidence-based secondary prevention interventions for linkage, retention and reengagement in HIV care. In accordance with the R21 funding mechanism, this exploratory study seeks to use the adapted socio-ecological framework to 1) conduct formative research with +YMSM, HIV clinicians and CBO leaders to investigatethe multi-level factors related to the HIV care continuum in Bangkok +YMSM; and 2) quantify the HIV care continuum in +YMSM, and examine the associated facilitators and barriers through a 9-month longitudinal, virtual cohort. A sub aim is to assess the feasibility of an online +YMSM cohort for future online intervention trials. Data from this proposed study by a new investigator will identify which secondary prevention strategies must be scaled in order to meet UNAIDS? 90-90-90 goals. Findings from this study will not only fill critical gaps in the HIV care continuum literature, it will identify subgroups of +YMSM who are most left out from the health system and to whom targeted secondary prevention interventions should be developed."
"9270056","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood adversity accounts for 50-75% of the population attributable risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide. Recent work has also documented enduring effects of childhood maltreatment on adult neurobiology, including alterations in cortical and limbic structures and reprogramming of HPA-axis mediated stress responses. Notably missing, however, is an understanding of how the potential neurobiological sequelae of chronic childhood adversity shape the vital adult activity of caring for an infant, and how this in turn affects early brain development. The proposed program of research seeks, for the first time, to link processes across neurobiological, neuroendocrine, and behavioral levels to examine how the impact of early adversity is conveyed from mother to child, among 150 mothers and their infants. To accomplish these aims the program is led by multiple principal investigators with specific expertise in: (1) mother-infant communication; (2) neurobiological effects of childhood abuse and (3) neonatal neuroimaging. The first aim of the study is to assess whether adversity- related alterations in structure, function or connectivity of maternal brain regions critical to stress regulation, including the amygdala, hippocampus/subiculum, and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC), are associated with differences in maternal stress response during an in-scanner psychosocial stress challenge. The second aim is to assess whether childhood adversity is associated with differences in mother's interactions with their infants at 4 and 12 months of age. Finally, we will assess longitudinally the degree to which maternal disrupted communication leads to impairments in infant stress regulation, amygdala hypertrophy and altered functional connectivity at one year of age. A substudy will also evaluate the contribution of prenatal factors including acute and chronic stress hormone measures, maternal psychiatric symptomatology and partner conflict. Childhood adversity and disrupted parenting are the root preventable causes for a host of medical and psychiatric disorders including addiction that result in billions of dollars in health care expenditures. A detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms, critical time points, and mediating factors is necessary to design targeted interventions to preempt the adverse consequences of early adversity. The proposed program of research will provide data on potential early biomarkers for infant risk that are much more specific than broad maternal psychosocial factors and could lead to earlier and more effective identification of, and intervention in, risk-related developmental trajectories."
"9295781","The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), produced by midbrain DA neurons, influences a spectrum of behaviors including motor, reward, motivation, and cognition. In accordance with these functions, DA dysfunction is prominently implicated in a wide gamut of disorders affecting tens of millions of people, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, addiction and depression. Understanding how DA neurons control all of these distinct behaviors is important for understanding and treating these neuropsychiatric diseases.  The literature is dominated by anatomical classification of DA neurons based on location within the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) or Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). Guided by an emerging literature on DA neuron heterogeneity, we hypothesize that there must exist several molecularly and functionally distinct DA types, perhaps intermingled, that could underpin the myriad functions of DA. As a first step in classifying DA neurons, the Awatramani lab developed an approach to profile single midbrain DA neurons, each for the expression of 96 key genes, using a microfluidic dynamic RT-qPCR array. Hierarchical clustering indicated that DA neurons exhibited roughly six distinct molecular barcodes, presumably indicative of at least six molecularly and functionally distinct DA subtypes.  The Dombeck laboratory has developed a robust data set demonstrating functional heterogeneity of DA neurons in behaving mice. Previous models postulated that slow variations in tonic firing rates bias the system toward or away from movement, whereas phasic signaling was linked to unpredicted rewards. Using imaging in behaving mice, we showed heterogeneous expression of phasic locomotion and reward signaling in DA axons projecting to the striatum. In the dorsal striatum we found that most DA fibers displayed a phasic signal locked to the animal's cyclic accelerations during locomotion. In the ventral striatum, axonal signaling to unpredicted rewards was more prevalent. These results indicate that striatum DA release is not simply homogenous and movement permissive, but is richly heterogeneous with respect to reward and locomotion signaling.  Based on these complementary data sets- molecular heterogeneity and functional heterogeneity, our goal is to correlate molecular identity with anatomy and function. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the diversity, transcriptomes, and projections of DA neuron subtypes, developing intersectional genetic tools to access DA neuron subtypes. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish the behavioral signaling properties of the genetically identified DA subtypes that project to the striatum. Thus, using a collaborative approach between two laboratories each with distinct expertise, we aim to characterize DA neuron subtypes based on their molecular, anatomic and functional properties. These studies will be vital for designing targeted therapies for the DA system. Moreover these studies will provide genetic platforms for manipulations of DA subtypes towards understanding their role in mammalian behavior."
"9415157","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This NIH mentored Career Development Award proposal describes continuation of a five year training program for the candidate, a physician scientist with the long-term goal of becoming an independent academic investigator with a research focus on epithelial ion transport related to kidney physiology and diseases. The candidate proposes to build on a background in basic research developed during undergraduate, Ph.D., and fellowship studies, and in particular previous experience studying Drosophila melanogaster, by developing new scientific skills in physiology and biochemistry. These will be applied to the immediate goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulation of SLC12 cation-chloride cotransporters by the WNK and SPAK/OSR1 kinases, which play essential roles in epithelial ion transport in the kidney. The candidate will develop these skills with the support of a primary mentor with extensive experience in fields related to the candidate?s proposed field of study. The candidate and her advisor are located at the University of Utah School of Medicine, a leading academic medical center with the substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. In addition to the intensive immersion in research in the laboratory, the candidate will take advantage of the numerous research and career development seminars and courses available at University of Utah to further develop her career. Project Description: Epithelial ion transport underlies essential kidney functions, such as the regulation of extracellular volume and blood pressure and acid-base regulation. The SLC12 family of cation-chloride cotransporters, which includes sodium-chloride, sodium-potassium-two-chloride, and potassium-chloride cotransporters (NCC, NKCC, and KCC), plays a key role in renal epithelial ion transport. Loss-of-function mutations in human NCC and NKCC2 result in hypotension due to renal sodium wasting, and these transporters are the targets of thiazide and loop diuretics, respectively. Knockout of the KCC4 gene in mice results in distal renal tubular acidosis. Regulation of these cotransporters remains incompletely understood, but recent evidence suggests that the WNK and SPAK/OSR1 kinases are involved. Human WNK gain-of-function mutations lead to hypertension and hyperkalemia, and loss-of-function mutations in WNK and SPAK lead to renal salt wasting and hypotension in the mouse. Data from in vitro, cell culture, and Xenopus oocyte models suggest that WNKs phosphorylate and activate SPAK and OSR1, which then phosphorylate and activate NCC and NKCCs, and oocyte data also suggest regulation of KCCs by WNKs. However, many open questions remain. The immediate goal of this project is to use the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster to better understand the molecular mechanisms of SLC12 regulation by WNKs and SPAK/OSR1. The sophisticated genetics of the fly, its rapid life cycle, and the well-characterized physiology of its renal tubule allows for efficient, yet detailed, study of the molecular mechanisms of epithelial ion transport in vivo. Moreover, the predominant single gene representation of most mammalian gene families decreases combinatorial complexity and gene compensation as encountered in mammalian models. Preliminary and published data suggest a role for SLC12 cotransporters in the fly renal tubule. The aims of this proposal are to assess whether WNK and Fray (the Drosophila SPAK/OSR1 homolog) regulate epithelial ion transport; if they do so by regulation of NKCC and/or KCC; and the detailed mechanisms by which WNK and Fray regulate NKCC versus KCC. This will be tested by assaying tubule physiology, including measurement of transepithelial potential and potassium flux, rates of urine secretion, and lethality of adult flies on high-potassium food, as well as in vitro and cell culture assays of protein-protein interactions and kinase activity. The differences between the four mammalian WNK isoforms will be explored by their introduction into flies lacking endogenous WNK. Finally, the importance of specific phospho-serines and phospho-threonines on the in vivo functioning of fly and mammalian NKCC and KCC will be tested by assaying tubule physiology in flies expressing mutant transporters. Insights gained from these studies can in future be directly tested in mouse models, with the long-term goal of better understanding mammalian renal physiology and human disorders such as hypertension and distal renal tubular acidosis."
"9332635","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It has been estimated that approximately 20% of U.S. service members returning from the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered at least one head injury during deployment. Nearly 83% of these injuries can be classified as mild and are the direct result of either blunt-force (i.e., direct blow to the head) or blast-related (i.e., high pressure from an improvised explosive device) trauma. Though the short and long-term consequences of neurotrauma are now only beginning to be appreciated, those with history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) show increased rates of disability and psychiatric disorders, decreased quality of life, significant cognitive deficits, and troublesome experience of post-concussive symptoms (PCS), relative to those with no history of mTBI. Though vastly understudied, the role of the cerebrovascular dysfunction in outcomes after mTBI has recently begun to garner increasing attention. Importantly, the brain is reliant on steady cerebral blood flow (CBF) to carry out a host of functional processes and maintain neuronal integrity. Brief fluctuations and/or prolonged alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been linked to negative pathological consequences (e.g., neurodegeneration, ischemia) and cognitive dysfunction. Within the context of mTBI, biomechanical and animal models suggest that primary structural alterations to vasculature or brain parenchyma supplied by microvasculature coupled with secondary cellular and/or molecular initiated neuroinflammatory cascades could greatly alter CBF post-injury. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand and clarify the nature of CBF alterations and its potential contributions to negative health outcomes in mTBI, particularly in chronic stages. The current proposal therefore seeks to use state-of-the art, non-invasive, multi-phase pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (MPPCASL) neuroimaging methods to:  (1) evaluate whether CBF changes occur in those with history of mTBI; (2) investigate the relationship between resting CBF and neuropsychological function; and (3) in exploratory analyses, examine possible mediators and/or moderators of resting CBF and cognition in those with history of mTBI. Importantly, understanding the nature and underlying contribution of CBF to poor outcomes in those with mTBI will help inform prevention and interventional strategies that are currently being developed to mitigate negative health consequences for those who have sustained head trauma. Specifically, information gleaned from this proposal has the potential to improve diagnosis, aid in symptom management, and possibly provide a useful biomarker of both impairment and recovery in a vulnerable population where persistent neurological and behavioral dysfunction remains poorly understood.  "

Innovative aspects of the proposal include prospective, longitudinal assessment of falls over a 3 year period through the use of falls calendars, utilization of remote-sensing technology to evaluate real-world mobility outcomes, and direct assessment of the home environment to identify environmental risk factors.  Aim 1 of the grant is to characterize the relationship of VF loss severity on fall rates in glaucoma patients.  Fall rates will be measured a a rate over time, as well as a rate over steps taken.  Steps will be measured in the subject's normal routine using a waistband accelerometer.  Understanding the relationship between disease severity and fall rates will identify which glaucoma patients are at a particularly high rik of falling, and therefore merit interventions to prevent falls.  Aim 2 of the proposal will identif potentially modifiable risk factors for falls in glaucoma patients.  Risk factors to be evaluated wll include features of the patient (e.g.  balance and lower extremity strength), features of the environment (e.g.  the number of hazards noted in a direct assessment of the home), and activity patterns (e.g.  the amount of accelerometer-defined walking and the amount of travel outside the home as measured through a cellular tracking device).  Outcomes from aim 2 will guide which features of the person should be targeted in programs to prevent falls in glaucoma.  Aim 3 of the proposal will characterize the downstream consequences of falls in glaucoma.  Specifically, this aim will characterize whether higher fall rates are associated with increases in fear of falling, decreases in self-reported quality of life, decreases in daily walking and physica activity (measured through annual week-long accelerometer trials), and decrease in the number of excursions outside the home or the amount of time spent outside the home (measured through the use of annual week- long trials with a cellular tracking device.  Outcomes from Aim 3 will guide which strategies should be used to prevent falls in glaucoma, while also addressing other aspects of mobility restriction."

"9307526","SUMMARY Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play an important role as barrier and as cellular factories in charge of absorbing and processing dietary nutrients, as well as the secretion of defense molecules and the orchestration of immune responses. Alterations in the normal function of IECs contribute to pathologies like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Importantly, patients with IBD are at an increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), which is one of the most prevalent neoplasias among the US population. Recent studies have shown the critical role of Paneth cell dysfunction in controlling IEC survival and the etiopathogeneis of intestinal inflammation. Therefore, understanding how different signaling cascades control intestinal homeostasis is a fundamental question in biology with potential therapeutic implications for IBD and CRC. We will address these questions in the context of PKC?/?. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the selective inactivation of PKC?/? in IECs results in the loss of Paneth cells, which provokes the break of the intestinal barrier, dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation and increased tumorigenesis. Importantly, PKC?/? expression decreases with progression in CD and it predicts poor survival in CRC. Of note, this Paneth cell defect is associated with increased crypt apoptosis, JNK activity and autophagy in PKC?/?-deficient IECs. Our hypothesis is that PKC?/? is an essential regulator of autophagy and cell death in intestinal cell homeostasis and inflammation-driven tumorigenesis. In this proposal we will address the following fundamental questions: (1) What is the role in vivo of JNK activation by PKC?/? deficiency in increased apoptosis of IECs and intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis? (2) What are the mechanisms whereby PKC?/? inhibits JNK activity? (3) Is enhanced autophagy in PKC?/?-deficient IECs a survival mechanism in vivo to antagonize the increased JNK and apoptosis promoted by the loss of PKC?/? and to prevent intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis? (4) What are the mechanisms whereby PKC?/? represses autophagy? Questions 1 and 2 will be answered by the experiments described in Aim 1; and questions 3 and 4 will be answered by the experiments described in Aim 2. This proposal will unveil a new paradigm whereby PKC?/? controls IEC apoptosis and autophagy and their role in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation-driven tumorigenesis, opening possibilities for new therapies."
"9411602","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This program targets the long-term preservation of vascularized composite tissues for both autologous- and allotransplantation (VCA), such as of e.g. muscle flaps, digits, faces and whole limbs, to radically improve restorative and reconstructive medicine. We have conceived an integrated two-pronged approach in which we will develop new nature inspired and further augmented stasis cocktails optimized for the critical phases of VCA preservation - preconditioning and protection (prior to storage), preservation (during storage) and revival- resuscitation-repair (after storage) - as wells as new devices purposefully designed for perfusion, storage and, evaluation and quality control before transplant decision. Our approach is based on using the best strategies employed by freeze-tolerant and hibernating animals in nature and then augmenting them with complementary strategies developed through recent scientific understanding, bioengineering principles and modern tools. Thus our preservation approach is unique and distinct from other approaches since we seek to accomplish storage times of several weeks to months using an unexplored, yet highly promising methodology. Importantly, our approach will not seek to solve all the problems needed for classical cryopreservation approaches, but rather be the first to develop preservation in a equilibrium state using high subzero storage temperatures (ranging from -5 to -20 °C) combined with programmed metabolic depression and enhanced stress tolerance pathways. These are temperatures and strategies used in nature by many species able to survive months in a state of `suspended animation,' with the whole animal, including every single organ being banked without injury. The technical objective of this Phase 1 proposal is to develop a non-toxic, multi-component, next generation cryostasis cocktail and protocol which in Phase 2 will be used for whole mammalian limb preservation with re- transplantation. We seek to develop a unique, holistic and non-toxic approach to salvage and preserve human (and eventually tissue engineered) VCA for unprecedented durations. Across three specific aims, in this first phase, we use skeletal muscle and vascular endothelial cells as a model with the central goal of creating a cocktail and protocol that enables high subzero cryopreservation and the development of a thermodynamically stable state, while actively suppressing metabolism and enhancing stress tolerance. Several of these sub-strategies should also help mitigate ischemia reperfusion injury and in other ways help with rewarming, revival and repair post storage. This proposal constitutes an important standalone project that should also lead to solutions for preservation of natural and engineered vital organs, as well as for traditional cell and tissue banking."
"9458426","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A new, integrated training program is proposed, Interdisciplinary Research Training in Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences, based in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina. Advancing the scientific foundation of otolaryngology and communication health, improving health outcomes, and developing and testing new treatments requires well- trained investigative teams with diverse skills and backgrounds in basic and clinical science. The training program's mission is to address these needs by supporting research opportunities in the disciplines related to otolaryngology and communication health, providing strong curricula in an integrative framework, with an interdisciplinary research culture that emphasizes mentoring, academic advancement, career development, grantsmanship, diversity outreach, responsible and ethical conduct of research, and productivity.

"9386216","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are requesting continued funding of this productive training program to prepare pre-doctoral and postdoctoral fellows to become independent scholars in studying the biomedical aspects of drugs of abuse. The training record of this program is outstanding, due to the quality of the trainees and preceptors and its organizational structure. Competition for support from this program has been strong and all slots have been full. Trainees are expected to be supported by this program for no more than 3 years. Since 2010, 13 pre-doctorals and 6 postdoctorals have earned individual NIH fellowships. A large number of individuals who received training from these preceptors have progressed to become leaders in the drug abuse field and a very impressive number have earned funding from NIDA and other sources for their substance abuse-related research. Since the submission of our last competitive application we have recruited three new faculty from other institutions and two faculty members from other departments in this university. The recruitment of more clinical faculty is seen as significant. Thus we are requesting support for 10 predoctoral trainees an increase of one, and we will maintain our postdoctoral trainees at 6. Our preceptors provide the trainees with cutting edge expertise in molecular, cellular, behavioral, clinical and translational research. The major emphasis of this program continues to be concentrated on the pharmacology and mechanism of action of abused drugs and mechanisms of addiction. We continue to have a broad scope in our training program and expect that each preceptor will bring his or her specific expertise to the benefit of all trainees. This is accomplished through the wide  variety of courses, the high level of collaboration among the mentors, the faculty serving on thesis committees and our excellent seminar series. We also have two new core facilities, one devoted to the development of genetically altered animals and the other to a sophisticated bioanalytical technology. The program has enjoyed and will continue to benefit from strong administrative support from the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and the administration of the school and university. The predoctoral training program is rigorous and is characterized by two years of required course work and participation in excellent research projects. Postdoctoral fellows will concentrate on research throughout their training. The major emphasis of all training supported by this program is on research. The faculty has earned the research support necessary for the trainees through the significant number of grants they have generated. We will provide guidance on research, teaching and the professionalism for a career in biomedical science and all aspects of becoming a productive and independent researcher. This will continue to be the hallmark of this program as we continue to provide the atmosphere for the training of leading scholars in the drug abuse field for the future."
"9276155","The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health."
"9325979","PROJECT ABSTRACT Metabolism provides the energy and building blocks necessary for all cellular functions. A breakdown in metabolic function can give rise to devastating diseases, including cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Yet, we have only a limited understanding of metabolic processes in individual living cells and tissues. The largest roadblock has been a general lack of tools for measuring metabolic transients that have high temporal and spatial resolution and also maintain the integrity of the cell. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors (GEFBs) have begun to bridge this gap. However, many first- generation GEFBs are still tremendously challenging or impractical to use due to low signal-to- noise (SNR), suboptimal dynamic and sensing ranges, and dependence on pH. The inherent slowness of the current approach to optimizing GEFBs has significantly hindered progress in this area. The proposed research seeks to overcome this critical barrier in the field of metabolism by establishing two new methods that will dramatically accelerate the development of biosensors optimized for use in living cells: Aim 1) a high-throughput, high- content screen for rapid optimization of GEFBs; and Aim 2) a multiple cloning toolkit for quick construction of novel dimerization-dependent GEFBs. The results of this work will help drive significant progress in the field of metabolism, and the GEFBs generated using these methods will be broadly applicable in multiple cell types, including neurons, cardiac and skeletal myocytes, and pancreatic ? cells."
"9237179","In previous grant cycles, the ADCS has not played a major role in biomarker measurement; assays for Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and for plasma and CSF measurement of amyloid peptides and tau proteins have been subcontracted to companies or external academic labs. However, the importance of biomarker measurement has grown steadily, in part due to the success of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. There have been an increasing number of requests for stored ADCS samples, and  increasing requests for biomarker measurement from ADCS investigators. To meet these needs, in late 2008, we established a Biomarker Core which is located on the 3rd floor of the Medical Teaching Facility building at UCSD School of Medicine."
"9298910","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT With the emergence of inhibitory processes late in the first year, infants begin to exhibit primitive voluntary regulation. Our investigation is a developmental cognitive neuroscience examination of the development of inhibitory control. Using a longitudinal design, we will test whether behavioral and neurophysiological levels of analysis reflect distinctions in two specific types of inhibitory control during infancy: attention inhibition and cognitive inhibition. Infants will be seen monthly from 5 to 12 months of age and complete inhibitory control tasks while brain electrophysiology is recorded. We will use behavior, EEG power, and EEG coherence to characterize the development of types of inhibitory control processes. Our proposed study is critical for understanding early cognitive development. There is a need in the scientific community for research that characterizes normal trajectories in early cognition in order to distinguish individual differences in development from non-optimal trajectories. Our study will provide that basic science foundational work on inhibitory control. We will address three research questions. 1) What is the distribution of performance on the inhibitory control tasks? 2) Is performance on the different types of inhibitory control tasks correlated at each age? 3) What are growth rates of the two types of inhibitory control from 5 to 12 months of age?"
"9237297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop better measures to assess adjustment to mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) because the impact of this therapy on patients' lives is profound. MCS devices are implanted surgically in patients with advanced heart failure and help the heart pump blood throughout the body. After discharge from the hospital, patients manage and troubleshoot their MCS devices while returning, as best they can, to usual activities of daily living (e.g., home and family responsibilities, work, and recreation). Benefits of MCS include longer survival (as compared to medical management of advanced heart failure), reduced heart failure symptoms, and improved physical function. Device-related complications (including bleeding, infection, device malfunction, and stroke) are risks of MCS implantation. As MCS technology evolves, survival is improving and the risk of adverse events is decreasing. However, future recommendations on the advisability of this expensive technology will depend not only on survivability and the risk of adverse events, but also on other outcomes, such as adjustment to MCS and HRQOL, which are less well defined. Importantly, currently available HRQOL instruments, which are generic or designed for heart failure or other illnesses, do not address many of the issues of concern and unique burdens of MCS on patients' daily lives. Currently, 50,000 to 100,ooo patients are diagnosed with advanced heart failure annually. Given the limited availability of heart transplantation, advanced heart failure patients may be offered MCS as a permanent implant (i.e., destination therapy). We propose to develop an MCS-specific measurement system, which we will refer to as Mechanical Circulatory Support: Adjustment and Quality of Life (MCS A-QOL). Our study design will focus on development and psychometric testing of our MCS A-QOL measurement system and evaluation of our conceptual model, followed by an exploration of usability of our measures (via a mobile app) by patients and providers. With development of a measurement system, our research will advance the field of MCS in patients with advanced heart failure. Use of our valid and responsive MCS A-QOL measures will contribute significantly to more clearly defining the benefits and risks of this evolving technology as compared with medical therapy or other strategies. Thus, survival will become more meaningful, as MCS A-QOL is incorporated into our understanding of risks and benefits."

"9412209","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is emerging evidence that distinct populations of actively cycling and quiescent intestinal stem cells (ISCs) co-exist within the small intestine epithelium and function cooperatively in tissue renewal. This proposal explores the hypothesis that these ISC populations are regulated by distinct sets of extracellular signals involved in organ size control and oxygen-sensing. This hypothesis is evaluated by three Specific Aims: (1) to explore the Hippo signaling pathway, implicated in controlling organ size, in regulating the regenerative responses of active and quiescent ISC populations, (2) to examine metabolic regulation of active and quiescent ISCs by the oxygen-sensing pathway, and (3) to determine the molecular signatures of active versus quiescent ISCs by comparative gene expression profiling. These Specific Aims will be achieved by employing rigorous mouse genetics to examine ISCs in vivo within their stem cell niches and validated ex vivo clonogenic culture techniques that allow for sustained proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation of single isolated ISCs. Achievement of these Aims should provide insight into the molecular differences between active and quiescent ISCs at the transcriptional level and their differential regulation by diverse pathways governing organ size and metabolism."
"9429357","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mTOR is a multifunctional kinase involved in embryonic development, cancer, and diabetes. Its role and regulation in nervous system physiology and disease, however, remains less understood. This is a major problem, because the malfunction of mTOR activity (either high or low) has been linked to a variety of brain dysfunctions that affect a specific set of neuronal populations in the brain, such as epilepsy, mental retardation, Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). A detailed understanding of how mTOR is regulated and what role it plays in selective brain regions is important for the development of better intervention strategies. Our long-term goal is to understand how striatum-enriched Rhes (Ras homolog-enriched in striatum) GTPase, which we found to activate mTOR (Subramaniam, 2012), can be manipulated in the striatum for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The objective here, which is the next step in pursuit of our goal, is to investigate the mechanisms by which Rhes GTPase regulates mTOR in cultured cells, and test the effect of mTOR deletion in the striatum on motor behaviors in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that Rhes GTPase is a major regulator of mTOR in the striatum, and that Rhes-mTOR circuitry controls striatal functions and dysfunctions. Our hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our published data, demonstrating that Rhes GTPase, besides its role as a SUMO E3 ligase and regulator of striatal cell toxicity in HD, activates mTOR signaling, which mediates abnormal motor behaviors in PD. We propose to further confirm the mechanisms what regulates, and how, Rhes activates mTOR in the striatum. We will specifically address the following: Aim 1: Dissect the mechanisms of RasGRP1-Rhes circuitry in striatal mTORC1 activation; Aim 2: Identify the role of SUMOylation in Rhes-mediated mTORC1 activity; and Aim 3: Test the effect of striatal deletion of mTOR on mouse behavior and striatal pathology. Overall, our proposal is conceptually innovative as it combines multidisciplinary approaches- cell culture, animal models, biochemistry, pharmacology, cell signaling and behavior- to discover the striatal-specific role and regulation of Rhes-mTOR signaling. The results of this project will be significant, as it will advance our understanding of not on the fundamentals biology of striatal signaling and also help develop novel therapies and treatments for neurological disorders, such as HD and PD, which are associated with Rhes-mTOR dysfunctions."
"9385152","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NISTP:  NEUROIMAGING SCIENCES TRAINING PROGRAM   This institutional grant requests funds for four postdoctoral positions for interdisciplinary training and research in neuroimaging.  Two general classes of neuroimaging will be emphasized:  radiotracer and nuclear magnetic resonance.  The specific imaging methods are described by the following acronyms: PET (positron emission tomography, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), including fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging), and MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy).  These imaging methodologies offer real promise for the expanded clinical utility of neuroimaging in the diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of the pathophysiology of substance abuse and dependence.  However, these new methodologies typically derive from complex, multidisciplinary sciences, which thereby create a challenging information barrier to their further development and application in medical practice.  The purposes of the proposed program are the following:  - Provide formal course training to postdoctoral fellows, with an emphasis on imaging and clinical research methodology, and instruction in their underlying multidisciplinary sciences.  - Provide mentored training for fellows to apply these new methods to the interdisciplinary advance of our understanding of the function of the brain in health, substance abuse, and other psychiatric diseases.  - Provide an integrated research experience for the fellows both in imaging applications and in methodology.  All postdoctoral fellows will be expected to complete at least one research project with an applications mentor and one with a methodology mentor during their training period. The integration of training in methodology and imaging applications will be enhanced by the organization of this program as two interactive tracks of approximately equal size:  Methodology and Application.  We expect that the majority of postdoctoral fellows in the Methodology track will have Ph.D. degrees, and those in the Application track, primarily M.D. degrees or Ph.D. in neurosciences or behavioral sciences.   Each fellow will have a primary and secondary faculty mentor to represent the two tracks."
"9307069","Abstract Risky sexual behaviors have high personal, social, and financial costs. Family communication about sex can reduce risky sexual behaviors, but most studies focus only on the teen-parent dyad. High levels of extended- family involvement in childrearing and sexuality communication, such as with grandparents, aunts and uncles, older siblings and cousins, and ?fictive kin,? especially in Black and Latino families, suggest the importance of assessing this under-studied influence. Preliminary findings show significant associations between extended- family sexuality communication and teen sexual behavior, but the risk or protective effects of this communication remain unclear. To address NICHD's goal of identifying protective factors that prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, this mixed-methods study proposes the first comprehensive assessment of teens' extended-family sexuality communication and its associations with sexual behavior, and includes extended-family perspectives in order to apply quantitative findings to prevention and intervention programs. The proposed study applies an established conceptual model of parent-teen sexuality communication to extended family, which recognizes both direct talk about sex and indirect (less straightforward) sexuality communication, which predict teens' sexual beliefs and behaviors. The study will investigate three aims: 1) Compare teens' sexuality communication with parents and with extended family, 2) Investigate associations between extended-family sexuality communication and teens' sexual beliefs and behaviors, and 3) Explore how extended-family members perceive sexuality communication with teens and what tools they need to support teens' sexual health. To address these aims, this study uses an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, which includes teen surveys and extended-family interviews. Seventeen hundred male and female 11th and 12th graders from 4 schools will fill out an in-school online survey, and 30 extended-family members will be interviewed. Quantitative analyses will address Aims 1 & 2. It is hypothesized that parent and extended-family sexuality communication differ and that teens' perceptions of family members' sexuality communication and attitudes will be associated with teens' sexual beliefs and behaviors. Teens' closeness with the extended family member and values of familism are expected to shape the strength of these associations. The direction of associations will vary by whether teens talk with older or younger extended family. Qualitative analyses will guide implementation of findings from Aims 1 & 2 to support school and community-based prevention and intervention efforts. The significance of this work lies in its comprehensive focus on the full range of partners in family sexuality communication, assessing whether this communication is helpful or harmful to teens' sexual health. It contributes to public health by informing whether and how to include larger family systems, beyond the nuclear family, into prevention and intervention programs.  "
"9385774","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will establish a unique training program in a developing area of transdisciplinary research, co-occurring substance use and other mental disorders (COD). The need for this scientific focus is vital given that COD is more the norm than the exception among those with addictive disorders. The philosophy of this program asserts that to effectively impact the problems of addiction and mental illness, one must be fully aware of their co-existence, etiologies, phenomenology, and clinical manifestations. Moreover, knowledge of clinical approaches and the healthcare systems that serve those with addiction and mental illness is necessary to inform the questions to be asked in laboratory and clinical research studies. Embracing COD as a primary perspective is not a widely accepted approach for the training of scientists. Of NIDA's approximate sixty T32 programs, none include the words co-morbidity, dual diagnosis, or other indicators of a focus on COD. Establishing programs that prioritize training in this area will lead to the development of advanced methods for finding innovative strategies for serving those with COD. We propose to develop such a program by utilizing the unique resources and opportunities available at Dartmouth. Six interconnected groups will provide research opportunities in social, behavioral, and neurobiological mechanisms, treatment development (psychosocial and pharmacological), technology-assisted treatment and dissemination, and health services practices and implementation. Faculty include preeminent leaders in COD research, MD and PhD investigators with strong histories of training scientists, and a team of support faculty committed to establishing a structured training program in COD. Research teams include neuroscientists, behavioral health technologists, clinical trials and contingency management experts, anthropologists, statisticians, economists, and family therapists. Currently the faculty has 27 NIH-funded projects (NIDA [12], NIAAA [4], NIMH [8], NCI [2]; NICHD [1]), and multiple foundation, Department of Education, and VA supported studies. Predoctoral and postdoctoral students mentored by core faculty in the past 10 years have co-authored over 150 publications related to their training activities and were first author on approximately 50% of those. This program will train 5-7 predoctoral and 9-11 postdoctoral students in the initial funding period. The stellar reputation of the faculty and participating research programs, in concert with rigorous criteria for trainee selection and a strong commitment to attracting diverse trainees, will ensure the development of scientists with greater knowledge about the scope of issues that science must address to effectively impact addiction and mental illness. This cohort will be more equipped with broad areas of expertise and a commitment to multidisciplinary approaches to their questions of interest."
"9234545","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Here we seek to understand how the dendritic cell (DC) actin cytoskeleton governs antigen presentation to cognate T cells and also how bidirectional communication between the two cells can rearrange cytoskeletal networks to orchestrate immune responses. DC initiates antigen presentation by imparting context specific information to responder T cells. Correct information drives T cells to dynamically reorient their actin network towards the site of DC-T cell contact and assemble actin-linked intracellular signaling components. This results in long-term sustained signaling events that induce cell behavioral and gene expression changes, thereby leading to onset of adaptive immunity. Although contribution of the actin network in T cells is well established, little is understood of C cytoskeletal roles in antigen presentation and immunity. It is also unclear how crosstalk between DC and T cells through receptor-ligand engagement at the immunological synapse (IS) could rearrange the DC cytoskeleton to influence the myriad of T cell responses. Previous studies strongly support the DC actin network playing significant roles in antigen presentation. Additionally, our preliminary work highlights the role of CD40 signaling in rearranging the actin cytoskeletal network in DC to promote efficient antigen presentation. We hypothesize that the ability to relay communication to cognate responder T cells occurs through modulation of the DC actin cytoskeleton into stiff and rigid networks. This transition of the DC network would then support in trans mobility, assembly, and activation of responder T cell signaling molecules. In this project, we will delineate the role of CD40 signaling in directing DC to upregulate and recrui the actin-bundling protein fascin to the DC IS. In Aim 1A we will define the role of CD40 ligation in modulating differential fascin expression, phosphorylation-activation states, and localization o fascin at the IS. Aim 1B will delineate the downstream intracellular signaling events of CD40 vs. the role of CD40-CD40L clustering at the IS in regulation of fascin activities. Finally, in Aim 1C we evaluate wild type vs. dominant negative mutant fascin ability to rescue CD40-defecient DC priming of responder T cells. Results will provide a better understanding of the role the DC cytoskeleton plays in antigen presentation and propose a model for a larger framework of studies describing: (a) polarized cargo transport along actin-bundled networks; (b) receptor- ligand mobility and membrane fluidity at actin-bundled sites; and (c) microtubule network dynamics in DC and respective contribution to T cell responses. Information uncovered in these studies may provide blueprints for development of tunable artificial antigen presenting material and rational design of DC-based immunotherapies."
"9402503","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is one of the most common environmental pollutants causing lung and other cancer. The mechanism of Cr(VI) carcinogenesis has not been elucidated. The long-term goal of this study is to determine the mechanism of Cr(VI) carcinogenicity and identify targets for better treatment and prevention of lung cancer resulting from Cr(VI) exposure. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in the pattern of gene expression that are not caused by changes in DNA sequence, but are mediated by DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications, microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are cancer cells possessing characteristics of normal stem cells. CSCs or CSC-like cells are considered as cancer initiating cells. Genomic imprinting refers to an epigenetic mechanism by which certain genes are expressed in a parent- of-origin-specific manner, restricting their expression from only one of the two parental chromosomes. Many studies demonstrated that deregulation of epigenetics and genomic imprinting plays key roles in carcinogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that Cr(VI) also causes epigenetic effects such as changing DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications. However, the mechanisms by which Cr(VI) triggers these epigenetic modifications remain largely unknown and whether these epigenetic modifications play a causal role in Cr(VI) carcinogenesis are not clear. Our preliminary studies found: (i) Chronic Cr(VI) exposure induces CSC-like property and cell malignant transformation; (ii) Chronic Cr(VI) exposure increases the levels of several HMTases, which play a causal role in Cr(VI)-induced CSC-like property and cell transformation; (iii) Higher levels of H3 repressive methylation marks and their related HMTases are also detected in lung cancer tissues of mice and humans exposed to chromium; (iv) Up-regulation of HMTases plays a crucial role in chronic Cr(VI) exposure- caused deregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 genomic imprinting cluster; (v) miR-494 down-regulation plays a causal role in Cr(VI)-induced cell transformation; and (vi) Oxidative stress increases the levels of HMTases. Based on literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize: (i) Cr(VI) exposure generates oxidative stress, which increases the levels of HMTases; (ii) Up-regulation of HMTases deregulates the Dlk1-Dio3 genomic imprinting cluster, which decreases the level of miR-494; and (iii) Down-regulation of miR-494 increases the levels of its targets and key CSC factors c-Myc and BMI1, which produce CSC-like property promoting Cr(VI)-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis. This proposed study not only fills the knowledge gap of epigenetics and Cr(VI) carcinogenesis, but also provides novel mechanistic insights for the crucial role of oxidative stress in Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1: Induction of CSC-like property by down-regulating miR-494 of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinting cluster and its role in Cr(VI)-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Aim 2: Down-regulation of miR-494 by chronic Cr(VI) exposure-induced HMTases through deregulating Dlk1-Dio3 genomic imprinting cluster. Aim 3: Up-regulation of HMTases by chronic Cr(VI) exposure through oxidative stress."
"9454939","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the Continuation of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) - Data Coordinating Center. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one out of every three adults and five children in North America and is a growing public health issue in the United States. NAFLD, and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer, as well as liver-, cardiovascular-, and cancer-related mortality, resulting in major increases in health burdens and costs. The NASH CRN is ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public health significance of NASH that can only be addressed via a large research consortium. The primary objective of the NASH CRN is to perform clinical research on NASH and NAFLD in adults and children. A closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in NASH and NAFLD focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management. In the next phase of the NASH CRN, the adult and pediatric therapeutic trials initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed, and new therapeutic trials, including phase 2a proof of mechanism and phase 2b clinical trials will be initiated, to develop evidence-based treatment options that are safe, effective, simple, and inexpensive. The longitudinal cohort of adults and children with NAFLD will be extended, which will prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and will aid in biomarker discovery and validation, and development and validation of non-invasive techniques to evaluate and identify those with NASH/NAFLD, who will respond, and how quickly the disease is progressing. The Data Coordinating Center will provide the NASH CRN with leadership, expertise (in biostatistical analysis, study design, data management, multicenter coordination, quality control methods) and project support, communication and organization and is eager to continue its collaboration with the clinical centers, NIDDK program staff, and private sector partners to complete these very important research objectives. The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."
"9229590","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sharing ASSETs: Expanding Science Opportunities in K-12 Classrooms will build upon an established partnership with the NIH (ORIP)-sponsored Tetrahymena Stock Center, an extensive teacher network, and existing infrastructure to expand the scope of the original ASSET program by developing new, innovative, fully evaluated biology curricula for elementary and middle school students. The new lab modules will feature safe, easily grown single-cell protozoa (Tetrahymena) that are ideal for demonstrating many of the basic principles of biology without engendering any of the conflicting reactions often invoked by the use of multicellular organisms in the classroom. To insure that modules meet the needs of teachers and students in schools with varying resources, the modules will be developed, tested, and evaluated in conjunction with teachers drawn from diverse school districts, ranging from small rural schools in economically depressed areas to large city schools serving under-resourced communities. When necessary, module use will be supported by a small equipment lending library that was established as part of the original ASSET program and that will be expanded as part of the new program. This project will also introduce a new approach to independent inquiry for high school students. Using the original ASSET high school modules as a starting point, we will draw upon the expertise of the program staff in the use of Tetrahymena in research, and solicit input from the Tetrahymena research community, to develop an open ended module that provides guidance for teachers in the implementation of independent inquiry as part of their curricula. To insure equitable use by teachers and students in underserved communities with limited facilities, modules will be designed to be as self-contained as possible, and when necessary, will be supported by the equipment lending library. Use of ASSET modules in underserved communities will help stimulate interest in science and science related careers, especially among students traditionally under-represented in STEM activities. In addition to the lab modules, innovative materials addressing the intersection of biology and society will also be developed for use by middle and elementary students. These interactive modules will support the establishment of a scientifically literate, engaged citizenry. In addition a series of teacher workshops will be carried out to support use of the new ASSET materials, targeting both elementary teachers, who are often not science specialists, and pre-service teachers. The proposed pre-service teacher outreach will support national goals of preparing 100,000 new K-12 STEM teachers by 2020."
"9249391","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     In the past 25 years, little improvement has been made in patient survival after a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The robust induction of angiogenesis, extreme resistance to radiation, and a highly aggressive, invasive phenotype make GBM one of the most lethal and difficult human cancers to treat. Recently, a mesenchymal subtype of GBMs has been identified that displays the most infiltrative behavior, is the most resistant to standard therapies, and expresses markers, such as a secreted protein YKL-40, which correlate with the worst patient prognosis. We have identified that two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and oncostatin M (OSM), are specifically overexpressed in patients with mesenchymal GBM. Our data indicates that IL-1? and OSM synergize to support GBM progression through a novel RelB/p50-canonical pathway, which to date has only been proposed to function in cells expressing high levels of RelB. Our preliminary studies have identified two groups of RelB/p50-dependent genes in GBM cells and astrocytes: conserved genes (activated in both GBM and astrocytes) and aberrantly-activated genes (activated in GBM but suppressed in astrocytes). The conserved genes include markers of the mesenchymal GBM subtype and intriguing novel genes postulated to regulate GBM progression. The aberrantly activated genes encode many cytokines, including IL-1, which suggests the existence of RelB-driven feedforward cytokine loop fueling chronic inflammation in GBM. Importantly, the aberrantly-activated genes have previously been shown to undergo RelB-dependent reprograming by epigenetic silencing in macrophages, which requires histone deacetylase SIRT1. Our preliminary studies have found that one allele of the sirt1 gene is deleted in 75% of GBM tumors, which may explain the lack of RelB-dependent epigenetic silencing in GBM. Thus, we hypothesize that RelB/p50 activation drives gene expression programs which induced both chronic inflammation and GBM aggressiveness."
"9229502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected individuals face a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), even when viremia is suppressed by combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Mechanisms underlying HIV-associated CVD risk are incompletely understood and specific guidelines on cardioprotective care for this population are not available. Characterizing and reducing CVD risk among HIV-infected women represents a particular challenge. HIV-infected women have a lower prevalence of select traditional CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension, smoking) and are less likely than HIV-infected men to be offered preventive cardiac care in clinical practice. However, several studies suggest women with HIV are just as likely as their male counterparts to incur an MI. Indeed, a large-scale US epidemiologic study shows that among HIV-infected women, unadjusted rates of MI modestly exceed those among HIV-infected men. Moreover, the same study reveals a significantly higher adjusted relative risk of MI in HIV infected-women versus uninfected females (2.89) as compared with HIV-infected men versus uninfected males (1.4). The proposed study aims to identify sex-specific mechanisms of CVD risk and risk reduction in HIV, addressing an NIH research priority. Importantly, the proposed study leverages the infrastructure of the largest primary prevention trial in the field of HIV-associated CVD: The Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE, A5332). The REPRIEVE trial, now launching, will test among 6500 HIV-infected persons ages 40-75 with low traditional CVD risk scores whether statin therapy reduces clinical cardiovascular events. Statin therapy has appeal in HIV in that it both reduces LDL cholesterol levels and dampens atherogenic immune activation, which persists in persons with HIV on cART. Work from our group and others suggests immune activation is highest in HIV-infected women (vs. HIV-infected men), particularly among those women who have undergone menopause. Through the proposed project, we will assess whether immune activation contributes uniquely to CVD risk among HIV-infected women across the reproductive aging spectrum and how statins may reduce CVD risk through effects on this pathway. Answers to these questions will influence the development of CVD prediction and prevention strategies tailored to the aging female HIV-infected population worldwide (~17 million). Maximizing our power to elucidate sex-specific CVD mechanisms in HIV, we will also design, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based education/awareness recruitment campaign to enhance female enrollment in the REPRIEVE trial."
"9327330","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastoma is highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. Despite treatment, median survival is only 12-15 months. Tumor cells rely upon elevated stress response pathways to survive and maintain a rapid proliferative rate in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are particularly enriched in their ability to survive in the context of nutrient deprivation, high reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and radiation. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the unfolded proteins response (UPR) promote cell survival during stress. These pathways are elevated in glioblastoma and knockdown induces chemosensitivity and cell death. The UPR specifically relieves ER stress, a key pathway of radiation-induced cell death. I have identified RSAD1 as a potential regulator of the UPR and thus a novel dependency in GSCs. There are currently no published studies characterizing the function of RSAD1. RSAD1 is upregulated in glioblastoma and is correlated with worse survival, and my preliminary evidence demonstrates that RSAD1 knockdown significantly impairs proliferation in GSCs. I found that RSAD1 binding partners enrich for UPR regulators and HSPs. The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that RSAD1 promotes survival in GSCs through activation of the UPR. Given the important role of the UPR in inducing stress resilience, inhibition of RSAD may act as a chemo- or radiosensitizer of GSCs, in addition to independently impairing proliferation. RSAD1 may therefore be a novel target for synergistic therapy in glioblastoma."
"9231499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine fatal inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by expansion of an inframe CAG trinucleotide repeat. Each repeat tract encodes a stretch of glutamine residues in the affected protein, in the case of SCA1 the protein is ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Symptoms of SCA1 include loss of motor coordination and balance, slurred speech, swallowing difficulty, spasticity, and some cognitive impairment. A characteristic feature of SCA1 pathology is atrophy and eventual loss of Purkinje cells from the cerebellar cortex. Like many neurodegenerative disorders, SCA1 is typically a late onset disease suggesting that physiological changes due to aging contribute to the onset of the disease. There is currently no effective treatment. Thus, identifying signaling pathways and cellular mediators of SCA1 onset and progression remain a major challenge in the search for therapeutics and is the focus of the research outlined in this application for continued support."
"9326050","ABSTRACT: Molecular imaging has evolved into an important clinical tool to visualize the expression and activity of specific molecules in diseased states and to provide insight towards effective diagnosis and treatment of patients. However, a significant bottleneck has emerged for the development and translation of molecular imaging agents, with the process of developing a single compound into an imaging agent being extremely time consuming and costly. Current limitations for the rapid development and translation of targeted molecular imaging agents for PET include but are not limited to; the complex design, synthesis and screening approaches for both ligand identification and imaging agent development as well as the burdensome administrative documentation associated with preparing the agent for clinical use. We propose to mitigate some of these challenges by leveraging academic and industry expertise and resources to develop a high- throughput multiplex approach, initially focusing on Plectin-1 targeted peptides (PTPs) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Plectin-1 is a marker for multiple cancers including ovarian, esophageal, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarinoma (PDAC). PDAC is a devastating disease with a median survival rate of 6 months and a 5-year survival rate of only 5%. The only curative treatment for PDAC is surgery for localized disease; however, only 20% of patients will present with surgically resectable disease. There is a clear unmet need for the development of novel molecular markers and imaging agents that would enable earlier detection and provide a rational guide for treatment regimens. We will utilize the advances made in combinatorial chemistry and microfluidic flow chemistry to rapidly identify, screen and optimize PTPs. Specifically we will use OBOC to affinity mature the plectin binding peptide PTP-01 (identified by Kelly) and microfluidic flow chemistry for rapid radiolabeling of lead peptides with fluorine- 18 for subsequent PET imaging in vivo in both mouse and non-human primate (NHP) studies. Through the industrial partnership with iTi Health Inc. we will advance a lead candidate through IND-enabling studies towards a first-in-human clinical study. This strategic alliance brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in combinatorial chemistry, radiochemistry, high-throughput in vivo screening and molecular imaging (Sutcliffe, PI), PDAC biology, chemical biology and proteomics (Kelly, co-investigator) biostatistics (Beckett), nonhuman primate imaging (Tarantal), and surgical oncology (Bold). In additional to the unique expertise this partnership leverages the unique resources including state of the art preclinical imaging resources (including nonhuman primate), new radiochemistry and GMP resources at UC Davis."
"9308705","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon guidance is a critical step in the development of the central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggests that axon guidance is disrupted in many patients suffering from several neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. The guidance cue netrin-1 and netrin receptor DCC regulate axon guidance by modulating the growth cone cytoskeleton, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. We recently identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 as a novel binding partner of DCC and a regulator of axon guidance and the cytoskeleton. We also have preliminary data showing that the highly similar protein TRIM67 interacts with DCC and the actin regulatory protein VASP, and is necessary for netrin-dependent axon branching. This proposal will test our hypothesis that TRIM9 and TRIM67 coordinate to regulate the downstream effects of netrin-1 dependent axon guidance. Our first aim will be to identify and confirm TRIM67 direct interactions with DCC and Ena/VASP actin regulatory proteins and their colocalization at filopodia tips. Our second aim is to define the role of TRIM67 in netrin-dependent axon morphogenesis. Our third aim will focus on identifying axon guidance defects that occur upon deletion of TRIM67 in vitro, using novel microfluidic devices, as well as defects that occur in vivo using histological analysis. These experiments will help to further elucidate mechanisms of neuronal development."
"9237182","Although a number of promising anti-amyloid (ABeta) agents are currently in large-scale clinical trials, unfortunately, none of the trials at the stages of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia has yet demonstrated clear evidence of clinical benefit. Given the mounting evidence that neurodegeneration is well entrenched even by the stage of MCI, there is growing concern in the field that we may need to institute antiamyloid therapies at a much earlier stage of AD to fully impact the course of the disease. Recent imaging, biomarker, and autopsy studies are remarkably consistent in the finding that approximately 1/3 of clinically normal older individuals harbor ABeta pathology, and many of these individuals already demonstrate functional and structural brain imaging abnormalities consistent with preclinical AD. The A4 (Anti-Amyloid treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease) study is a secondary prevention trial in clinically normal older subjects with biomarker marker evidence of AD pathology, who at increased risk for progression to AD dementia. The A4 trial will be a 3-year, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of a monoclonal anti-ABeta antibody in 1000 older individuals who are ABeta-positive on screening PET amyloid imaging. The primary outcome will be rate of decline on a cognitive composite, heavily weighted towards episodic memory and executive function tests. Secondary biomarker outcomes will include PET amyloid imaging, cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau/phosphotau, and volumetric MRI measures. We will also develop a novel computerized test battery and task-free functional MRI as exploratory outcomes. The A4 study will also include a natural history arm of age and education matched ABeta-negative individuals (n=500) who will undergo longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessments. The A4 study should provide critically needed evidence to support (or refute) ABeta as a promising strategy for disease-modifying therapy in very early AD, and will serve to greatly enhance the efficiency of future prevention studies as additional therapies, including anti-tau agents, become available."

"9441912","Project 4 has been a leader in revealing the myriad roles played by microRNAs in human cancer. We will  build upon this foundation with an increased biological focus on breast cancer. We will isolate the six, well defined mammary epithelial cell types from normal virgin and parous female mice and define their miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. In so doing, we hope to better define the mammary stem cell (MaSC) and gain an appreciation for the pathways that maintain its self-renewal. This will include a definition of miRNAs and miRNA targets that are important in the MaSC. Using normal cells as a reference point, we will work to understand the relafionship between mammary tumor initiating cells and normal mammary stem cells. In part, we aim to test the relevance of tumor initiating populations, which thus far have only been detected in transplantation studies, to breast cancer in in vivo models of basal tumorigenesis. We hope to identify pathways that determine tumor initiating potential and to relate these to self-renewal pathways used by mammary stem cells. We appreciate that both normal and tumor cells function in context, and we will therefore strive to understand how the in vivo niche supports MaSC self-renewal. Similarly, we will ask whether tumor initiating cells occupy a niche or whether their special status is a cell autonomous property. With the realization that it is usually metastatic disease that kills patients, we will also probe the niches occupied by disseminated tumor cells, which can lie dormant for decades following initial treatment before they progress to frank metastases. Using a series of highly innovative strategies, including molecular profiling, RNAi-based genetics, and sophisticated imaging a whole, this Project takes a comprehensive approach to understanding the roles of miRNAs in breast cancer."
"9441909","Cancer involves the induction of uncontrolled DNA replication and mitosis in cells, as well as processes that ensure cells evade cell death or senescence and survive in specific tissue micro-environments. Project 1 has been a leader in studying the mechanisms and control of inheritance of the human genome and has identified many of the key proteins that are involved in DNA synthesis at the replication fork and other proteins that are involved in the initiation of DNA replication. In the proposed studies. Project 1 will continue to focus on how the initiation of DNA replication is controlled in human cells and how this process goes awry n tumor cells. Specific Aim 1 will focus on how the origins of DNA replication are marked in chromosomes so that they can form pre-replicative complexes during exit from mitosis or during Gl phase, thereby enabling the initiation of DNA replication in S phase of the cell division cycle. Since the Origin Recognition Complex, particularly its largest subunit Orel is loaded onto chromosomes beginning in prophase of mitosis and Orel is the most stably bound chromatin protein, the locations within the human genome for Orel binding will be determined. In addition, proteins that dynamically interact with ORC during M and G1 phases will be determined. The cell cycle regulators Cyclin E-CDK2 and Cyclin A-CDK2, the former often over-active in breast cancer, are controlled by direct interactions with Orel and Cdc6 and how these interactions influence the initiation of DNA replication and centriole duplication in centrosomes will be investigated. Recent evidence has emerged that ORC subunits play a critical role at kinetochores that bind microtubule spindles for congression of chromosomes prior to their segregation. In Specific Aim 2, interactions between the Orc2 and Orc3 subunits of ORC and the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint kinase BubRI will be investigated, as will the role of the ORC subunits in maintenance of stable spindle attachment during the metaphase to anaphase transition. In Specific Aim 3, the control of DNA replication by the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 and its interaction with the transcription factor E2F1 will be studied. DDX5 is amplified in the genome of cells in 25% of human breast cancers and it is these cells that display selective sensitivity to inhibition of DDX5 protein levels. How DDX5 influences E2F1-driven expression of DNA replication genes in the Gl phase of the cell cycle will be investigated. Project 1 will also investigate how tumor cells with amplified copy number of DDX5 become addicted to its continued expression, in contrast to normal, non-tumor cells and many other cancer cells. Finally, the additive effects on inhibition of tumors cell proliferation with the combination of DDX5 depletion and Trastuzumab (Herceptin) treatment will be examined."

"9378558","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competitive renewal of a highly successful grant investigating sociodemographic disparities in outcomes from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, we will turn our attention to the alarming and unexplained sociodemographic disparities that exist in SLE incidence. Most SLE patients are women and blacks have much higher incidence and poorer outcomes than whites. Moreover, within the population enrolled in Medicaid, the Federal-state insurance for low income Americans, we have shown increased SLE among those living in poorer areas. We will investigate three classes of potentially modifiable social and behavioral factors that may contribute to increased SLE incidence among black and low socioeconomic status women: 1. dietary factors and patterns, specifically fish (rich in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids), and the Western pro-inflammatory dietary pattern, characterized by fast food, high saturated fat, processed meats, potatoes, and sugar-sweetened soft drinks; 2. obesity, which induces systemic inflammation, and; 3. psychosocial factors including depressive symptoms, anxiety and exposure to abuse. We hypothesize that these exposures are associated with elevated biomarkers of SLE autoimmunity, as well as with incident SLE. We will utilize the largest collection of women followed prospectively prior to SLE, the Nurses' Health Study and the Black Women's Health Study cohorts, with rich data on dietary, lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and banked blood samples. With excellent statistical power, we will examine whether and how these exposures at different time periods of life may alter SLE risk among white and black women of a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Our multidisciplinary investigative team spanning nutritional epidemiology, social and behavioral epidemiology, biostatistics, and rheumatology will employ advanced and innovative epidemiologic concepts and analyses. The proposed analyses will provide currently lacking information concerning potential epidemiologic explanations for observed sociodemographic disparities in SLE. The findings will have important public health and clinical implications, directly informing lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing and reducing disparities in SLE."
"9222010","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians need rapid and specific histopathologic diagnoses for their cancer patients. For example, open surgical biopsies may contain diagnostic information bearing on intraoperative decisions such as surgical resection vs conservative treatment. But standard rapid diagnosis by frozen section may not discriminate between relevant pathologies. Standard specific diagnosis by immunohistochemistry (IHC) can take days to provide these data. This situation may deny information critical for good decision making at open biopsy. For example, small cell astrocytomas and central nervous system lymphomas are difficult to distinguish on frozen section. Astrocytomas require aggressive resection, but lymphomas are best left unresected. Misdiagnosis could lead to unnecessary resection of eloquent brain or missed aggressive resection of an invasive malignant tumor. A method that rapidly provides relevant diagnostic information will improve clinical care. This project develops nanoprobes that rapidly provide diagnostic histopathologic information from fresh tumor biopsies. Aptamers are an emerging class of polynucleotides easily engineered to identify specific molecular targets. Recent methods let aptamers switch conformation when they bind a target, and this change can provide imaging contrast. Our project aims to generate switchable aptamer contrast agents that detect clinically relevant extracellular and intracellular IHC targets Aim 1 develops a switchable aptamer that rapidly detects the extracellular marker for human central nervous system lymphoma in fresh xenograft tissue biopsies. Aim 2 develops a switchable aptamer against the intracellular astrocytoma marker glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). We plan to rapidly deliver the GFAP-specific aptamer to intracellular space using a DNA tetrahedron nanostructure. Both aims optimize rapid aptamer-based labeling of xenograft biopsies. This project develops switchable aptamers as contrast agents for rapid IHC-quality labeling. Our future plan is to develop a clinical trial evaluating aptamer-based diagnostics on intraoperative decision-making during initial craniotomy for brain diagnosis and/or resection.  This proposal brings together physicians and scientists from the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) and Arizona State University's (ASU) Biodesign Institute. BNI is the largest Neurosurgery residency program in North America and cares for one of the largest volumes of brain tumor patients in the United States. BNI has been a leader in advancing fluorescence imaging tools for brain tumor imaging, and is the only North American center with an advanced Zeiss LSM710/5LiveDUO confocal microscope situated in the pathology department. The Biodesign Institute has been a leader in developing DNA nanotechnology, and its Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics is innovating the use of DNA as structural material. This collaboration between BNI and the Biodesign Institute will develop an innovative class of nanomolecules for the rapid diagnosis, and improved care of cancer patients."
"9244678","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 25-30% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with high mortality. In HER2+ patients, anthracycline (i.e. doxorubicin) chemotherapy is usually followed by treatment with trastuzumab, which has led to a dramatic improvement in survival. However, cardiovascular toxicity remains the most devastating complications of cancer treatments. In a recent large study, the adjusted 3-year incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) or cardiomyopathy was 42% for HER2+ patients. To monitor for potential cardiotoxicity, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is monitored and if a decline in LVEF develops, therapy is withheld. However, an LVEF decline occurs very late, and significant myocardial injury may have already occurred by the time an LVEF decline is detected. Therefore, an early detection of cardiotoxicity will have significant clinical impact by enabling initiation of cardioprotective theapy to prevent development of CHF and allowing uninterrupted completion of cancer therapy; however currently there is no non-invasive method to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity. Recent advances in cardiac MR (CMR) allow non-invasive assessment of the degree of extracellular volume expansion, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and edema which are directly related to myocardial injury associated with chemotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesize that CMR can provide noninvasive, quantitative evidence of early cardiotoxicity associated with adjuvant therapy for HER2+ patients to devise personalized treatment planning for management of toxicity without interrupting the chemotherapy. We will perform both pre-clinical (in a swine model of cardiotoxicity) and clinical study (in HER2+ breast cancer patient) to establish role of CMR in detecting subclinical cardiotoxicity."
"9393067","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Addictions and the associated public health problems of HIV transmission, crime and violence, exact a severe toll on our nation, costing billions annually in health care, lost productivity, and incarceration. As there  have  been  rapid advances  in  neuroscience  and  genetics  in  the  past two  decades, we  need  to  speed  the  'forward' translation of this knowledge into more effective clinical treatments for the addictions. Conversely, for addiction treatments with some known efficacy, we can now apply new neuroscience and genetic tools in 'backward-translation' -- e.g., finding why a treatment works well for some individuals, yet not at all for others.  To help meet the need for skilled translatioal researchers, this application proposes a continuation of our T32 Translational Addiction Research Fellowship for pre- and post-doctoral trainees at the University of Pennsylvania.  The  training  program  will  make  explicit  a  long-standing  translational  tradition  at  Penn,  integrating clinical and basic research strengths to create trainees, whether clinical or preclinical, Ph.D.'s or  M.D.s, who will be able to accelerate addiction science in the next decade. The emphasis on translation is  reflected at each level of the program - through the Co-PIs (clinical and basic, Drs. Childress and Pierce), the  internal and external advisory board members, the formal didactics, the dual mentoring (each trainee will  have both a clinical and preclinical mentor), and in the focus of trainees' mentored research projects.    The translational emphasis of the program is driven by the recognition that addictions are complex  disorders, multi-determined by interaction of genetic vulnerabilities, exposure to drug, and a host of modulating  (e.g., early trauma, stress, cultural norms) influences. Trainees will thus be offered state-of-the-art knowledge  about these interacting determinants through a didactic series specific to the program, and through mentored  projects  that  may  range  from  molecular  and  genetic  studies,  to  brain  systems  (neuroscience  and  neuroimaging), to clinical treatment trials, and drug policy. This wide range of choices is enabled by the long  history  of  excellence in  addiction  research  at  the  University,  reflected  in  the  several  academic  research  Centers  (Penn-VA  Addiction  Research  Center~  Translational  Research  Laboratories/CNB~  Center  for  Aids  Research~ Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center~ Treatment Research Institute) and laboratories  (Lucki lab, Mackler lab) offering skilled, successful mentors to the Fellowship. Mentored research also takes place within several affiliated treatment settings (VA, Presby-Penn, NIDA CTN sites, community methadone clinics, and mobile HIV Prevention units), critical for translating new research findings into the 'real world'."
"9307229","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)?defined as deliberate destruction of one's body in the absence of intent to die (most commonly self-cutting)?accounts for 25% of 7-24 year olds seen in emergency departments annually for self-harm and increases the risk for a suicide attempt (SA) by as much as 7-fold. Moreover, suicide is the second leading cause of death of 10-24 year olds in the U.S. Thus, there is a critical need to identify the brain/behavior mechanisms underlying NSSI itself and also the circuit/behavior/symptoms predictors of which youths engaged in NSSI-only will make a first-onset SA (and which will not). THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES are (1) to identify functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences between youths engaged in NSSI vs. controls without psychopathology, (2) to determine the circuit, behavior, and symptom factors associated with first-onset SA, and (3) to test moderators of this relationship including irritability, social function, and impulsive aggression. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, based on preliminary data from our American Foundation for Suicide Prevention study of teens engaged in NSSI-only is that (a) youths engaged in NSSI-only without a prior SA have behavior/circuit alterations in a prefrontal cortex (PFC)- amygdala circuit during tasks tapping implicit associations with suicide and response to peer acceptance vs. rejection, and (b) these circuit alterations, moderated by irritability, impulsive aggression, and social dysfunction, put youths at greater risk for future suicidal behavior. RESEARCH METHOD: We will test this hypothesis by comparing 150 youths engaged in NSSI-only (without prior SA) vs. 50 typically-developing control (TDC) youths on circuit, behavior, and symptom measures, and then following the sample for 18 months to delineate what distinguishes those who progress to suicidal behavior. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROPOSAL is that greater knowledge of the brain/behavior mechanisms underlying NSSI and the relationship to subsequent first-onset SA will ultimately lead to a more brain-based classification and treatment approach for NSSI and suicide, which in turn would reduce risk, and enhance prevention for, suicidal behavior among children and adolescents. INNOVATION: Our study is innovative because it will uniquely synergize circuit and behavioral methods based on solid preliminary data with innovative ecological momentary assessments of NSSI/suicide and irritability, real-world assessment of social function, longitudinal follow up, and a committed multi-disciplinary team. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is significant because it addresses gaps in knowledge about bio-behavioral mechanisms of both NSSI and also of a first-onset SA highlighted by the NIMH/National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention's (NAASP) ?Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention? and the June 2016 NIMH-sponsored meeting on ?Mechanisms of Suicide Risk??as these mechanisms provide the foundation for biological mechanism-based classification and treatments for NSSI and suicide."

"9237181","Quantitative brain imaging biomarkers now play a central role in clinical trials for AD, as they may permit a more direct assessment of the effects of a therapy on brain function, amyloid load, and rate of neurodegeneration. Such information complements clinical and cognitive data points to provide a more complete picture of an intervention's putative disease-modifying effects. Further, clinical brain imaging and central clinical overread may be required for monitoring patient safety during a trial. However, the complexity of imaging data requires ready access to specialized neuroimaging expertise to assist in developing and maintaining state-of-the-art approaches in study design as well as data management, analysis, and sharing.

"9093815","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over three million pregnant women labor and give birth in the United States every year. Despite the frequency of this event, many aspects of labor management lack evidence. The second stage of labor, defined as the interval from complete cervical dilation through delivery of the fetus, is the most physiologically demanding period of labor for both the mother and the fetus. Despite the huge impact labor management can have on mode of delivery and neonatal and maternal morbidities, the optimal technique for managing maternal pushing during the second stage of labor is unknown. The two most common approaches involve either allowing for spontaneous descent (delayed pushing) or initiating pushing with uterine contractions once complete cervical dilation occurs (immediate pushing). Prior studies comparing these approaches reported results that are contradictory with regard to benefit and harm to the neonate and mother. Despite these data, delayed pushing gained wide spread use with a perception that it improves rates of vaginal delivery and reduces morbidities. By contrast, our recent meta-analysis demonstrated that among high-quality trials, delayed pushing did not improve the spontaneous vaginal delivery rate, but prolonged second stage duration. Notably, the largest trial evaluated outcome measures that are obsolete in contemporary obstetrics in the United States, such as use of mid-pelvic rotational forceps. Results of our large observational study indicated that selection to delayed pushing is associated with worse labor outcomes than immediate pushing. The lack of a modern, large, well- controlled, randomized clinical trial to address this question has led to uncertainty as to which technique for maternal pushing in the second stage of labor optimizes outcomes. In addition, effects of immediate versus delayed pushing on risk of maternal pelvic floor injury remain unknown. Given that approximately 11,000 women labor and deliver daily in the United States, there is an urgent need to fill this important clinical knowledge gap and provide high-quality evidence to inform contemporary obstetric management of the second stage of labor. We propose a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of immediate versus delayed pushing for nulliparous women in labor at term reaching complete cervical dilation. Our central hypothesis is that immediate pushing in the second stage of labor increases spontaneous vaginal delivery, shortens duration of the second stage, and reduces adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes in nulliparous women. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess the effectiveness of immediate pushing at complete cervical dilation on the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women (Primary Aim), 2) Determine the effect of immediate pushing on the rate of neonatal composite morbidity (Secondary Aim #1), and 3) Determine the impact of immediate versus delayed pushing on objective and subjective measures of maternal pelvic floor morbidity (Secondary Aim #2). We estimate that randomizing a total of 3184 women will provide adequate statistical power to detect meaningful differences in the primary and secondary outcomes."
"9370490","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression and obesity are reaching epidemic proportions in American youth today, and when they co-occur, they may have compounding deleterious effects, including the development of impaired insulin sensitivity toward insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes in which cells fail to respond to the normal actions of the hormone insulin). Traditionally, depression and impaired insulin sensitivity have been compartmentalized as separate emotional and physical health syndromes. However, recent evidence suggests interactions and common neurobehavioral pathways between these syndromes that can lead to worsening depressive symptoms. To date, no study has investigated the underlying mechanisms or risk factors for developing worsening of depressive symptoms in youth with depression and impaired insulin sensitivity.  There is a pressing clinical need to better identify which youth with depression and impaired insulin sensitivity are most likely to develop worsening depressive symptoms, as current pharmacological and dietary/lifestyle strategies to overcome the burgeoning threat of lifelong depression and obesity are of limited efficacy, have adverse side effects, and in most cases are not curative. Compelling recent data have shown that depressed youth, independent of changes in weight, have early disruptions of neurobiological systems critical for the response and regulation of reward, most notably in the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala neural reward circuit. This Research has implicated involvement of the Approach Motivation construct of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Positive Valence Systems, which describes fundamental aspects of reward dysfunction when youth with depression engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g. overeating) that place them at high risk for progressively worsening depressive symptoms.  This proposal aims to use an RDoC framework in the first prospective study to investigate the mechanisms and risk factors for worsening depressive symptoms that are associated with dysfunctional Approach Motivation in youth with depression and impaired insulin sensitivity. To accomplish these aims, 120 overweight girls and boys (ages 9-15 years) seeking treatment for moderate to severe depressive symptoms, will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 24 months with cognitive and behavioral markers of Approach Motivation, serum markers of insulin sensitivity, and clinical markers of depression. Youth will be scanned with multimodal MRI at baseline and at 6 months. We aim to determine whether worsening depressive symptoms in youth with depression and impaired insulin sensitivity is mediated by changes in neural reward circuitry, and to identify clinical, demographic, and familial risk factors for developing worsening depression in these youth. This knowledge will be vitally important to mental health and primary care professionals who have limited empirical evidence on which to base their practice. It also has potential to inform the pathophysiology of other disorders associated with dysfunctional approach motivation and the development of novel empirical targets for treating these complex problems in youth."
"9431631","Project Summary/Abstract Asymmetrical localization and specific protein binding patterns of mRNA play a key role in many cellular pro- cesses, and aberrant mRNA localization has been observed in cancer and several neurological diseases. Gain- ing a deeper understanding of mRNA localization patterns and the corresponding mechanisms of mRNA transport would provide valuable information regarding disease progression and potential therapeutic ap- proaches. However, the RNA labeling methods currently available suffer from various challenges and limitations, creating an ongoing demand for improved methods for labeling and imaging of specific mRNA sequences in living cells. Harnessing the power of molecular recognition between RNA and small molecules, we have devel- oped ribozyme sequences that are capable of self-alkylation with an electrophilic fluorescein analogue, and can be fused to an mRNA of interest and expressed in cells. These ribozymes are anticipated to serve the dual purpose of enabling fluorescence-based visualization of mRNA and providing a handle for immunoprecipitation of proteins bound to specific RNA sequences. Compared with other RNA labeling technologies, the proposed ribozyme-based approach offers the benefits of smaller fusion size, potential for use with a broad palette of small-molecule fluorophores, and reduction of background signal by removal of excess fluorophore. Additionally, the proposed ribozyme-based approach enables new applications that are not possible with other RNA labeling technologies, such as pulse-chase labeling and transcript-specific immunoprecipitation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) utilize the ribozymes to isolate and identify transcript-specific RNA-binding proteins; (2) fluorescently label and visualize mRNAs in living cells and monitor time-resolved mRNA dynamics; (3) utilize our RNA labeling and immunoprecipitation methods to gain insight into the mechanism and specific localization pat- terns of non-canonical ER-localized mRNAs. This research is anticipated to provide powerful tools for studying the localization and transport mechanisms of mRNA in living cells, and will put these tools to immediate use to answer biological questions regarding ER-localized RNAs. This is in turn expected to further our understanding of fundamental cellular processes and offer new insights into the mechanisms and treatment of disease."
"9209218","Core B Project Summary/Abstract There is a need for a Health span and Longevity Core to coordinate efforts of projects into a common goal to test the long term effects of SS-31 on age-related physiological function and lifespan in mice. These effects are not yet known at the multisystem level and the proposed experiments will shed new light on the ability to target mitochondria with a compound that is predicted to delay or reverse aging and age-related comorbid diseases. Use of a depot parenteral delivery will eliminate the need to do daily injections and provide a means of long term administration in preclinical studies and in human studies. The depot delivery concept is a significant approach to enhancing the value of the peptide. The underlying hypothesis is that SS-31 therapy initiated in middle age will forestall and protect the heart, skeletal muscle, vision and other health span metrics from intrinsic aging. It is not yet known whether SS-31 will extend lifespan (in any model organism) and this is a second important outcome of the efforts of Core B. Finally, application of a stressor can accelerate aging phenotypes, and the best model of this is a high fat diet (HFD), both because of its known deleterious effects on health span and lifespan metrics, as well as the unfortunate fact that obesity is epidemic in the human population. Thus, mice on a HFD model the aging of a large segment of humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine murine lifespan and health span after SS-31 is continuously delivered to mice beginning at middle age. Pilot data will confirm health span phenotypes in C57BL/6 and the F1 BALB/cBy x C57BL/6 hybrid, followed by full cross sectional and lifespan cohorts with both genders. Specific Aim 2 will determine the ability of SS-31 to attenuate the stress effects of a high fat diet (HFD) during aging. The protocol will follow that of Aim 1, but using a HFD. The data generated will provide valuable information on ways to further validate the peptide in preclinical studies and establish strategies for developing clinical anti-aging trials. Core B will address the resource objectives by providing colony management including old mouse monitoring and arrangements for colony management, and physiological assessment assays. Therefore, Core B will be enhancing the overall research goals of the P01."
"9442948","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With 34 million people currently living with HIV worldwide, developing a prophylactic HIV vaccine that protects against heterosexual transmission remains a top global health priority. We have recently discovered the existence of a novel class of CD8+ T cells recognizing peptide antigen presented by the non-classical molecule MHC-E. In contrast to the staggering diversity of classical HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles present in the human population, only two HLA-E alleles exist, which differ only by one amino acid and are functionally identical. Furthermore, while classical HLA-A and -B molecules are removed from the surface of HIV-infected cells by the Nef protein, HLA-E surface expression increases dramatically. These desirable traits raise the possibility that a vaccine targeting HLA-E could induce a universal T cell response, which would be unaffected by the immune evasion activities of the Nef protein, and shared by all vaccinated individuals. To investigate this intriguing idea, we will define MHC-E restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes in both humans and rhesus macaques in specific aim 1 of this proposal. In specific aim 2, we will characterize the functionality, TCR usage, and antiviral efficacy of these unusual T cells. In specific aim 3, we wil vaccinate macaques with a novel vaccine approach that delivers SIV antigens simultaneously with viral proteins identified to trigger MHC-E presentation. We will subsequently challenge these animals with low-dose SIV to determine the protective capability of MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells. Successful completion of these studies could define an entirely new approach to inducing universal protective immunity by mobilizing the monomorphic MHC-E molecule."
"8912861","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed three-year project will enhance our understanding of the link between school absences, school absences due to influenza like illness and influenza incidence in the wider community. Our proposal extends an existing set of projects that the co-Investigators of this proposal have conducted on influenza in school-children in the Pittsburgh area in the last 5 years. The Pittsburgh Influenza Prevention Project and the Social Mixing and Respiratory Transmission in Schools project have allowed us to fine tune surveillance systems for absenteeism and respiratory illness in the Pittsburgh area. We have conducted absentee surveillance and performed laboratory investigations of the viral etiology of respiratory illness in over 6000 children over 3 years as part of these two studies. We propose to conduct cause-specific school absence surveillance in three school districts including 11,000 students in and around Pittsburgh, PA. We will include multiple levels of surveillance including web-based surveys targeted broadly, closer follow-up and determination of viral etiology of respiratory infections in a subset of schools and close observation of a sentinel cohort of 250 school children each year. Drawing upon existing methodological work on time series and studies of spatial-temporal patterns of infectious disease, we will develop new statistical models of community metrics of influenza incidence using cause- specific school absence data and other covariates. We have been engaged in research and collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Department and the Pennsylvania Department of Health for several years in a study of influenza dynamics, county and state-wide. These partnerships have gained us access to disaggregate data on the appearance of influenza in the Allegheny county community. The intersection of experience conducting school-based influenza surveillance, developing novel statistical tools to study spatial-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases and long standing relationships with local public health authorities position us extremely well to succeed in this project. Dr. Derek Cummings is the Principal Investigator of this proposal, and each of the co-investigators has extensive experience working and collaborating with him on other research projects. Dr. Zimmer is an infectious disease clinician who has performed studies of the community transmission and burden of influenza in the 2009 pandemic and of influenza in interpandemic periods. Mr. Vukotich has extensive experience in public health project management stemming from 30 years of work at the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) as Assistant Deputy Director. We aim to develop protocols for conducting cause-specific school absence surveillance that can be transported to other populations, develop predictive models of the temporal course of influenza in communities and schools and develop novel statistical methods for prediction."
"9263026","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South America faces a changing epidemiological environment with a mix of endemic and emerging challenges. Past challenges have covered a broad range of ailments moving from SARS to avian and pandemic influenza and dengue hemorrhagic fever. We are now threatened by the imminent emergence of Chikungunya virus, the rise of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Guyana shield and the spread of visceral leishmaniasis in the southern cone. An adequate response to emerging infections requires epidemiologists with advanced research training. However, there are no doctoral programs of international caliber in resource- limited countries like Peru. The NAMRU-6/UPCH/UNMSM/UFMG/JHBSPH/USUHS/CDC consortium proposes to substantially expand our ability to train doctoral-level investigators in a cost-effective and sustainable way, fosterin a new generation of international-caliber scientists. Specifically, we will create a four-year doctorl program in Epidemiology in Peru and will enroll two four-student classes. Additionally, we will reinsert seven PhDs scientists in Peru upon completion of coursework while another seven PhD students/graduates enroll in world-class programs. Our Brazilian partners will prove to be critical for this activity. We will add another 90 graduates from our self-sustainable Epidemiology Masters' program, ~25% conducting infectious diseases research and ~20% working in the public sector. Finally, we will train 200 undergraduate students in short research methods courses or laboratory/field rotations to establish the foundation of a new generation of scientists in Peru who can address the control of emerging and parasitic infections. The viability of our approach is supported by our substantial track record accomplished during our previous awards. We have provided international doctoral training for eight Peruvian scientists and five additional Masters' graduates have started doctoral coursework. Furthermore, we have offered our Masters' program seven years in a row training 184 Latin American students. Our consortium has published 60 papers and our Masters' students have produced 152 papers after graduation, duplicating their rate of articles published per year as compared to before their training. Moving forward, competitive research funding from the Department of Defense will be critical to provide long-term career sustainability to our trainees. Training will take place in a ich environment supported by DoD and NIH collaborations in extensive multi-year research projects. Our proposal is supported by a large pool of highly trained local and foreign mentors, sophisticated laboratories, and diverse field and clinical sites: 45 organizations, 32 PhD scientists residing permanently in Peru and 116 letters of support documents a solid regional collaboration."

"9405274","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to lead a translational research group that investigates the neurogenetic basis of both normal and pathological behavior. To acquire the specific training I will need to achieve this, I propose a project that examines the mechanisms underlying genetic and epigenetic sources of depression risk, as well as their potential interaction. Specifically, I, and my future lab, will investigate how common genetic and epigenetic variation in the serotonin 1a receptor gene (HTR1A) impacts HTR1A gene expression and contributes to both depression risk and anti-depressant drug responsiveness. To directly translate our findings, we will pursue complimentary techniques in post-mortem human tissue and a humanized HTR1A mouse model.  My primary expertise is in mouse behavior, molecular cloning, and transgenic techniques; my career development plan expands on these methods, providing essential new training in epigenetic techniques, experimental use of post-mortem human tissue, and a deeper understanding of psychiatric disorders. Since it is my goal to lead a lab that studies the neurogenetics of behavior and how alterations in gene expression contribute to disease states, my success as an independent researcher depends on these skills. I also propose to further develop my training in translational neuroscience so that I may expand my clinical collaborations. Research Project  Identifying the biological mechanisms underlying both heritable and non-heritable factors that impact depression risk and treatment response is of the utmost importance for designing better therapies and preventative interventions. While substantial evidence from both humans and rodent models has linked variation in serotonin 1a receptor (5-HT1A) levels with depression-related traits, the biological mechanisms underlying differences in receptor expression are not well understood. Preliminary evidence suggests that both rs6295, a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located upstream of the HTR1A gene, and methylation of the HTR1A promoter impact 5-HT1A levels. However, the direct contribution and potential interaction of these putative sources of variation in expression have not been demonstrated. Thus, we here propose to investigate the hypothesis that both epigenetic and genetic variation affect susceptibility to depression and resistance to antidepressants by modulating 5-HT1A levels. To test this, we will first examine the relationship between rs6295 and levels of HTR1A mRNA in post-mortem human brain tissue. Then we will use a humanized mouse model to determine the direct contribution of rs6295 to 5-HT1A levels, depression- related behavior, and antidepressant responsiveness. Using these mice, we will also examine the effects of stress exposure on HTR1A transcription, methylation of the human HTR1A promoter, and behavior. Finally, we will combine these lines of questioning to ask whether rs6295 interacts with stress exposure at a molecular (i.e., epigenetic) and/or behavioral level."
"9349681","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The legalization of marijuana in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington is the most dramatic change in U.S. substance abuse policy since the end of Prohibition. These states are implementing regulatory and enforcement systems for the retail sales of recreational marijuana to adults 21 years or older, akin to state controls on the sale of alcohol. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued directives that it would monitor whether these states implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that among other DOJ priorities, prevented distribution of marijuana to youth. A retail sales intervention that has been effective at reducing illegal alcohol sales to minors (and intoxicated patrons) is alcoholic beverage server training (or Responsible Beverage Service training - RBS). Recently, Colorado enacted a law for incentivized responsible marijuana vendor (RMV) training, Oregon will require RMV training, and Washington proposes to incentivize it. In SBIR Phase I research, our team established the feasibility of creating and evaluating an online RMV training by a) exploring the concept/content of RMV with owners/managers and clerks in retail outlets and state and local regulators and enforcement officials; b) examining under-age sales with owners/managers, clerks, and underage individuals; c) developing and evaluating a prototype RMV training, Way To Tend, in an outline and storyboards and by programming one module with retail outlet personnel and local officials; d) identifying licensed marijuana retail outlets eligible for a randomized trial; and e) estimating current refusal rates of sales of marijuana to minors with a pseudo-patron (PP) buyer assessment. An Expert Advisory Board (EAB) comprised of state and local regulators, licensed retail cannabis sellers, and experts in responsible beverage service from these states confirmed the feasibility of the Way To Tend training. In this SBIR Phase II application, we propose to 1) produce the Way To Tend responsible marijuana vendor (RMV) training presenting retail marijuana sales laws, methods for preventing sales to minors (i.e., ID checking and preventing third party sales), the health effects of marijuana (e.g., driving under the influence; fetal exposure; dosing; and safe storage), and rules of the trade (e.g., tracking and safety procedures and sales to intoxicated patrons) and 2) conduct a randomized trial of Way To Tend in a sample of 150 retail marijuana outlets in Colorado, Oregon and Washington against control outlets who receive usual and customary (UC) training and examine Way To Tend's impact on RMV outcomes (refusals to PP without apparently valid IDs). The long-term objectives of the SBIR research are urgently needed and extremely significant as increased drug availability is linked to marijuana initiation. The proposed research will have a very large impact. Our effective RMV training by a third-party (not the cannabis industry) will be a first-of-its-kind for a highly uniqe circumstance, the first legal U.S. retail marijuana markets. The commercial potential for Way To Tend is untapped and potentially very large, for the market is poised to grow tremendously as more states consider legalization of marijuana."
"9198438","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this research is to understand fundamental neural coding mechanisms in auditory cortex that subserve cortical representations of biologically relevant sounds. We will use the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as our experimental model to address these questions. This model system provides several important advantages over other species, namely, a hearing range similar to that of humans, a rich vocal repertoire, an auditory cortex that lies largely on the lateral surface of the cerebral cortex and a high reproductive rate while in captivity. In this application, we will focus on elucidating neural mechanisms underlying cortical representations of harmonicity and spatial location. Aim 1 will study neural representations of harmonic structures in auditory cortex across the entire hearing frequency range of marmosets in both primary and non-primary auditory cortex. Aim 2 will use intracellular recording and inactivation techniques to investigate cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representations of pitch and harmonicity. Aim 3 will investigate neural representations of spatial location in marmoset auditory cortex using novel stimulation paradigms. Findings from the proposed study will shed light on neural mechanisms responsible for hearing and have implications for understanding how the auditory cortex operates in normal or diseased conditions."
"9229030","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our accurate vision depends on the flow of visual information through precisely wired synaptic connections among axons and dendrites of retinal neurons with unique morphological and functional properties. In the vertebrate retina, each of the six neuronal cell types: ganglion, amacrine, bipolar, horizontal, and rod and cone photoreceptor cells are further divided into subtypes based on location, morphology and function. Of all retinal neurons, amacrine cells are the most diverse group with >30 subtypes being identified so far. They represent ~40% of neurons both in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL), make up a majority of synapses in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and contribute to a majority of visual processing in the retina.  One of the key questions i how the many retinal neuronal subtypes are produced and wired during development. In this proposal, we focus on the amacrine cells associated with the sublaminar layer 3 (S3) of the IPL. The S3 sublamina separates the ON and OFF laminas in the IPL but its cellular makeup and function is poorly understood. Here, we have demonstrated LHX9, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed early in retinogenesis and its expression is tightly confined toa few amacrine cells in the INL and the GCL. In our preliminary study, we have shown that these LHX9+ cells are a subgroup of GABAergic amacrine cells and express GAD67 but not GAD65. LHX9-expressing cells are also LHX2-expressing subgroup of amacrine cells. Targeted deletion of Lhx9 in mice results in a nearly complete loss of these LHX2-expressing amacrine cells and strikingly, in the absence of the S3 sublamina, suggesting that LHX9 could be expressed in and be required for the development of a unique, S3-stratifying amacrine subtype cells. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that bNOS expression is significantly down-regulated in the Lhx9-null retina, suggesting a loss of bNOS-subtype of amacrine cells that are known to project in the S3 sublamina. Being a transcription factor with a known function in neuronal subtype development in the central nervous system, LHX9 likely plays a critic role in amacrine subtype specification and offers us a unique opportunity to ultimately elucidate the genetic pathway governing the formation of the S3 sublamina and its associated neural circuitry. In this proposal, we will fully characterize the subtype identity of these LHX9-expressing amacrine subtypes and will identify its circuitry within the retina. Second, we will analyze the retinal defects of Lhx9-null mutation, particularly the effect on amacrine subtype specification, differentiation of these Lhx9-expressing S3 stratifying amacrine cells, and the change in the functional properties and circuitry of the Lhx9-lineage cells. To elucidate the LHX9 regulatory pathway in the S3-stratifying amacrine cells, we will perform RNA-Seq of control and Lhx9-null retinas and use LHX9 ChIP-Seq to screen for downstream target genes of LHX9 and to identify the transcriptional network. Together, these studies will define the role of LHX9 in regulating the formation and neural circuitry of S3 sublamina and elucidate the transcriptional events that occur downstream of LHX9."
"9273494","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My project will investigate the mechanisms underlying cerebellar growth failure and apply this understanding to medulloblastoma, a tumor of excess cerebellar growth. These two interrelated conditions are both important sources of medical illness in children. Cerebellar development depends on the regulated growth of a population of neuronal precursor cells called cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs). Failure of these cells to expand their population leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, as seen in the congenital disorder Seckel syndrome. In contrast, excessive proliferation of CGNPs predisposes to medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Although mutation of the DNA repair protein ATR is known to cause Seckel syndrome, the mechanism through which ATR deficiency results in neurodevelopmental defects is still not fully understood. The hypo-plastic phenotype of Seckel syndrome, however, suggests that ATR disruption may be exploited in the treatment of the hyper-plastic disorder medulloblastoma. The goal of this Kirschstein-NRSA individual fellowship (F30) project is to delineate why ATR is required for cerebellar growth and whether ATR disruption may be used in medulloblastoma treatment.  I have found that conditional deletion of ATR in the mouse cerebellum causes widespread DNA damage and cell death in CGNPs, resulting in the formation of small, disorganized cerebella. However, the mechanism by which ATR deficiency leads to CGNP damage and death, and consequently cerebellar hypoplasia, is still unclear. My experiments will use tissues and cells from ATR-deficient mice to reveal where in the cell cycle DNA damage accumulates in CGNPs in response to loss of ATR (Specific Aim 1), and how CGNPs die when they lack ATR (Specific Aim 2). Delineating the mechanism by which CGNPs are damaged and die in response to ATR loss will advance the understanding of Seckel syndrome.  CGNP requirement for ATR, as revealed by Seckel syndrome and as seen in ATR-deficient mice, suggests that ATR may be targeted as a novel therapy for medulloblastoma. My preliminary work shows that genetic deletion of ATR during early development in medulloblastoma-prone mice has a profound anti-tumor effect. I thus propose in Specific Aim 3 to determine if deletion of ATR after the point of tumor formation will have a similar anti-tumor effect. My findings will advance cancer treatment by testing the value of targeting ATR in treating medulloblastoma.  The proposed training and research plans outlined in this NIH F30 fellowship application will provide me with outstanding education in the areas of cell physiology, neuroscience, cancer biology, and molecular pharmaceutics, and promote my professional development toward a career as a physician-scientist."
"9229581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and elevated blood lipid levels are the strongest risk factor. The goal of this R01 proposal is to identify genes and genetic variants associated with blood lipid levels to inform our understanding of the biology of lipids and cardiovascular disease and identify new targets for therapies for cardiovascular disease. Our research team combines strengths in cardiovascular disease, high-throughput genetics and genomics and development and application of innovative computational and statistical methods. In Aim 1, we will assess ~40m genetic variants for association in very large samples after imputation from large, sequenced reference panels. We expect to meta-analyze data for ~400,000 individuals. In Aim 2, we will examine coding variation for association with blood lipid levels, with a particular focus on low frequency variation that cannot be imputed well in GWAS cohorts. We anticipate the exome survey will include data for ~300,000 individuals from different ancestries. In Aim 3, we will evaluate rare and novel variation, not reachable using chip or imputation-based approaches, by leveraging exome or whole genome sequence data from 10,000s sequenced samples. In Aim 4, we will examine null alleles in lipid- associated genes we identify in coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction case-control studies, to better understand their role in cardiovascular disease and as potential drug targets. We are leaders in the development and implementation of tools, methods and websites for statistical analysis of genetic data and sharing of study results. Here, we will also develop a web portal to facilitate public sharing, interpretation, and experimental follow-up of results from our genetic discovery aims. Funding this proposal will allow continued effort and co-ordination of the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC). Completion of our aims will provide new insights into disease mechanisms that have the potential to catalyze breakthroughs in prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and may serve as a model for other large-scale genetic studies."
"9240557","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nicotine and alcohol are the most commonly abused recreational drugs, and nicotine dependence and alcoholism have a high degree of comorbidity. For example, an estimated 90% of alcoholics also smoke, and an estimated 60% of smokers engage in binge drinking. The health consequences of alcohol and nicotine abuse are severe, including many types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver damage, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further, these health issues are more severe in individuals who co-abuse these drugs. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the interaction between nicotine and alcohol abuse. This information can then be used to develop treatments specifically designed address the comorbidity of addiction to these drugs. A major problem with both nicotine addiction and alcoholism is the craving and relapse induced by individuals' heightened responsivity to the people, places, and other cues associated with drinking and smoking. In addition, smoking-associated cues can trigger drinking. Preliminary studies demonstrate that nicotine enhances the response alcohol-associated cues, but it is not known whether nicotine's effects on alcohol drinking are secondary to these effects. In addition, the response to many drug-associated cues involves the brain's motivational circuit, including the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex, which affect behavior in complementary ways. It may be through activation of this system that nicotine increases the response to alcohol cues, but to date no studies have examined this possibility. The proposed work will determine whether nicotine increases alcohol intake by increasing the response to alcohol cues within this system, and whether the response to alcohol cues depends upon specific subcircuits within the brain's motivational circuitry. This project will determine th behavioral and neural basis for the ability of nicotine to increase alcohol drinking in rats, by dissociating the effects of cues during specific phases of alcohol drinking, and by measuring and manipulating the activity of neurons with the brain's motivational circuitry. To this end, two sets of experiments will determine 1) which specific aspect of alcohol drinking (including the response to alcohol cues) are affected by nicotine, and 2) which specific projections are necessary and sufficient to engender alcohol cues with motivational value. Findings from this project regarding the specific behavioral and neural points of interaction between nicotine and alcohol will allow for the development of experimental and pharmacological interventions that specifically address the effect of nicotine on alcohol intake."
"9390738","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA viruses represent a third of all emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and are of continual global health concern as major causes of local epidemic and global pandemic outbreaks linked with mild to severe disease. The immune response to RNA viruses is initiated upon the recognition of non-self, viral RNA by the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology (LGP2). LGP2 function is poorly understood.  West Nile Virus (WNV), an RNA Flavivirus, is of particular interest as it represents a viral family with a large global health footprint. WNV is neurotropic and the most common arboviral disease in the United States. It causes severe neuroinvasive disease in a high frequency of infected patients. Importantly, treatment for WNV infection is limited to supportive care because vaccines or antivirals are not available. The proposed studies will use WNV-Texas, the currently US circulating strain, in vitro and in mouse models of infection to study the role of LGP2 in the immunity to infection.  These studies aim to define the role and mechanism of LGP2 modulation of RIG-I and MDA5 following Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) recognition, and functional outcomes of LGP2 modulation in viral control of the important human pathogen, WNV. My central hypothesis is that LGP2 modulates RIG-I and MDA-5 signaling through non-direct mechanisms that dictates the end result of antiviral versus pro- inflammatory signaling after PAMP detection. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims will be investigated: 1) Determine the role of LGP2 in regulating RLR signaling during RNA virus infection; and 2) determine the contributions of each RLR during WNV infection to the overall innate immune profile. In vitro signaling approaches along with ex vivo and in vivo studies will be used to examine LGP2 function and mechanism of action in regulating the other RLRs. Further, mouse knockout models of LGP2 alone or in conjunction with other RLR family members will be utilized to investigate the role of LGP2 in immunity against WNV. The overall innate immune contributions to WNV immunity from LGP2 within the context of the other RLRs will be determined and presented through a computational model synthesizing the data generated in this proposal.  Successfully defining the modulation of RLRs by LGP2 during WNV infection will have major implications in the fields of immunology, and will provide insights on innate immune regulation for possible applications in diverse fields impacted by RLR function including therapeutics, vaccinology, cancer biology, toxicology, and wound repair."
"9322667","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of hospitalization has long been viewed as a major health benefit of the use of influenza vaccine. This was, in large part, the rationale for the initial vaccination programs targeting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.  However, in the last decade, questions have been raised about the value of such programs. Modern study designs to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) have required laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, as well as documentation of vaccine receipt and the use of a test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. There is a need for current estimates of VE in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization using these methods. We propose estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalization in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE in various populations since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at two hospitals, and will enroll adult in-patients with acute respiratory infection. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospitalization. Analyses will use a test- negative design; those testing positive for influenza ar cases, those testing negative are controls. Modifiers and confounders of vaccine effectiveness such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, functional status, frailty, education, tim from illness onset to specimen collection, calendar time, and propensity for vaccination will be assessed. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment, we propose an estimation of the incidence of hospitalization in adults due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV and other respiratory viruses. This will allow for the evaluation of bias in influenza VE assessment due to interaction between influenza vaccination, infection, and non-influenza respiratory viruses, and will establish a platform for the future evaluation of RSV vaccines. We will accomplish these additional objectives by expanding our surveillance to months before and after the typical influenza season and evaluating specimens by molecular methods for RSV and other respiratory viruses."
"9397745","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Burn Association has reported that each year approximately 450,000 burn injuries receive medical treatment in the U.S. Skin burns are classified into 4 grades of severity during triage, which in turn determines their distinct course of clinical treatment. For example, superficial partial-thickness burns can heal spontaneously over a 2- to 3-week period, whereas deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns require excision and surgical skin grafting procedures. However, the accuracy rate of the current clinical assessment technique used to differentiate between burn grades is limited to 64-70%, often necessitating several skin grafting operations per patient over the course of treatment. Non-invasive and highly-accurate assessment of burn wounds can alter the management course, reduce the length of hospital stay and improve the overall recovery of the burn patient, while also reducing the cost of care. Based on our previous empirical observations of the sensitivity of the coherent terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy to the water content of the tissue, as well as to scattering by the density of normal skin structures, we propose the following novel hypothesis: Partial-thickness burns that heal spontaneously in 2-3 weeks will differ significantly in their terahertz signatures from wounds that do not heal. We will address this hypothesis from the following approaches: 1. We will use standardized porcine burn models to determine the efficacy of the THz modality in burn characterization against histological assays. 2. Given the important role of deep dermal structures in the skin regeneration process, we will quantify the intactness and biological viability of cells that are responsible for reepithelialization in the vicinity of hair follicles and sweat glands of each burn using vitality assays. We will test the statistical correlation between this histological measure of skin regeneration and the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurements to determine a potential relationship for burn healing likelihood based on early THz predictions. 3. We will conduct dosimetry and safety studies in normal porcine skin models to establish that exposure to terahertz light is safe for human studies. 4. In collaboration with the Harborview Regional Burn Center at the University of Washington, we will conduct a pilot human study in order to investigate the utility of the terahertz modality in burn assessment during the early post-injury period."
"9232217","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This integrated research and training plan will prepare Dr. Ranney, a fellowship-trained, practicing emergency physician, to become an independently funded physician-researcher with expertise in emergency department (ED)-based mental health interventions. Dr. Ranney's long-term research goal is to become an expert in developing effective, easily-disseminated, technology-augmented mental health interventions for high-risk ED patients. Her short-term goals, for this K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Career Development Award, are to (1) gain expertise in the development and evaluation of technology-augmented ED depression interventions, and (2) to test the hypothesis that a brief in-ED + longitudinal text-message (ED+text) indicated depression prevention intervention is acceptable and feasible for high-risk youth.  Depressive symptoms and peer violence are common, significant, and strongly correlated causes of morbidity, mortality, and ED visits among adolescents. The ED is often the primary source of care for high-risk youth with depressive symptoms and history of peer violence. The ED is well established as a location for mental health intervention, yet few resources are available to high-risk youth. Most adolescent ED patients use text-messaging. Text-message behavioral change has been shown effective. In this project, Dr. Ranney and mentors will develop and pilot a single-session in-ED + 8 week longitudinal text-message program (ED+text) to reduce depressive symptoms, for adolescent ED patients with depressive symptoms and a history of peer violence.  Under the guidance of a strong mentorship team of NIH-funded researchers, Dr. Ranney will achieve five specific training goals: (1) Gain advanced training in ED-based mental health research, focusing on the link between depression and violence; (2) Develop expertise in use of technology, particularly text-messaging, to enhance intervention delivery and evaluation; (3) Become a skilled user of qualitative research methodology to inform intervention development; (4) Learn how to design and conduct a clinical trial of an ED-based depression prevention intervention; (5) Develop skills in longitudinal data analysis for clinical trials.  Dr. Ranney's training activities will be complemented by an innovative research plan allowing practical application of her new skills. Using a staged approach, Dr. Ranney will, first, conduct focus groups to develop our innovative ED+text intervention content; next, refine the intervention through an iterative process of open trials; finally, test the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention through a randomized piot study (n=100).  This work is a crucial step toward preventing depression and co-occurring disorders among a high-risk population that does not typically seek out services. It addresses a current lack of easily-accessible preventive interventions, addressing NIMH Strategic Objectives 3 (treatment development for diverse populations) and 4 (strengthening public health impact), as well as critical Adolescent and Mental Health objectives of Healthy People 2020."
"9441908","The overall goal of this Program remains to understand how basic cellular processes are altered to promote tumor initiation and progression and how such alterations might make tumor cells vulnerable to specific, targeted interventions. Initiated by James Watson in 1968, the program focused on the action of DNA tumor viruses and in many ways powered the molecular biology revolution. Throughout its history, it revealed the underpinnings of basic biological processes central to cancer development and revealed key oncogenic mechanisms affecting their action. Taking advantage of new biological concepts and technologies emerging from its investigators, the Program has continued to innovate and evolve, with an ever greater focus on mechanisms of immediate biological and therapeutic relevance to the human disease. Over the last funding period, the Program produced fundamentally new insights into DNA replication its coordination in normal and cancer cells, and established that aberrant alternative RNA splicing is an important oncogenic mechanism. The Program has been at the forefront of non-coding RNA biology, providing some of the first evidence that microRNAs can act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and influence other key cancer phenotypes. Lastly, the Program has developed and implemented innovative mouse models and used them to identify new oncogenes and tumor suppressors of broad relevance to human cancer. Armed with new technologies developed by Program investigators over the last several years, we will implement a multi pronged approach towards identifying novel oncogenic mechanisms, with an eye towards revealing the vulnerabilities they create. Some elements of the Program are driven from the standpoint of particular cellular processes, such as chromosome replication and segregation or pre-mRNA splicing (Projects 1 and 2), and others implement unbiased approaches informed by changes in the cancer genome or alterations in regulatory networks to focus their studies (Projects 3-5). All Projects converge on potential anticancer targets, whose efficacy can be predicted based upon the nature or state of the cancer cell or its microenvironment. All of the Projects benefit from demonstrable interactions among themselves, taking advantage of complementary approaches and expertise. Moreover, each Project benefits from the four innovative Cores, each of wtiich is lead by outstanding and experienced researchers. Finaily, the Program benefits from, and contributes to, the collaborative environment fostered by the Coid Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center and is at the heart of its activities."
"9276059","?

Despite significant progress in the profiling and quantitation of complex metabolomics mixtures, such as urine, serum, and cancer tissue, by NMR and mass spectrometry, important methodological challenges remain. Some of these challenges are addressed in this proposal, which is divided into four different focus areas. Specifically, it is proposed to (i) develop new approaches to integrate NMR with mass spectrometry for the de novo characterization of unknown metabolites and the more accurate identification of catalogued compounds, (ii) develop and maintain advanced web servers and databases for the reliable, efficient, and user-friendly analysis of metabolomics spectroscopic data, (iii) develop and apply new NMR experiments, and (iv) develop new approaches for sample preparation, including the use of nanoparticles for the simpler and more accurate analysis of a wide range of metabolomics samples. The proposed research will promote the dissemination of metabolomics as a powerful, versatile, and manageable tool to the biomedical scientific community. These activities are expected to lead to a better understanding of a broad range of biological questions from a metabolite perspective for the benefit of human health."
"9238521","Project Summary/Abstract Often called the ?first? hormone of reproduction, the hypothalamic peptide gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is the key and essential endocrine signal that activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and, thus, reproductive function in males and females. Released from axon terminals in the median eminence, GnRH is transported via the hypophyseal portal circulation to the anterior pituitary gland where it binds to high affinity GnRH receptors and stimulates the expression and release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In females, an acute rise in LH is obligatory for inducing ovulation and as such is a mandatory event for reproduction and fertility. Over the last several decades much has been elucidated regarding the key cellular and biochemical events elicited by activation of the GnRH receptor including the identity of intracellular signaling intermediates that underlie changes in gonadotropin gene expression and secretion. Missing, however, has been the development and application of technologies that possess the spatial and temporal resolution necessary for analyzing immediate early events elicited by GnRH in living cells. Such events would include the formation of plasma membrane signaling domains. Recently, we have applied high resolution imaging to demonstrate GnRH-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled to the opening of L-type calcium channels. Calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous signaling molecules that influence cellular processes ranging from neurotransmitter release to apoptosis. The general goal of this proposal is to investigate the poorly understood mechanisms controlling calcium and ROS signaling mechanisms in pituitary gonadotropes. More specifically, this research investigates a novel regulatory mechanism where localized oxidant and calcium signaling microdomains functionally converge in gonadotropes following stimulation of the GnRH receptor. This promotes increased ROS generation and L-type calcium channel activity, increased calcium within the cells, and ultimately changes in gene expression required for ovulation. In this application we propose to test a model where the convergence of calcium and oxidant microdomain signaling is coupled to activation of ERK signaling. We will also investigate the underlying mechanisms regulating this signaling modality. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that subplasmalemmal GnRH-induced calcium and ROS microdomains colocalize and are functionally coupled. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that activated GnRH receptors assemble and form dynamic multi-protein signaling complexes necessary for transduction of colocalized calcium and ROS microdomains to ERK activation Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that actin cytoskeletal dynamics are regulated oxidatively and are essential for GnRH receptor microdomain signaling. The experiments in these Specific Aims will use a combination of voltage-clamp electrophysiology, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, molecular biology, biochemistry, super resolution imaging, and proteomics to examine the structural and function of this local signaling mechanism. The outcome of these experiments will provide mechanistic insights into events underlying gonadotrope function and dysfunction and may lead to the development of new rational approaches for regulating GnRH receptor signaling with respect to fertility and other important health issues such as GnRH receptor-responsive carcinomas."
"9225175","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 10% of the US population currently suffers from asthma. Evidence suggests that early life microbial exposure, both commensal and pathogenic, influences long-term risks for the development and severity of asthma. Studies of asthma in children suggest a role for nontypeable H. influenzae bacteria (NTHi) in the development of disease, as NTHi colonization of the nasopharynx in the first 4 weeks of life is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma by age 5 years. This finding suggests that NTHi infection during a specific window of susceptibility might influence programming of the immune system and establish a trajectory towards a more inflammatory outcome. Thus, prevention of early NTHi colonization might reduce the incidence of childhood asthma. Conversely, there are also data suggesting that early life exposure to specific antigens such as dog and cat dander is correlated with reduced risk of developing asthma later in life. The identification of both early life sensitizing and protective factors against the development of juvenile asthma is the major long-term goal of our research.  Our preliminary data demonstrate that 3-day-old mice intranasally colonized with NTHi were significantly more likely to have exacerbated allergic airways disease in response to juvenile ovalbumin allergen exposure when compared to mice that were treated with saline alone as neonates. We hypothesize that asthma susceptibility is established in an early life window of competitive sensitizing and protective exposures that include NTHi in the neonatal respiratory tract and environmental antigens such ass dog and cat dander. We predict that neonatal NTHi exposure alters a critical immune checkpoint and establishes a trajectory towards juvenile immune and airway hyper-responsiveness upon exposure to common environmental allergens. Aim 1 will compare the immune and airway responses between animals with and without neonatal colonization with NTHi and juvenile sensitization to the major environmental allergens Aspergillus and dust mite Der p 1. Experiments will subsequently identify the window of susceptibility to NTHi immune reprogramming and identify associated post-colonization lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cell immune signatures that predict enhanced juvenile immune responsiveness and airway hyper-responsiveness to the allergen exposures. Aim 2 will determine how cat and dog antigens alter the early life immune checkpoint and juvenile airway hyperreactivity that follows neonatal NTHi colonization. The results of our proposed studies will contribute novel insights into how early life microbial and environmental exposures affect immune set points for childhood and adult disease like asthma."
"9230840","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project addresses neurovascular injury during ischemic retinopathy. While this condition is associated with early neurovascular dysfunction, conventional therapies target clinically significant macula edema or neovascularization, which occur much later. Therapy to prevent/reverse ischemic retinal injury is a critical unmet need. The project goal is to delineate mechanisms of vascular and neuronal injury during retinopathy and identify novel therapeutic strategies. The investigators' studies in models of ischemic retinopathy have revealed that the urea cycle enzyme arginase is critically involved in both vascular and neuronal injury. Arginase metabolizes L-arginine to form proline, polyamines and glutamate. Excessive arginase activity reduces the L-arginine supply for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), causing it to become uncoupled and produce superoxide and less NO. Superoxide and NO react rapidly and form the toxic oxidant peroxynitrite. Glutamate and the catabolic products of polyamine oxidation can induce more oxidative stress and DNA damage, both of which can cause mitochondrial injury and premature senescence. Preliminary data show that neurovascular injury during retinopathy is associated with increased arginase expression/activity, decreased NO, polyamine oxidation, increased formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite, mitochondrial injury and premature senescence. Furthermore, the cytosolic isoform arginase 1 (A1) is implicated in premature senescence and dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells (EC), whereas the mitochondrial isoform arginase 2 (A2) appears to be involved in neuronal dysfunction/injury. Thus, it is hypothesized that activation of the arginase pathway causes neurovascular injury by uncoupling NOS and inducing polyamine oxidation and glutamate formation, thereby reducing NO and increasing oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, EC senescence and vascular and neuronal dysfunction. Aim 1 will use animal and tissue culture models to test whether (A) limiting A1 expression will prevent vascular dysfunction by blocking NOS uncoupling, reducing oxidative stress and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence of ECs; (B) limiting A2 expression will prevent neuronal injury by blocking polyamine oxidation and glutamate formation, reducing oxidative stress and preventing mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction. Aim 2 will determine the effects on neurovascular dysfunction and injury of novel therapies designed to limit arginase activity, restore NO availability and reduce oxidative stress. Innovation: This application will, for the firt time, investigate the role of arginase in retinal neurovascular injury. The studies will use molecular approaches to manipulate A1 and A2 expression in combination with real-time vascular imaging, electroretinography and morphometric analyses of neuronal and vascular injury. Therapeutic effects of limiting arginase activity and increasing NO will also be tested. Th research is expected to significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of retinal neurovascular injury and facilitate development of novel strategies for prevention and treatment of ischemic retinopathy."
"9209220","CORE D: MITOCHONDRIAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION ? SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent findings of this PO1 revealed that treatment of aged mice with the mitochondria-targeted peptide (SS- 31) conferred rapid rejuvenation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, suggesting that SS-31 increases intrinsic mitochondrial plasticity by increasing the capacity of the mitochondrial ETC to produce more ATP at times of increased metabolic demands or decreased fuel supply. The mechanism by which SS-31 increases mitochondrial plasticity is not completely understood, although recent work the Program Project and this Core has now shown that these peptides target the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) because of their high affinity for cardiolipin (CL). By modifying the interaction of CL and cytochrome c (cyt c), SS peptides protect the hexacoordination of the heme Fe to optimize electron transport (ET) and minimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. As a result, the SS peptides prevent oxidative stress in the mitochondrial inter membrane space (IMS). The goal of this Mitochondrial Structure and Function Core is to assist all Projects in the PO1 to demonstrate that protection of mitochondrial structure by the SS peptides at the level of cristae architecture and cytochrome c (cyt c) heme ligation can reduce mitochondrial aging in the heart, skeletal muscle and retina. The major services provided by this Core include: Aim 1 is to provide ultrastructural and protein characterization of age and high fat diet-mediated changes in cristae architecture and composition, and protection by SS peptides. Aim 2 is to provide characterization of age- and high fat diet-mediated changes in cyt c heme structure, and protection by SS peptides. This will include providing the resources to assist all Projects in determining the extent of oxidative stress in the mitochondrial IMS and working with Core B to obtain mass-spectrometry confirmation of these oxidized proteins. Aim 3 is to provide methods for studying mitochondrial electron transport chain structures. This will include methods for identifying supercomplexes in mitochondria from retina, heart and skeletal muscles using 2-D native blue gels/SDS gel electrophoresis and specific antibodies for the individual respiratory complex proteins. In summary, this Core will determine if structural changes in mitochondrial cristae and cyt c heme ligation play a role in the inhibition of ET and increase in ROS emission associated with aging. The SS peptides will provide evidence to support the importance of repairing mitochondrial structure in order to restore cellular bioenergetics and allow for repair of cellular structure and function."
"9241435","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Control of gene expression in space and time plays an important role in enabling cells to know where they are in the developing embryo and what to become, a process often referred to as cellular specification. Decades of research have demonstrated numerous layers of regulation in control of gene expression, at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, which coordinate this process. Translational contro of gene expression has, on the contrary, received less experimental attention. Most notably, the prevailing dogma is that at the level of protein production, the ribosome -although an immensely complex molecular machine- possesses a constitutive rather than regulatory function in translating mRNAs. Our findings unexpectedly reveal that fundamental aspects of embryonic development and tissue patterning are instead controlled by a highly regulatory function of the ribosome. Importantly, we have shown that specialized ribosomes harboring a unique protein composition or activity confer tremendous specificity to how the mammalian genome is decoded into proteins. Our recent studies have also begun to elucidate how expression information encoded within the mRNA template confers gene regulatory potential by the ribosome to guide embryonic development. In particular, our research has identified novel RNA regulons embedded within the 5'UTRs of key developmental regulators, such as entire subsets of Homeobox (Hox) genes, which direct how gene products are translated in time and space to pattern the mammalian body plan. These findings transform our understanding of gene regulation and open a new portal of understanding into an additional layer of regulation embedded within vertebrate 5'UTRs vital to control of cell specification, tissue patterning, and embryonic development. In this proposal we will undertake a highly multidisciplinary approach to characterize this novel regulatory code for translational control of key developmental transcripts that primes them for post- transcriptional regulation. In Aim1 we will characterize a novel post-transcriptional circuitry required for control of Hox gene expression in time and space. In particular, we will undertake a multi-faceted genetic approach to uncover the functional roles of novel 5'UTR RNA Regulons including IRES-like and TIE elements in multiple Hox genes 5'UTRs towards key aspects of their expression in vivo and patterning of the vertebrate embryo. In Aim2 we will characterize the TIE element, a newly identified RNA regulatory element with remarkable potential to functionally specialize the translation of the mammalian genome. In Aim3 we will more broadly define the impact of RNA binding proteins on IRES-mediated translational control of key vertebrate developmental regulators. Together, these studies will open a new portal of understanding into the grammatical rules facilitated by unique RNA elements embedded within vertebrate 5'UTRs, which serves to expand developmental gene expression programs guiding organismal development."
"9286314","ABSTRACT  In 2013, 42,440 adults in the U.S. were diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), the majority at late stages, with an estimated five-year survival of 50% and a high rate of recurrence. Among those who survive, surgery and chemoradiotherapy leave patients with long-term pain, disfigurement, and disability that further add to the burden of the disease. Each year, OPCs are responsible for ~10,000 deaths, 130,000 years of potential life lost, and ~$3 billion in productivity loss. Earlier OPC diagnoses increase likelihood of single- modality treatment, lower the risk of mortality, decrease medical expenditures, and improve quality of life.  HPV causes ~70% of OPCs in the US, with the proportion of OPCs due to HPV increasing each year. Incidence rates of HPV-related OPCs are also ~3-fold higher in males compared to females. While there is substantial literature regarding the natural history of genital HPV infection and progression to cervical cancer, little has been published on the natural history of oral HPV infection, thus limiting the development of OPC prevention interventions. Unlike cervical and anal cancers, no screening tests are available for OPC, nor have current HPV vaccines been evaluated for efficacy against these cancers. Therefore, in this grant application we propose to study oral HPV natural history through an established prospective cohort of average risk men, information urgently needed to inform the development of future prevention strategies, including clinically relevant screening tools. The HIM Study is the only male prospective study that has the cohort infrastructure and archived oral specimens to fill this critical research void.  The overall goal of this research is to define the natural history of oral HPV infection to inform future development of OPC prevention and screening interventions. The central hypothesis is that viral, host, and behavioral factors are predictive of oral HPV infections that are most likely to persist ?12 months (surrogate cancer endpoint), infections most likely to progress to cancer. We will estimate incidence and duration of oral HPV infections and associated factors. Novel viral (viral methylation, integration, variants), host (methylation), and behavioral (tobacco use, oral hygiene and health, sexual behavior,) factors will be evaluated in relation to oral HPV natural history. The proposed research is innovative, as it will be the first to prospectively address fundamental questions related to oral HPV natural history. Our study builds on an existing large data and biological specimen repository to efficiently address timely and significant questions identifying markers of infection that have utility for the design of future HPV-OPC screening/prevention interventions. Our transdisciplinary team of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, oncologists, and virologists has the experience and expertise to successfully implement the proposed study."
"9287227","Project Summary This research project will test the hypothesis that, in the diabetic milieu, S100A9 induces the calcification potential of macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), precursors of microcalcifications, contributing to the biomechanical instability of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. S100A9, a recently identified biomarker of vulnerable plaques, increases in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes, is expressed by macrophages, and is a component of EV. Our published studies linked macrophages and calcification, and showed that macrophages can release EV with a high calcification potential. The present study will explore further the role of proinflammatory macrophages in vascular calcification in diabetes. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis in vitro that diabetic milieu promotes macrophage activation and accelerates release and mineralization of S100A9?enriched EV. These experiments will involve innovative methods for detection of EV microcalcifications and macrophage phenotypes, including density dependent scanning electron microscopy (DDSEM) combined with elemental analysis, high-resolution microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, 3D-hydrogel system, proteomics, single cell RNA sequencing, and network analyses. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis in vivo that S100A9 mediates diabetes-induced microcalcifications in atherosclerotic plaques. We expect that i) genetic deletion of S100A9, ii) macrophage-targeted siRNA silencing of S100A9, and iii) bone marrow transplantation from S100A9-deficient mice will retard the progression of microcalcification and subsequent rupture, as determined by molecular imaging and comprehensive histopathological analyses. Specific Aim 3 will quantitatively evaluate the impact of microcalcification on the biomechanical instability of the atherosclerotic plaque, using mathematical modeling and finite element analysis. These complementary studies will advance the field by identifying the role of macrophage S100A9 in microcalcification. To facilitate clinical translation of mouse data, we will employ human primary macrophages and atherosclerotic plaque specimens from patients with diabetes. The findings from this project will help to develop much needed anti-calcification therapies."
"9354023","Disassembly of the cone-shaped HIV-1 capsid after virus-cell fusion is a prerequisite for establishing a life-long infection. This step in HIV-1 entry, referred to as uncoating, is critical yet poorly understood. We have recently developed a novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 uncoating that is based on a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of a capsid-binding host protein cyclophilin A (CypA-DsRed). CypA-DsRed, which is specifically packaged into virions through the high-avidity binding to the HIV-1 capsid, does not compromise the infectivity. This probe remains associated with cores after virus-cell fusion and is released upon uncoating. Supporting this notion is our finding that the rate of CypA-DsRed loss from individual post-fusion cores is modulated by mutations affecting the core stability and is accelerated by reverse transcription. The CypA-DsRed based imaging assay revealed a biphasic kinetic of HIV-1 uncoating, with a large number of cores shedding the capsid protein shortly after fusion. This assay also revealed marked differences in the uncoating phenotype in HeLa-derived cells and primary human macrophages. We propose to: (1) delineate CypA-DsRed interactions with HIV-1 core through functional and structural studies of CypA-DsRed/capsid complexes; (2) elucidate the relationship between reverse transcription and single core uncoating; and (3) investigate regulation of HIV-1 uncoating by host factors, such as Nup358 and CPSF6. These studies, employing a combination of genetic, biochemical and advanced imaging tools, are expected to provide critical insights into the dynamics and regulation of HIV-1 uncoating in living cells."
"9327325","Project Summary While cancer has traditionally been viewed as a disease process based on genetic aberrations, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic alterations play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of many types of cancer. One emerging epigenetic driver of cancer is the super-enhancer, which is defined as a series of traditional enhancers in close physical proximity that determine cell state and cell identity. Super- enhancers define cell state, are associated with genes that control cell type specific biology, and are enriched for disease-associated genetic variation. Super-enhancers identified from cancer cells identify tumor- associated genes in glioblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and multiple myeloma. Because of the close association between super-enhancer structure and biological function, study of the alterations in disease- specific super-enhancers may reveal insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor, with poor responses to all therapeutic modalities despite intensive research. One major contributor to the poor prognosis of glioblastoma is the presence of cancer stem cells. These self-renewing tumor cells play a role in resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, as well as maintenance of tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis. Because of these features, cancer stem cells have become an important target for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. To better understand key regulators of glioma stem cell identity, an original super-enhancer screen identified genes that are epigenetically upregulated in glioma stem cells and for which elevated expression is associated with poor patient prognosis. This approach revealed lipid metabolism pathways and specifically the gene ELOVL2, which is a lead candidate for further evaluation. Cancer cells utilize aberrant metabolic processes to drive increased proliferation and altered signaling. While lipid metabolism has been implicated in the process of oncogenesis, the precise functions of ELOVL2 have not been defined in cancer. The first aim will define the role of ELOVL2 in glioma cell survival, self-renewal capacity, and tumor formation in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The second aim will investigate the transcription factor network that regulates the expression of ELOVL2 including enhancer elements, transcription factor occupancy, and super-enhancer structure. These approaches will lead to a greater understanding of the epigenetic features that define the glioma stem cell state and inform the development of novel therapeutics."
"9327424","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The loss of skeletal muscle mass is characteristic of inactivity-, disease-, and age-related conditions and negatively affects whole muscle function and quality of life. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms of muscle fiber size maintenance and growth is important for guiding interventions and therapeutics. In response to short-term loading (two weeks), muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are not necessary for hypertrophy in adult mice. However, after long-term loading (eight weeks), the absence of satellite cells results in robust expansion of the cytosolic area that myonuclei govern (myonuclear domain), excessive extracellular matrix deposition, and blunted muscle fiber growth. Whether compromised growth is a consequence of fibrosis or a lack of myonuclear addition mediated by the loss of satellite cells is presently uncertain. To understand the role of satellite cells during prolonged muscle hypertrophy, our laboratory recently developed the Pax7-N-WASp mouse. Inducible depletion of N-WASp specifically in satellite cells inhibits their ability to fuse into a muscle fiber and contribute a nucleus during hypertrophy. However, their presence and activation during growth can regulate extracellular matrix accumulation. This mouse model will elucidate whether limiting fibrosis promotes muscle fiber growth in the absence of myonuclear accretion. Furthermore, the ability to prevent satellite cell fusion in vivo will allow for exploration into whether satellite cells communicate with muscle fibers in the absence of fusion. The findings from this proposal will provide fundamental information on the necessity of satellite cells during adult skeletal muscle hypertrophy and potentially define new roles for satellite cells independent from fusion into muscle fibers."
"9259828","Chlamydia is a genus of intracellular bacteria that infects hundreds of millions of people world-wide. C. trachomatis is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infection and the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. Additional human pathogens include C. pneumoniae, which causes community-acquired pneumonia, and the zoonotic agent, C. psittaci. Chlamydia species are also important sources of veterinary disease. The Chlamydia Basic Research Society is the primary scientific organization representing researchers studying Chlamydia biology and pathogenesis. It organizes the preeminent international basic science Chlamydia meeting, held every two years in a city in the U.S. Seven previous meetings have brought together an average of 266 attendees from as many as 17 countries. From the beginning, the Society has had a major goal of organizing the biennial meeting as an affordable forum that investigators would attend together with many of their students and post-doctoral fellows. Registration fees for trainees have been kept down by carefully negotiating low hotel and facility costs, and raising funds from outside sources including NIH. As a consequence, the meeting stands out for its very high participation rate of trainees (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and a few undergrads), who have made up 45% of attendees. 62% of the talks at the 2015 meeting were given by trainees, emphasizing the Society?s commitment to giving young Chlamydia scientists the opportunity to present and discuss their work at the meeting. The 2017 Chlamydia Basic Research Society meeting will be held in Charlotte, NC in April 2017. This proposal seeks support to underwrite the travel expenses of students and post-doctoral fellows so that they can attend this meeting. The specific aims of the 2017 meeting will be 1) to encourage and promote basic research in chlamydial biology and pathogenesis, 2) to provide a forum for the exchange of information among scientists engaged in research on basic chlamydial biology, pathogenesis and vaccine development, and 3) to promote the development of young scientists."
"9379693","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tendons are dense, load-bearing tissues that transmit muscle forces to the skeleton. Upon traumatic injury or degeneration, load-bearing function is frequently compromised due to poor intrinsic healing that is dominated by fibrotic scar formation. Despite tremendous interest, the biology of tendon healing remains poorly defined and many of the cell and molecular factors that mediate these events have not been identified. One major signaling pathway with high therapeutic potential for tendon is TGF?, which has been implicated in multiple aspects of tendon cell biology including development, regeneration, and fibrosis. Despite the importance of TGF? signaling, the mechanisms by which TGF? may drive these divergent processes remain unknown, which has limited effective therapeutic application. Therefore, the goal of our proposal is to distinguish the tenogenic vs. fibrotic functions of TGF? signaling in the context of injury using a novel model of neonatal regenerative healing and a model of adult fibrotic healing. Using inducible mouse technology which enables cell-specific targeting and temporal control of gene recombination, we will determine the role of TGF? (Aim 1) and downstream Smad (Aim 2) signaling in the specific cell populations that drive healing. Aim 3 will use a tissue engineering platform to determine whether limitations in adult tendon healing are due to poor intrinsic tenogenic capacity and identify potential Non-Smad mediators of tenogenesis. Successful completion of this project will uncover the tenogenic vs. fibrotic requirements for TGF? and Smad signaling, which will ultimately enable the development of targeted cell therapies modulating TGF? signaling to enhance tendon differentiation while attenuating fibrosis."
"9243117","PROJECT SUMMARY Succesful implantation requires a receptive uterine endometrium. Any flaws in uterine endometrial receptivity can lead to implantation defects or failure. Currently, we have no clear answers for how the uterine endometrium achieves its receptivity, or how endometrial receptivity can be predicted or controlled. In this regard, the discovery of endometrial receptivity and non-receptivity markers offers a great promise. Implantation in primiparous or multiparous rodents only occurs in between two nodular (inter-nodular) areas, but not at nodular areas created at placental ejection sites after the end of pregnancy. This uterine region- based implantation strategy in parous mice could be due to loss of endometrial receptivity at the nodular, but not at the inter-nodular endometrium. These two dissimilar functional regions of the same uterine horn of parous mice offer an entirely new approach to discover morphological criteria and/or molecules pivotal to induce uterine nonreceptivity and/or receptivity. Thus, the goal of this application is to 1) demonstrate whether uterine receptive and non-receptive states can be discerned by morphological criteria of uterine luminal epithelial cells and/or vascular architecture, and 2) identify the molecule(s) whose upregulation or downregulation and/or no expression makes the uterine nodular sites, but not the inter-nodular sites, unsuitable for blastocyst implantation. Our working hypothesis is that morphological criteria and/or genes that are unique to either nodular or inter-nodular areas on day 4 of pregnancy could serve as excellent indicators for either poor or optimal uterine receptivity, respectively. Two Specific Aims will be pursued in primiparous (Para 1) mice on day 4 (the day of uterine receptivity) of their 2nd pregnancy to fulfill our goal. Specific Aim 1 will assess luminal epithelial surface morphology and blood vessels distribution changes at the nodular and inter-nodular uterine areas. Specific Aim 2 will discover molecule(s) responsible for uterine receptivity and/or non-receptivity by comparing genomic profiles of uterine tissues or cells from the nodular and inter-nodular areas over a period of time when uterine transition from the non-receptive state to the receptive state occurs. We will use multiple experimental approaches including scanning electron microscopy, laser captured microscopy, corrossion casting, punch biopsy, RNA- Sequencing, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry to acomplish our goals. The outcome of our studies will provide useful information for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools that can be used for detection, prevention and treatment of female reproductive disorders, and improve technologies for assisted reproduction and contraception."
"9256604","Project Summary/Abstract  RNA editing is an evolutionarily conserved form of RNA processing that expands the functionality of the transcriptome. The most prevalent example is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing wherein adenosine is chemically modified by enzymes to form inosine. The advent of sequencing-based methods has reignited interest in the RNA editing field, which has revealed a large number of previously unknown, edited sites. For example, a recent study identified close to 20,000 A-to-I sites in the human brain transcriptome, many of which were found on repetitive sequences. More studies have shown clinical correlations between A-to-I edited RNA and the onset of cancer and other diseases such as ALS. Surprisingly, we still know very little about how, why and where they happen due to a lack of tools for studying this important modification. Using innovative imaging techniques, we will visualize and quantify these events using oligonucleotide-based RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) in single cells to reveal the localization and mechanism of RNA editing. Ultimately, we believe that the addition of spatial and temporal information for this processing will increase the understanding of this important biological process and its role in gene expression. We have already validated a FISH-based method that can discriminate adenosines from inosines on glutamate receptor 2, a well-validated, partially edited mRNA for which editing results in an important neuronal phenotype. This proposal outlines the next steps for which we will utilize this new tool to explore the subcellular localization of edited transcripts. In the first aim, we will explore the translocation of edited transcripts in response to cellular stress. In aim two, we will characterize the cell-to-cell variability of A-to-I editing in single-cells. Finally, we will explore the role of hyper-edited Alu sequences in regulating the subcellular localization of the transcripts they are inserted in. Successful completion of these aims will provide an important tool for visualizing A-to-I edited transcripts in single cells, and define changes in subcellular localization of RNA as a function of editing. ."
"9231388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for the vast majority of skin infection in humans, which corresponds to 14 million outpatient visits and nearly 500,000 hospital admissions per year in the U.S. Moreover, the epidemic of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections in the past 2 decades has become a serious public health concern, as virulent and multi-drug resistant strains are causing severe and recurrent skin infections in healthy people outside hospital settings. If future immunotherapies and vaccines are to provide an alternative to antibiotics, understanding the cutaneous host defense mechanisms that protect against S. aureus skin infections is essential. In humans, patients with loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (i.e., hyper-IgE syndrome patients [HIES]) have a deficiency of circulating T helper 17 cells (Th17 cells) and suffer from recurrent S. aureus skin infections. These findings suggest that STAT3 and Th17 cells are important for immune protection against S. aureus skin infections in humans. The role of STAT3 in Th17 responses complex as cytokines that signal via STAT3 (IL-6, IL-23) are thought to promote the generation of Th17 cells (as well as Th22 and IL-17/IL-22-producing ?? T cells) and effector cytokines that signal via STAT3 (IL-6, IL-21 and IL-22) are produced by these cells. Therefore, we used an in vivo mouse model of a CA-MRSA in conjunction with STAT3 cre/lox conditional knockout mice to investigate STAT3-mediated responses among resident skin cells, trafficking of immune cells (including neutrophil recruitment/abscess formation that is crucial for immunity against S. aureus infections) and the development of T cell responses. In our preliminary data, we found that deletion of STAT3 in T cells and especially in keratinocytes resulted in markedly impaired S. aureus bacterial clearance. The host defense role of STAT3 in keratinocytes is a novel finding because it provides an explanation for the contradiction of why S. aureus infections are confined to the skin in HIES patients despite the presence of a systemic deficiency in Th17 cells. Based on these findings, our overall hypothesis is that STAT3 signaling in keratinocytes and T cells interact to promote antimicrobial peptide production, neutrophil recruitment and generation of IL-17/IL-22-producing ?? T cells and Th17/Th22 cells for optimal host defense against S. aureus skin infections. This study has three aims. Aim 1 will evaluate the host defense role of STAT3 in keratinocytes, Aim 2 will evaluate the differential role of STAT3 in T cell subsets, and Aim 3 will evaluate the host defense role of STAT3 in human skin grafts and keratinocytes against S. aureus. The insights gained in this proposal will provide more effective immune mechanisms to target in the future development of immunotherapies and vaccines against S. aureus skin infections in humans."
"9264933","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone loss affects millions of patients in the United States annually and can be caused by traumatic injury, inflammatory and infectious diseases, congenital malformation or oncologic resection. Conventional treatment often involves using autologous or allograft bone tissues, which is limited by donor site morbidity, insufficient donor tissue supply, and potential immunogenicity. Stem cell-based therapy offers a promising approach for the repair of bone loss such as cranial and long bone defects. However, a critical barrier to progress in the field is the lack of suitable cell carriers that can support stem cell survival, and guide vascularized and mineralized bone formation in situ without the addition of supraphysiological concentration of growth factors. To address the above challenges, my proposed multidisciplinary approach aims to validate the efficacy of microribbon-based scaffolds as a novel type of cell carrier for enhancing stem cell survival and mineralized bone matrix deposition in vivo using a mouse critical size cranial defect model. Our µRB- like hydrogels were fabricated by wet-spinning gelatin (digested collagen), the most abundant ECM matrix protein, into µRB-like structures, which can be crosslinked into a macroporous scaffold. The resulting hydrogels combine the injectability and cell-encapsulation ability of standard hydrogels with the macroporosity that facilitates faster vascular ingrowth, cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and ECM deposition. This injectable system empowers minimally invasive surgery for a broad range of diseases. In our preliminary studies, µRB-based matrices markedly enhanced the survival of human adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and accelerated tissue regeneration in vivo. Here I propose to further enhance the osteoinductivity and osteoconductivity of µRB-like hydrogels by tuning µRB stiffness, bulk stiffness and hydroxyapatite coating. I hypothesize that osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in microribbon-based scaffolds can be enhanced by increasing the µRB stiffness and hydroxyapatite coating of microribbons. Furthermore, I hypothesize that increasing bulk stiffness of the scaffold will result  in reduced matrix deposition due to decreasing pore size. Overall, the macroporosity of microribbon-based scaffolds would lead to enhanced cell survival, faster vascularization and enhanced bone tissue formation in vivo compared to convention biomaterials. The outcomes of the proposed work would lead to the development of new tissue engineering therapy for treating craniofacial and other large bony defects, and correspondingly reduce the associated socio-economical burden on society."
"9242639","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to discover the cortical computations embodied in the responses of neurons in ventral visual area V2. Since V2 is heavily dependent on input from V1 for its visual responsiveness, we will develop a two-stage model, in which responses are constructed from a suitable combination of V1 afferents, with the design of each stage following a common canonical form. This model is intended to account for the visual response properties of neurons as economically as possible, while not necessarily reflecting the details of neuronal circuitry. This simplicity is deliberate, as it will allow the mdel to be fit to data recorded from single neurons, and, when assembled into a population, to predict perceptual capabilities. The motivation for the structure of the model, and our confidence in its success, comes from the convergence of three strands of previous work: (1) we have developed, fit, and validated a similar two-stage model for neuronal responses in area MT, a dorsal stream area which also receives primary afferent drive from area V1; (2) we have developed a two-stage model for visual texture representation that captures perceptually recognizable structures of natural images using spatial integration regions matched in size to those of V2 cells. We've shown that images synthesized to have matching model responses are indistinguishable to human observers; and (3) we've obtained preliminary data indicating that most of V2 cells respond more vigorously to synthetic texture stimuli than to spectrally matched noise stimuli, whereas V1 cells do not. The research is divided into three parts. First, we will gather electrophysiological data to dissect those model-generated features that underlie the increased responsiveness of V2 to texture stimuli. We will, in parallel, gather evidence for the increased responsiveness using fMRI, which will allow us to compare simultaneously measured responses averaged over neural populations in V1 and V2. Second, we will develop a physiologically plausible instantiation of the texture model and develop the methods to fit it to data from single neurons. Finally, we will link the novel functional response properties we have discovered to perception by simultaneously measuring neuronal responses and perceptual judgments in awake behaving macaques. To explore sensitivity to naturalistic features, we will relate psychometric and single-neuron neurometric functions, and use choice probability to link responses to behavioral performance."
"9258955","Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is a serious public health problem for the Southwestern United States and all who visit there. A small proportion of infections result in progressive, debilitating, even life-threatening illness (disseminated coccidioidomycosis or DCM). All evidence suggests that this heightened susceptibility is due to differences in immunologic responses of the patient, clearly understood in overtly immunodeficient persons (i.e., those with AIDS) but not understood for the large majority of otherwise healthy patients with DCM. The NIAID intramural PI (Dr. Steven Holland) has identified inheritable gene mutations in a few patients each of which are associated with DCM. He has also found additional patients with DCM to have rare gene variants possibly producing deleterious consequences. These discoveries provide clues to the pathways that might be deregulated in other patients with DCM but who do not have such readily identifiable genetic alternations. This project builds on the ongoing collaboration between Dr. Holland and Dr. John Galgiani, University of Arizona (UA) Director of the Valley Fever Center for Excellence, to maintain a referral path for subjects living in Arizona to the existing program at the NIH Clinical Center. This work will better define the functional consequences of the Mendelian mutations that Dr. Holland has identified and how those differences permit DCM to occur. A second aim is to analyze gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with DCM not associated with Mendelian mutations in comparison to persons who control coccidioidal infection without becoming ill. Such comparisons may identify dysregulated patterns of response and suggest which putatively deleterious variants in such patients might be responsible. A third aim is to genetically introduce Mendelian mutations associated with human DCM (such as one found by Dr. Holland in STAT4) into a mouse strain normally resistant to coccidioidal dissemination to determine if such mutations result in increased DCM. If so, we can also discover whether it is possible to prevent DCM in the transfected mice by immunization. The murine studies will use containment facilities available at the UA and not currently available at the NIH. As a result of this work, it may be possible to identify persons who, if infected, will develop DCM. Also, our findings may suggest new approaches to therapy or preventative vaccines."
"9229081","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Middle school (MS), when students enter adolescence, is perhaps the most critical educational point at which to engage them in science education and attune their dreams to careers in science; however, several obstacles make this transition difficult. The extant literature and our long-term interactive partnerships with teacher identify three important barriers that can limit the effectiveness of MS science education. 1) Teachers often lack sufficient content knowledge in their area of science to effectively teach their students. This is compounded as science is rapidly evolving, requiring teachers to engage in significant professional development to keep pace with knowledge changes. 2) MS teachers typically have little experience in biomedical professions, and thus, they and their students lack a full understanding of how science education translates into meaningful careers. 3) While inquiry-based education is clearly the most effective educational method to create and sustain excitement in students about science, many teachers, especially those in underserved schools, utilize traditional didactic teaching methods they feel maintain classroom order. If teachers are to excite students about science, they need practical lessons, assistance and practice in classroom management. SEEC will address all three issues through teacher education and the creation of modules that will form an effective bridge to allow students and parents to realize the very exciting biomedical careers to which science education can lead. Twelve MS science teachers each year will be enrolled in a summer science careers Boot Camp. Each day the camp will focus on an area of State Science Standards in which the area students are historically deficit. Each session starts content deepening information, delivered by a scientist working in that biomedical-related field. Teachers will then conduct an inquiry-based, participatory experiment that uses the tools of that career to answer a scientific question. Teachers will also receive training in classroom management and individual learning styles and will create inquiry-based experiences that will address the science deficiency and excite students about science career opportunities. All of the teachers will then continue to learn through teaching and research internships (academia and/or biomedical businesses) and in the classroom using modules they develop. The program will also include Science Fair Overnighters to prepare students to be competitive in science and a Biomedical Jobs Fair for the students and parents to learn about science careers. The Intellectual Merit of this project wil be to enhance teacher development by providing up-to-date knowledge of science content, exposure to biomedical scientists and training in participatory science experiments and classroom management thus enabling them to excite MS students about biomedical science education and position them for competitive biomedical careers.. The broader impacts will include the translation and testing of a science education model and the creation of experience that integrate NIH biomedical science research into MS education."
"9209951","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding how modular taper junctions behave in vivo, as indicated by the recent resurgence of problems with modular taper junctions in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Specifically, the topography of the trunnion and head taper surfaces, in the form of circumferential machining marks, is suspected to play a role. Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem because until it is filled, knowledge of how to improve modular junctions remains largely incomprehensible. The long term goal is to determine trunnion-head taper surface topography combinations that minimize micromotion in vivo and allow for the greatest forgiveness during assembly, thereby reducing the potential for fretting and corrosion. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationship between surface topography and implant stability after assembly and cyclic loading and identify target best surface topographies for modern THAs. The central hypothesis is that surface topographies with shallower, more widely spaced machining marks will have higher pull-off loads and turn-off torques after assembly, less micromotion under cyclical loading, and less severe damage on retrieved implants. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that, determining the surface topography that minimizes micromotion will result in improved modular junctions, reducing implant failure. The central hypothesis will be tested under three specific aims: 1) Characterize trunnion- head taper surface topographies, global implant dimensions, and damage patterns of retrieved THAs; 2) Determine the factor most important for initial implant stability and later stability during cyclic loading by performin a parametric FEA of trunnion-head taper surface topography, load, implant global geometry, and material; and 3) Experimentally test both initial stability and stability under cyclic loading of trunnion-head taper topography combinations identified as ideal using FEA. Under aim 1, retrieval analysis will be used to identify ranges of implant characteristics consistent with grade of damage for evaluation with FEA. FEA will be used to achieve aim 2 to determine the surface topography that results in highest pull-off force and turn-off moment and lowest micromotion under cyclical loading. Experimental testing will be performed in aim 3 of the FEA identified best topographies. The approach is innovative because of the novel multi-scale FEA approach which links a global THA model to the local surface topography to determine how the local surface topography affects the entire implant. As a consequence, new strategies for reducing fretting and corrosion of modular taper junctions are expected to result. The proposed research is significant because it is the first step towards determining how to decrease fretting and corrosion in modular taper junctions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to advance both FEA and experimental design and help reduce the growing burden of TKA revision surgery in the United States."
"9458354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to request a further five years of support for an Institutional National Research Service Award (years 21-25) to support multidisciplinary postdoctoral training focused on the neurobiological aspects of substance abuse with a strong focus on neuroimaging as well as in molecular and familial genetics. We request support for six postdoctoral (3 MDs and 3 PhDs) fellows. The fellowship will usually last 3 years for MDs and 2 years for PhDs. Fellows with a wide variety of backgrounds will be recruited including; Psychology, Psychiatry, Genetics, Medicine, Anthropology, Sociology, Biology, and Neuroscience. The primary research training experience is the apprenticeship model - conduct of supervised research under the tutelage of one or more preceptors who are established researchers and experienced mentors. The trainee's work is usually focused on a single but broad ranging research project developed jointly by the preceptor and trainee. Mentored research takes up approximately 70%-80% of the trainee's effort. The remainder of the training program is made up of lectures, seminars, reading courses, individual tutorials and, where needed, formal didactic course work available in our graduate and medical school. Tutorials in neurobiology, genetics and epidemiology are tailored for trainees with specific interests that may or may not fall into their major area of focus. To arrang these tutorials, the program coordinator and preceptor identify areas of specific interest and set up the tutorial for the trainees with one of our preceptors or tutors who best meet the training objective. The main research interests of the Washington University Department of Psychiatry are very broad: Genetic Epidemiology, Molecular Genetics, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Nosology, Physiology, Neuroimaging and Molecular Neurobiology. The department seminar series includes Grand Rounds, Departmental Research Seminars, and three special series, one devoted to Epidemiology & Biostatistics, one devoted to Genetic Epidemiology and one to Neurobiology. The Medical Center as a whole offers more than 35 hours of relevant seminars per week dealing with the subject matter of this grant. Many of these are relevant to the mission of this program and can be attended by postdoctoral trainees."
"9237170","The Administrative Core (AC) serves as the central coordinating center that manages and integrates the multiple program activities carried out at the ADCS and co-located facilities, and is necessary to maintain smooth operation of this complex grant program. Because the AC activities integrate with the activities of each of the other ADCS cores and committees it results in a multi-faceted approach that lends itself to communication and information sharing among all cores. The primary objective of the AC is to provide overall direction and oversight to the ADCS by working closely with its various cores and committees to accomplish program goals.    The ADCS is a large, complex organization, with over 100 members at UCSD, 8 cores, 35 primary performance sites, dozens of additional sites, multiple ongoing trials, collaborations with multiple companies, and contracts with many vendors. It is primarily an academic organization, but performs all of the activities required by multicenter trials, with an in-house data management system, biostatistics, clinical operations, regulatory oversight, medical and safety management, and onsite and remote clinical monitoring. Smooth operation requires, in addition to experience and expertise, efficient and effective management, standard operating procedures and quality assurance programs, and effective communications. The standing committees, which exist throughout the grant period, contribute to all grant activities. The Committees budgeted within the Administrative Core are the Internal Ethics Committee, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Committee, and the Instrument Committee with its five subcommittees."
"9441916","The services provided in Core C will enable this Program Project to incorporate highly needed histopathology services and innovative and powerful imaging technology into the program in a cost-effective manner.

Ongoing innovations by Core C will make these technologies powerful biological tools for the use in cancer research. Importantly, Core C also provides pathological support for the Program through a subcontract with a world-class pathologist. During the upcoming period of requested support, the core proposes to support Program investigators through four general aims. First, the program will provide assistance with histology, immune labeling and pathology. Second, the Core will support super-resolution imaging and live cell imaging using one of only about twenty OMX microscopes that exists worldwide. Third, the core will assist with imaging at the tissue level, either using 3D tissue reconstruction or live imaging in animals. These technologies each require custom built microscopes that are not generally available. Fourth, to provide Program investigators with tools to track tumor growth and metastasis, the Core will assist with whole animal imaging approaches, including bioluminescence, fluorescent proteins and small animal ultrasound. Together, the Core have an unprecedented imaging platform, covering super-resolution imaging, 3D tissue reconstruction, live cell tracking in tissues and whole animal imaging. A core that enables program investigators access to these technologies is essential as most of the imaging technologies supported by the Core are highly sophisticated and require very specialized training. Furthermore, access to the instruments required for these imaging technologies would be cost-prohibitive without the support of a core."

"9276680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UC Berkeley's Department of Bioengineering (BioE) is educating the next cadre of biomedical leaders and innovators. Our program consists of a Clinical Immersion (summer internship), Engineering Immersion (Fall Semester Capstone), and Translational Immersion (Spring Semester) periods. The renewal R25 builds on established partnerships with >20 departments at UCSF Medical Centers, Stanford Medical, and the UC Davis Medical Centers in addition to the newly established UCSF Rosenman Institute and the new UC Berkeley Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation. Unique aspects include: first, unmet needs formulated from 8-week in-clinic needs finding during the Clinical Immersion by BioE Fellows (Capstone alumni) and Protégés (rising Capstone seniors). Second, direct teaming of BioE undergraduates with clinical clients during the Engineering Immersion. Third, we partner the aforementioned two new institutes, one focused on engineering design (Jacobs) and one focused on biomedical device translation (Rosenman) . Fourth, we will enhance all three Immersion periods by integrating two factors (self-efficacy and community support) that are correlated with subsequent pursuit of STEM careers; the latter factor being acutely relevant to URM career decisions. We will retain the Clinical-Engineering-Translational Immersion framework and pursue two new Aims: (1) Inculcate engineering design approaches with an emphasis on self-efficacy (Engineering Immersion) and (2) Expand community engagement and support (Engineering & Translational Immersion). In Aim 1, we will transform our Capstone course into a fully studio-based course housed in the new Jacobs Hall. Lecture content will be recorded and viewed a priori. Studios will be hands-on workshops, case study discussion, and in-depth Design Reviews. Real-time self-assessment will be developed and integrated into each studio so that students receive tangible (irrefutable) evidence of mastery to enhance self-efficacy. In Aim 2, we will enhance both the Engineering and Translational Immersion periods. We will add Engineering Advisors to each Capstone project, but not supplant the Clinical Client. Engineering Advisors are accomplished senior engineers and fellows of the UCSF Rosenman Institute. In addition to technical feedback, Advisors will provide societal capital needed for our students (and URM students in particular) to join established formal and informal entrepreneurial networks. Also supporting Aim 2, we will provide financial support not just for project resources but also for student presentation of project outcomes at state and national meetings, as is crit ical for establishing self-efficacy and engaging with a supportive technical community (again, an acute factor in URM selection of BioE as a career path). The Immersion program combines didactic and experiential training to provide a comprehensive introduction to translational medicine innovation -- with the aim of supplementing theoretical knowledge with hands-on engineering for clinical and biomedical environments. 1"

"9274051","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant proposal Building Enteric Infectious Disease Research Capacity in India describes a training program in public health and infectious diseases, which includes interdisciplinary, translational training in in enteric infectious disease and the response to oral vaccines in developing countries. Enteric infectious diseases are the second major cause of post-neonatal mortality in under-5 children in developing countries, and cause both direct morbidity and sequelae in the form of growth faltering and possibly delayed cognitive development. The poor performance of oral vaccines in low-resource settings makes intervention challenging and a goal of this program is to focus training on inter-disciplinary studies on immunology and the role of gut microbiome in influencing the response to infection and immunization in India. Over the last nine years, a collaborative partnership between investigators at Tufts Medical Center/Tufts University School of Medicine (Tufts) and the Christian Medical College, Vellore (CMC) has established training with an initial focus on epidemiology, risk assessment and surveillance of enteric infections. Building on our knowledge, experience, and collaborative relationships, in this renewal application we will put greater emphasis on interventional clinical research, the enhancement of quantitative skills and in bio-informatics particularly related to the analysis and interpretation of metagenomic studies to develop a more translational approach during the next five years. We will expand the pool of potential trainees to all parts of India and the mentors to include faculty from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), Houston. The goals of extending training in a variety of disciplines necessary to investigate gastrointestinal infections and immune response to oral vaccines with special emphasis on clinical research, vaccinology and bioinformatics, facilitating the transition of trainees to independent research and of working with the Indian government for prioritization of research and training and aid translation of research results into public health practice will be met by a tiered training program with three levels of trainees who will be trained in India and in the US, and who will carry out research projects in India. In each of 5 years, one long term and one intermediate term trainee will be supported with a basic training package, mentored research project development and conduct and continuing professional development. Long-term and intermediate term trainees will be either at the pre-doctoral or the post-doctoral level, with a focus on post-doctoral candidates as far as possible. In each year, one short-term (faculty level) trainee will be selected to attend either targeted training or a short course identified as being relevant to the research training goals of the program. Of a total of 15 trainees, we expect at least 2-3 doctoral degrees and at least 4 competitive research grants to be obtained by the trainees as post-doctoral trainees or faculty. Based on prior results, we expect an average of at least 10 publications annually to which trainees will contribute. Each long term trainee will be expected to have at least 2 first authored publications, and each intermediate term trainee will be expected to have one paper. In addition, the program faculty with work with the Department of Biotechnology's Clinical Service Development Agency to develop a credit based program-the Indian Clinical Researcher Development (InCReD) program which is intended as a new paradigm for providing research skills to 15-20 junior faculty annually at medical schools in India through a combination of distance learning and contact courses. The multi-disciplinary and complementary training, networking and career development support are expected to result in a sustainable research program with significantly increased skills and capacity for infectious disease research in India."

"9453961","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prescription opioids are the second most commonly abused substances in the U.S. (after marijuana), and overdose deaths related to prescription opioids now exceed deaths from motor vehicle crashes. Prescription opioid abuse appears to be even more common among HIV-infected patients, presumably a consequence of the known co-morbidity between HIV and substance use. Studies suggest that one-fifth of all HIV-infected patients are prescribed chronic opioid therapy (COT) for pain and that HIV-infected patients are more likely to be prescribed opioids for pain than HIV-uninfected patients. Given the high prevalence of pain (~50%) among HIV-infected patients, pain management is by necessity a major responsibility of physicians treating patients with HIV. However, most physicians and advanced practice providers providing primary care for HIV-infected patients (henceforth referred to as HIV physicians) have little training in the management of chronic pain. Therefore, HIV physicians frequently do not follow existing guidelines for prescribing opioids and report low satisfaction and limited confidence with this important and at times vexing aspect of clinical care. The proposed Targeting Effective Analgesia in Clinics for HIV (TEACH) Study will test the effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention directed toward HIV physicians to improve the management of COT and reduce the misuse of prescription opioids among HIV-infected persons. The intervention is composed of the following elements: 1) collaboration with a nurse care manager (NCM); 2) physician education and academic detailing; and 3) facilitated access to a specialist in addictions to help manage the most challenging HIV-infected patients on COT. The NCM will utilize an electronic registry to assist physicians in implementing guideline-driven care including opioid treatment agreements, urine drug testing (UDT), random pill counts and checking of online Prescription Monitoring Programs (PMPs). Physicians in the control group will receive information summarizing guidelines for COT but will not have access to the support of the TEACH intervention. This 3-site study will use a cluster randomized trial design, randomized at the level of the physician, and compare primary outcomes over one year. The Specific Aims are to test the effectiveness of the TEACH collaborative care program to achieve the following: Aim 1 - Improve HIV physicians' adherence to guidelines for COT compared to standard practice; Aim 2 - Increase HIV physicians' satisfaction and confidence in prescribing COT; Aim 3 - Reduce aberrant use of prescription opioids among HIV-infected patients who are on COT; and Aim 4 - Improve virologic control among HIV-infected patients who are on COT. If effective, implementation of the intervention in HIV clinics will enable physicians in clinical teas to deliver chronic opioid therapy according to established guidelines with more confidence, potentially resulting in less prescription drug abuse and improved HIV outcomes."
"9311435","Project Summary / Abstract An estimated 3.5 million American children and adolescents are prescribed prescription stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A large body of animal research demonstrates that stimulants induce long-term changes in dopamine systems in the brain that parallel changes observed in individuals with psychosis. Although it is known that stimulants can precipitate acute episodes of psychosis, there is a lack of research on whether stimulants increase long-term risk of developing a psychotic disorder or whether stimulants are associated with an earlier onset of psychosis. To address these gaps, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous training by Harvard faculty with an innovative research agenda that uses two complementary approaches to study the risk of psychosis with prescription stimulant use: 1) A large-scale longitudinal study using electronic medical records for a New England healthcare system to compare the risk of developing a psychotic disorder in children/adolescents with ADHD based on exposure to prescription stimulants, and 2) a patient-oriented clinical research study in individuals with first-episode psychosis to determine if prescription stimulant use prior to illness onset is associated with an earlier onset of psychosis. The PI is a psychiatrist with clinical expertise in psychotic disorders with a background in neuroimaging research in schizophrenia. Training objectives for this grant are for the PI to: 1) Develop expertise in epidemiology and use of electronic medical records to perform large-scale studies of putative risk factors for psychosis; 1) Develop expertise in research in child and adolescent psychiatry and first-episode psychosis; and 2) Develop advanced skills in complex statistics such as propensity score matching, survival analysis and predictive modeling. These goals will be accomplished by formal coursework and mentorship by an exceptionally-qualified team of scientists who are internationally-recognized leaders in research directly relevant to the current proposal. The proposed research project aligns with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Strategic Objective 2 on charting mental illness trajectories to allow early intervention. By charting the trajectory from childhood/adolescence to onset of psychosis, this research may potentially identify a modifiable risk factor that could alter the likelihood of progression to psychosis. The successful completion of this career development plan will assist the PI in making the transition to an independent investigator with the long-term goal of identifying risk factors for psychosis to target those individuals most at risk and allow early intervention. In addition, this award will provide the PI with the training and tools necessary for future studies involving the analysis of large-scale multi-element electronic medical record data sets in alignment with objectives of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program."
"9286730","Project Summary DESCRIPTION. The immune system must eliminate cells of the body that have become diseased as the result of intracellular infection or oncogenic transformation. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are responsible for completing this task and must be able to distinguish healthy cells from diseased ones. Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC class I) molecules are present on most nucleated cells and are responsible for presenting antigen at the cell surface for CD8+ T cell inspection. In order to present antigen, the MHC class I pathway relies on binding to short peptides, created from degraded cellular proteins. When the source protein is associated with a disease (such as a viral protein or tumor associated protein) specific CD8+ T cells will recognize the peptide- MHC class I complex and kill the cell. Because the peptide provides the ultimate specificity in this reaction, we are interested in understanding how these peptides are created. Our data indicates that proteins which are rapidly degraded following their synthesis (termed Defective Ribosomal Proteins or DRiPs) are responsible for efficiently generating a supply of peptides. This proposal seeks to determine which cellular metabolic pathways are used to direct the rapid degradation of DRiPs and to determine if DRiPs are necessary in physiologically relevant settings. We are focusing on the ubiquitin conjugation pathway, as ubiquitin coupling is intimately associated with protein degradation. Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) may also play a role in direct antigen presentation. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to identify how the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme Usp14 interacts with the antigen presentation machinery, understand why conjugation of the ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd8 is necessary for DRiP antigen presentation, and determine which E3 ubiquitin ligases are necessary for DRiP antigen presentation."
"9206459","This grant will continue to support our ongoing discovery antd functional characterization of molecular mechanisms of lymphocyte homing to the Gl tract. We propose the following specific Aims: Aim 1. GPR15 in intestinal immunobiology: role in intestinal immune responses and mechanisms and effects of species specific differences in expression. We showed expression of GPR15 by effector T cells (Teff) in colitis, and demonstrated that this novel colon homing receptor can play a pathogenic role. We also discovered major differences in GPR15 expression in humans vs mice that have the potential to underlie differences in inflammation, vaccination responses, and intestinal immunity. We propose that aberrant GPR15 expression in mice is due to absence of GATA3 consensus binding sites that regulate GPR15 in other species.  We will use CyTOF and flow cytometry to compare the expression and regulation of GPR15 on gut homing lymphocyte subsets in mouse vs man. We will use standard reporter assays, site directed mutagenesis and Chip-seq data to test the hypothesis that the species differences in Th vs Treg subset expression are controlled by loss of GATA3 binding to the mouse Gpr15 enhancer. Most importantly, we propose to analyze the effects of humanized Gpr15 expression patterns on small intestinal Teff vs Treg subsets, and on intestinal immune responses in vivo. Mice in which GPR15 is driven under native human sequence control (BAG transgenics; 5 founder lines have been generated already), or in which GATA3 TFBS are introduced or repaired in the mouse enhancer sequence by targeted mutagenesis or knockin strategies, will be studies under homeostatic and inflamed/immunized conditions. The effects of altered, 'human-like' GPR15 expression patterns on intestinal lymphocyte subset frequencies and immune responses will be assessed. Significance: The studies will directly test the hypothesized role of GATA3 TFBS mutations in human vs mouse differences in GPR15 expression and in intestinal immunobiology. If, as hypothesized, mice with a humanized Ggr15 enhancer display colon immunobiology that much more closely reflects that of humans, the studies will have fundamental implications for our understanding of colitis and for drug discovery for IBD. Aim 2: To define the role and significance of CD22 as a novel intestinal lymphocyte homing receptor  Our experiments show that CD22 functions as a B cell homing receptor for HEV in Peyer's patches. Short term homing assays will be used to confirm this, and to assess critically a hypothesized role of CD22 in homing of follicular T helper cell subsets to GALT as well. We will also assess the role of CD22 in lymphocyte recruitment to the lamina propria and colon patches. Finally, we observe significant residual Sfga/6-dependent homing of CD22-deficient lymphocytes to PP: we hypothesize that this may be mediated by the closely related B cell lectin, SiglecG, which binds similar carbohydrates. We propose to use readily available SiglecG and if indicated, CD22/SiglecG double KO mice to test this hypothesis. Significance: This Aim will elucidate specific B cell homing mechanisms for GALT, mechanisms that contribute to the specialization of mucosal immune responses. Moreover, CD22 is an emerging target for autoimmune diseases: Understanding its role in lymphocyte recruitment to the Gl tract will provide important insight into intestinal immune responses, and could prove critical to avoid infectious side effects in settings of CD22 targeted immunotherapy. Aim 3: GPR43 in intestinal immunity and immune homeostasis: role in Th17 vs Treg homeostasis, and identification and function of novel protein ligands. Based on our preliminary studies, we propose to use GPR43 KO /WT mixed bone marrow chimeras to define the role of the receptor in microbiome- and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-dependent control of Th17 and other effector and regulatory T cells in the gut. In addition, we will elucidate GPR43 interactions with angiopoietin-2 (Ang2). In the DSS colitis model Ang2, like GPR43, reduces the severity of symptoms (colon shortening, diarrhea), although the effects are complex. We shall use standard biochemical assays to define the specificity/avidity of Ang2-GPR43 binding, and in vitro adhesion assay to define the role of Ang2 in intestinal immune cell adhesion triggering and chemotaxis. Since GPR43 regulates apoptosis, we will also elucidate the effects of Ang2-GPR43 interaction on immune cell survival and responses to pro-inflammatory signals. Significance: GPR43 moderates inflammation in the Gl tract, dampening colitis. Its known ligands are short chain fatty acids (SOFA) from intestinal microflora. Identification of Ang2 as a protein ligand and for GPR43 suggests the potential for additional pathways to GPR43-dependent control of intestinal immune responses. Since Ang2 regulates angiogenesis and vascular stability, its induction during gut wall repair may act through GPR43 to suppress inflammation in the absence of dangerous pathogen invasion. Additional Plans: We will test the hypothesized roles of additional candidate trafficking mechanisms identified in our microarrays. Anti-CD63 and Bsti MAbs will be injected iv to assess effects on lymphocyte homing to GALT and gut wall. To test the hypothesis that GPR183 mediates lymphocyte diapedesis in response to a trans-HEV gradient of its oxysterol ligands, we will compare the in vivo transendothelial migration and homing ability of normal B and T cells to those of lymphocytes in which GPR183 is deficient or desensitized. Significance: These studies have the potential to define additional mechanisms and therapeutic targets for regulation of intestinal lymphocyte trafficking."
"9323141","PROJECT SUMMARY An explosion in knowledge related to HIV vaccine research has led to the concept of B cell lineage immunogen design as an HIV vaccine strategy. In this strategy, broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) B cell lineages are determined in HIV-infected individuals, and then sequential immunizations are designed to recapitulate, with a multi-component vaccine, the immunologic events that transpire during bnAb development in infection. However, a major bottleneck in developing this strategy and advancing it to clinical trials is a bottleneck in production of clinical trial materials to test these vaccines. In particular, greater capacity is needed to produce clinical trial materials under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) in an environment that also has HIV vaccine expertise. To begin addressing this bottleneck, earlier this year the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI) ? a leader in HIV vaccine development efforts ? and the Duke University School of Medicine opened a 1,600 net. sq. ft. CGMP manufacturing facility which can produce at most two HIV vaccine-related proteins for clinical trial use per year. Because recent studies in animals suggest that an effective HIV vaccine may require as many as 10 different proteins and may benefit from inclusion of specific RNA and/or DNA, additional capacity for protein production and new capabilities for RNA and DNA production are needed. Thus we propose to upgrade existing functional space to create an additional 2,500 net sq.ft CGMP facility at Duke. This new facility will expand our protein production capacity, enable manufacturing of CGMP-grade RNA and/or DNA, and do so in an efficient and expert manner. The overall objective of this grant is to design and build a CGMP facility at Duke to enhance our capacity to produce clinical trials materials, have the capacity to produce recombinant proteins, mRNA or DNA immunogens, and capitalize on the unique expertise of the DHVI team in HIV vaccine immunogen design and CGMP production. Because of our team's involvement with international HIV vaccine research and development efforts, this facility will be connected to clinical trial needs and will help accelerate the effort to develop, test, and make available an effective HIV vaccine."
"9245838","PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. While the implementation of lung cancer screening for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes has brought significant hope to this disease, very limited options exist for the early detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) SCLC carries a 5-year survival rate of only 7% and despite the development of novel targeted therapies and early detection for NSCLC, no such advances have been achieved in SCLC. A gap in our current approach to lung cancer detection and treatment has been that informative and reliable biomarkers for the detection and surveillance of lung cancer have remained elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as viable biomarkers in body fluids thus, providing an excellent means to achieve non-invasive assays for early cancer detection. Furthermore, miRNA expression in circulation appears to be compartment specific. While the majority of miRNAs are intracellular, a significant number of miRNAs have been observed outside of cells, including in various bodily fluids. The origin, applications and potential functionality of RNAs in circulation are the sources of intriguing questions. Obtaining a detailed RNA spectrum in plasma would shed some light on this matter. We have taken a multidisciplinary approach to the investigation of circulating RNA transcripts that integrates expertise in miRNA biology, nanoengineering, lung cancer and bioinformatics. We have developed a simple tethered Cationic Lipoplex Nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons (MBs) in the lipoplex nanoparticles as probes to capture and detect targeted miRNAs and mRNAs in human plasma without any need of pre- or post-sample treatment. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to assess both exosomal miRNAs and mRNAs using both Next Generation Sequencing and our tCLN biochip in cohorts of control smokers and patients with early stage NSCLC. Our primary objectives are to extend these novel findings by (1) Test and validate the utility of measurement of ASCL1 and DLL3 in the early detection of SCLC in a retrospective and prospective study with network samples (2) Develop A Panel of Comprehensive EV RNA Candidates using nest generation sequencing and q-RT-PCR (3) Develop an optimized EV nanochip based RNA Classifier for early SCLC detection and (4) Validate the optimized EV RNA Classifier by using the multiplex TLN array biochips in independent, blinded case control studies at the OSU James Cancer Hospital and from the SCLC consortium."

"9261576","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings."
"9225218","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Older adult drivers with glaucoma are at a high risk for being at-fault in motor vehicle collisions, causing injury or death to themselves or others.  However, the types of driving errors that place these individuals at risk and the relationship between their driving errors and their clinical profiles remain unclear.  To address this need, we will study 125 drivers with varying severity of glaucoma and 55 control (non-glaucoma) drivers using an on-road driving test to assess driving behaviors in an objective, standardized, individualized, and real-life manner.  Driving behavior will be measured by an in-car driving evaluator and a 2-camera telemetry system with modern sensors.  A comprehensive clinical assessment of vision (e.g peripheral visual field loss) and non-vision (e.g cognition and mobility) factors associated with driving safety will be obtained to help characterize the relationship between these factors and driving errors.  The Specific Aims are to:  1) Identify the type and frequency of at-risk driving errors in glaucoma patients; 2) Determine vision and non-vision factors associated with at-risk driving errors in glaucoma patients; and 3) Identify effective compensatory strategies used by safe glaucoma drivers.  A multidisciplinary team of experts (in glaucoma, gerontology, driving and low vision rehabilitation, instrumentation, epidemiology, and statistics) will provide integration of the multifactorial nature of safe and unsafe driving behavir in glaucoma patients.  Multivariate methods will be used to develop a parsimonious model of vision and non-vision factors associated with driving errors.  The expected outcome from this innovative project is to have identified 1.  vision factors associated with at-risk driving errors n glaucoma patients that are amenable to interventions and 2.  effective compensatory strategies currently used by safe glaucoma drivers.  These two pieces of critical information will provide a foundation for defining interventions and designing studies to improve safety for glaucoma drivers.  The long-term goal of our research is to develop and implement evidence-based vision rehabilitation programs to facilitate and prolong safe driving in older adults with glaucoma.  Overall, these outcomes are anticipated to have an important public health benefit by reducing the risk of driving with glaucoma which will minimize morbidity and mortality and promote a sense of independence and overall well-being in older adults with glaucoma"
"9232158","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms that control cell size are largely unknown and represent a fundamental unsolved problem in biology. The size of proliferating cells is controlled by cell size checkpoints, which ensure that key cell cycle transitions are initiated only when sufficient growth has occurred. Despite their name, it is uncertain whether cell size checkpoints monitor a parameter linked to cell size, such as volume or surface area, or whether they monitor parameters linked to growth or biosynthetic capacity. The signals that link the cell cycle to cell size have remained deeply mysterious.  We discovered that protein phosphatase 2A associated with the Rts1 subunit (PP2ARts1) is required for cell size control in budding yeast. Importantly, cells that lack PP2ARts1 fail to modulate their size in response to nutrients, which suggests that PP2ARts1 functions in the enigmatic mechanisms that set cell size. We used quantitative proteome-wide mass spectrometry to discover targets of PP2ARts1, which revealed that PP2ARts1 is a master regulator of multiple cell size checkpoint pathways. This important discovery suggests that multiple seemingly independent cell size checkpoints may be linked to a common mechanism that measures cell growth. We further found that PP2ARts1 itself is controlled by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which plays conserved roles in control of cell growth and size. Together, our recent discoveries have led us to hypothesize that common signals, working through PDK1 and PP2ARts1, coordinately control cell growth and size. We further hypothesize that PP2ARts1 works in a mechanism that translates growth into a proportional checkpoint signal that can be read to determine when sufficient growth has occurred. The proposed Aims use a combination of genetics, biochemistry, proteomics and imaging to test these hypotheses, while also laying the groundwork for new breakthroughs in cell size control."
"9193089","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA-directed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is one of the most important proteins in the cell. Pol II is responsible for transcribing the vast majority of genes to generate messenger RNA that will be translated in the ribosomes to produce all cellular proteins. The initiation stage of transcription requires timely interactions between Pol I and the general transcription factors or GTFs including, TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIE. The process of initiation is highly dynamic; biochemical experiments hint at possible discrete stages where the GTFs recognize, melt and load a nucleic acid scaffold. Initial promoter melting is triggered by TFIIH helicases that generate a 7-9 bases transcription bubble (TB); the bubble is further unwound to approximately 18-25 bases and descends to Pol II's active site where a short DNA-RNA hybrid (transcript) is synthesized; transcripts of 10 or more nucleotides result in promoter escape and stabilization of a mature TB that ultimately leads to dislodging of the GTFs leaving a poised Pol II for entry into productive elongation. This process is universal, for all eukaryotic species, and is at the core of gene regulation; understanding its molecular details will provide essential clues that could potentially lead to pharmacological manipulation of gene expression. The intention of this proposal is to use biochemical and X-ray crystallography techniques to understand the molecular details of promoter binding to Pol II and the role that TFIIB and TFIIF play in TB loading and stabilization."
"9390239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This UCSF postdoctoral training program, entering its 20th year, develops drug abuse treatment and services researchers. The training focuses on four areas: 1) clinical trials of behavioral, psychosocial, and pharmacological interventions, including pilot work that leads to clinical trials; 2) studies of processes that contribute to outcome; 3) efficacy and effectiveness of interventions in real-world settings, and 4) intervention dissemination and diffusion. Trainees are admitted for two years with possibility of a third year. The exceptional trainee may enter for a one-year training program. In the past 19 years the program has successfully trained over 50 doctoral level psychologists, psychiatrists, public health, and policy scientists for academic and research careers. The program's young, trans-disciplinary researchers have embarked on fruitful careers to improve drug abuse treatment through scientific study. In the most recent funding cycle the program had a new director and focused on integration of substance abuse with medical care research in AIDS and other diseases, continuing care for complex patient populations, development of digital-Health intervention platforms, and understanding how health disparities can be ameliorated. During the next five years we appoint a new associate director, focus on linking with nursing in addition to mental health disciplines, conduct rigorous program evaluation, further our emphasis on technology, focus on study of health care reform, and build on our emphasis on HIV care and prevention. The program exists in an environment with relevant resources, including linkages with multiple and diverse clinical sites and a variety of academic centers and activities that supplement the training experience. A six-member Executive Committee of Co-Principal Investigators directs the program, with guidance two groups, a Physician Advisory Committee and a Scientific and Training Advisory Committee. The transdisciplinary core faculty members have backgrounds including psychology, psychiatry, biostatistics, nursing, public health, and epidemiology. Core faculty have strong histories of mentorship, extensive experience in obtaining extramural funding, and ongoing research productivity in drug abuse (including nicotine) treatment and services research. New faculty members have joined the program, bringing important lines of inquiry, research settings, and methods. The result is a resonant environment that allows trainees to draw on multiple perspectives in designing and completing treatment and services research. The expectation is that program graduates will conduct independent methodologically rigorous drug abuse treatment and services research and contribute to the knowledge base in the field. Recent changes in policy and public perception of drug abuse increase the need for outstanding researchers in treatment and services research."
"9459124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drs. Cottler and Latimer propose a resubmission for a new NIDA T32 at the University of Florida (UF) combining over 40 years of mentoring leadership with an array of innovative new partnerships at UF. Both NIDA Training Directors at their former institutions (Washington University and Johns Hopkins University), the PIs are teaming up to offer graduate and post-graduate addiction training in their respective departments, Epidemiology (Cottler) and Clinical and Health Psychology (Latimer) both in the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions. The justification for a new NIDA training program for 4 Pre Docs and 2 Post Docs each year is: a) increased health disparities related to the harmful consequences of drug use; b) a significant shortage of scientists in the drug abuse field; c) our strong academic and research environment at UF which is ripe for producing public health oriented scientists and clinicians; d) the underrepresentation of NIDA and other NIH T32 training programs in the Southeast region of the US; e) a strong and enthusiastic group of mentors who have an excellent track record to train nationally and internationally prominent substance abuse researchers; and f) the commitment of the State and UF's President to be a top ten public university, which brings additional resources for research. The core innovative aspect of this new public health oriented T32 is the focus on the epidemiology and prevention of substance use and its consequences and co-morbidities, with a focus on social determinants of health and health inequalities, and the development of behavioral interventions to reduce substance use and its harmful consequences. The training program is crafted with a clear application to practice and public health both domestically and internationally, given the PIs' and mentors' focus. While UF is an excellent training environment, there are few NIH T32s. Thus, the proposed T32 will: i. train talented individuals to independently work from the individual leve (behavioral interventions) to the population level (exposure and consequences of addiction) to eliminate health inequalities related to substance use and its consequences; ii. provide trainees with an apprenticeship style education to master skills to critically evaluate data, conduct multiple aspects of addiction research and become successful, and independent investigators who contribute to the field; iii. train individuals to understand, apply and maintain the highest ethical standards in their science and scholarship and be socially responsible investigators."
"9429445","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) is one of the most promising candidates for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy: is inherently neurotropic and can replicate in neoplastic cells and mediate robust oncolytic effects while sparing normal cells. Although phase I and Ib oHSV clinical trials conducted to date for GBM have shown signs of anti- tumor activity, clinical response rates have been sub-optimal, primarily due to tumor heterogeneity and oHSV delivery issues in the tumor resection cavity post-surgery. Based on our recent finding that oHSV susceptibility varies among tumor lines, we have engineered an armed oHSV mutant encoding S-TRAIL (secretable tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) (oHSV-TRAIL) and shown killing of oHSV resistant GBM lines in a mechanism based manner. In our recently published studies, we have shown that human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) loaded oHSV have a significantly better therapeutic efficacy than the purified oHSV in a mouse GBM model. These results although promising, have raised fundamental questions on how to specifically target heterogeneous and invading GBM tumor residues after resection of primary GBM as well as recurrent GBMs that have undergone the current standard of care? In the proposed studies, we will utilize patient derived primary GBM stem cells (GSC: invasive and nodular), pharmacological inhibitors and genetic gain/loss of function constructs to elucidate the molecular mechanism of MSC loaded oHSV-TRAIL mediated GBM killing. We hypothesize that MSC-oHSV-TRAIL will specifically kill a broad spectrum of GSC by targeting both cell proliferation and death pathways. The delivery, spread and therapeutic efficacy of MSC loaded oHSV-TRAIL will be tested in nodular and highly invasive mouse tumor models of resection generated from primary GSC. Based on our recent findings that synthetic extracellular matrix (sECM) encapsulation of stem cells is necessary to prevent rapid wash- out of stem cells post- transplantation in the tumor resection cavity, we will encapsulate MSC loaded oHSV-TRAIL into sECM and evaluate their fate and efficacy in tumor resection cavity generated from primary GSC lines. We hypothesize that sECM-MSC-oHSV-TRAIL will effectively target residual tumor cells in the resection cavity and also track and kill invasive tumor cells. Finally, the responses of recurrent GSC, obtained from GBM patients that are resistant to standard therapies, to MSC-oHSV-TRAIL will be assessed in vitro and the status of proteins involved in survival and apoptosis pathways will be analyzed. Intracerebral mouse models of invasive and nodular recurrent GBM will be generated and the efficacy of intracarotid artery (ICA) delivered MSC-oHSV-TRAIL will be tested. We hypothesize that MSC loading will protect virus from neutralization and MSC will efficiently extravasate and home to the tumor sites resulting in specific killing of recurrent GSC. Fluorescent and bioluminescent imaging (BLI) markers will be genetically incorporated into oHSV and GSC to follow fate of oHSV, GBM cell invasion and oHSV efficacy by real time in vivo imaging. The proposed studies are likely to unravel the mechanism-based, targeted stem cell mediated therapies for malignant GBMs which can be readily translated into clinics."
"9225194","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Stress and Abdominal Pain: Novel Mechanisms Chronic stress activates the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and is a known inducer of abdominal pain. Recent reports indicate that chronic psychological stress causes changes in epigenetic  regulation of gene function in CNS regions associated with memory and mood. Epigenetics refers to stable and/or heritable changes in gene function without changes in the DNA sequence via DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodeling. The field of epigenetics has emerged  rapidly in the past decade based on seminal studies demonstrating genome-wide distribution of  methylation and acetylation sites in primary cells and human cell lines. It is unknown whether chronic stress regulates peripheral pain pathways via epigenetic mechanisms. The endovanilloid transient receptor potential (TRP) pathway plays a pivotal role in pain transmission and the TRPV1 receptor is known to be regulated by endocannabinoids (CB) acting on CB1 receptors which inhibit TRPV1 function. Chronic stress down-regulates the function of the CB pathway resulting in up-regulation of TRPV1 receptor function and abdominal pain. We will examine the hypothesis that chronic stress induces visceral pain via epigenetic regulation of CB1 and TRPV1 receptors in a region- and cel- specific manner in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating pelvic organs but not the somatosensory distribution to the lower extremities. Specifically, our preliminary data support two  highly novel hypotheses: 1. Chronic intermittent stress promotes DNMT1-mediated methylation of  glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promoter sites resulting in decreased GR expression that is linked to  reduced levels and function of the anti-nociceptive endocannabinoid CB1 receptor, and enhances  histone acetylation linked to increased expression and function of the pro-nociceptive endovanilloid  TRPV1 receptor in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons; and 2. Chronic stress-induced, corticosterone  (CORT)-mediated epigenetic changes are region- and cell-specific, and hardwired to nociceptive  DRGs innervating the GI tract (colon) vs. somatosensory (sciatic nerve) distribution. The hardwired expression pattern predisposes nociceptive neurons innervating the GI tract to hyperalgesia in response to colorectal distension in the setting of chronic intermittent stress. These studies will include the application of cuttin-edge methods to identify putative regulatory CpG methylation sites at the promoters of stress response genes and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of relevant histone modification targets. The subpopulation of nociceptive neurons will be identified using both immunohistochemical markers with retrograde labeling and laser capture microscopy to harvest distinct populations of DRG neurons in conjunction with quantitative single-cell PCR of relevant targets. Confirmation of the role of specific receptors and signal transduction pathways to the changes observed in CB and TRP pathways will be confirmed using targeted delivery of gene silencing (si-RNA) reagents in situ and correlation of these interventions with behavior, e.g. visceral motor response to colorectal distension. We will also examine whether the formation of CB1-TRPV1 receptor complexes plays a role in stress-associated visceral hyperalgesia in DRG neurons and transfected cells using FRET/TIRF microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation of chronic stress-induced visceral pain will have a significant impact on our understanding of how pain pathways are regulated and, likely, the management of functional pain disorders affecting the GI tract."
"9229592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will study the biological properties of the medial entorhinal cortical-hippocampal network that enable it to perform spatial processing functions. This research will focus on biological mechanisms of grid cell formation and theta phase precession. Grid cells are spatially sensitive cells in medial entorhinal cortex that fire whenever an animal is positioned in the firing fields of the cell, in a hexagonal array of position in the environment. Interactions between grid cells in entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus are thought to be important in overall spatial functions, such as coding the position of the animal and planning future paths. Theta phase precession is a phenomenon that occurs in place cells (spatially sensitive cells that fire whenever an animal is in a certain locaton of an environment). Place cells shift their phase of firing relative to network theta rhythm oscillations in a manner suggesting that populations of cells organize their activity to allow for compressed neural activity representing a trajectory. This representation could be useful for encoding of trajectories in memory and planning of future trajectories. This research will use a large scale, biologically constrained model of the medial entorhinal cortical- hippocampal network to assess the ability of a biologically realistic network to support the various models of grid cell formation and theta phase precession that have been previously proposed. The knowledge gained from this work will allow a broader understanding of the mechanisms by which various neurological disorders such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease can adversely affect cognitive functions such as spatial processing and memory. Further, the computational model produced by this work will be freely shared and can be used to search for and quantify potential therapeutic targets for various disorders."
"9271968","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CRISPR/Cas9 system has enabled tremendous advances in genome editing in many organisms, versatile gene expression control, and imaging of genomic loci in living cells. This R21 bioengineering project aims to advance the applications of CRISPR/Cas9 by generating new Cas9 proteins that are orthogonal to each other and can therefore be used together but for different, controllable purposes. This would make many new applications possible that require efficient multiplexing of distinct functions, such as simultaneous control of many genes that need to be either activated or repressed, or multicolor imaging of different DNA loci in live cells. The current system consists of the Cas9 protein and a small guide RNA (sgRNA), which can be programmed to recognize any arbitrary DNA sequence that is complimentary to the sgRNA and contains a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognized by Cas9. To date, the Cas9 protein from S. pyogenes (SpCas9) has been used almost ubiquitously, due to its robustness and flexibility. The proposed new Cas9 tools are based on SpCas9 but have additional specificity elements (new PAM sequences) that can direct distinct functionalities (defined by different PAMs) to the target sequences (programmed as before by the sgRNA). Previous protein engineering has failed to generate new Cas9 tools with substantially altered PAM specificity, which likely requires the structure of the SpCas9 active site to be remodeled considerably. To overcome this bottleneck, we will utilize computational strategies borrowed from the field of robotics, which we have previously shown can model protein conformations with atomic accuracy. We will integrate these methods for the first time with design, to alter active site structures for new functions. In Aim 1, we will develop new computational design methods to accurately position key sidechains by remodeling the backbone of the surrounding functional site environment, test these methods on recapitulating functional site conformations in existing structures, and make forward predictions to design SpCas9 variants that recognize new PAMs. In Aim 2, we will test and optimize these SpCas9 variants and apply them to multicolor imaging of defined DNA loci in human cells. To achieve these goals, our proposal brings together two investigators who are experts in computational protein design (Kortemme) and fluorescence microscopy (Huang). Both the proposed design method and the design application are innovative, but supported by preliminary data showing labeling of genomic loci by an SpCas9 variant computationally designed to recognize an altered PAM. To further address risks, we plan to complement computation with experimental testing of sequence libraries and optimization of design candidates by directed evolution. The outcomes of this project would advance both (i) computational design to address more complex engineering goals than are possible now, and (ii) CRISPR/Cas9 applications by allowing simultaneous control of multiple functions, including systematic analysis of gene function in health and disease, and dynamic imaging of fundamental processes in living cells."
